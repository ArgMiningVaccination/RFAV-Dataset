This clinical practice guideline is not A replacement for clinical judgment or individualized, person -centered c are Intended to be applied as inflexible standards of care across patients, and/or patient populations by healthcare professionals, health systems, pharmacies, third -party payers, or governmental jurisdictions or to lead to the rapid tapering or discontinu ation of opioids for patients A law, regulation, and/or policy that dictates clinical practice or a substitute for FDA -approved labeling Applicable to the following types of pain treatment: o sickle cell disease -related pain; o cancer pain; o palliative care; or o end-of-life care 27 Summary 28 This clinical practice guideline updates and expands the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids 29 for Chronic Pain \u2014 United States, 2016 (Dowell, Haegerich, & Chou, 2016) and provid es evidence -based 30 recommendations for clinicians providing pain care, including those prescribing opioids, for outpatients 31 aged 18 years with acute pain (duration <1 month), subacute (duration of 1 -3 months) pain, or chronic 32 (duration of >3 months) pain, and excluding of sickle cell disease -related pain management, cancer pain 33 3 treatment, palliative care, and end -of-life care. Content on use of opioids for acute pain and on tapering 34 opioids for patients already receiving higher dosages for subacute or chron ic pain has been substantially 35 expanded. This update includes recommendations for primary care and other clinicians (including 36 physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and oral health practitioners) managing pain in 37 outpatient settings. Appli cable settings include clinician offices, clinics, and urgent care centers. The 38 recommendations do not apply to inpatient care received while hospitalized or to care received while in 39 an emergency department or other observational setting from which a pati ent might be admitted to 40 inpatient care but do apply to prescribing for pain management upon discharge (from emergency 41 departments, hospitals, or other facilities). 42 This clinical practice guideline addresses: 43 1) Determining whether or not to initiate opi oids for pain; 44 2) Opioid selection and dosage; 45 3) Opioid duration and follow -up; and 46 4) Assessing risk and addressing potential harms of opioid use. 47 CDC developed this clinical practice guideline using the Grading of Recommendations 48 Assessment, Developmen t, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework, and recommendations are made based 49 on a systematic review of the available scientific evidence while considering benefits and harms, 50 patients', caregivers', and clinicians' values and preferences, and resource allocatio n (e.g., costs to 51 patients or health systems, including clinician time). As described in more detail below, CDC obtained 52 input on this updated clinical practice guideline in a wide variety of avenues including conversations 53 with patients, caregivers, and clinicians , through Federal Register notices and comments from the public, 54 peer reviewers, and a federally chartered advisory committee. 55 4 The clinical evidence reviews found that nonopioid therapies are effective for many common 56 types of ac ute pain and found insufficient evidence to determine long -term (>1 year) benefits of opioid 57 therapy for chronic pain . Recommendations include that opioids should be used only when benefits for 58 pain and function are expected to outweigh risks. Before start ing opioids for subacute or chronic pain, 59 clinicians should discuss with patients the known risks and realistic benefits of opioid therapy, work with 60 patients to establish treatment goals for pain and function and consider how opioid therapy will be 61 discon tinued if benefits do not outweigh risks. When opioids are initiated, clinicians should prescribe the 62 lowest effective dosage of immediate -release opioids for no longer than needed for the expected 63 duration of pain severe enough to require opioids . During ongoing opioid therapy, c linicians should 64 collaborate with patients to evaluate and carefully weigh benefits and risks of continuing opioid therapy 65 and exercise care when increasing, continuing, or reducing opioid dosage. Before starting and 66 periodically d uring continuation of opioid therapy, clinicians should evaluate risk for opioid -related 67 harms and should work with patients to incorporate relevant strategies to mitigate risk, including 68 offering naloxone when factors that increase risk for opioid overdos e are present, and reviewing 69 potential interactions with any other prescribed medications or substances used. Clinicians should offer 70 or arrange treatment with medication for patients with opioid use disorder . 71 72 It is imperative that people with pain receiv e the most appropriate and effective pain treatment 73 with careful consideration of the benefits and risks of all treatment options. Clinicians should collaborate 74 with patients when making treatment decisions and designing a treatment plan, including when 75 initiating or changing pain management strategies and, particularly, when considering initiating, 76 increasing, tapering, or discontinuing opioids. Clinicians should avoid abrupt discontinuation of opioids, 77 especially for patients receiving high dosages of opi oids, should avoid dismissing patients from care, and 78 should ensure (provide or arrange) appropriate care for patients with pain and patients with 79 5 complications from opioid use (e.g., opioid use disorder) . Special attention should be given to ensure 80 high q uality and equitable care across sociodemographic groups, for example , through linguistically 81 tailored care and cost assistance programs to ensure access to appropriate pharmacotherapy, 82 psychological support, and physical therapy as needed. This voluntary clinical practice guideline provides 83 recommendations only and is inten ded to be flexible to support, not supplant, clinical judgment and 84 individualized, person -centered decision -making. This clinical practice guideline should not be applied as 85 inflexible standards of care across patient populations by healthcare professional s, health systems, 86 pharmacies, third -party payers, or state, local, and federal organizations or entities. 87 This clinical practice guideline is intended to improve communication between clinicians and 88 patients about the risks and benefits of pain treatment, including opioid therapy for pain, improve the 89 safety and effectiveness of pain treatment, mitigate pain, and improve function and quality of life for 90 patients with pain, and reduce risks associated with opioid therapy, including opioid use disorder, 91 overdose, and death. 92 Introduction 93 Background 94 Pain is one of the most common reasons adults seek medical care i n the United States 95 (Schappert & Burt, 2006) . Acute pain, a nearly universal experience, is a physiologic response to noxious 96 stimuli that can become pathologic, is normally sudden in onset, time limited (<1 month), and often 97 caused by injury, trauma, or medical treatments such as surgery (Institute of Medicine Committee on 98 Advancing Pain Research Care and Education, 2011; Tighe et al., 2015) . Chronic pain, defined in this 99 clinical practice guideline as pain that typically lasts greater than three months or past the time of 100 normal tissue healing, is often interlinked with acute pain (International Association for the Study of 101 Pain, 1986) . Chronic pain can be the result of an underlying medical disease or condition, injury, medical 102 6 treatment, inflammation, or an unknown cause (Institute of Medicine Committee on Advancing Pain 103 Research Care and Education, 2011) . It is estimated that approximately 1 in 5 U.S . adults had chronic 104 pain in 2019, and approximately 1 in 14 adults experienced \"high -impact\" chronic pain, defined as 105 having pain most days or every day in the past three months that limited life or work activities (Zelaya, 106 Dahlhamer, Lucas, & Connor, 2020) . Pain, especially chronic pain, can impa ct almost every aspect of an 107 individual's life, leading to impaired physical functioning, poor mental health, and reduced quality of life, 108 and contributes to substantial morbidity each year (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 109 2019b) . In 2011, the economic costs of chronic pain were estimated to range from $560 to $635 billion 110 in annual direct medical costs, lost productivity, and disability (Institute of Medicine Committee on 111 Advancing Pain Research Care and Education, 2011) . 112 Pain is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by multiple factors, includ ing biological, 113 psychological, and social factors (Chou et al., April 2020) . Given this complexity, there is substantial 114 heterogeneity in the effectiveness of various pain treatments depending on the type of underlying pain 115 or condition being treated (Chou et al., April 2020; Chou et al., December 2020; Halker Singh et al., 116 December 2020; McDonagh et al., April 2020; Skelly et al., April 2020) . Patients may experience 117 persistent pain that is not well controlled (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2019b) . In 118 addition, chronic pain often co -occurs with behavioral health conditions , including mental and substance 119 use disorders (Hooten, 2016; Morasco et al., 2011) ; suicidal ideation also is common among patients 120 with chronic pain (Racine, 2018; M. T. Smith, Edwards, Robinson, & Dworkin, 2004) . Data from death 121 investigations in 18 states between 2003 and 2014 indicate that at least 9% of suicide decedents had 122 evidence of having chronic pain at the time of their death, although this is likely an underestimate given 123 limitations of the underlying data sources used in the study (Petrosky et al., 2018) . These factors and 124 potentially deleterious outcomes associated with chronic pain for some individuals add to the clinical 125 complexity and underscore the importance of adequately treating and caring for people with pain. Thus, 126 7 prevention, assessment, and treatment of pain is a persistent challenge for clinicians. Pain may go 127 unrecognized, and some individuals \u2014 in particular members of some marginalize d racial and ethnic 128 groups, women, older persons, people with cognitive impairment, individuals with mental and 129 substance use disorders, and individuals with cancer and at the end -of-life or those with sickle cell 130 disease \u2014 can be at risk for inadequate pa in treatment (Bazargan, Yazdans henas, Gordon, & Orum, 131 2016; Becker 2017; C Evans, Bazargan, Cobb, & Assari, 2019; Institute of Medicine Committee on 132 Advancing Pain Research Care and Education, 2011; Rupp & Delaney, 2004; Simon, Snow, & Wakeman, 133 2020; U.S. Department of Health an d Human Services, 2019b; Yazdanshenas et al., 2016) . 134 While ther e is significant opportunity for improvement in pain management broadly across the 135 United States, data underline particular opportunities for attending to specific, long -standing health 136 disparities (Joynt et al., 2013; Ly, 2019; Morden, Chyn, Wood, & Meara, 2021) in the treatment of pain. 137 For example, patients who identify as Black, Latino, and Asian have been found to receive fewer 138 postpartum pain assessments relative to White patients (Bazargan et al., 2016; C Evans et al., 2019; J. D. 139 Johnson et al., 2019; Rupp & Delaney, 2004; Simon et al., 2020; al., 2016) . Black (Goyal, 140 Kuppermann, Cleary, Teach, & Chamberlain, 2015; P. Lee et al., 2019) and Latino (P. Lee et al., 2019) 141 patients are less likely to receive analgesia for acute pain. Among Black and White patients receiving 142 opioids for pain, Black patients are less likely to be referred to a pain specialist and receive prescription 143 opioids at lower dosages than White patients (Hausmann, Gao, Lee, & Kwoh, 2013; Morden et al., 144 after adj usting for access -related factors , as well as the needs and 145 preferences of patients, and the appropriateness of the intervention (Ly, 2019) . These disparities appear 146 to be further magnified if patients from some racial and ethnic groups reside in socioeconomically 147 disadvantaged neighborhoods (Joynt et al., 2013) . Women may be at higher risk for inadequate pain 148 management (Majedi et al., 2019) although they have higher opioid prescription fill rates (Schieber, Guy, 149 Seth, & Losby, 2020) than men at a population level. In addition, geographic disparities contribute to 150 8 increased use of opioids for conditions for which nonopioid treatment options may be preferred but 151 may be less available. For example, compared to adults living in nonrural areas, adults living in rural 152 areas are significantly more likely to be prescribed opioids for chronic nonma lignant pain (Prunuske et 153 al., 2014) . Despite the fact that American Indian/Alaska Native , non -Hispanic and White , non -Hispanic 154 populations have experienced much higher rates of prescription opioid -related overdose deaths th an 155 Black , non -Hispanic, Hispanic, or Asian/Pacific Islander, non -Hispanic populations (Wilson, Kariisa, Seth, 156 Smith IV, & Davis, 2020) , there is evidence that application of safeguards in opioid prescribing are 157 disproporti onately applied to Black patients. Black patients in one study were more likely than White 158 patients to receive regular office visits and have restricted early refills (Becker et al., 2011) , and clinicians 159 in another study were substantially more likely to disconti nue opioids given evidence of misuse when 160 patients were Black compared to when patients were White (Gaither et al., 2018) . Pain being 161 differentially untrea ted or undertreated as a result of clinician biases persists and demands immediate 162 and sustained attention and action (Ghoshal, Shapiro, Todd, & Schatman, 2020; Nelson & Hackman, 2008; Soares, Knowles, & Friedmann, 2019) . 164 Given the clinical, psychological, and s ocial consequences associated with pain including 165 limitations in activities, lost work productivity, reduced quality of life, and pervasive stigma, it is 166 essential that clinicians have the training, education, guidance, and resources to provide appropriate , 167 holistic, and compassionate care for patients with pain (Institute of Medicine Committee on Advancing 168 Pain Research Care and Education, 2011; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2019b) . A key 169 aim of pain management is the provision of person -centered care, including the proper evaluation to 170 establish a diagnosis, with measurable outcomes that focus on optimizing function and quality of life, 171 that is built on a foundation of trust between patients and clinicians (U.S. Department of Health and 172 Human Services, 2019b) . To achieve this aim, it is important that clinicians consider the full range of 173 pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments for pain care, and health systems, payers, and 174 9 governmental programs and entities make the full spectrum of evidence -based treatments accessible to 175 patie nts with pain and their treating clinicians. 176 The range of therapeutic options that might benefit patients has historically been inaccessible to 177 many due to a variety of factors, including inadequate clinician education, training, and guidance, 178 unconscious bias, a shortage of pain management specialists, insufficient access to treatment modalities 179 such as behavioral therapy, siloed health systems, insurance coverage and reimbursement policies, and 180 lack of clarity around the evidence supporting different pai n treatments (Becker et al., 2017; Benzing, 181 Bell, Derazin, Mack, & MacIntosh, 2020; Heyward et al., 2018; Jamison, Sheehan, Scanlan, Matthews, & 182 Ross, 2014; D. H. Lin et al., 2018; Sabin & Greenwald, 2012; Saluja & Bryant, 2021; U.S. Department of 183 Health and Human Services, 2019b) . In part due to these factors affecting access to a wide range of 184 treatment modalities, for many years, medications such as prescription opioids have been the mainstay 185 to treat pain, despite very limited evidence to support their long -term (> 1 year) be nefits, with most 186 placebo -controlled trials shorter than 6 weeks in duration (Chou et al., September 2014; Dahlhamer, 187 Connor, Bose, Lucas, & Zelaya, 2021; Institute of Medicine Committee on Advancing Pain Research Care 188 and Education, 2011; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2019b) . 189 While opioids can be essential medications for the management of pain, they carry significant 190 potential risk. A systematic review published in 2014 by the A gency for Healthcare Research and Quality 191 (AHRQ) found insufficient evidence to demonstrate long -term benefits of prescription opioid treatment 192 for chronic pain, and also that long -term prescription opioid use was associated with increased risk of 193 overdose and opioid misuse, among other risks, with some, such as overdose, being dose dependent 194 (Chou et al., September 2014) . Based on accumulating evidence of potential risks for patients, in 2014 195 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required new safety labeling chan ges for extended -release 196 and long -acting opioids to include a boxed warning on the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse which 197 can potentially lead to overdose and death, as well as the risk for neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome 198 10 among patients receiving opioids during pregnancy (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2014a) . These 199 warnings were subsequently added to the labels for immediate -release opioids in 2016 (U.S. Food and 200 Drug Administration, 2016) . 201 In addi tion to the potential risks for patients prescribed opioids, these medications carry risks 202 due to their potential for diversion and nonmedical use among individuals to whom they were not 203 prescribed (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administrat ion, 2021a) . In the United States, 204 opioid prescribing increased four -fold between 1999 and 2010, and this increase was paralleled by a 205 nearly four -fold increase in overdose deaths involving prescription opioids during the same time period 206 (Paulozzi, Jones, Mack, & Rudd, 2011) as well as increases in prescription opioid use disorder (Han, 207 Compton, Jones, & Cai, 2015) . In addition to the overall volume of opioid prescriptions increasing during 208 this period, how opio ids were prescribed also changed, with opioids increasingly prescribed at higher 209 dosages and for longer durations \u2014 prescribing behaviors associated with opioid use disorder and 210 overdose (Bohnert et al., 2011; Edlund et al., 2014) . Thus, the limited evidence of long -term 211 effectiveness of opioids for chronic pain coupled with risks for patients and for people using prescription 212 opioids that were not prescribed to them underscored the importance of reducing inappropriate opioid 213 prescribing, while at the same time advancing evidence -based pain care to i mprove the lives of people 214 living with pain. 215 Recognizing the need for a national guideline on pain management that could improve 216 appropriate opioid prescribing while minimizing opioid -related risks, CDC released the CDC Guideline for 217 Prescribing Opioids fo r Chronic Pain in 2016 (referred to as the 2016 CDC Guideline hereafter). The 2016 218 CDC Guideline included 12 recommendations for the prescribing of opioids by primary care clinicians for 219 chronic pain in outpatient settings outside of active cancer treatmen t, palliative care, and end -of-life 220 care (Dowell et al., 2016) . The recommendations in the 2016 CDC Guideline were based on a systematic 221 review of the best available evidence at the time, along with input from experts and from the public, 222 11 and review and deliberation by a federally chartered advisory committee. The ultimate goal of the 2016 223 CDC Guideline was: 1) to ensure that clinicians and patients considered safer and more effective pain 224 treatment, 2) improve patient outcomes such as reduced pain and improved function, and 3) reduce the 225 number of persons who developed opioid use disorder, overdose, or experienced other prescription 226 opioid -related adverse events (Dowell et al., 2016) . To facilitate uptake of the 2016 CDC Guidelin e into 227 clinical practice, CDC employed a broad -reaching implementation strategy that included clinician 228 education and training, partnerships with health systems and payers, and multiple clinical tools and fact 229 sheets (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021b) . 230 While the number of overal l opioid prescriptions in the United States had been declining since 231 2012, the release of the 2016 CDC Guideline furthered these declines. The timing of its release was 232 associated with accelerated decreases in overall opioid prescribing and declines in hig h-risk prescribing 233 behaviors cautioned against in the 2016 CDC Guideline , such as high -dose opioid prescribing and the 234 prescribing benzodiazepines (Bohnert, Guy, & Losby, 2018) . Though not the 235 intent of the 2016 CDC Guideline , design and implementation of new law s, regulations, and policies also 236 drew from its recommendations. As one example since 2016, consistent with SUPPORT ACT 237 requirements, many state Medicaid programs have used the guideline as well as other resources in 238 creating opioid edits in their pharmacy programs (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2019) . 239 More than half of all states have passed legislation that limits initial opioid prescriptions for acute pain 240 to a sev en day supply or less (National Conference of State Legislatures, June 30, 2019.) , and many 241 insurers, pharmacy benefit managers, and pharmacies also have enacted similar policies (U.S. 242 Department of Health and Human Services, 2020) . In addition, at least 17 states have passed laws that 243 require the co -prescription of naloxone when risk factors such as high doses of opioids or concomitant 244 opioids and benzodiazepines are prescribed (Haffajee, Cherney, & Smart, 2020) . 245 12 While some laws, regulations, and policies that were derived from the 2016 CDC Guideline 246 might have had positive results fo r some patients, a central tenet of the 2016 CDC Guideline was that 247 the recommendations are voluntary and are intended to be flexible to support, not supplant, 248 individualized, patient -centered care. Of particular concern, s ome policies that were purportedl y drawn 249 from the 2016 CDC Guideline have, in fact, been notably inconsistent with the 2016 CDC Guideline and 250 have gone well beyond its clinical recommendations (Dowell, Haegerich, & Chou, 2019; Kroenke et al., 251 2019; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2019b) . Such misapplication includes extension of 252 the 2016 CDC Guideline to patient populations not covered in the 2016 CDC Guideline (e.g., cancer and 253 palliative care), opioid tapers and abrupt discontinuation without collaboration with patients, rigid 254 application of opioid dosage thresholds, application of the Guideline's re commendations for opioid use 255 for pain to medications for opioid use disorder treatment (previously referred to as medication assisted 256 treatment), duration limits by insurers and by pharmacies, and patient dismissal and abandonment 257 (Dowell, Haegerich, et al., 2019; Kroenke et al., 2019; U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2019c) . These 258 actions are not consistent with the 2016 CDC Guideline and have contributed to patient harm, including 259 untreated and undertreated pain, serious withdrawal symptoms, worsening pain outcomes, 260 psychological distress, overdose, and suicidal ideation an d behavior (Coffin et al., 2020; Demide nko et 261 al., 2017; Kroenke et al., 2019; Mark & Parish, 2019; U.S. Food and Drug 262 Administration, 2019c) . 263 Rationale 264 New evidence on the risks and benefits of prescription opioids for both acute and chronic pain, 265 comparisons with nonopioid pain treatments, dosing strategies, opioid dose -response r elationships, risk 266 mitigation strategies, and opioid tapering and discontinuation has emerged since release of the 2016 267 CDC Guideline (Chou et al., April 2020; Chou et al., December 2020; Halker Singh et al., December 2020; 268 13 McDonagh et al., April 2020; Skelly et al., April 2020) . In particular, studies have been published on 269 misapplication of the 2016 CDC Guideline (Kroenke et al., 2019) ; benefits and risks of different t apering 270 strategies and rapid tapering associated with patient harm (K. S. Gordon et al., 2020; James et al., 2019; 271 Mark & Parish, 2019; U.S. Food and Drug Administrati on, 2019c) ; challenges in patient access to opioids 272 (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2019b) ; patient abandonment a nd abrupt 273 discontinuation of opioids (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2019b); a seminal 274 randomized clinical trial comparing prescription opioids to nonopioid medications on long -term pain 275 outcomes (E. E. Krebs et al., 2018) ; the association of characteristics of initial opioid prescriptions with 276 subsequent likelihood for long -term opioid use (Deyo et al., 2017; Shah, Hayes, & Martin, 2017) ; and 277 that many patients use a small proportion of opioids prescribed to them for postoperative pain (Hill, 278 McMahon, Stucke, & Barth, 2017; Hill, Stucke, McMahon, Beeman, & Barth, Howard, & Lee, 2018) . 280 Opioid prescribing has been declining since 2012, with the decline sharply accelerated after 281 release of the 2016 CDC Guideline ; however, these medications remain a common treatment fo r pain. In 282 2015 -2018, approximately 6% of U.S. adults reported use of one or more prescription opioids in the past 283 30 days (Hales, Martin, & Gu, 2020) , and in 2020, approximately 143 million opioid prescriptions were 284 dispensed from pharmacies in the United States (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021c) . In 285 addition, rates of opioid pre scribing continue to vary across states, medical specialties, patient 286 demographics, and pain conditions in ways that cannot be explained by the underlying health status of 287 the population and are often discordant with the 2016 CDC Guideline recommendations (Guy & Zhang, 288 2018; Hill et al., 2017; Ly, 2019; Mikosz et al., 2020; Schieber et al., 2019) . The prevalence of prescription 289 opioid misuse and opioid use disorder has also declined in recent years. Among people 12 and older in 290 the U.S. in 2019, 9.7 million r eported misuse of prescription opioids in the past year (decreased from 291 12.5 million in 2015), and 1.4 million met criteria for a past -year prescription opioid use disorder 292 14 (decreased from 2.0 million in 2015) (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 293 2020) ; however, prescription opioids remain the most commonly misused prescription drug in the 294 United States in 2020 (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2021a) . Also in 295 2020, it is important to note that among those reporting misuse in the past year, 64.6% reported the 296 main reason for their most recent misuse was to \"relieve physical pain\" compared to 11.3% to \"feel 297 good or get high\" and 2.3% \"because I am hooked or have to have it\" (Substance Abuse and Mental 298 Health Services Administration, 2021a) . Taken together, these factors underscore the need for an 299 updated clinical practice guideline on appropriate opioid prescribing and pain management. 300 This clinical practice guideline expands and updates the 2016 CDC Guideline for Prescribing 301 Opioids for Chronic Pain to provide evidence -based recommendations for the prescribing of opioid pain 302 medication for acute, subacute, and chronic pain by clinicians for outpatients aged 18 years outside of 303 sickle cell disease -related pain management, cancer pain treatment, palliative care, and end -of-life care. 304 This clinical practice guideline update leverages new data to expand content on prescription opioids for 305 acute and subacute pain throughout the recommendations. Importantly, the update also aims to clearly 306 delineate recommendations that apply to patients who are being considered for initial treatment with 307 prescription opioids and those who have already been rec eiving opioids as part of the ir ongoing pain 308 management treatment. CDC developed a draft clinical practice guideline based on five systematic 309 reviews of the best available evidence on the benefits and risks of prescription opioids, nonopioid 310 pharmacologica l treatments, and nonpharmacological treatments. As described in more detail below, 311 the draft clinical practice guideline was reviewed by an independent Federal Advisory Committee (CDC's 312 Board of Scientific Counselors of the National Center for Injury Prev ention and Control), peer reviewers, 313 and the public, and revised by CDC based on feedback from these reviews. In addition, insights from 314 patients, caregivers, and clinicians via conversations held in 2020 were incorporated during the clinical 315 practice guid eline update. 316 15 This clinical practice guideline provides recommendations only. It does not replace clinical 317 judgment and individualized, patient -centered decision -making. The recommendations are based on 318 emerging evidence, including observational studies or randomized clinical trials with nota ble limitations, 319 and thus, when providing care, they should be considered in the context of the individual clinician - 320 patient relationship based on a shared understanding and a \"whole -person approach\" that considers 321 such factors as the patient's physical an d psychological functioning, support needs, expected health 322 outcomes and well -being , home environment, and home and work responsibilities. Flexibility for 323 clinicians and patients is paramount when making clinical treatment decisions based on individual 324 factors. The clinical practice guideline recommendations aim to improve communication between 325 clinicians and patients about the risks and benefits of prescription opioids and other pain treatment 326 strategies, improve the safety and effectiveness of pain treatm ent, improve pain, function, and quality 327 of life for people with pain, and reduce the risks associated with opioid pain treatment (including opioid 328 use disorder, overdose, and death) and with other pain treatment. Of utmost importance, this clinical 329 practi ce guideline provides voluntary clinical practice recommendations for clinicians that should not be 330 used as inflexible standards of care. The clinical practice guideline recommendations are also not 331 intended to be implemented as absolute limits of policy o r practice across populations by organizations, 332 healthcare systems, or government entities. 333 Scope and audience 334 This clinical practice guideline is intended for clinicians who are treating outpatients aged 18 335 years with acute (duration <1 month) pain, subacute (duration of 1 -3 months) pain, or chronic 336 (duration of >3 months) pain outside of sickle cell disease -related pain management, cancer 337 treatment, palliative care, and end -of-life care. For the purposes of this clinical practice guideline, 338 \"clinicians\" refers to physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and oral health 339 16 practitioners. This clinical p ractice guideline update includes recommendations for primary care (e.g., 340 internists, family physicians) and other (e.g., surgeons, emergency clinicians, occupational medicine 341 and physical medicine and rehabilitation clinicians, neurologists) clinicians (i ncluding physicians, nurse 342 practitioners, physician assistants, and oral health practitioners managing pain in outpatient settings. 343 Applicable settings include clinician offices, clinics, and urgent care centers. The recommendations do 344 not apply to inpatie nt care received while hospitalized or to care received while in an emergency 345 department or other observational setting from which a patient might be admitted to inpatient care 346 but do apply to prescribing for pain management upon discharge (from emergency departments , 347 hospitals, or other facilities ). As clinicians may work within team -based care, the recommendations 348 refer to and promote integrated pain management and collaborative working relationships with, for 349 example , behavioral health specialists, such as social workers or psychologists, and pharmacists. 350 In addition to updating recommendations based on new evidence regarding management of 351 chronic pain, this clinical practice guideline update is meant to assist clinicians in weighing benefits and 352 risks of prescribing opioid pain medication for painful acute conditions (e.g., l ow back pain, neck pain, 353 other musculoskeletal pain, neuropathic pain, dental pain, pain due to kidney stones, and acute episodic 354 migraines ) and pain related to procedures (e.g., postoperative pain, pain from oral surgery ). Several of 355 these indications were prioritized in 2020 by an ad hoc committee of the National Academies of 356 Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine, 2020) 357 as those for which evidence -based clinical prac tice guidelines would help inform prescribing practices, 358 with the greatest potential impact on public health. The clinical practice guideline has additionally been 359 updated to include content on management of subacute painful conditions \u2014 when duration fall s 360 between that typically considered acute (defined as <1 month in this clinical practice guideline) and 361 chronic (generally considered as >3 months). Note that the durations used to define acute, subacute, 362 and chronic pain might imply more specificity than is found in real -life patient experience, when pain 363 17 often gradually transitions from acute to chronic pain. These time -bound definitions are not meant to be 364 absolute, but instead to provide approximate guides to facilitate consideration and practical use o f 365 recommendations by clinicians and patients. 366 The 2016 CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain focused on recommendations 367 for primary care physicians. This clinical practice guideline expands the scope of the 2016 CDC Guideline 368 to additional clinicians. While primary care physicians prescribe approximately 37% of all opioid 369 prescriptions, other clinicians , including pain medicine clinicians (8.9%) and dentists (8.6%) , account for 370 significant proportions of prescriptions. Pain medicine and phy sical medicine and rehabilitation clinicians 371 prescribe opioids at the highest rates, followed by orthopedic and family medicine clinicians (Guy & 372 Zhang, 2018) . Thus, expanding the clinical practice guideline's scope to outpatient opioid prescribing can 373 provide evidence -based advice for many additional clinicians, including dentists and other oral health 374 providers, clinicians managing postoperative pain in outpatients, and clinicians providing pain 375 management for patients being discharged from emergency departments . 376 Many principles of pain management are similar whether or not the treating clinician is a pain 377 management specialist, and many of the recommendations might be relevant for pain management 378 specialists. In addition, many pain management specialists already follow principles outlined in this 379 clinical practice guideline. However, use by pain management specialists is not the focus of this clinical 380 practice guideline. Pain management specialists often have extensive training and expertise in pain 381 management modalities that other clinicians do not, and they might see patients with clinical situations 382 that are more complex, less prevalent, and not well -addressed by the available evidence; thus, the 383 balance of benefits and risks to patients might differ when the treating clinician is a pain management 384 specialist treating patients with complex pain conditions. 385 18 In addition, the recommendations address the use of opioid pain medication in certain specia l 386 populations (e.g., older adults and pregnant people) and in populations with conditions posing special 387 risks (e.g., a history of substance use disorder). The recommendations do not address the use of opioid 388 pain medication in children or adolescents aged <18 years. The available evidence concerning the 389 benefits and risks of long -term opioid therapy in children and adolescents remains limited, and few 390 opioid medications provide information in the labeling regarding safety and effectiveness in pediatric 391 patients. Guidelines and recommendations are available for pain management in children with sickle cell 392 disease (Brandow et al., 2020) and undergoing surgical procedures (Michigan Opioid Prescribing 393 Engagement Network) , and for palliative care in adolescent and young adult patients with cancer 394 (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) . 395 While some p rinciples in this clinical practice guideline might be helpful in the management of 396 pain in sickle cell disease, cancer, palliative care, and end -of-life care, some recommendations might not 397 be relevant for patients with these conditions and receiving care in these settings. Thus, this clinical 398 practice guideline does not apply to patients experiencing pain associated with these conditions or 399 settings. Other guidelines more specifically address pain management for patients with these conditions 400 (Brandow et al., 2020; Denlinger, Sanft, & Armenian; National Comprehensive Cancer Network; Paice et 401 al., 2016; Swarm et al., 2019) . This does not imply that any other types of pain are more or less worthy 402 of effective treatment - only that they are not covered by this clinical practice guideline. This clinical 403 practice guideline follows the Institute of Medicine's definition of palliative care as care that provides 404 relief from pain and other symptoms, supports quality of life, and is focused on patients with serious 405 advanced illness (Committee on Approaching Death: Addressing Key End of Life Issues & Institute of 406 Medicine, 2015) . Palliative care can begin early in the course of treatment for any serious illness that 407 requires advanced management of pain or other distressing symptoms (Committee on Approaching 408 Death: Addressing Key End of Life Issues & Institute of Medicine, 2015) . End-of-life care is defined as 409 19 care for persons in hospice care and others with a terminal illness or at high risk of dying in the near 410 future in hospitals, receiving long -term services and supports (including institutional care, and home and 411 community -based services), or at home. This clinical practice guideline does not apply to pati ents 412 undergoing cancer treatment, palliative care, or end -of-life care because of the unique therapeutic 413 goals, ethical considerations, opportunities for medical supervision, and balance of risks and benefits 414 with opioid therapy in such care. Readers are r eferred to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network 415 (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology: Adult Cancer Pain (Swarm et al., 2019) , NCCN Clinical 416 Practice Guidelines in Oncology: Survivorship (Denlinger et al.) , and Management of Chronic Pain in 417 Survivors of Adult Cancers: American Society of Clinical Oncology Clinical Practice Guideline (Paice et al., 418 2016) for recommendations on pain management for patients with cancer and patients who have 419 survived cancer. In addition, given unique considerations in management of pain rela ted to sickle cell 420 disease, which can change the balance of benefits and risks for the use of opioids, clinicians should refer 421 to specific guidelines for pain management for patients facing painful complications of sickle cell disease 422 and are referred to t he American Society of Hematology 2020 Guidelines for Sickle Cell Disease: 423 Management of Acute and Chronic pain (Brandow et al., 2020) . In 2018, the National Comprehensive 424 Cancer Network and the American Society of Clinical Oncology convened and led a meeting including 425 representatives and guideline authors from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, American 426 Society of Clinical Oncology, American Society of Hematology, and Centers for Disease Control and 427 Prevention to review existing pain management guidelines (Denlinger et al.; Dowell et al., 2016; Paice et 428 al., 2016; Swarm et al., 2019) and guidelines then in development (Brandow et al., 2020) from these 429 organizations. Meeting participants noted that these guidelines applied to different p atient populations 430 and target audiences , but found no disagreement among recommendations when applied to the 431 appropriate patient and clinical situation (Schatz et al ., 2020) . 432 20 While this clinical practice guideline update includes content on pain management for patients 433 with opioid use disorder, and one recommendation focuses on management of opioid use disorder as a 434 complication of opioid use, recommendations on o pioids used specifically as medications for opioid use 435 disorder are not the focus of this clinical practice guideline. Readers are referred to The ASAM National 436 Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder: 2020 Focused Update (American Society of 437 Addiction Medicine, 2020) for more detailed recommendations on management of patients with opioid 438 use disorder. 439 Methods for clinical practice guideline development 440 Methods for conducting systematic reviews 441 Sources of evidence 442 The 2016 CDC Guideline was based on a systematic clinic al evidence review sponsored by AHRQ 443 on the effectiveness and risks of long -term opioid therapy for chronic pain (Chou et al., September 2014; 444 Chou et al., 2015) , supplemented by a CDC update to the AHRQ -sponsored review and additional 445 contextual questions (Dowell et al., 2016) . The AHRQ -sponsored systematic review addressed the 446 effectiveness of long -term opioid therapy for outcomes related to pain, function, and quality of life; the 447 comparative effectiveness of different methods for initiating and titrating opioids; the harms and 448 adverse events associated with opioids; and the accuracy of risk -prediction instruments and 449 effectiveness of risk mi tigation strategies on outcomes related to overdose, opioid use disorder, illicit 450 drug use, and/or prescription opioid misuse. The CDC update to the AHRQ -sponsored review included 451 more recently published literature (published during or after 2015) and an additional question on the 452 association between opioid therapy for acute pain and long -term use . The contextual evidence review 453 addressed effectiveness of nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic treatments, clinician and 454 patient values and preferences, and information regarding resource allocation. 455 21 For this CDC update to the 2016 CDC Guideline, CDC funded AHRQ in 2018 and 2019 to conduct 456 five systematic reviews (Chou et al., April 2020; Chou et al., December 2020; Halker Singh et al., 457 December 2020; McDonagh et al., April 20 20; Skelly et al., April 2020) . AHRQ's Evidence -based Practice 458 Centers completed thes e reviews , which include new evidence related to the treatment of chronic and 459 acute pain. The AHRQ review of opioids for chronic pain updated the evidence addressed in the prior 460 (2016) CDC review and expanded upon it, by including studies on shorter term ( 1 to 12 month) 461 outcomes of therapy involving opioids, effects of opioid plus nonopioid combination therapy, effects of 462 tramadol, effects of naloxone co -prescription, risks of co -prescribed benzodiazepines, risks of co - 463 prescribed gabapentinoids, and effects of concurrent use of cannabis (Chou et al., April 2020) . The 464 systematic clinical evidence review on opioids for chronic pai n (Chou et al., April 2020) also included 465 Contextual Questions on clinician and patient values and preferences and costs and cost-effectiveness of 466 opioid therapy and risk mitigation strategies. In addition, CDC used four new, complementary AHRQ 467 reviews on the benefits and harms of nonpharmacologic treatments for chronic pain (Skelly et al., April 468 2020) , nonopioid pharmacologic treatments for chronic pain (McDonagh et al., April 2020) , treatments 469 for acute episodic migraine (Halker Singh et al., December 2020) , and treatment f or acute (non - 470 migraine) pain (Chou et al., December 2020) . A question on management of acute pain in the 2016 CDC 471 review on opioids for chronic pain was moved to the new review on therapies for acute pain (Chou et 472 al., December 2020) . CDC also reviewed AHRQ -sponsored surveillance reports conducted in follow -up to 473 the five systematic reviews for any new evidence that could potentially change systematic review 474 conclusion s (Chou R et al., 2022) . To supplement the clinical evidence reviews, CDC sponsored a 475 contextual evid ence review on clinician and patient values and preferences and resource allocation 476 (costs) for the areas addressed in the four new reviews (Chou et al., December 2020; Halker Singh et al., 477 December 2020; McDonagh et al., April 2020; Skelly et al., April 2020) . 478 Primary clinical questions guiding the systematic reviews 479 22 Across reviews, the main outcomes were pain, function, and quality of life. Harms varied 480 depending on the therapy evaluated but included serious adverse events when reported; for opioids, 481 key harms included overdose and harms related to opioid use disorder . The reviews of therapies for 482 chronic pain assessed outcomes at short - (1 to <6 months), intermediate - (6 to <12 months), and long - 483 term follow -up (12 months). The reviews of therapies for acute pain assessed outcomes at < 1 day; 1 484 day to <1 week; 1 week to <2 weeks; and 2 weeks to 4 weeks; the review of treatments for acute non - 485 migraine pain also evaluated outcomes at 4 weeks. All reviews included key questions (KQs) or sub - 486 questions on how benefits and harms varied according to demographic (age, sex, ra ce), clinical (severity 487 and duration of pain, medical and psychiatric comorbidities, concomitant medications), and intervention 488 (dose, duration, intensity) characteristics. 489 The systematic clinical evidence reviews addressed questions in the following topi c areas 490 (details including questions available in the full AHRQ reports [Chou et al., April 2020; Chou et al., 491 December 2020; Halker Singh et al., December 2020; McDonagh et al., April 2020; Skelly et al., April 492 2020] ): 493 Opioids for chronic pain 494 The effectiveness and comparative effectiveness (benefits, [KQ] 1 and harms, [KQ 2]) of 495 long -term opioid therapy versus placebo, no opioid therapy , or nonopioid therapy. 496 The comparative effectiveness of various opioid dosing strategies (KQ3): 497 o Different methods for initiating and titrating opioids 498 o Short -acting versus long -acting/extended -release opioids 499 o Different long -acting opioids 500 o Short - plus long -acting versus long -acting opioid alone 501 23 o Scheduled, continuous versus as -needed dosing 502 o Opioid dose escalation versus dose maintenance or use of dose thresholds 503 o Opioid rotation versus maintenance 504 o Different strategies for treating acute exacerbations of c hronic pain 505 o Decreasing opioid doses or tapering off opioids versus continuation of opioids 506 o Different tapering protocols and strategies 507 o Different opioid dosages and durations of therapy 508 The accuracy of instruments for predicting risk for opioid overdose, addiction, abuse, or 509 misuse; the effectiveness of risk prediction instruments; the effectiveness of various risk 510 mitigation strategies; and comparative effectiveness of strategies for managing patients 511 with opioid use disorder (KQ 4). The risk mi tigation strategies are: 512 o Opioid management plans 513 o Patient education 514 o Urine drug screening 515 o Use of prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) data 516 o Use of monitoring instruments in patients prescribed opioids 517 o More frequent monitoring intervals 518 o Pill counts 519 o Use of abuse -deterrent formulations 520 24 o Consultation with mental health specialists when mental health conditions are 521 present or suspected 522 o Avoidance of co -prescribing of sedative hypnotics 523 o nonpharmacological treatments for ch ronic pain 525 The effectiveness and comparative effectiveness (benefits and harms) of noninvasive 526 nonpharmacological treatments (exercise, mind -body practices, psychological 527 interventions, multidisciplinary rehabilitation, mindfulness practices, musculoskeletal 528 manipulation, physical modalities, and acupuncture) versus inactive treatments, usual 529 care, no treatment, pharmacological therapy, or selected active treatments (exercise 530 [chronic pain conditions other than headache] or biofeedback [headach e]), for the 531 following conditions: 532 o Chronic low back pain (KQ 1) 533 o Chronic neck pain (KQ 2) 534 o Osteoarthritis (knee, hip, hand) (KQ 3) 535 o Fibromyalgia (KQ 4) 536 o Chronic tension headache (KQ 5) 537 Nonopioid pharmacologic treatments for chronic pain 538 Effectiveness and comparative effectiveness (benefits [KQ 1] and cannabis) versus placebo or other nonopioid pharmacologic agents. 542 25 Treatments for acute pain 543 Effectiveness and comparative effectiveness (benefits and harms) of opioid therapy 544 versus nonopioid pharma cannabis) 546 nonpharmacologic therapy (exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy, meditation, 547 relaxation, music therapy, virtual reality, acu puncture, massage, 548 manipulation/mobilization, physical modalities); nonopioid nonpharmacologic therapy; and 550 nonpharmacologic therapy versus inactive treatments or usual care, for the following 551 conditions: 552 o Acute back pain (including back pain with radiculopathy) (KQ 1) 553 o Acute neck pain (including neck pain with radiculopathy) (KQ 2) 554 o Musculoskeletal pain not otherwise included in KQ 1 or KQ 2 (including 555 fractures) (KQ 3) 556 o Peripheral neurop athic 4) 558 o Postoperative pain (excluding inpatient management of pain following major 559 surgical procedures (KQ 5) 560 o Dental pain (KQ 6) 561 o Kidney stones (including inpatient management) (KQ 7) 562 o Sickle cell crisis (episodic pain) (KQ 8) 563 Treatments for acute episodic migraine 564 Effectiveness and comparative effectiveness (benefits and harms) of: 565 26 o Opioid cannabis, or others [e.g., gepants]) or nonpharmacologic 568 therapy (exercise, cognitiv e behavioral therapy, acupuncture, or others) (KQ 1) 569 o Nonopioid pharmacologic therapy versus a different nonopioid pharmacologic 570 therapy or nonpharmacologic therapy (KQ 2) 571 o Nonpharmacologic therapy versus inactive treatments, usual care, or no 572 treatment (KQ 3) 573 574 Search protocols 575 Complete methods and data, including detailed search protocols and inclusion and exclusion 576 criteria, for the five AHRQ reports summarized here have been published (Chou et al., April 2020; Chou 577 et al., December 2020; Halker Singh et al., December 2020; McDonagh et al., April 2020; Skelly et al., 578 April 2020) . Briefly, study authors developed the search protocols using a standardized process with 579 input from experts and the public. The review protocols were submitted for registration in the 580 PROSPERO database prior to conducting the reviews. For each review, research librarians conducted 581 searches on multiple electronic databases. For all reviews , searches were conducted on MEDLINE, 582 Cochrane CENTRAL, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews; other databases that were 583 utilized for one or more reviews (depending on the topic) were Embase PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, and 584 others. The searches were supplemented by a review of reference lists (including prior AHRQ and CDC 585 reviews on these topics) (Chou et al., September 2014; Dowell et al., 2016; Skelly et al., 2018) and gray 586 literature sources. Searches were conducted in August or September 2019 for the chronic pain reviews 587 and in July or August 2020 for the acute pain reviews. 588 27 Summarizing the evi dence 589 The reviews categorized magnitude of effects for pain and function using the same system as 590 prior AHRQ reviews (Chou et al., 2017; Skelly et al., 2018) . A small effect was defined for pain as a mean 591 between -group difference following treatment of 0.5 to 1.0 points on a 0 - to 10 -point numeric rating 592 scale (NRS) or visual analog scale (VAS) and for function as a standardized mean difference (SMD) of 0.2 593 to 0.5 or a mean difference of 5 to 10 points on the 0 to 100 -point Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) 594 (Fairbank & Pynsent, 2000) , 1 to 2 points on the 0 to 24 -point Roland -Morris Disability Questionnaire 595 (RDQ) (Roland & Morris, 1983) , or equivalent. A moderate effect was defined for pain as a mean 596 difference of 10 to 20 points on a 0 - to 100 -point VAS (1 to 2 points on a 0 - to 10 -point NRS) and for 597 function as an SMD of 0. 5 to 0.8, or a mean difference of 10 to 20 points on the ODI, 2 to 5 points on the 598 RDQ, or equivalent (Chou et al., 2017; Skelly et al., 2018) . Large/substantial effects were defined as 599 greater than moderate. We applied similar thresholds to other outcomes measured. Small effects using 600 this system may not meet proposed thresholds for clinically meaningful effects (Ostelo et al., 2008) . 601 However, there is variability in estimated minimum clinically important differences across studies, and 602 the clinical relevance of effects classified as small might vary for individual patients depending on 603 preferences, baseline s ymptom severity, harms, cost, and other factors (Jayadevappa, Cook, & 604 & Nelissen, 2012) . The reviews also evaluated results based 605 on dichotomous outcomes ( e.g., likelihood of experiencing clinically meaningful improvement in pain or 606 function, often defined as >30% or >50% improvement from baseline). 607 Evaluating quality of the evidence: the AHRQ method 608 609 610 The reviews used the AHRQ approach to synthesize and gra de the strength of evidence 611 (Berkman et al., 2015) . The AHRQ approach is based on a systematic review of the evidence and 612 provides an overall strength of evidence indicating the level of certainty (high, moderate, low, or 613 28 insufficient), based on similar factors considered in the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization 614 Practices (ACIP) adapted (Ahmed, Temte, Campos -Outcalt, & Sch\u00fcnemann, 2011; G. Lee & Carr, 2018) 615 GRADE (Guyatt et al., 2008) approach (study limitations/r isk of bias, consistency, directness, precision, 616 reporting bias, and other factors [large strength of association, dose response, and plausible 617 confounders strengthening observed findings]). 618 Evaluating the quality of the evidence: the ACIP -adapted GRADE m ethod 619 620 Predicated on a systematic review of scientific evidence, the GRADE approach provides a 621 transparent framework for grading the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations based on 622 the evidence. GRADE has been adapted by the ACIP, (Ahmed et al., 2011; G. Lee & Carr, 2018) and CDC 623 used the ACIP adaptation of the GRADE framewor k in this clinical practice guideline. Applying the ACIP 624 GRADE framework, each body of evidence is initially categorized using a hierarchy that reflects the 625 degree of confidence in the effect of a clinical action on health outcomes. The categories in the 626 hierarchy ( Box 2 ) are: type 1 evidence (randomized clinical trials or overwhelming evidence from 627 observational studies), type 2 evidence (randomized clinical trials with important limitations, or 628 exceptionally stron g evidence from observational studies), type 3 evidence (observational studies or 629 randomized clinical trials with notable limitations), and type 4 evidence (clinical experience and 630 observations, observational studies with important limitations, or randomiz ed clinical trials with several 631 major limitations). The evidence is downgraded if issues are identified with regard to risk of bias, 632 inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, or publication bias; observational studies may be upgraded in 633 certain situations (large strength of association, presence of dose response, or plausible effects of 634 confounding would strengthen findings). That is, if it is likely that confounding would provide results 635 opposite to the observed findings, it strengthens the confidence that the observed association is 636 present . Based on these considerations, a final evidence type is assigned. Type 1 evidence indicates high 637 confidence that the true effect is close to the estimate of the effect; type 2 evidence means that the 638 29 true effect is lik ely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is some uncertainty; type 3 639 evidence means that confidence in the effect estimate is limited (moderate uncertainty), and the true 640 effect could differ substantially from the estimate of the effect; an d type 4 evidence indicates that one 641 has very little confidence in the effect estimate (high uncertainty), and the likelihood that the true effect 642 differs from the estimate of the effect is high (Ahmed et al., 2011; Balshem et al., 2011) . When no 643 studies are available or the evidence is too limited to estimate effects, evidence is considered 644 insufficient. 645 Evaluating the quality of the evidence: converting the AHRQ quality rati ng to GRADE 646 rating 647 648 The AHRQ approach uses a different method and terminology (high, moderate, low, or 649 insufficient) to grade the strength of evidence (SOE) than the ACIP -adapted GRADE approach (evidence 650 types 1, 2, 3, or 4) (Berkman et al., 2015) . However, the underlying principles are similar, enabling 651 translation from the AHRQ to CDC grades. A methodologist translated the AHRQ strength of evidence 652 grades to CDC evidence types based on the information provided in the summary of evidence tables in 653 the AHRQ reviews. Tables with GRADE clinical evidence review ratings of the evidence for the key clinical 654 questions are available ( http://stacks.cdc.gov/XXXXX link TBD ). Evidence was categorized into the 655 following types: type 1 (randomized clinical trials or overwhelming evidence from observational studies; 656 generally equivalent to AHRQ high strength of evidence), type 2 (rand omized clinical trials with 657 important limitations, or exceptionally strong evidence from observational studies; generally equivalent 658 to AHRQ moderate strength of evidence), type 3 (observational studies, or randomized clinical trials with 659 notable limitatio ns; generally equivalent to most AHRQ low strength of evidence ratings), or type 4 660 (clinical experience and observations, observational studies with important limitations, or randomized 661 clinical trials with several major limitations; equivalent to AHRQ low strength of evidence with serious 662 limitations). When no studies were available or the evidence was too limited to estimate effects, 663 30 evidence was assessed as insufficient. Results from meta -analyses conducted for the AHRQ reviews 664 were reported when availab le; otherwise, the evidence was synthesized qualitatively. 665 Methods to develop the recommendations 666 CDC developed this clinical practice guideline using the approach developed by the GRADE 667 working group ( https://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/ ). Recommendations are based on the reviewed 668 evidence. In the ACIP adapted GRADE framework, recommendations are assigned one of two categories 669 (category A or B). Four major factors determine the category of the recommendation: the quality of 670 evidence, the bal ance between desirable and undesirable effects, values and preferences, and resource 671 allocation (e.g., costs to patients or health systems) (Andrews et al., 2013) . Other considerations include 672 feasibility and acceptability, and impact on equity (Welch et al., 2017) . Recommendations are more 673 likely to be category A when the evidence is higher quality, there is a greater balance of desirable 674 relative to undesirable effects, resources and costs are lower, and when recommendations are less 675 sensitive to differences in values and preferences. Category A recommendations generally apply to all 676 persons in the group addressed in the recommendation and indicate a course of action that can be 677 followed in most circumstances. Category B recommendations indicate that the recommendation may 678 not apply to all persons in the group addressed in the recommendation; therefore, different choices will 679 be appropriate for different patients and decisions should be individualized based on the individual 680 patient's circumstances. For category B recommendations, clinicians must help patients arrive at a 681 decision consistent with patient values and preferences, and specific c linical situations (shared decision - 682 making) (Ahmed, 2013) . In the GRADE approach, a particular quality of evidence does not necessarily 683 result in a particul ar strength of recommendation (Andrews et al., 2013; Balshem et al., 2011; Guyatt et 684 al., 2008) . Although it is desirable for category A recommendations to be based on type 1 or type 2 685 evidence, category A recommendations can be made based on type 3 or type 4 evidence when the 686 advantages of a clinical action are assessed as clearly outweighing the disadvantages based on a 687 31 consideration of benefits and harms, values and prefe rences, and costs, despite uncertainty in effect 688 estimates (Andrews et al., 2013) . The GRADE Working Group has presented several \"paradigmatic\" 689 situations in which strong (cate gory A) recommendations may be justified despite low quality evidence, 690 for example, w hen high quality evidence suggests equivalence of two alternatives and low quality 691 evidence suggests harm in one alternative, or when high quality evidence suggests modest benefits and 692 low/very low quality evidence suggests possibility of catastrophic harm (Andrews et al., 2013) . Category 693 B recommendations are made whe n the advantages and disadvantages of a clinical action are more 694 balanced or when there is more uncertainty with regard to whether benefits clearly outweigh harms. 695 In accordance with the ACIP adapted GRADE process, CDC drafted recommendations based on 696 the clinical and contextual evidence (including benefits and harms, values and preferences, resource 697 allocation) . Draft recommendations focused on determining whether or not to initiate opioids for pain; 698 opioid selection and dosage; opioid duration and follow -up; and assessing risk and addressing potential 699 harms of opioid use. To help assure the draft guideline's integrity and credibility, CDC then began a 700 multistep review process described in detail below. 701 Federal Advisory Committee review and recommendation 702 CDC sought recommendations on the draft updated clinical practice guideline from one of its 703 federal advisory committees, the Board of Scientific Counselors of the National Center for Injury 704 Prevention and Control (BSC/NCIPC). The BSC/NCIPC advises the Secretary of the Department of Health 705 and Human Services (HHS), the Di rector of CDC, and the Director of NCIPC, and makes recommendations 706 regarding scientific, programmatic, and research policies, strategies, objectives, projects, and priorities. 707 The BSC/NCIPC also reviews progress toward injury and violence prevention. BSC/ NCIPC members are 708 special government employees appointed by the Secretary, HHS, or their designee, as CDC advisory 709 committee members. Members are required to complete the Office of Government Ethics Form 450 710 32 annually to disclose relevant interests and repo rt on their disclosures during meetings. Disclosures for 711 the BSC/NCIPC are reported in this clinical practice guideline. 712 On December 4 -5, 2019, CDC held a public meeting of the BSC/NCIPC (announced via Federal 713 Register 84 FR 57021; 84 FR 65159) and provide d a presentation on the background for updating the 714 clinical practice guideline. CDC then requested the formation of an Opioid Workgroup (OWG), under the 715 parent BSC, whose primary purpose would be to review a draft updated clinical practice guideline and t o 716 develop a report of their observations for the BSC/NCIPC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 717 2021a) . After considering CDC's presentations, the proposed OWG Terms of Reference, and public 718 comments, the BSC/NCIPC voted unanimously to establish an OWG that reports to the BSC/NCIPC. CDC 719 then held a public nomination process for prospective OWG members (Centers for Disease Control and 720 Prevention, 2021a) . 721 To provide background to the BSC/NCIPC for informing the creation of the OWG with a balance 722 of perspective s, CDC identified audiences that would be: 1) directly affected by the clinical practice 723 guideline, 2) directly involved with implementing or integrating recommendations into current practice, 724 and 3) qualified to represent a specific discipline or expertis e in alignment with the tasks of the 725 workgroup for consideration by the BSC/NCIPC. Identified groups with perspectives that would support 726 the workgroup's capacity included, but were not limited to, patients living with pain, family members 727 and caregivers, clinicians, public health practitioners, and research scientists. CDC announced the call for 728 nominations at the December 4 -5, 2019, public meeting and heard recommendations from the public 729 during the public comment opportunities , as well as from BSC/NCIPC members regarding 730 recommendations for nominations. People interested in being considered for the workgroup were 731 encouraged to submit self -nominations from December 4, 2019, through February 4, 2020. CDC's 732 BSC/NCIPC received 255 nominations for the OWG. 733 33 After carefully reviewing clinical expertise, professional credentials, and diversity in perspectives 734 of all nominees (including sex, race/ethnicity, geographic region, institutional affiliations, and personal 735 experiences relevant to pain management and carin g for patients with pain), the OWG's Designated 736 Federal Officer (DFO) created a list of prospective workgroup members and sent invitations to 737 participate along with conflict -of-interest disclosure forms. The OWG's DFO and the BSC/NCIPC's DFO 738 reviewed confl ict of interest disclosure forms. CDC's Strategic Business Initiatives Unit (SBIU), which 739 oversees the Federal Advisory Committee Act program, also reviewed the OWG Terms of Reference, 740 prospective OWG roster, curricula vitae, and conflict of interest discl osure forms and determined all 741 reported financial or other conflicts of interest were not present or non -significant before finalizing 742 selection. OWG members disclosed any potential topical conflicts of interest related to OWG meeting 743 agenda items prior to each meeting. Disclosures of the OWG are reported in the clinical practice 744 guideline. 745 The OWG had 23 members (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020d) . In accordance 746 with CDC guidance (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2008, 2020c) that at least two 747 BSC/NCIPC members must serve on the OWG, and one of the two members must serve as the 748 workgroup chair, the OWG included a total of three BSC/NCIPC members, with one BSC/NCIPC me mber 749 serving as the OWG chair. A NCIPC subject matter expert served as the OWG's DFO. OWG members 750 included patients with pain, caregivers, and family members of patients with pain. The OWG also 751 comprised clinicians and subject matter experts, with the foll owing perspectives represented: primary 752 care, pain medicine, public health, behavioral health, pharmacy, emergency medicine, medical 753 toxicology, obstetrics/gynecology, bioethics, orthopedic surgery, plastic surgery, dentistry, sickle cell 754 disease, substanc e use disorder treatment, and research. OWG members were diverse in regard to sex, 755 race/ethnicity, geographic region, institutional affiliation, subject matter expertise, and personal 756 34 experiences. The CDC NCIPC OWG DFO presented the OWG roster and reviewed the Terms of Reference 757 at the publicly held BSC/NCIPC meeting on July 22, 2020 ( Federal Register 85 FR 30709; 85 FR 40290). 758 The OWG had a total of 11 meetings from October 2020 through June 2021. Before receiving 759 the draft updated clinical practice guidel ine, the OWG held meetings to review and discuss the 2016 CDC 760 Guideline, CDC's community engagement activities with patients, caregivers, and clinicians, and GRADE 761 methodology. CDC NCIPC staff provided the OWG with the evidence reviews, public comments fro m 762 BSC/NCIPC meetings, and summaries of community engagements for review before providing the OWG 763 with the draft updated clinical practice guideline in March 2021. The OWG held 7 meetings to review 764 and discuss the draft clinical practice guideline and develop a report summarizing their expert 765 observations and findings for the BSC/NCIPC. The OWG report (BSC/NCIPC Opioid Workgroup Members, 766 2021) provided overall observations on overarching themes and draft clinical practice guideline 767 recommendations. In addition, many members of the OWG developed a document entitled OWG 768 Guiding Principles that was included as an appendix in the OWG report; this document outlines the 769 \"general process and principles by which the OWG approached their assigned tasks.\" These Guiding 770 Principles included: minimize bias, scientific integrity, enhanc e inclusivity, patient and clinician centered, 771 and historical context. 772 The OWG chair presented the OWG report at a public BSC/NCIPC meeting held on July 16, 2021 773 (Federal Register 86 FR 30048 ). After hearing additional CDC presentations on the process and progress 774 of the draft clinical practice guideline, discussion of the OWG report, and a two -hour public comment 775 period, the BSC/NCIPC voted unanimously that CDC adopt the OWG report, while considering ideas and 776 suggestions raised by the BSC/NCIPC and publi c during the meeting, and that the OWG's work be 777 considered complete and the OWG sunsetted. After the meeting, the BSC/NCIPC provided their 778 recommendations to HHS and CDC. CDC carefully considered the OWG's observations, BSC/NCIPC 779 recommendations, and publ ic comments when revising the draft updated clinical practice guideline. 780 35 Federal partner engagement 781 The BSC/NCIPC invited federal partners to serve as ex -officio members of the OWG, which 782 comprised representatives from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) at the National Institutes of 783 Health (NIH), the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), FDA, and the 784 Indian Health Service (IHS). The BSC/NCIPC comprised ex -officio members from the Administration for 785 Children and Familie s, the Administration on Aging in the Administration for Community Living, the 786 National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and the National Center for Health Statistics at the 787 CDC, the Health Resources and Services Administration, IHS, SAMHSA, an d the National Institute on 788 Aging, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NIDA, and the National Institute 789 of Mental Health at the NIH. Additional federal partners were engaged throughout the clinical practice 790 guideline update proces s. Federal partners reviewed the full draft clinical practice guideline as part of 791 CDC's agency clearance process. 792 Public comment and community engagement 793 CDC garnered input through Federal Register notices to better understand community 794 members' lived experiences and perspectives related to pain and pain management options before 795 drafting the updated clinical practice guideline. Through the Federal Register notice (85 FR 21441) 796 posted from April 17, 2020, through June 16, 2020, CDC invited input specifically on topics focused on 797 using or prescribing opioid pain medications, nonopioid medications, or nonpharmacological treatments 798 and received 5,392 public comments. Public comments were synthesized int o common themes, utilizing 799 a CDC -funded analysis contract. 800 In addition, the Lab at the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) worked with CDC to 801 design and implement community engagement opportunities to gain additional insight into the values 802 and prefer ences of patients, caregivers, and clinicians. For these opportunities, key groups included 803 patients with acute or chronic pain, patients' family members and/or caregivers, and clinicians who care 804 36 for patients with pain or conditions that can complicate pa in management (e.g., opioid use disorder or 805 overdose). 806 CDC planned to have individual conversations with patients, caregivers, and clinicians in person 807 but pivoted to holding conversations with individuals in a virtual format due to the COVID -19 pandemic. 808 CDC posted a companion Federal Register notice (85 FR 4 4303) from July 22, 2020, through August 21, 809 2020, to solicit input from patients, caregivers, and clinicians interested in participating in individual 810 conversations. After the Federal Register notice closed, CDC and OPM randomly selected participants 811 with in each group (i.e., patients, caregivers, clinicians) from a total of 973 respondents. They also 812 developed a randomly -selected waitlist of participants that they used to fill conversation appointments 813 that were missed or cancelled by participants. The com munity engagement was authorized under the 814 Generic Clearance for the Collection of Qualitative Feedback on Agency Service Delivery (OMB Control 815 Number: 0920 -1050) approval for the Paperwork Reduction Act. CDC and OPM conducted telephone 816 and video conversat ions throughout September 2020 and spoke with 106 individuals, which included 42 817 patients, 21 caregivers, and 43 clinicians. Participating individuals lived and worked all over the United 818 States and had diverse experiences with opioids. Participants provid ed verbal consent for their 819 conversations to be recorded. A transcription service reviewed the conversation recordings to develop 820 anonymized transcripts. CDC and OPM reviewed the anonymized transcripts to develop thematic 821 summaries. 822 CDC and OPM also held two human -centered co -design workshops with staff from CDC and 823 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Workshop topics included framing priority needs for 824 public input, objectives for individual conversations, and synthesizing engagement strategi es based on 825 insights from public comments and conversations with patients, caregivers, and clinicians. Workshop 826 participants included patients, caregivers, clinicians, clinical practice guideline authors, and other subject 827 matter experts. 828 37 CDC also garnered input through oral and written public comment opportunities at and in 829 conjunction with public BSC/NCIPC meetings. These public comment opportunities were announced 830 through Federal Register notices ( Federal Register 84 FR 57021; 30048 ) and partner newsletters. 832 CDC reviewed thematic summaries of public comments, individual conversations, and the 833 workshops to learn more about the values and preferences of patients, caregivers, clinicians, and 834 experts b efore drafting the updated clinical practice guideline. After incorporating observations and 835 comments on the draft clinical practice guideline from the BSC/NCIPC and agency clearance process, 836 CDC will post the revised full draft clinical practice guideline in the Federal Register for public comment. 837 The public comment period is anticipated to be open for 60 days. CDC will review and carefully consider 838 all comments when revising the updated clinical practice guideline. 839 Peer review 840 This clinical practice guideline provides influential scientific information that could have a clear 841 and substantial impact on public - and private -sector decisions. Therefore, peer review of the draft 842 clinical practice guideline is required per the final i nformation quality bulletin for peer review 843 (https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp -content/uploads/2019/04/M -19-15.pdf ). 844 Note: at the time of developing this revision of the draft updated clinical practice guideline, the 845 peer review process is ongoing. This infor mation will be updated once peer review is complete. 846 CDC selected peer reviewers based on scientific and subject -matter expertise, racial/ethnic 847 diversity, diversity of experiences and perspectives, independence from the clinical practice guideline 848 develop ment process, and consideration of conflicts of interest. Specific effort was made to identify 849 subject matter experts with knowledge and experience in topics such as chronic and acute pain 850 management; clinical practice; health equity; mental -pharmacological 852 38 pain management; and surgical pain management. CDC assessed potential conflicts of interest with the 853 same conflict of interest di sclosure form used for selection of BSC/NCIPC OWG members. Conflict of 854 interest forms will be reviewed by the NCIPC Associate Director for Science and confirmed by SBIU 855 before finalizing selection. Any disclosures of the peer reviewers will be reported in the final published 856 clinical practice guideline. After the peer reviewers have completed their reviews, CDC will post the 857 names of peer reviewers on the CDC and the NCIPC Peer Review Agenda websites that are used to 858 provide information about the peer revie w of influential government scientific documents. Peer 859 reviewers will independently review the draft clinical practice guideline to determine the 860 reasonableness and strength of recommendations; the clarity with which scientific uncertainties were 861 clearly i dentified; and the rationale, importance, clarity, and ease of implementation of the 862 recommendations. CDC will review and carefully consider peer review comments when revising the 863 draft clinical practice guideline. 864 865 Summary of findings for clinical questio ns 866 Opioids for chronic pain 867 The AHRQ systematic clinical evidence review on opioids for chronic pain (Chou et al., April 868 2020) updated the 2014 AHRQ report (Chou et al., September 2014) and 2016 CDC update (Dowell et al., 869 2016) and expanded upon the prior reviews by adding evidence from randomized trials reporting short - 870 term outcomes, including tramadol as an opioid intervention, addressing risks of co -prescribing 871 benzodiazepines or gabapentin, and addressing effects of co -use of cannabis. 872 Effectiveness (benefits and harms) 873 For short -term (1 to <6 month) outcomes, based on over 70 placebo -controlled trials (evidence 874 type 1), opioids were associated with beneficial effects versus placebo, but mean differences were 875 39 small: for pa in, <1 point on a 0 to 10 scale and for function, a SMD of 0.22 (or <1 point on the 0 to 10 876 Brief Pain Inventory [BPI]) (Cleeland & Ryan, 1994) interference scale and <1 point on the 0 to 24 877 Roland -Morris Disability Questionnaire [RDQ]). Opioids were associated with a number of patients 878 needed to treat (NNT) of approximately 6.7 to achieve one additional case of short -term pain relief (e.g., 879 30% improvement in pain). Analyses based on a combi nation of head -to-head (within study) 880 comparisons as well as a meta -regression of placebo -controlled trials indicated an association between 881 higher opioid dose and greater short -term effects on pain which appeared to plateau at around 50 mg 882 morphine equiva lent dose (MME)/day (evidence type 2). Evidence also indicated that effects of opioids 883 dissipate with longer duration of therapy. Opioids were associated with a small mean improvement in 884 short -term sleep quality (evidence type 2) versus placebo and a small mean short -term improvement in 885 Short -Form 36 -item (SF -36) (Ware & Sherbourne, 1992) mental health status (evidence type 1). Effects 886 of opioids on short -term outcomes were generally consistent across opioid types (opioid agonist, partial 887 agonist, or mi xed medication agent). Effects on pain were somewhat greater for neuropathic than 888 musculoskeletal pain (effects on pain about 0.5 point greater for neuropathic versus musculoskeletal 889 pain on a 0 to 10 scale). Use of a crossover or enriched enrollment rando mized withdrawal (EERW) 890 design ( a type of trial in which potential participants receive the study drug for a period of time in a 891 prerandomization phase, and only those who benefit from the drug and can tolerate the side effects 892 continue in the trial, rando mly assigned to continue on the study drug or [Furlan, Chaparro, 893 Irvin, & Mailis -Gagnon, 2011] ) was associated with greater effects on pain than parallel group or non - 894 EERW studies. 895 Opioids were associated with increased risk versus placebo of discontinuation due to adverse 896 events (number of patients treated to cause one adverse event [number needed to harm, NNH 10], and 897 increased risk of gastrointestinal events [NNH 7.1 for nausea, 14.3 for vomiting, and 7.1 for 898 constipation], ty pe 1). 899 40 There were few serious adverse events and no difference between opioids versus placebo in risk in the 900 short -term trials (evidence type 2), but serious adverse events were not well -defined by the trials, the 901 trials excluded higher risk patients (e.g. , those with history of substance use disorder), and the trials 902 were not designed to assess serious but less common harms such as overdose, opioid use disorder 903 mortality, cardiovascular events, and fractures. EERW studies tended to report lower risk with o pioids of 904 discontinuation due to adverse events and gastrointestinal adverse events than non -EERW studies. 905 Uncontrolled studies (studies without a non -opioid control group) were not included in the AHRQ 906 review, though a recent systematic review with such s tudies found that rates of misuse ranged from 21 907 to 29% (range, 95% confidence interval [CI], 13 to 38%) and rates of addiction ranged from 8 to 908 12%(range, 95% CI, 3 to 17%), based on higher quality observational evidence (Vowles et al., 2015) . 909 As in the 2014 AHRQ report and 2016 CDC update, the clinical evidence review identified no 910 long -term (>1 year) randomize d controlled trials (RCTs) of opioid therapy versus placebo. One new 911 cohort study found long -term opioid therapy was not associated with improved pain, function or other 912 outcomes versus no opioids (Veiga et al., 2019) . New observational studies included in the new AHRQ 913 review were consistent with the 2014 AHRQ report in finding an association between use of prescription 914 opioids and risk of addiction, overdose, fractures, falls, and cardiovascular events (evidence type 3); a 915 new study also found an association between opioid use and risk of all -cause mortality (Ray, Chung, 916 Murray, Hall, & Stein, 2016) (evidence type 4). New observational studies were also consis tent with the 917 2014 AHRQ report in finding associations between higher doses of opioids and risks of overdose, 918 addiction, and endocrinological adverse events; new studies also found an association between higher 919 dose and increased risk of incident or refrac tory depression (Scherrer, Salas, Copeland, et al., 2016; 920 Scherrer, Salas, Sullivan, et al., 2016) . Observational studies also indicated an association between co - 921 prescription of gabapentinoids (Gomes et al., 2018; 2018) or benzodiazepines (Dunn et al., 2010; Hernandez, He, Brooks, & Zhang, 2018; E. C. Sun et al., 923 41 2017) and increased risk of overdose, with most pronounced risk occurring soon after init iation of these 924 medications (evidence type 3). All observational studies were susceptible to residual confounding. 925 There were no differences across 16 trials between opioids versus nonopioids (most commonly, 926 NSAIDs, gabapentinoids, and nortriptyline) in sh ort-term pain, function, health status/quality of life, 927 sleep quality, or mental health outcomes (evidence type 1 for function and 2 for other outcomes), 928 though opioids were associated with increased risk of short -term adverse effects (evidence type 1 or 2 ). 929 Most trials were <6 months; one trial of patients with chronic low back pain or pain associated with 930 osteoarthritis (mean pain intensity 5.4 on a 0 to 10 scale at baseline) evaluated outcomes at 1 year (E. E. 931 Krebs et al., 2018) . It found no differences between stepped therapy with opioi ds versus stepped 932 therapy starting with nonopioids in function, sleep, or mental health outcomes; opioids were associated 933 with slightly worse effects (by ~0.5 point on a 0 to 10 scale) on pain (evidence type 2). Although 934 tramadol was an option in step 3 of the nonopioid stepped therapy arm, only 11% received tramadol; 935 mean opioid doses for stepped opioid therapy and stepped therapy starting with nonopioids were 26 vs. 936 1 MME/day, respectively, at 12 months. 937 There were also no differences between combination therapy versus a nonopioid alone in short - 938 term effectiveness but increased risk of short -term adverse effects for combination therapy, based on 939 six trials (evidence type 3). Combination therapy was associated with a small (5 to 13 MME/day) opioid - 940 sparing e ffect versus opioid therapy alone, with little effect on pain. All trials of combination therapy 941 evaluated patients with neuropathic pain and primarily evaluated gabapentinoids or nortriptyline. 942 Evidence on long -term effects of combination therapy versus a n opioid or nonopioid alone was lacking. 943 Opioid dosing strategies 944 Evidence on the effectiveness of different opioid dosing strategies remains very limited. One 945 trial included in the 2014 AHRQ report found no differences between a more liberal dose escalati on 946 42 strategy versus maintenance of current doses in pain, function, or discontinuation due to opioid misuse, 947 but the difference in opioid doses between arms was small (52 vs. 40 mg MMD/day) (Naliboff et al., 948 2011) (evidence type 3). There were no clear differences between short - versus long -acting opioids 949 (evidence type 3) or between different long -acting opioids (evidence type 2) in pain or function, but in 950 most trials, doses were titrated to achieve adequate pain control. Evidence on comparative risks of 951 methadone versus other opio ids and risk of overdose remains limited and inconsistent. Evidence on the 952 benefits and harms of different methods for initiating and titrating opioids, scheduled and continuous 953 versus as -needed dosing of opioids, use of opioid rotation, and methods for ti trating or discontinuing 954 patients off opioids remains insufficient. The 2014 AHRQ report found buccal or intranasal fentanyl 955 more effective than placebo or oral opioids for treatment of exacerbations of chronic pain, based on 956 immediate effects (up to 2 hou rs after administration). None of the trials of buccal or intranasal fentanyl 957 were designed to assess longer -term benefits or harms, and no new trials were identified for the 2020 958 systematic review. In 2007, the U.S. FDA released a public health advisory d ue to case reports of deaths 959 and other life -threatening adverse effects in patients prescribed buccal fentanyl (U.S. Food and Drug 960 Administration, 2007) . 961 Risk mitigation strategies 962 New evidence on the accuracy of risk prediction instruments was consistent with the 2014 963 AHRQ report, which found highly inconsistent estimates of diagnostic accuracy, methodological 964 limitations and few studies of risk assessment instruments other than the Opioid Risk Tool (L. R. Webster 965 & Webster, 2005) and Screening and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain -Revised instrument 966 (Butler, Fernandez, Benoit, Budman, & Jamison, 2008) (evidence type 3). Evidence on the effectiveness 967 of risk miti gation strategies also remains very limited. One new observational study found provision of 968 naloxone to patients prescribed opioids in primary care clinics was associated with decreased likelihood 969 of emergency department visits, but no difference in overdo se risk (evidence type 3) (Coffin et al., 970 43 2016) . Evidence on opioid tapering was largely limited to a trial that found a taper support intervention 971 associated with better functional outcomes and a trend towards lower opioid doses versus usual opioid 972 care (Sullivan et al., 2017) (evidence type 2). A cohort study found discontinuation of opioid therapy was 973 associated with increased risk of overdose mortality versus continuation, but there was no statistically 974 significant differenc e in risk of all -cause mortality (James et al., 2019) . Findings should be interpreted 975 with caution, because of potential confounding related to the reason for discontinuation. 976 No trial compared different rates of opioid tapering, though one observational study found an 977 association between longer time to opioid discontinuation in patients on long -term, high -dose opioid 978 therapy and decreased risk of opioid -related emergency depart ment visit or hospitalization (Mark & 979 Parish, 2019) (evidence type 3). The review did not identify any study that evaluated the effectiveness of 980 risk mitigation strategies, such as use of risk assessment instruments, opioid management plans, patient 981 education, urine drug screening, PDMP data review, monitoring instruments in patients prescribed 982 opioids , more frequent monitoring intervals, pill counts, abuse -deterrent formulations, or avoidance of 983 co-prescribing of benzodiaze pines on risk of overdose, addiction, abuse or misuse. 984 Evidence on the effectiveness of interventions for opioid use disorder in patients with 985 prescription opioid dependence or opioid use disorder was highly limited due to methodological 986 shortcomings (smal l sample sizes, high attrition or crossover) and/or exclusion of patients with chronic 987 pain. 988 Noninvasive nonpharmacologic treatment for chronic pain 989 The AHRQ systematic clinical evidence review (Skelly et al., April 2020) focused on commonly 990 encountered pain conditions and frequently us ed interventions; selection of conditions for review was 991 informed by stakeholder input. 992 Benefits 993 44 Chronic low back pain : The review found psychological therapies associated with small 994 improvements versus usual care or an attention control for function and pain at short -, intermediate -, 995 and long -term follow -up (evidence type 2). Exercise, low -level laser therapy, spinal manipulation, 996 massage, yoga, acupuncture, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation were associated with improvements in 997 function at short and/or intermediate term follow -up versus usual care, placebo, wait list, or inactive 998 therapies; effects on pain were small for all therapies except yoga, for which benefits were moderate 999 (evidence type 2 at short term for exercise, massage, and yog a; evidence type 3 for others). Massage, 1000 mindfulness -based stress reduction, acupuncture, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation were associated 1001 with small short -term improvement in pain versus control (evidence type 2); exercise, low -level laser 1002 therapy, an d yoga were also associated with small to moderate short -term improvement in pain, though 1003 evidence was not as strong (evidence type 3). At intermediate term, spinal manipulation, yoga, 1004 multidisciplinary rehabilitation (evidence type 2) and exercise and min dfulness -based stress reduction 1005 (evidence type 3) were associated with improved pain versus sham, usual care, or attention control; 1006 effects were small for all therapies except for yoga, for which effects were moderate. Compared with 1007 exercise, multidiscipli nary rehabilitation was associated with small improvements in function and pain at 1008 short and intermediate terms (evidence type 2). 1009 Chronic neck pain : The AHRQ systematic clinical evidence review found low -level laser therapy 1010 (evidence type 2) and massage ( evidence type 3) associated with improved short -term function and pain 1011 for chronic neck pain. The magnitude of effect was moderate for low -level laser therapy and small for 1012 massage. Exercise was associated with small improvement in long -term function versu s attention 1013 control (evidence type 3) and combination exercise was associated with improved short - and long -term 1014 function and short -term pain versus wait list or attention control (evidence type 3). Acupuncture was 1015 associated with small improvements in sho rt- and intermediate -term function versus sham, placebo, or 1016 usual care, but there were no differences in pain versus sham acupuncture, an intervention meant to 1017 45 mimic acupuncture but without acupuncture effects (e.g., needles into non -acupuncture point, or non- 1018 penetrating needles/pressure on acupuncture points) (evidence type 3). Pilates was associated with 1019 improved short -term function (small effect) and pain (large effect) versus acetaminophen (evidence type 1020 3). 1021 Osteoarthritis pain : The AHRQ systematic clin ical evidence review found that for knee 1022 osteoarthritis, exercise was associated with small improvements in short - and long -term function and 1023 pain versus usual care, no treatment, or sham (evidence type 2 for short -term and type 3 for long -term), 1024 and moder ate improvement in intermediate -term pain and function (evidence type 3). For hip 1025 osteoarthritis, exercise was associated with small improvement in short -term function and pain versus 1026 usual care (evidence type 3). Functional improvement persisted at interm ediate -term follow -up, but 1027 pain improvement did not (evidence type 3). 1028 Fibromyalgia : The AHRQ systematic clinical evidence review found exercise, mind -body 1029 practices, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation, and acupuncture associated with small improvement in 1030 short -term function versus usual care or inactive treatments for fibromyalgia (evidence type 2 for 1031 acupuncture and evidence type 3 for others). At intermediate term, exercise, acupuncture, cognitive - 1032 behavioral therapy ( CBT), mindfulness -based stress red uction, myofascial release, and multidisciplinary 1033 rehabilitation were associated with improvements in function versus inactive treatments, usual care, or 1034 waitlist (evidence type 2 for exercise and acupuncture and evidence type 3 for others). Effects on 1035 intermediate -term function were moderate for CBT and small for the other therapies. At long term, 1036 multidisciplinary rehabilitation was associated with persistent small improvement in function versus 1037 usual care, but not for pain (evidence type 3). Tai chi was associated with small improvement in function 1038 versus exercise at short - to intermediate -term follow -up (evidence type 3). Therapies associated with 1039 improved pain versus usual care, waitlist, no treatment, or inactive treatments were exercise (small 1040 effect, short and intermediate term; evidence type 2), CBT (small, short -term; evidence type 3), 1041 46 mindfulness practices (small, intermediate -term; evidence type 3), and multidisciplinary rehabilitation 1042 (small, intermediate -term; evidence type 3). 1043 Chronic tension headache : The AHRQ systematic clinical evidence review found spinal 1044 manipulation was associated with moderate improvement in short -term pain and small improvement in 1045 function versus usual care for chronic tension headache (evidence type 3). For other inter ventions, 1046 evidence was sparse, and the majority of trials had serious methodological limitations. 1047 Harms 1048 Across conditions, data on harms of nonpharmacological therapies was limited, but no evidence 1049 suggested serious harms. Although reporting on harms was s uboptimal, among studies that reported 1050 data, non -serious treatment -related adverse events (e.g., discomfort, soreness, bruising, increased pain, 1051 and worsening of symptoms) were infrequently reported, there were few withdrawals from 1052 nonpharmacological thera pies due to adverse events, and there were no differences between 1053 comparison groups (either usual care/no nonpharmacological therapy or another therapy ) in the 1054 frequency of intervention -related adverse events or withdrawals (evidence type 2 or 3). 1055 Nonopioi d pharmacologic treatments for chronic pain 1056 Benefits 1057 For neuropathic pain, the AHRQ systematic clinical evidence review (McDonagh et April found anticonvulsants ( pregabalin, and oxcarbazepine) were associated with small 1059 short -term improvement in pain versus placebo (evidence type 2), with no difference between 1060 pregabalin versus ga bapentin enacarbil (evidence type 3) . The antidepressant duloxetine was associated 1061 with small improvements in short -term pain, function, and quality of life versus placebo in patients with 1062 diabetic peripheral neuropathy (evidence type 2 for pain and quality of life and type 3 for function). 1063 47 Tetra hydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) oral spray had inconsistent effects on pain in 1064 patients with multiple sclerosis or with allodynia (evidence type 3). Topical capsaicin was not associated 1065 with significant effects on pain versus placebo, or effect s were below the threshold for a small effect 1066 (evidence type 2). 1067 For were associated with small, short - and intermediate -term improvements i n 1069 pain and quality of life versus placebo; a small beneficial effect on function was only observed at short - 1070 term (evidence type 2). The anticonvulsants pregabalin and gabapentin were associated with small 1071 short -term improvements in pain and function versus placebo; there were no effects on quality of life 1072 (evidence type 2). Memantine was associated with moderate intermediate -term improvements in pain, 1073 function, and quality of life versus placebo (evidence type 3). 1074 For osteoarthritis, NSAIDs were associated with small short -term improvement in pain (evidence 1075 type 2) and function (evidence type 1). Topical diclofenac was associated with small improvement in 1076 short -term pain (evidence type 2) and function (evidence type 3) versus placebo. Duloxetine was 1077 associa ted with small improvement in pain severity, function and quality of life; and moderate 1078 improvement in likelihood of a pain response (evidence type 1). Acetaminophen was not associated 1079 with improvement in pain or function versus placebo (evidence type 3). 1080 For inflammatory arthritis, NSAIDs were associated with small improvements in short -term pain 1081 and function versus placebo (evidence type 2); effects on pain and function were small at intermediate - 1082 term follow -up (evidence type 3). At long -term follow -up ef fects on pain were large, with no effects on 1083 function (evidence type 3). 1084 48 For low back pain, duloxetine was associated with a small short -term improvement in pain 1085 intensity and likelihood of a pain response versus placebo, but improvements in function and q uality of 1086 life did not meet the threshold for small improvement (evidence type 2). 1087 Harms 1088 Across all classes of nonopioid therapies, the AHRQ systematic clinical evidence review found 1089 that the incidence of serious adverse events (SAE) was low; however, the trials were not designed to 1090 assess SAEs and there were few SAEs (evidence type 3). 1091 Antidepressants were associated with increased risk of withdrawal due to adverse events (WAE) 1092 versus placebo. SNRI antidepressants were associated with moderate to large increases in risk of nausea 1093 and excessive sweating (evidence type 2 or 3). Duloxetine was associated with a large, dose -dependent, 1094 increase in sedation versus placebo (evidence type 2 or 3). 1095 With regard to anticonvulsants, oxcarbazepine was associated with a large increase in risk of 1096 WAEs versus placebo (evidence type 2). Pregabalin and ga bapentin were associated with moderate 1097 increased risk of WAEs (evidence type 2), with an association between higher doses of pregabalin and 1098 increased risk. Pregabalin and gabapentin were associated with large increases in blurred vision, 1099 dizziness, weight gain, and cognitive effects (e.g., confusion) (evidence type 2). Additionally, pregabalin 1100 was associated with large increases in risk of peripheral edema and sedation (evidence type 2). 1101 NSAIDs were associated with increased risk of WAEs versus placebo; the magnitude was small 1102 for ibuprofen and diclofenac and moderate for naproxen (evidence type 2). The risk of any 1103 cardiovascular event was not significantly elevated for NSAIDs as a group, but diclofenac was associated 1104 with small increase in risk, particularl y in the first 6 months, and with higher doses (evidence type 2). 1105 Versus placebo, the risk of major coronary events was elevated with diclofenac and celecoxib (moderate 1106 effect) and with ibuprofen (large effect). For every 3000 patients treated with diclofe nac or celecoxib, 1107 49 there were an estimated 3 additional major coronary events. There was no difference in cardiovascular 1108 events between celecoxib versus nonselective NSAIDs in the intermediate or long term (evidence type 1109 2). The risk of serious upper gastro intestinal events was increased with diclofenac (moderate effect) and 1110 ibuprofen or naproxen (large increase), particularly in the first 6 months of treatment (evidence type 1 1111 to 2). In the intermediate term, diclofenac and naproxen were associated with lar ge increase in risk of 1112 hepatic harms (evidence type 1 to 2). 1113 Acetaminophen was not associated with increased risk of short - or intermediate -term WAEs 1114 versus placebo (evidence type 3). Capsaicin was associated with large increase in risk of application site 1115 pain (evidence type 2) and a small increased risk of erythema (evidence type 3). Cannabis as oral 1116 dronabinol solution was associated with large increase in risk of dizziness, and as 1117 tetrahydrocannabinol/cannabidiol was associated with large increase in ri sk of WAEs, dizziness, and 1118 nausea (evidence type 3). 1119 Treatments for acute pain 1120 The AHRQ systematic clinical evidence review (Chou et al., December 2020) found that most 1121 trials of treatments for acute pain focused on effects on pain at short -term (up to 1 week) follow -up. 1122 Evidence was somewhat stronger for pharmacological than nonpharmacological therapies. 1123 For acute surgical dental pain (evidence type 3) a nd kidney stone pain (evidence type 2), the 1124 AHRQ systematic clinical evidence review found that opioids were associated with small to moderate 1125 increases in pain or need for rescue medication use versus NSAIDs. Findings for postoperative pain were 1126 somewhat inconsistent. Although opioids were associated with increased likelihood of repeat or rescue 1127 medication use at 1 day to 1 week (evidence type 3), evidence on pain intensity was insufficient due to 1128 inconsistency. Results for postoperative pain were based on a small number of trials and pain related to 1129 a limited set of surgical procedures (most commonly cesarean section, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) 1130 50 reconstruction, knee arthroplasty, other surgical 1131 proced ures. Opioids were associated with increased risk of adverse events such as nausea, dizziness, 1132 and sedation versus nonopioid pharmacologic therapies (evidence type 2 or 3). The trials were not 1133 designed to assess SAEs, and few such events were reported. Evi dence on opioids versus acetaminophen 1134 was somewhat mixed: for dental pain, the systematic clinical evidence review found opioids were 1135 associated with small improvement in pain outcomes on some measures (evidence type 2), but for 1136 kidney stone pain, opioids were associated with small increase in pain (evidence type 2). Evidence on 1137 NSAIDs versus acetaminophen was also somewhat mixed: for dental pain, evidence indicated that 1138 NSAIDs were associated with moderate to large decrease in pain (evidence type 2), but f or kidney stone 1139 pain, evidence was insufficient. Evidence on nonopioid pharmacologic therapies other than NSAIDs or 1140 acetaminophen was very limited. 1141 Evidence on nonpharmacological therapies for acute pain was limited. For low back pain, the 1142 AHRQ systematic clinical evidence review found heat therapy was associated with a moderate decrease 1143 in pain versus usual care or placebo at 1 day to <1 week and at 2 to <4 weeks (evidence type 2 to 3). 1144 There may be no difference between spinal manipulation versus inactive controls for non -radicular low 1145 back pain (evidence type 2 to 3), though one trial of patients with radiculopathy found manipulation was 1146 associated with increased likelihood of improvement in pain at 2 to <4 weeks, and at 4 weeks 1147 (evidence type 3) (Santilli, Beghi, & Finucci, 2006) . Acupuncture was associated with moderate 1148 improvement in pain and function versus an NSAID for low back pain, but findings wer e based on one 1149 trial that evaluated one session of acupuncture and a single dose of an NSAID (evidence type 3) (Shin et 1150 al., 2013) . For postoperative pain, there was type 3 evidence that massage might have some 1151 effectiveness, with likely no difference between cold therapy versus no cold therapy, with the possible 1152 exception of decreased pain medication use at <1 week. The re was also limited evidence supporting 1153 effectiveness of acupressure for acute musculoskeletal pain (evidence type 3). Reporting of harms for 1154 51 nonpharmacologic therapies was suboptimal. However, the noninvasive nonpharmacologic therapies 1155 evaluated in the AH RQ systematic clinical evidence review were generally not thought to be associated 1156 with serious harms, and harms were few when reported. 1157 Trials of opioid therapy for acute pain were not designed to evaluate effects on long -term use of 1158 opioids or outcomes s uch as misuse or development of opioid use disorder. Limited evidence from 1159 observational studies found being prescribed an opioid for acute low back pain or after minor or elective 1160 surgical procedures was associated with increased likelihood of opioid use at longer term (e.g., 6 months 1161 or 1 year) follow -up (evidence type 3). Evidence on factors associated with opioid prescribing in patients 1162 with acute pain conditions was very limited, and suggested that legislation mandating use of 1163 prescription drug monitor ing program data prior to prescribing was not associated with decreases in 1164 opioid prescribing for low back pain or postoperative pain. No studies were identified that evaluated the 1165 accuracy or effectiveness of risk assessment instruments to inform use of o pioids for acute pain. 1166 Treatments for acute episodic migraine 1167 The AHRQ review on treatments for acute episodic migraine (Halker Singh et al., December 1168 2020) found limited evidence on the benefits and harms of opioids. It found that opioids might be 1169 associated with decreased pain versus placebo, but worse pain outcomes versus nonopioid 1170 pharmacological therapy (evidence type 3). Most outcomes were assessed at short -term (2 hours or 1 1171 day) follow -up. Opioids were associated with increased risk of adverse events, though evidence on 1172 serious adverse events was lacking. There were no studies on instruments for predicting opioid misuse, 1173 opioid use di sorder, or overdose, or risk mitigation strategies in patients prescribed opioids for migraine. 1174 The AHRQ review found stronger (type 1 or 2) evidence supporting the effectiveness of several 1175 established nonopioid pharmacological therapies for improving pain resolution in episodic 1176 migraine, including triptans, NSAIDs, dihydroergotamine, and ergotamine plus caffeine. Evidence also 1177 52 favored antiemetics versus placebo or no antiemetic but was more limited (evidence type 3). Newer 1178 treatments (calcitonin gene -related peptide receptor 1179 antagonist lasmiditan) were associated with reduced pain and improved function versus placebo 1180 (evidence type 2 or 3). However, lasmiditan was associated with increased risk of severe adv erse events 1181 (most commonly, dizziness; evidence type 3); evidence on serious adverse events of CGRP antagonists 1182 was insufficient. 1183 Evidence on nonpharmacological therapy for acute episodic migraine was sparse. There was 1184 moderate evidence (evidence type 2) s upporting remote electrical neuromodulation. More limited 1185 evidence (evidence type 3) supported acupuncture, chamomile oil, external trigeminal nerve 1186 stimulation, and eye movement desensitization reprocessing. There was insufficient evidence to 1187 determine ri sk of serious adverse events with nonpharmacological therapies for acute episodic 1188 migraine. 1189 Contextual evidence 1190 Patient and preferences 1191 Opioids for chronic pain 1192 A Contextual Evidence Review conducted for the 2016 CDC Guideline (Dowell et al., 2016) found 1193 data indicating that physicians frequently lacked confidence in their ability to safely prescribe opioids, 1194 predict or identify prescription medication misuse or opioid use disorder, or discuss these issues with 1195 their patients. Clinicians reported fa vorable beliefs and attitudes about effects of opioids on pain and 1196 quality of life; however, they also had concerns about risk of opioid use disorder and overdose , yet did 1197 not consistently utilize risk mitigation strategies (e.g., use of PDMP data, urine t oxicology testing, and/or 1198 opioid treatment agreements). Evidence on patient values and preferences was limited but indicated 1199 53 unfamiliarity with some terms (\"opioids\"), more familiarity with the term \"narcotics\" but an association 1200 between \"narcotics\" and \"a ddiction\" or \"abuse,\" and concerns about addiction and abuse. Side effects 1201 such as nausea, constipation, and somnolence (rather than pain relief) accounted for most of the 1202 variation in patient preferences regarding use of opioids. Patients prescribed high dose opioids reported 1203 reliance on opioids, and ambivalence or uncertainty about benefits and side effects. 1204 The AHRQ review identified some new information on preferences and values. A survey of 961 1205 clinicians found that 82% were reluctant to prescribe opi oids and less than half (47%) expressed 1206 confidence in caring for patients with chronic noncancer pain (Ebbert et al., 2018) . Sixty -seven percent 1207 were aware of the 2016 CDC guideli ne and 55% were enrolled in the state PDMP; 2% always or 1208 frequently prescribed naloxone to patients on opioids, although results are difficult to interpret as the 1209 study did not specify whether patients met 2016 CDC Guideline criteria for naloxone. Guidelin e 1210 awareness was associated with increased confidence in caring for patients with chronic pain. Other 1211 surveys found negative attitudes or concerns regarding prescription opioid use disorder, but beliefs in 1212 potential effectiveness of opioids for treating pai n and support for policies and guidelines aimed at 1213 mitigating risks, with increased confidence when following \"best practices\" (Kennedy -Hendricks et al., 1214 Ebbert, 2019) . 1215 Regar ding patient preferences and values, a new systematic review found that among various 1216 opioid -related outcomes (effects), patients ranked pain relief, nausea, and vomiting as most important, 1217 followed by constipation (Goshua et al., 2018) . \"Addiction\" was only evaluated in t wo studies and rated 1218 as less important than pain relief. An online (non -peer reviewed) survey of over 3000 patients 1 year 1219 after the release of the 2016 CDC Guideline found that 84% reported more pain and worse quality of life 1220 and 42% said they had conside red suicide; however, the survey did not attempt to sample patients with 1221 chronic pain using a rigorous methodological approach (Pain News Network, 2017) . 1222 54 Noninvasive nonpharmacological treatments for chronic pain 1223 The Contextual Evidence Review found that evidence on patient values and preferences related 1224 to noninvasive nonpharmacologic al treatments for chronic pain was limited. A Gallup poll found that 1225 78% of Americans preferred nonpharmacological therapies (e.g., physical therapy and chiropractic care) 1226 to address pain over prescribed pain medication (Rosenberg et al., 2008) . Another survey indicated 1227 frequent use of complementary and integrative therapies for chronic pain (Francois, Lanier, Marich, 1228 Wallendorf, & Van Dillen, 2018) . 1229 Clinicians generally agreed with use of guideline -supported therapies and therapies supported 1230 by evidence, including nonpharmacological therapies; clinicians also felt that treatments should be 1231 credible and individualized to the patient (Cottrell, Foster, Porcheret, Rathod, & Roddy, 2017; concerns regarding nonpharmacological treatments included costs and safety 1233 (Cottrell e t al., 2017) . Surveys indicated high support for use of exercise therapy, complementary 1234 medicine therapies, and psychological therapies (Cottrell, Roddy, & Foster, 2010; Cowell et al., 2018; 1235 Driver, Kean, Oprescu, & Lovell, 2017) ; clinicians also supported chronic pain management informed by 1236 a biopsychosocial framework or using a multidimensional approach (Holden, Nicholls, Young, Hay, & 1237 Foster, 2009) . Some barriers to use of therapies included lack of knowledge or expertise and uncertainty 1238 regarding potential benefits (Cottrell et al., 2010; Cowell et al., 2018; Dima et al., 2013; et al., Tan, 2007) . treatments for chronic pain 1241 The Contextual Evidence Review found limited evidence on clinician and patient values and 1242 preferences related to nonopioid pharmacological treatments. Evidence described variability in patient 1243 preferences regarding nonopioid pharmacological treatments, int erest in medical cannabis, cost as an 1244 important consideration, high priority on pain reduction as well as side effects and harms (including risk 1245 55 of OUD), and high value for having alternatives to opioids (M\u00fchlbacher et al., 2015; Patel et al., 2016; 1246 Turk et al., 2020) . A survey of pharmacists in Canada found that 38% agreed that non -prescription 1247 analgesics should be first line for chronic low back pain and 79% agreed that tricyclic antidepressants a re 1248 effective for peripheral diabetic neuropathy (R. C. Wielage, Bansal, Andrews, Klein, & Happich, 2013) . 1249 Treatments for acute pain 1250 The Contextual Evidence Review found limited evidence suggesting variability in patient values 1251 and preferences regarding treatments for acute pain (Fullen et al., 2008; Hallway et al., 2019) , with 1252 some evidence of high satisfaction when postoperative pain was managed using an opioid -sparing 1253 pathway (Swenson, Prashar, Mangino, Thode, . There was also variability in clinician 1254 values and prefere nces regarding acute pain treatments that were impacted by clinical specialty, 1255 knowledge regarding effectiveness, and costs; negative attitudes towards acute pain conditions were 1256 associated with less likelihood of using or re (Cherkin, -Bitensky, 1258 Rossignol, & Dumas, 2005) . A systematic review found inconsistent evidence that education increased 1259 clinician adherence with acute low back pain guideline recommendations in terms of referral rates to 1260 physiotherapy (C. C. Lin et al., 2018) . 1261 Treatments for acute episodic migraine 1262 The Contextual Evidence Review found very limited evidence on clinician and patient values and 1263 preferences related to treatments for acute episodic migraine. One survey found that patients with 1264 headaches (primarily episodic or chronic migraine) prioritized efficacy of treatment over the safety or 1265 route of administration and preferred oral over parenteral medications (Adelman & Belsey, 2003) . A 1266 survey of Canadian pharmacists found that 42% agreed that migraine patients should try non - 1267 56 prescription prior to p rescription medications and 53% agreed that triptans should be reserved until 1268 failure of at least two other prescription medications (R. C. Wielage et al., 2013) . 1269 Costs and cost -effectiveness 1270 Opioid therapy for chronic pain 1271 The Contextual Evidence Review conducted for the 2016 CDC Guideline estimated (based on 1272 studies published after 2010) yearly direct and indirect costs related to prescription opioids at $53.4 1273 billion for nonmedical use of prescription opioids; $55.7 billio n for abuse, dependence (i.e., opioid use 1274 disorder), and misuse of prescription opioid Sullivan, 2011; Inocencio, Carroll, Read, & Holdford, 1276 2013). In 2012, total expenses fo r outpatient prescription opioids were estimated at $9.0 billion, an 1277 increase of 120% from 2002 (Stagnitti, 2001) . Based on a large national sample of 2008 claims data, 1278 direct costs of opioids in patients with osteoarthritis were estimated at $287.4 per patient, but there 1279 was wide variability in estimates (SD $1,652.1) (Gore, Tai, Sadosky, Leslie, & Stacey, 2012) . One study 1280 estimated costs of urine toxicology testing (including screening and confirmatory tests) at $211 to $363 1281 per test (Laffer et al., 2011) . 1282 The AHRQ report included data that estimated the total economic burden of fatal overdose, 1283 abuse, and dependence of prescription opioids in 2013 at $78.5 billion, with $28.9 billion related to 1284 increased healthcare and substance u se disorder treatment costs (Florence, Zhou, Luo, & Xu, 2016) . 1285 More recent data indicate that spending on opioid prescriptions peaked at $1.6 billion in 2009, with a 1286 decrease to $1.2 billion in 2016 (Cox, Rae, & Sawyer, 2018) . However, costs of treatment for opioid use 1287 disorder and overdose increased ($646 million in 2009 and $2.6 billion in 2016). Data also indicate that 1288 Medicaid spending on opioids has declined since 2014, though spe nding on buprenorphine (a partial 1289 57 opioid agonist often used to treat opioid use disorder) has increased (Young, 2019) , likely because of 1290 greater numbers of individuals accessing medication and treatment for opioid use disorder (MOUD). 1291 No study was identified that formally evaluated the cost -effectiveness of opioid therapy versus 1292 no opioid therapy or nonopioid pharmacological therapy for noncancer pain. A modeling study that 1293 estimated 80% of opioid overdose deaths to be attributable to i llicit opioids projected that interventions 1294 targeting prescription opioid misuse such as prescription monitoring programs would decrease the 1295 number of opioid overdose deaths by 3.0% to 5.3% (Chen et al., 2019) . There were also no cost - 1296 effectiveness analyses of risk mitigation strategies in persons prescribed opioids for chronic pain. A 1297 systematic review that included 43 economic evaluation studies of treatments for opioi d use disorder 1298 found evidence supporting the cost -effectiveness of methadone therapy, with less evidence for other 1299 opioid use disorder therapies (Murphy & Polsky, 2016) . Additional analyses from the UK and California 1300 also found treatment for opioid use disorder to be cost -effective or cost saving (Kenworthy et al., 2017; 1301 et a l., . nonpharmacological treatments for chronic pain 1303 The Contextual Evidence Review found that for nonpharmacological treatments covered by 1304 commercial insurers, out -of-pocket costs ranged from $25 to $60 per visit ($150 to $720 for a 6 - to 12 - 1305 visit course of therapy) (Heyward et al., 2018) . Studies found that a number of nonpharmacologic 1306 therapies were cost -effective for various chronic pain conditions. F or osteoarthritis, cost -effective 1307 interventions (relative to a comparison such as no therapy or usual care) included exercise, acupuncture, 1308 and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (Center for He alth Information and Analysis, 2015; 1309 Coupe et al., 1311 Williamson, Messier, 2009) . low back pain, cost -effective interventions included interdisciplinary 1312 58 rehabilitation, exercise, yoga, acupuncture, spinal manipulation, cognitive behavioral therapy, 1313 mindfulness based stress reduction, biofeedback , van Tulder, Haines & 1315 Bowles, 2017; Herman et al., 2017; Herman, Lavelle, Sorbero, Hurwitz, & Coulter, 2019; C. W. Haas, 1316 Tulder, 2011; Suni et al., 2018; Tsertsvadze et al., 2014) . For neck pain, cost - 1317 effective interventions included manual therap y, physiotherapy, acupuncture, exercise, and spinal 1318 manipulative therapy (Essex et al., 2017; Herman et al., 2019; Miyamoto, Lin, Cabr al, van Dongen, & van 1319 Tulder, 2019; R. L. Robinson & Jones, 2006; van der Velde et al., 2016; Willich et al., 2006) . For 1320 fibromyalgia, cost -effectiveness analyses of no npharmacological therapies was very limited (Luciano et 1321 al., 2014) , but some evidence suggested that cognitive behavioral therapy dominated (associated with 1322 cost savings and greater benefits) pharmacological therapy or usual care (Hsiao & Fraenkel, 2019) . 1323 Nonopioid pharmacologic treatments for chronic pain 1324 The Contextual Evidence Review found some evidence indicating that nonopioid 1325 pharmacological therapies are cost -effective for chronic pain. For osteoarthritis and low back pain, there 1326 was some evidence that nonopio id pharmacological Happich, studies also found N SAIDs, duloxetine, and 1329 pregabalin cost -effective versus usual 1335 Liedgens 1337 N. Wu, Chen, Boulanger, Rao, & Zhao, 2011; Zhao et al., 2010) . For fibromyalgia, cost -effective 1338 treatments included duloxetine, pregabalin, and amitriptyline, though analyses of relative cost - 1339 effectiveness among these the rapies were inconsistent (Burke et al., 2012; Gan et al., 2004; Gore, Tai, 1340 Chandran, Zlateva, & Leslie, 2012; Harnett Choy, & Zlateva, 2012; P. 2014; Zhao, Sun, & Watson, 2011) . 1342 Treatments for acute pain 1343 The Contextual Evidence Review found lim ited evidence exercise was cost -effective for acute 1344 low back pain and interdisciplinary rehabilitation cost -effective for low back pain that was identified as 1345 high risk for becoming chronic (Essex et Gatchel, . There was limited evidence that acetaminophen and spinal manipulation were not 1347 cost-effect ive for acute low back pain (the acetaminophen analysis was based on a randomized trial that 1348 found acetaminophen to be ineffective for acute low back pain and the spinal manipulation analysis was 1349 based on a cohort study that found that manipulation for acu te low back pain did not reduce follow -up 1350 visits or days of sick leave for low back pain) (C. C. Lin et al., 2018; Walker, Mertens, Schmidt, & Chenot, 1351 2017) . One cohort study of patients with postsurgical pain found use of long -acting opioids within 30 1352 days associated with greater costs of services ($11,900 vs. $8,400, p<0.0001) (Gold, Strassels, & Hansen, for acute episodic migraine 1355 The Contextual Evidence Review found that studies on costs and cost -effectiveness of 1356 treatments for acute episodic migraine focused almost exclusively on triptans. Triptans were 1357 consistently found to be associated with low costs per pain -free episode and o ther outcomes (e.g., 1358 Healey, 2007; Perfetto, Weis, Subedi, Reeder, 1361 2004) . Triptans were dominant (more effective and less costly) over fixed -dose combination of 1362 ergotamine tartrate plus caffeine (Zhang & Hay, 2005) . 1363 Recommendations 1364 This clinical practice guideline includes 12 recommendations ( Box 1 ) for clinicians who are 1365 prescribing opioids for outpatients aged 18 years with acute (duration <1 month) pain, subacute 1366 (duration of 1 -3 months) pain, or chronic (duration of >3 months) pain outside of sickle cell disease - 1367 related pain management, cancer pain treatment, palliative care, and end -of-life care. Refer to the 1368 earlier section on scope and audience for further details on clinicians and patients and on definitions of 1369 acute, subacute, and chronic pain. In accordance wi th the ACIP adapted GRADE process, CDC based the 1370 recommendations on consideration of clinical evidence, contextual evidence (including benefits and 1371 harms, values and preferences, resource allocation), and expert opinion. Expert input is reflected within 1372 the recommendation rationales. For each recommendation statement, CDC notes the recommendation 1373 category (A or B) and the type of the evidence (1, 2, 3, or 4) supporting the statement (Box 2 ). 1374 Category A recommendations indicate that most patients should receive the recommended 1375 course of action; category B recommendations indicate that different choices will be appropriate for 1376 different patients, requiring clinicians to help patients arrive at a decision consistent with patient values 1377 and preferences and specific clinical situations. Consistent with the ACIP (Ahmed, 2013; Centers for 1378 Disease Control and Prevention, 2018a ) and GRADE process (Balshem et al., 2011) , category A 1379 recommendations were made, even with type 3 and 4 evidence, when there was broad agreement that 1380 the advantages of a clinical action greatl y outweighed the disadvantages based on a consideration of 1381 benefits and harms, values and preferences, and resource allocation. Category B recommendations 1382 61 were made when there was broad agreement that the advantages and disadvantages of a clinical action 1383 were more balanced, but advantages were significant enough to warrant a recommendation. 1384 Recommendations were associated with a range of evidence types, from type 1 to type 4. 1385 In summary, the categorization of recommendations was based on the following asse ssment: 1386 A number of nonpharmacological treatments and a number of nonopioid medications are 1387 associated with improvements in pain and/or function that are reportedly comparable to 1388 improvements associated with opioid use. 1389 There is evidence that several noni nvasive, nonpharmacologic interventions improve chronic 1390 pain and function, with small to moderate effects in specific pain conditions, and are not 1391 associated with serious harms. Compared with medication treatment, for which benefits are 1392 anticipated while p atients are taking the medication but are not usually expected to persist 1393 following completion of treatment (once patients stop taking the medication), several 1394 noninvasive, nonpharmacologic interventions are associated with improvements in pain and/or 1395 func tion that are sustained following SNRI antidepressants, pregabalin/gabapentin, and NSAIDs, are 1397 associated with small to moderate improvements in chronic pain and function. Drug class - 1398 specific adverse events include ser ious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, or renal effects with 1399 NSAIDs and sedation with anticonvulsants. 1400 Opioid therapy is associated with similar or decreased effectiveness for pain and function versus 1401 NSAIDs across several acute pain conditions, with small improvements in short -term (1 to <6 1402 months) pain and function compared with placebo, with increased short -term harms compared 1403 with placebo, and with evidence of attenuated pain reduction over time (between 3 and 6 1404 months versus between 1 and 3 months). Th ere is evidence from observational studies of an 1405 association between opioid use for acute pain and long -term opioid use. Evidence on long -term 1406 62 effectiveness of opioids remains very limited; a long -term (12 months) randomized trial of 1407 stepped therapy for ch ronic musculoskeletal pain found no difference in function and higher 1408 pain intensity after starting with opioid therapy compared to starting with nonopioid therapy. 1409 There is evidence of increased risk of serious harms (including opioid use disorder and ove rdose) 1410 with long -term opioid therapy that appears to increase with increase in opioid dosage, without a 1411 clear threshold below which there is no risk. There is no validated, reliable way to predict which 1412 patients will suffer serious harm from opioid therapy and no reliable way to predict which 1413 patients will benefit from opioid therapy. 1414 It can be very challenging for clinicians and patients to discontinue opioids after extended 1415 periods of continuous opioid use. Tapering or discontinuing opioids in patients who have taken 1416 them long -term can be associated with significant risks (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 1417 2019c) , particularly if opioids are tapered rapidly or pa tients do not receive effective support. 1418 Patients, caregivers, and clinicians responded to CDC with invited input regarding their lived 1419 experiences and perspectives related to pain and pain management options. Key themes 1420 expressed included strained patien t-provider relationships and the need for patients and 1421 providers to make shared decisions, the impact of misapplication of the 2016 CDC Guideline, 1422 inconsistent access to effective pain management solutions, and achieving reduced prescription 1423 opioid use thr ough diverse approaches. 1424 Each of the 12 recommendations is followed by a rationale for the recommendation, with 1425 considerations for implementation noted immediately below the recommendation statement. These 1426 bulleted implementation considerations offer pract ical insights meant to further inform clinician -patient 1427 decision -making for the respective recommendation and are not meant to be rigidly or inflexibly 1428 followed. The recommendations are grouped into four areas for consideration: 1429 Determining whether or not to initiate opioids for pain 1430 63 Opioid selection and dosage 1431 Opioid duration and follow -up 1432 Assessing risk and addressing potential harms of opioid use 1433 In addition, these five guiding principles should broadly inform implementation across 1434 recommendations: 1435 1. Acute, subacute, and chronic pain need to be appropriately and effectively treated independent 1436 of whether opioids are part of a treatment regimen. 1437 2. Recommendations are voluntary and are intended to support, not supplant, individualized, 1438 person -centered care . Flexibility to meet the care needs and the clinical circumstances of a 1439 specific patient are paramount. 1440 3. A multimodal and multidisciplinary approach to pain management attending to the physical 1441 health, behavioral health, long -term services and supports, a nd expected health outcomes and 1442 well-being of each person is critical. 1443 4. Special attention should be given to avoid misapplying this updated clinical practice guideline 1444 beyond its intended use or implementing policies purportedly derived from it that might lead to 1445 unintended consequences for patients. 1446 5. Clinicians, practices, health systems, and payers should vigilantly attend to health inequities, 1447 provide culturally and linguistically appropriate communication (Office of Minority Health, 1448 2021) , including communication that is accessible to persons with disabilities, and ensure access 1449 to an appropriate, affordable, div ersified, coordinated, and effective nonpharmacologic and 1450 pharmacologic pain management regimen for all persons. 1451 Determining whether or not to initiate opioids for pain 1452 64 All patients with pain should receive treatment that provides the greatest benefits rel ative to 1453 risks. See Recommendation 1 for determining whether to initiate opioids for acute pain (i.e., with a 1454 duration of less than one month) and Recommendation 2 for d etermining whether or not to initiate 1455 opioids for subacute (i.e., with a duration of at least one month and less than three months) or chronic 1456 pain (i.e., with a duration of three months or more). 1457 1458 1. Nonopioid therapies are effective for many common types of acute pain. Clinicians should only 1459 consider opioid therapy for acute pain if benefits are anticipated to outweigh risks to the patient 1460 (recommendation category: B, evidence type: 3) . 1461 Implementation considerations : 1462 There is an important role for opioid therapy for acute pain related to severe traumatic injuries 1463 (including crush in juries and burns), invasive surgeries typically associated with moderate to 1464 severe postoperative pain, and other severe acute pain when NSAIDs and other therapies are 1465 contraindicated or likely to be ineffective. 1466 Opioids are not first -line therapy for many common acute pain conditions, including low back 1467 pain, neck pain, pain related to other musculoskeletal injuries (such as sprains, strains, 1468 tendonitis, bursitis), pain related to minor surgeries typically associated with minimal tissue 1469 injury and only mil d postoperative pain (e.g., dental extraction), dental pain, kidney stone pain, 1470 and headaches including episodic migraine. 1471 When diagnosis and severity of acute pain are reasonably assumed to warrant the use of 1472 opioids, clinicians should prescribe immediat e-release opioids (see Recommendation 3) at the 1473 lowest dose to achieve expected effects (see Recommendation 4) and for no longer than the 1474 expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids (see Recommendation 6). 1475 Clinicians should maximize use of nonopioid pharmacologic (e.g., NSAIDs and/or acetaminophen) 1476 and nonpharmacologic (e.g., ice, heat, elevation, rest, immobilization and/or exercise) therapies 1477 as appropriate for the specific condition and continue these therapies as needed once opioids are 1478 discontinued. 1479 Clinicians should prescribe and advise opioid use only as needed (e.g., hydrocodone 5 1480 mg/acetaminophen 325mg, one tablet not more frequently than every 4 hours as needed for 1481 pain) rather than on a scheduled basis (e.g., one tablet every 4 ho urs) and encourage and include 1482 an opioid taper if opioids will be taken around the clock for more than a few days (see 1483 Recommendation 6). 1484 If patients already receiving opioids in a long -term fashion require additional medication for 1485 acute pain, nonopioid medications should be used when possible, and if additional opioids are 1486 65 required (e.g., for superimposed severe acute pain), they should be continued only for the 1487 duration of pain severe enough to require additional opioids, returning to the patient's baseline 1488 opioid dosage as soon as possible, including a taper to baseline dosage if additional opioids were 1489 used around the clock for more than a few days (see Recommendation 6). 1490 Clinicians should ensure that patients are aware of expected benefits of, common and serious 1491 risks of, and alternatives to opioids before starting or continuing opioid therapy and should 1492 involve patients meaningfully in decisions about whether to start opioid therapy. 1493 Supporting Rationale 1494 Evaluation of the patient is critical in order to inform appropriate management. Evaluation can 1495 identify reversible causes of pain and underlying etiologies with potentially serious se quelae that require 1496 urgent action. To guide patient -specific selection of therapy, clinicians should evaluate patients and 1497 establish or confirm the diagnosis. Diagnosis can help identify interventions to reverse, ameliorate, or 1498 prevent worsening of pain an d improve function; for example, surgical intervention to repair structure 1499 and function following certain traumatic injuries, bracing to prevent recurrence of acute ankle sprain, 1500 fracture immobilization, ice or elevation to reduce swelling, and early mobil ization to maintain function 1501 Noninvasive, non pharmacologic approaches have the potential to improve pain and function 1505 without risk of serious harms (Chou et al., December 2020) . The clinical evidence reviews found that 1506 some nonpharmacologic treatments were likely effective for acute pain (e.g., heat therapy will probably 1507 be effective for acute low back pain, spinal manipulation might be effective for acute back pain with 1508 radiculopathy, a cervical collar or exercise might be effective for acute neck pain wit h radiculopathy, 1509 acupressure might be effective for acute musculoskeletal pain, massage might be effective for 1510 postoperative pain (Chou et al., December 2020) , and remote electrical neuromodulation might improve 1511 acute pain related to episodic migraine (Halker Singh et al., December 2020) ). Some nonpharmacologic 1512 66 therapies are relatively low cost and available without a clinician appointment (e.g., heat for low back 1513 pain) (Chou et al., December 2020) . 1514 The American College of Physicians recommends nonpharmacologic treatment with superficial 1515 heat, massage, acupuncture, or spinal manipulation as a cornerstone of treatment for acute low back 1516 pain (Qaseem, Wilt, McLean, & Forciea, 2017) . The American College of Physicians and American 1517 Academy of Family Physicians suggest acupressure to improve pain and function and transcutaneous 1518 electrical nerve stimulation to reduce pain in patients with acute musculoskeletal injuries (Qaseem et 1519 al., 2020) . 1520 Despite evidence supporting thei r use, noninvasive, nonpharmacologic therapies are not always 1521 or fully covered by insurance (Heyward et al., 2018) , and access and cost can be barriers for patients, 1522 particularly for patients who are uninsured, individuals with limited income, and for people with 1523 transportation challenges or living in rural are as. Experts expressed concern about limited access to non - 1524 opioid pain management modalities, in part due to lack of availability or lack of coverage by payers, and 1525 emphasized improving access to non -opioid pain management modalities as a priority. To impro ve pain 1526 management and reduce medication use and associated risks, health insurers and health systems should 1527 increase access to noninvasive, nonpharmacologic therapies with evidence of effectiveness. 1528 Noninvasive, nonpharmacologic approaches should be used as appropriate to alleviate acute pain, 1529 including ice and elevation to reduce swelling and discomfort from musculoskeletal injuries, heat to 1530 alleviate low back pain, and other modalities depending on the cause of the acute pain. 1531 1532 Nonopioid medications for acute pain 1533 Many acute pain conditions can often be managed most effectively with nonopioid medications 1534 (Chou et al., December 2020) . NSAIDs are probably more effective than opioids for surgical dental pain 1535 and f or kidney stone pain and similarly effective to opioids for low back pain (Chou et al., December 1536 2020) . There is limited evidence on comparative effectiveness of therapies for acute neuropathic pain, 1537 67 neck pain, and postoperative pain (Chou et al., December 2020) associated with improved pain 1539 and function with generally mild and transient adverse events (Halker Singh et al., December 2020) . 1540 The American College of Physicians recommends NSAIDs or skeletal muscle relaxants if 1541 pharmacologic treatment is desired to treat low back pain (Qaseem et al., 2017) . For acute 1542 musculoskeletal injuries other than low back pain, the American College of Physicians and American 1543 Academy of Family Physicians recommend to pical NSAIDs with or without menthol gel as first -line 1544 therapy and suggest oral NSAIDs to improve function, or oral acetaminophen to reduce pain (Qaseem et 1545 al., 2020) . The American Dental Association recommends NSAIDs as first -line treatment for acute dental 1546 pain management (American Dental Association, 2020) . For pain management for women in the 1547 postpartum period, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends a 1548 stepwise, ACOG recommends acetaminophen or NSAIDs, 1549 and if needed, escalating to an opioid; after caesarian delivery, ACOG recommends standard oral and 1550 medications as opioids with duration of opioid use limited to the shortest reasonable course expected for treating acute 1552 pain (The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2021) . ACOG recommends counseling 1553 individuals who are prescrib ed opioids about the risk of central nervous system depression in the 1554 individual and in the breastfed infant (The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2021) . 1555 For acute kidney stone pain, NSAIDs are at least as effective as opioids (Cordell can he ureteral smooth muscle 1557 tone and ureteral spasm (Cole, Fry, & Shuttleworth, 1988) causing kidney stone pain, and are preferred 1558 for kidney stone pain if not contraindicated. Triptans, NSAIDs, combined triptans with 1560 (Halker Singh et December 2020) . receptor antagonist lasmiditan and the gepant 1561 68 ubrogepant were approved by the FDA in 2019 for the treatment of migraine (U.S. Food and Drug 1562 Administration, 2019a) ; another gepant, rimegepant, was approved in 2020. Lasmiditan and the gepants 1563 were more effective than placebo in providing pain relief at 2 hours, 1 day, and at 1 week (Halker Singh 1564 et al., December 20 20). Adverse events related to these newer medications require further study, but 1565 given their mechanisms of action, are believed to be nonvasoconstrictive (Shapiro et al., 2019) , and 1566 potentially carry lower risks than vasoactive medications in patients with cardiovascular risk factors 1567 (Halker Singh et al., December 2020) . 1568 When not contraindicated, NSAIDs should be used for low back pain, painful musculoskeletal 1569 injuries (including minor pain related to fractures), dental pain, postoperative pain, and kidney stones; 1570 triptans, NSAIDs, or their combinations should be used alon g with antiemetics as needed for acute pain 1571 related to episodic migraine. NSAID use has been associated with serious gastrointestinal events and 1572 major coronary events (McDonagh et al., April 2020) , particularly in patients with cardiovascular or 1573 gastrointestinal co -morbidities, and clinicians should weigh risks and benefits of use, dose, and duration 1574 of NSAIDs when treating older adults as well as patients with hypertension, renal insufficiency, or heart 1575 failure, or those with risk for peptic ulcer disease or cardiovascular disease. V asoactive effects of triptans 1576 and ergot alkaloids might preclude their u se in patients with migraine who also have cardiovascular risk 1577 factors (Buse, Reed, Fanning, Kurth, & Lipton, 2017; Halker Sing h et al., December Lipton, Reed, 1578 Kurth, Fanning, & Buse, 2017) . should review FDA -approved labeling , including boxed 1579 warnings before initiating treatment with any pharmacologic therapy. 1580 1581 Opioid medication for acute pain 1582 The evidence review (Chou et al., December 2020) found that opioids might not be more 1583 effective than nonopioid therapies for some acute pain conditions (Chang, Bijur, Esses, Barnaby, & Baer, 1584 2017; Friedman et al., 2015; Le wis et al., 2015; Moore & Hersh, 2013; Pathan, Mitra, & Cameron, 2018) , 1585 69 and use of opioids might negatively affect recovery and function (Franklin, Stover, Turner, Fulton -Kehoe, 1586 & Wickizer, 2008; B. S. Webster, Verma, & Gatchel, 2007) . The review found that opioids were probably 1587 less effective than NSAIDs for surgical dental pain and kidney stones, less effective than acetaminophen 1588 for kidney stone pain, and similarly effective as NSAIDs for low back pain (Chou et al., December 2020) . 1589 For postoperative pain, effects of opioids on pain intensity were inconsistent, and opioids were 1590 associated with increased likelihood of repeat or rescue analgesic use (Chou e t al., December 2020) . 1591 There was some evidence that opioids might be more effective than gabapentin for acute neuropathic 1592 pain (Chou et al., December 2020) . There was insufficient evidence for opioids in trea tment of episodic 1593 migraine (Halker Singh . Compared with NSAIDs or acetaminophen, opioids were 1594 associated with increased risk of short -term adverse events, including any adverse event, nausea, 1595 dizziness, and somnolence (Chou et al., December 2020) . Observational studies found opioid use for 1596 acute low back pain or postoperative pain was associated with increased likelihood of long -term opioid 1597 use (Chou et al., December 2020) . Proportions of adults with new long -term opioid use at follow -up 1598 after initiation for short -term use for post -operative pain have ranged from <1% to 13% 2018; et al., 2016; S. P. Johnson et al., 2016; J. S. Lee et al., 2017; E. C. 1600 Sun, Darnall, Baker, & Mackey, 2016) . Odds of long -term opioid use at follow -up after initiation for 1601 short -term use for acute pain might be greater with higher dose and duration of exposure. For example, 1602 one study found that compared with no early opioid use for acute low back pain, the adjusted odds ratio 1603 was 2.08 (95% CI 1.55 to 2.78) for an early prescription totaling 1 to 140 MME/day and increased to 6.14 1604 (95% CI 4.92 to 7.66) for an early prescription totaling 450 MME/day (B. S. Webster et al., 2007) . In 1605 episodic migraine, opioids as well as butalbital -containing medications were associated with a two-fold 1606 higher risk of development of medication overuse headache compared with simple analgesics and 1607 triptans (Halker Singh et al., December 2020; Katsarava et al., 2004) . Ser ious adverse events were 1608 70 uncommon for opioids as well as for other medications, but studies were not designed to assess risk of 1609 overdose, opioid use disorder, or long -term harms (Chou et al., December 2020) . 1610 For acute low back pain, the American College of Physicians found insufficient evidence for 1611 effectiveness of opioids and recommends nonopioid medications (see Nonopioid medications for acute 1612 pain ) if choosing pharmacologic treatment (Qaseem et al., 2017) . The American College of Physicians 1613 and American Academy of Family Physicians suggest against treating patients with acute pain from 1614 musculoskeletal injuries with opioids, including tramadol (Qaseem et al., 2020) . The American Dental 1615 Association recommends NSAIDs as the first -line therapy for acute pain management (see Nonopioid 1616 medica tions for acute pain ) (American Dental Association, 2020) . The American College of Obstetricians 1617 and Gynecologists recommends a shared decision -making approach to postpartum discharge pain 1618 management, incorporating pharmac ologic treatments that may include opioids, limiting duration of 1619 opioid use to the shortest reasonable course expected for treating acute pain, noting that if a codeine - 1620 containing medication is selected, duration of therapy and neonatal signs of toxicity s hould be reviewed 1621 with individuals and their families (The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2021) . 1622 Multiple guidelines include both nonopioid and opioid 1623 treatment options and have emphasized multimodal incorporating around the clock 1624 nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies and noting t hat systemic opioids are often 1625 needed postoperatively but are not required in all patients (Chou et al., 2016; Hill, Stucke, Billmeier, 1626 Kelly, & Barth, 2018; Overton et al., 2018) . The American Headache Society recommends against 1627 prescribing opioid or butalbital -containing medications as headache disorders (Loder, Weizenbau m, Frishberg, & Silberstein, 2013) , and the American Academy of Neurology 1629 recommends against use of these medications for treatment of migraine, except as a last resort (Langer - 1630 Gould et al., 2013) . 1631 71 Given equivalent or lesser effectiveness for pain relief compared with NSAIDs and risks of long - 1632 term opioid use after using opioids for acute pain, opioids are not recommended as first -line therapy for 1633 many common acute pain conditions, including low back pain, neck pain, pain related to other 1634 musculoskeletal injuries (such as sprains, strains, tendonitis, bursitis), pain related to minor surgeries 1635 typically associated with minimal tissue injury and only mild postoperative pain (e.g., dental extraction), 1636 dental pain, kidney stone pain, and headaches including episodic migraine. There is an important role 1637 for opioid therapy for acute pain related to severe traumatic injuries (including crush injuries and burns), 1638 invasive surgeries typically associated with mo derate to severe postoperative pain, and other severe 1639 acute pain when NSAIDs and other therapies are contraindicated or likely to be ineffective. 1640 When diagnosis and severity of acute pain are reasonably assumed to warrant the use of 1641 opioids, clinicians sho uld prescribe immediate -release opioids (see Recommendation 3) at the lowest 1642 dose to achieve expected effects (see Recommendation 4) and for no longer than the expected duration 1643 of pain severe enough to require opioids (see Recommendation 6) to minimize un intentional initiation 1644 of long -term opioid use. Clinicians should maximize use of nonopioid pharmacologic (e.g., NSAIDs 1645 and/or acetaminophen) and nonpharmacologic (e.g., ice, heat, elevation, rest, immobilization and/or 1646 exercise) therapies as appropriate f or the specific condition and continue these therapies as needed 1647 once opioids are discontinued. Clinicians should work with patients to prevent prolonged opioid use, 1648 prescribe and advise opioid use only as needed (e.g., hydrocodone 5 mg/acetaminophen 325mg , one 1649 tablet not more frequently than every 4 hours as needed for pain) rather than on a scheduled basis (e.g., 1650 one tablet every 4 hours), and encourage and include an opioid taper if opioids will be taken around the 1651 clock for more than a few days (see Rec ommendation 6). Clinicians should consider concurrent medical 1652 conditions, including sleep apnea, pregnancy, renal or hepatic insufficiency, mental health conditions, 1653 and substance use disorder, in assessing risks of opioid therapy (see Recommendation 8), o ffer naloxone 1654 if the patient or a household member has risk factors for opioid overdose (see Recommendation 8), use 1655 72 extreme caution when prescribing benzodiazepines or other sedating medications with opioids (see 1656 Recommendation 11), and check the PDMP data base to ensure a new opioid prescription will not 1657 contribute to cumulative opioid dosages or medication combinations that put the patient at risk for 1658 overdose (see Recommendation 9). If there are signs of opioid use disorder, clinicians should address 1659 conc erns with the patient, should offer or arrange medication treatment for patients who meet criteria 1660 for opioid use disorder, and should use nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments as appropriate 1661 to manage the patient's pain (see Recommendation 12 and The ASAM National Practice Guideline for 1662 the Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder: 2020 Focused Update (American Society of Addiction Medicine, 1663 2020) ). 1664 Although findings regarding risks of new long -term opioid use after use for acute pain (Chou et 1665 al., December 2020) relate specifically to patients who were previously opioid -na\u00efve, there might also be 1666 risks associ ated with dose escalation (see Recommendation 4) if patients already treated with long -term 1667 opioids are prescribed additional opioid medication for new acute pain superimposed on chronic pain. 1668 Therefore, strategies that minimize opioid use should be implem ented for both opioid -na\u00efve and opioid - 1669 tolerant patients with acute pain when possible. If patients already receiving long -term opioids require 1670 additional medication for acute pain, nonopioid medications should be used when possible, and if 1671 additional opio ids are required (e.g., for superimposed severe acute pain), they should be continued 1672 only for the duration of pain severe enough to require additional opioids, returning to the patient's 1673 baseline opioid dosage as soon as possible, including an appropriate taper to baseline dosage if 1674 additional opioids were used around the clock for more than a few days (see Recommendation 6). 1675 Patient education and discussion before starting outpatient opioid therapy are critical so that 1676 patient preferences and values can b e understood and inform clinical decisions. Clinicians should ensure 1677 that patients are aware of expected benefits of, common and serious risks of, and alternatives to opioids 1678 before starting or continuing opioid therapy and should involve patients in decis ions about whether to 1679 73 start opioid therapy. Essential elements for communication and discussion with patients before starting 1680 outpatient opioid therapy for acute pain include the following: 1681 Advise patients that short -term opioid use can lead to unintended long -term opioid use and the 1682 importance of working toward planned discontinuation of opioid use as soon as feasible, 1683 including a plan to appropriately taper opioids as pain resolves if opioids have been used around 1684 the clock for more than a few days (see Recommendation 6). 1685 Review communication mechanisms and protocols patients can use to inform clinicians of 1686 severe or uncontrolled pain and to arrange for timely reassessment and management. 1687 Advise patients about serious adverse effects of opioids, including potentially fatal respiratory 1688 depression and development of a potentially serious lifelong opioid use disorder (see 1689 Recommendation 12) that can cause distress and inability to fulfill major role obligations at 1690 work, school, or home. 1691 Advise patients about common effects of opioids, such as constipation, dry mouth, nausea, 1692 vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, tolerance, physical dependence, and withdrawal symptoms 1693 when stopping opioids. To prevent constipation associated with opioid use, advise patients to 1694 increase hydration and fiber intake and to maintain or increase physical activity as they are able. 1695 A cathartic (e.g., senna) with or without a stool softener or a laxative might be needed if opioids 1696 are used for more than a few days. To minimize withdrawal sy mptoms, clinicians should provide 1697 and discuss an opioid tapering plan when opioids will be used around the clock for more than a 1698 few days (see Recommendation 6). Limiting opioid use to the minimum needed to manage pain 1699 (e.g., taking the opioid only when ne eded if needed less frequently than every 4 hours and the 1700 prescription is written for every 4 hours as needed for pain) can help limit development of 1701 tolerance and therefore of withdrawal once opioids are discontinued. 1702 74 If formulations are prescribed that combine opioids with acetaminophen, advise patients of the 1703 risks of taking additional over -the-counter products containing acetaminophen. Acetaminophen 1704 can be hepatotoxic at dosages of >3 -4 grams/day and at lower dosages in patients with chronic 1705 alcohol use or liver disease (American Geriatrics Society Panel on the Pharmacological 1706 Management of Persistent Pain in Older Persons, 2009) . 1707 To help patients assess when a dose of opioids is needed, explain that t he goal is to reduce pain 1708 to make it manageable rather than to eliminate pain. 1709 Discuss effects that opioids might have on ability to safely operate a vehicle or other machinery, 1710 particularly when opioids are initiated or when other central nervous system d epressants, such 1711 as benzodiazepines or alcohol, are used concurrently. 1712 Discuss increased risks for opioid use disorder, respiratory depression, and death at higher 1713 dosages, along with the importance of taking only the amount of opioids prescribed, i.e., n ot 1714 taking more opioids or taking them more often. 1715 Review increased risks for respiratory depression when opioids are taken with benzodiazepines, 1716 other sedatives, alcohol, non -prescribed or illicit drugs such as heroin, or other opioids (see 1717 Recommendation s 8, 11). 1718 Discuss risks to household members and other individuals if opioids are intentionally or 1719 unintentionally shared with others for whom they are not prescribed, including the possibility 1720 that others might experience overdose at the same or at lower dosage than prescribed for the 1721 patient, and that young children and pets are susceptible to unintentional ingestion. Discuss 1722 storage of opioids in a secure, preferably locked location and options for safe disposal of unused 1723 opioids (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2020a) . 1724 75 Discuss planned use of precautions to reduce risks, including naloxone for overdose reversal 1725 (see Recommendation 8), and clinician use of prescription drug monitoring program information 1726 (see Recommendation 9). 1727 1728 2. Nonopioid therapies are preferred for subac ute and chronic pain. Clinicians should only consider 1729 initiating opioid therapy if expected benefits for pain and function are anticipated to outweigh 1730 risks to the patient. Before starting opioid therapy for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should 1731 discuss with patients the known risks and realistic benefits of opioid therapy, should work with 1732 patients to establish treatment goals for pain and function, and should consider how opioid 1733 therapy will be discontinued if benefits do not outweigh risks (recomme ndation category: A, 1734 evidence type: 2). 1735 Implementation considerations : 1736 To guide patient -specific selection of therapy, clinicians should evaluate patients and establish or 1737 confirm the diagnosis. 1738 Clinicians should use appropriate n oninvasive, n onpharmacologic approaches to help manage 1739 chronic pain, such as exercise (aerobic, aquatic, and/or resistance exercises) or exercise therapy 1740 (a prominent modality in physical therapy) for back pain, fibromyalgia, and hip or knee 1741 osteoarthritis; weight loss for knee osteoarthritis ; manual therapies for hip osteoarthritis; 1742 psychological th erapy, spinal manipulation, low -level laser therapy, massage, mindfulness -based 1743 stress reduction, yoga, acupuncture, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation for low back pain; mind - 1744 body practices (yoga, tai chi, qigong), massage, and acupuncture for neck pain ; CBT, myofascial 1745 release massage, mindfulness practices, tai chi, qigong, acupuncture, and multidisciplinary 1746 rehabilitation for fibromyalgia; and spinal manipulation for tension headache. 1747 Low-cost options to integrate exercise include walking in public s paces or use of public recreation 1748 facilities for group exercise. Physical therapy can be helpful, particularly for patients who have 1749 limited access to safe public spaces or public recreation facilities for exercise or have not 1750 improved with low -intensity p hysical exercise. 1751 To improve pain management and reduce medication use and associated risks, health insurers 1752 and health systems should increase access to noninvasive, nonpharmacologic therapies with 1753 evidence for effectiveness. 1754 Clinicians should review FDA -approved labeling including boxed warnings and weigh benefits 1755 and risks before initiating treatment with any pharmacologic therapy. 1756 76 When patients affected by osteoarthritis have an insufficient response to nonpharmacologic 1757 interventions such as exercise for arthritis pain, topical NSAIDs can be used in patients with a 1758 single or few joints near the surface of the skin (e.g., knee). In patients with osteoarthritis pain in 1759 multiple joints or incompletely controlled with topical NSAIDs, duloxetine or systemic NSAIDs can 1760 be considered. 1761 NSAIDs should be used at the lowest dose and duration needed and should be used with caution, 1762 particularly in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities, chronic renal failure, or previous 1763 gastrointestinal bleeding. 1764 When patien ts with chronic low back pain have had an insufficient response to 1765 nonpharmacologic approaches such as exercise, clinicians can consider NSAIDs duloxetine for neuropathic pain. 1770 Duloxetine and pregabalin are FDA -approved the treatment of diabetic peripheral 1771 neuropathy, and pregabalin and gabapentin are of post 1772 n and 1775 gabapentin) are used to improve pain, function, and quality of life . Duloxetine, milnacipran, and 1776 pregabalin are FDA -approved for the treatment of fibromyalgia. 1777 Patients with co -occurring pain and depression might be especially likely to benefit from 1778 antidepressant medication (see Recommendation 8). 1779 Opioids should not be considered first -line or routine therapy for subacute or chronic pain. This 1780 does not mean that patients should be required to sequentially \"fail\" nonpharmacologic and 1781 nonopioid pharmacologic therapy or be required to use any specific therapy before proceed ing to 1782 opioid therapy. Rather, expected benefits specific to the clinical context should be weighed 1783 against risks before initiating therapy. In some clinical contexts (e.g., serious illness in a patient 1784 with poor prognosis for return to previous level of f unction, contraindications to other therapies, 1785 and clinician and patient agreement that the overriding goal is patient comfort), opioids might 1786 be appropriate regardless of previous therapies used. In other situations, (e.g., headache or 1787 fibromyalgia), expe cted benefits of initiating opioids are unlikely to outweigh risks regardless of 1788 previous nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapies used. 1789 Opioid therapy should not be initiated without consideration by the clinician and patient of an 1790 \"exit st rategy\" to be used if opioid therapy is unsuccessful. 1791 Before opioid therapy is initiated for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should determine jointly 1792 with patients how effectiveness will be evaluated and establish treatment goals. 1793 77 Clinicians seeing new patients already receiving opioids should establish treatment goals for 1794 continued opioid therapy. Clinicians should avoid rapid tapering or abrupt discontinuation of 1795 opioids (see Recommendation 5). 1796 Patient education and discussion before starting opioi d therapy are critical so that patient 1797 preferences and values can be understood and used to inform clinical decisions. 1798 Clinicians should review available low -cost options for pain management for all patients, and 1799 particularly for low -income, underinsured and uninsured patients. 1800 Clinicians should ensure that patients are aware of expected benefits of, common and serious 1801 risks of, and alternatives to opioids before starting or continuing opioid therapy and should 1802 involve patients in decisions about whether t o start opioid therapy. 1803 Supporting Rationale 1804 To guide patient -specific selection of therapy, clinicians should evaluate patients and establish 1805 or confirm the diagnosis. Detailed recommendations on diagnosis are provided in other guidelines 1806 (American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 2017; Chou et a l., 2007; Federation of 1807 State Medical Boards, 2017; Hooten et al., 2013; U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of 1808 Defense, 2017) , but evaluation should generally include a focused history, including history and 1809 characteristics of pain and potential contributing factors (e.g., function, psycho social stressors, sleep) 1810 and physical exam, with imaging or other diagnostic testing only if indicated (e.g., if severe or 1811 progressive neurologic deficits are present or if serious underlying conditions are suspected [Chou et al., 1812 2007; Hooten et al., 2013] ). For complex pain syndromes, pain specialty consultation can be considered 1813 to assist with diagnosis as well as management. 1814 Diagnosis can help identify disease -specific interventions to reverse, ameliorate, or prevent 1815 worsening of pain and improve function; for example, improving glucose control to prevent progression 1816 of diabetic neuropathy; immune -modulating agents for rheumat oid arthritis; physical or occupational 1817 therapy to address posture, muscle weakness, or repetitive occupational motions that contribute to 1818 musculoskeletal pain; or surgical intervention to relieve mechanical/compressive pain (Hooten et al., 1819 2013) . The underlying mechanism for most pain syndromes can be categorized as neuropathic (e.g., 1820 78 diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, fibromyalgia), or nociceptive (e.g., osteoarthritis, muscular 1821 back pain). The diagnosis and pathophysiologic mechanism of pain have implications for symptomatic 1822 pain treatment with medication. For example, ther e is limited evidence for improved pain or function, or 1823 evidence of worse outcomes, with long -term use of opioids for several chronic pain conditions for which 1824 opioids are commonly prescribed, such as osteoarthritis (Bannuru et al., 2019) , low back pain (Chaparro 1825 et al., 2014; Qaseem et al., 2017) , headache (Loder . For moderate to severe chronic 1827 back pain or hip or knee osteoarthritis pain, a nonopioid strategy starting with acetaminophen or 1828 NSAIDs results in significantly improved pain intensity compared to a strategy starting with opioids (E. E. 1829 Krebs et 1831 postherpetic and Environmental 2017] ). 1832 In addition, review of the patient's history and context beyond the presenting pain syndrome is 1833 helpful in selection of pain treatments. In particular, medications should be used only after assessment 1834 and determination that expected benefits outweigh risks given patient -specific factors. For example, 1835 clinicians should consider fall risk when selecting and dosing potentially sedating medications such as 1836 tricyclics, anticonvulsants, and opioids, and should weigh risks and benefits of use, dose, and duration of 1837 NSAIDs when treating older adults as well as patients with hypertension, renal insufficiency, or heart 1838 failure, or those with risk for peptic ulcer disease or cardiovascular dis ease. Some guidelines recommend 1839 topical NSAIDs for localized osteoarthritis (e.g., knee osteoarthritis) over oral NSAIDs in patients aged 1840 75 years to minimize systemic effects (Hochberg et al., 2012) . See Recommendation 8 for additional 1841 considerations for assessing risks of opioid therapy. 1842 1843 Noninvasive, nonpharmacologic approaches to subacute and chronic pain 1844 79 Many n oninvasive, n onpharmacologic approaches, including physical therapy, weight loss for 1845 knee osteoarthritis, and psychological therapies such as CBT, and mindfulness -based s tress reduction 1846 can improve pain and function without risk for serious harms (Skelly et al., April 2020) . There is high - 1847 quality evidence that exercise therapy (a prominent modality in physical therapy) for back pain, 1848 fibromyalgia, and hip or knee osteoarthritis reduces pain and improves f unction immediately after 1849 treatment and that the improvements are sustained for at least 2 -6 months (Busch , Barber, Overend, al., April 2020) . Previous guidelines have 1852 recommended aerobic, aquatic, and/or resistance exercises for people with chronic pain, including 1853 osteoarthritis of the knee or hip, back pain, and fibromyalgia (American College of Occupational and 1854 Environmental Medicine, 2017; Hochberg et al., 2012; Macfarlan e et al., 2017; Qaseem et al., 2017; U.S. 1855 Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense, 2017) . Other noninvasive, 1856 nonpharma cologic therapies that improve pain and/or function for at least one month after delivery 1857 without apparent risk for serious harm include CBT for knee osteoarthritis; manual therapies for hip 1858 osteoarthritis; psychological therapy, spinal manipulation, low -level laser therapy, massage, 1859 mindfulness -based stress reduction, yoga, acupuncture, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation for low back 1860 pain; mind -body practices (e.g., yoga, tai chi, qigong), massage, and acupuncture for neck pain; CBT, 1861 myofascial release m assage, mindfulness practices, tai chi, qigong, acupuncture, and multidisciplinary 1862 rehabilitation for fibromyalgia; and spinal manipulation for tension headache (Skelly et al., April 2020) . 1863 For temporomandibular disorder pain, patient education and self -care can be effective, as can occlu sal 1864 splints for some patients and biobehavioral therapy for prevention of disabling symptoms (List interventions, 1866 and psychological treatments (including CBT and mindfulness practices) can encourage active patient 1867 participation in the care plan and address the effects of pain in the patient's life; these more \"active\" 1868 80 therapies have somewhat more robust evidence for sustained improvements in pain and function than 1869 more \"passive\" treatme nts (e.g., massage), particularly at longer -term follow -up (Skelly et al., April 1870 2020) . Active approaches that engage the patient should be used, when possible, with a supplementary 1871 role for more passive approaches, to reduce pain and improve function. 1872 Despite their favorable benefit -to-risk profile, noninvasive, nonpharmacologic therapies are not 1873 always or fully covered by insurance (Heyward et al., 2018) . Access and cost can be barriers for patients, 1874 particularly people who are low -income, uninsured, underinsured, or living in rural areas or with 1875 transportation challenges. To improve pain management and reduce medication use and asso ciated 1876 risks, health insurers and health systems should increase access to noninvasive, nonpharmacologic 1877 therapies with evidence for effectiveness. In addition, for many patients, aspects of these approaches 1878 can be used even when there is limited access to specialty care. For example, previous guidelines have 1879 strongly recommended aerobic, aquatic, and/or resistance exercises for patients with osteoarthritis of 1880 the knee or hip (Hochberg et al., 2012) and maintenance of physical activity, including normal daily 1881 activities, for patients with low bac k pain (Chou et al., 2007) . A randomized trial found no difference in 1882 reduced chronic low back pain intensity, frequency or disability between pa tients assigned to relatively 1883 low-cost group aerobics and individual physiotherapy or muscle reconditioning sessions (Mannion, 1884 M\u00fcntener, Taimela, & Dvorak, 1999) . Low -cost options to integrate exercise include walking in public 1885 spaces or use of public recreat ion facilities for group exercise. Physical therapy can be helpful, 1886 particularly for patients who have limited access to safe public spaces or public recreation facilities for 1887 exercise or have not improved with low -intensity physical exercise . A randomized trial found a stepped 1888 exercise program, in which patients were initially offered an internet -based exercise program and 1889 progressively advanced to biweekly coaching calls and then to in -person physical therapy if not 1890 improved at previous step s, successfully improved symptomatic knee osteoarthritis, with 35% of 1891 patients ultimately requiring in -person physical therapy (Allen et al., 2020) . In addition, primary care 1892 81 clinicians can integrate elements of psychosocial therapies such as CBT, which addresses psychosocial 1893 contributors to pain and improves function (A. C. Williams, Eccleston, & Morley, 2012) , by encouraging 1894 patients to take an active role in the care plan, by supporting patients in engaging activities such as 1895 exercise that are generally beneficial but that might initially be associated with fear of exacerbating pain 1896 (Hooten et al., 2013) , or by providing education in relaxation techniques and coping strategies. In many 1897 locations, there are free or low -cost patient support, self -help, and educational community -based or 1898 employer -sponsored progra ms that can provide stress reduction and other mental health benefits. 1899 Clinicians should be familiar with such options within their communities so they can refer patients to 1900 low-cost services. Patients with higher levels of anxiety or fear related to pain, or other significant 1901 psychological distress, can be referred for treatment with a mental health specialist (e.g., psychologist, 1902 psychiatrist, clinical social worker). 1903 1904 Nonopioid medications for subacute and chronic pain 1905 Several nonopioid pharmacologic the rapies (including acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and selected 1906 antidepressants and anticonvulsants) are used for painful symptoms in chronic pain conditions. 1907 Nonopioid pharmacologic therapies are associated with risks, particularly in older adults, pregnant 1908 patient s, and patients with certain co -morbidities such as cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, and 1909 liver disease. For example, NSAID use has been associated with serious gastrointestinal events and 1910 major coronary events (McDonagh et al., April 2020) . Increases in non -serious adverse events have been 1911 found with the anticonvulsants pregabalin (blurred vision, cognitive effects, sedation, weight gain, 1912 dizziness and peripheral edema) and gabapentin (blurred vision, cognitive effects, sedation, and weight 1913 gain), with cannabis (nausea and dizziness), and with the SNRIs duloxetine (nausea, sedation) and 1914 milnacipran (nausea); dose reductions reduced the risk of some adverse events with SNRI 1915 82 antidepressants (McDonagh et al., April 2020) . Clinicians should review FDA -approved labeling including 1916 boxed warnings before initiating treatment with any pharmacologic t herapy. 1917 For osteoarthritis, NSAIDs including topical NSAIDs (diclofenac) and the SNRI duloxetine have 1918 small to moderate benefits for pain and function at short -term assessment (3 to 6 months), with 1919 intermediate -term (6 to 12 months) evidence for some medi cations (celecoxib and duloxetine), and 1920 some evidence that duloxetine is more effective in older (>65 years) compared to younger patients and 1921 in patients with knee osteoarthritis (McDonagh et al., April 2020) . Acetaminophen has limited evidence 1922 for effectiveness (McDonagh et al., April 2020) and is no longer considered a first -line treatment for 1923 osteoarthritis (Bannuru et al., 2019) . When patients have an insufficient response to nonpharmacologic 1924 interventions such as exercise for arthritis pain and if a single or a few joints near the surface of the skin 1925 (e.g., knee) are affected by osteoarthritis, use of topical NSAIDs is recommend ed (Bannuru et al., 2019) . 1926 In patients with osteoarthritis pain in multiple joints or incompletely controlled with topical NSAIDs, 1927 systemic NSAIDs or duloxetin e can be used. However, systemic NSAIDs should be used at the lowest 1928 dose and duration needed as risks may increase with longer use and at higher doses (U.S. Food and Drug 1929 Administration, 2015b) . NSAIDs should be used with caution particularly in patients with cardiovascular 1930 comorbidities, chronic renal failure, or previous gastrointestinal bleeding. In patients with 1931 gastrointestinal comorbidities but without current or previous gastrointestinal bleeding, 1932 cyclo oxygenase -2 (COX -2) inhibitors or NSAIDs with proton pump inhibitors can be used to minimize risk 1933 compared to risk with use of NSAIDs alone (Bannuru et al., 2019) . Moderate -quality evidence shows 1934 small improvements in chronic low back pain with NSAIDs (Qaseem et al., 2017) and with duloxetine 1935 (McDonagh et al., April 2020) . When patients have had an insufficient response to nonpharmacologic 1936 approaches such as exercise, clinicians can consider NSAIDs or duloxetine (Qaseem et al., 2017) for 1937 patients without contraindications. For temporomandibular disorder pain that is not sufficiently 1938 improved with nonpharmacologic interventions, NSAIDs can be effective (Kulkarni, Thambar, & Arora, 1939 83 Mujakperuo, 1940 antidepressants, selected anticonvulsants, and and lido caine patches are recommended for 1941 neuropathic pain (American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 2017) . However, 1942 evidence on topical lidocaine and capsaicin is lim ited (McDonagh et al., April 2020) . enacarbil, oxcarbazepine ) are associated with small improvements in neuropathic pain (mainly diabetic 1945 neuropathy and post -herpetic neuralgia) (McDonagh et al., April 2020) . Duloxetine and pregabalin are 1946 FDA-approved for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy, and pregabalin and gabapentin are FDA - 1947 approved for treatment of post -herpe tic neuralgia. In patients with fibromyalgia, several medications 1948 have been shown to be associated with small to moderate improvements in pain, function, and quality 1949 of life, including SNRI antidepressants (duloxetine and al., April 2020) . Tricyclics and SNRIs 1951 can also relieve fibromyalgia symptoms. Duloxetine, milnacipran, and pregabalin are FDA -approved for 1952 and are recommended for the treatment of fibromyalgia (American College of Occupational and 1953 Environmental Medicine, 2017) . The tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline is often used and 1954 recommended in patients with fibromyalgia (American College of Occupational and Environmental 1955 Medicine, 2017) , altho ugh evidence on its effectiveness is limited (McDonagh et al., April 2020) . Because 1956 patients with ch ronic pain might experience concurrent depression (Howe & Sullivan, 2014) , and 1957 depression can exacerbate physical symptoms including pain (Sullivan, Edlund, Zhang, Un\u00fctzer, & Wells, 1958 2006) , patients with co -occurring pain and depression might be especially likely to benefit from 1959 antidepressant medication (see Recommendation 8). Evide nce on effectiveness of cannabis for painful 1960 conditions is limited, inconsistent across studies, and some studies have reported adverse events such 1961 as dizziness, nausea, and sedation (Banerjee & McCormack, 2019; McDonagh et al., April 1962 1963 84 Opioid medic ation for subacute and chronic pain 1964 The clinical evidence reviews found insufficient evidence to determine long -term benefits of 1965 opioid therapy for chronic pain and found an increased risk for serious harms related to long -term 1966 opioid therapy that appears to be dose -dependent (Chou et al., April 2020) . Compared with no opioid 1967 use, o pioid use was associated with increased risk of opioid use disorder, overdose, all -cause mortality, 1968 fractures, falls, and myocardial infarction (Chou et al., April 2020) . Opioids were also associated with 1969 increased risk of discontinuation due to gastrointestinal adverse events, somnolence, dizziness, and 1970 pruritus (Chou et al., Apri l 2020) . Compared with placebo, at short -term (1 - <6 months) follow -up, 1971 opioids were associated with small mean improvements in pain intensity (mean difference -0.79 point 1972 on a 0 to 10 scale, 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.93 to -0.67, I2=71%) and fu nction (Chou et al., April 1973 2020) . There was some evidence that improvement in pain is reduced with longer duration of opioid 1974 therapy; from a mean improvement of 1 on a 0 to 10 scale at 1 to 3 months to about 0.5 at 3 to 6 1975 months (Chou et al., April 20 20). No placebo -controlled trial evaluated effectiveness of opioids at 1976 intermediate (6 - <12 months) or long -term (12 months) follow -up (Chou et al., April 2020) . Compared 1977 with nonopioid treatments at short -term follow -up, there were no differences in mean pain 1978 improvement (mean difference -0.29 on a 0 to 10 scale, 95% CI, -0.61 to 0.03) or functional 1979 improvement. No trials compared opioids with nonopioid therapies at intermediate or long -term follow - 1980 up, with the exception of one trial which found stepped therapy starting with opioids associated with 1981 higher pain intensity than stepped therapy starting with nonopioids (4.0 vs . 3.5, mean difference 0.5, 1982 95% CI, 0.0 to 1.0) at 12 -months (Chou et al., April 2020; E. E. Krebs et al., 2018) . 1983 The clinical evidence reviews identified an observational study (Edlund et al., 2014) finding l ong- 1984 term (>90 days' supply) opioid prescription to be associated with significantly increased risk of a new 1985 opioid use disorder diagnosis for all dosages of lo ng-term (>90 days' supply) opioids prescribed, with 1986 adjusted odds ratios of 15, 29, and 122 at low (1 to 36 MME/day), medium (36 to 120 MME/day) and 1987 85 high (120 MME/day) opioid dosages, respectively). Compared with no opioid use, opioid use was 1988 associated w ith increased risk of opioid use disorder, overdose, all -cause mortality, fractures, falls, and 1989 myocardial infarction (Chou et al., April 2020) . 1990 Several experts from the Opioid Workgroup appreciated the importance of highlighting both 1991 pain and function, of clinicians being realistic \"upfront\" with patients, and of attention to tapering and 1992 exit strategies. While some experts fe lt the recommendation statement could state nonopioid therapies 1993 \"may be preferred\" or \"may be effective\" for chronic pain, others agreed with language that nonopioid 1994 therapies \"are preferred\" for chronic pain, given opioid therapies are associated with sma ll short -term 1995 benefits compared with placebo, comparable or reduced short -term benefits compared with nonopioid 1996 therapies, uncertain long -term benefits, and potential for serious harms. 1997 Opioids should not be considered first -line or routine therapy for su bacute or chronic pain. 1998 Although evidence on long -term benefits of nonopioid therapies is also limited, these therapies are also 1999 associated with short -term benefits, there is no evidence for attenuated benefit over time or difficulty 2000 stopping therapy when benefits do not outweigh risks, and risks for serious harms are usually lower. 2001 This does not mean that patients should be required to sequentially \"fail\" nonpharmacologic and 2002 nonopioid pharmacologic therapy or be required to use any specific therapy before proceeding to 2003 opioid therapy. Rather, expected benefits specific to the clinical context should be weighed against risks 2004 before initiating therapy. In some clinical contexts (e.g., serious illness in a patient with poor prognosis 2005 for return to previous le vel of function, contraindications to other therapies, and clinician and patient 2006 agreement that the overriding goal is patient comfort), opioids might be appropriate regardless of 2007 previous therapies used. In other situations (e.g., headache or fibromyalgia ), expected benefits of 2008 initiating opioids are unlikely to outweigh risks regardless of previous nonpharmacologic and 2009 nonopioid pharmacologic therapies used. 2010 86 The clinical evidence reviews found no instrument with high accuracy for predicting opioid - 2011 related harms such as overdose or opioid use disorder (Chou et al., April 2020) . It can be very 2012 challenging for clinicians to predi ct whether benefits of opioids for chronic pain will outweigh risks of 2013 ongoing treatment for individual patients. Therefore, opioid therapy should not be initiated without 2014 consideration by the clinician and patient of an \"exit strategy\" that could be used if opioid therapy is 2015 unsuccessful . Before opioid therapy is initiated for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should determine 2016 with patients how effectiveness will be evaluated and establish treatment goals. Some patients have 2017 reported treatment goals are effective in increasing motivation and functioning (Chou et al., April 2020) . 2018 Goals ideally include improvement in pain relief, function (including social and emotional as well as 2019 physical dimensions), and quality of life. Goals can be tailored to individual patient and clinical 2020 circumstances. For example, for some patients with d iseases typically associated with progressive 2021 functional impairment or catastrophic injuries such as spinal cord trauma, reductions in pain without 2022 improvement in physical function might be more realistic. Clinicians can assess and then follow (see 2023 Recomme ndation 7) function, pain control, and quality of life using tools such as the three -item \"Pain 2024 average, interference with Enjoyment of life, and interference with General activity\" (PEG) Assessment 2025 Scale (Krebs et al., 2009) . Clinically meaningful improvement has been defined as a 30% improvement in 2026 scores fo r both pain and function (Ostelo et al., 2008) . Clinicians can ask patients about functional goals 2027 that have meaning for them (e.g., walking the dog or walking around the block, returning to part -time 2028 work, attending family sports or recreat ional activities), and then use these goals in assessing benefits of 2029 opioid therapy for individual patients and in weighing benefits against risks of continued opioid therapy 2030 (see Recommendation 7). Clinicians seeing new patients already using opioid medic ation should 2031 establish treatment goals for continued opioid therapy. Clinicians should avoid rapid tapering or abrupt 2032 discontinuation of opioids (see Recommendation 5). Although the clinical evidence reviews did not find 2033 studies evaluating the effectivenes s of written agreements or treatment plans (Chou et al., April 2020) , 2034 87 clinicians and patients who set a treatment plan in ad vance of prescribing will clarify expectations 2035 regarding how opioids will be prescribed and monitored with an aim to improve patient safety, health, 2036 and well -being. 2037 Patient education and discussion before starting opioid therapy are critical so that patient 2038 preferences and values can be understood and used to inform clinical decisions. Clinicians should ensure 2039 that patients are aware of expected benefits of, common an d serious risks of, and alternatives to opioids 2040 before starting or continuing opioid therapy and should involve patients in decisions about whether to 2041 start opioid therapy. Many patients rank pain relief, nausea, vomiting, and constipation as significant 2042 effects (Chou et al., April 2020) . Essential elements for communication and discussion with patients 2043 before starting opioid t herapy include the following: 2044 Review available low -cost options for pain management for all patients, and particularly for low - 2045 income, underinsured, and uninsured patients . Review considerations related to access to care 2046 given the clinical oversight neede d to initiate and continue opioid therapy and other treatments 2047 for pain. 2048 Be explicit and realistic about expected benefits of opioids, explaining that there is not robust 2049 evidence that opioids improve pain or function with long -term use, and that complete 2050 elimination of pain is unlikely. 2051 Emphasize improvement in function as a primary goal and that function can improve even when 2052 pain is not completely eliminated. 2053 Advise patients about serious adverse effects of opioids, including potentially fatal respiratory 2054 depression and development of a potentially serious lifelong opioid u se disorder that can cause 2055 distress and inability to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home. 2056 Advise patients about common effects of opioids, such as constipation, dry mouth, nausea, 2057 vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, tolerance, physical de pendence, and withdrawal symptoms 2058 88 when stopping opioids. To prevent constipation associated with opioid use, advise patients to 2059 increase hydration and fiber intake and to maintain or increase physical activity. A cathartic 2060 (e.g., senna) with or without a s tool softener or a laxative might be needed. 2061 If formulations are prescribed that combine opioids with acetaminophen, advise patients of the 2062 risks of taking additional over -the-counter products containing acetaminophen. Acetaminophen 2063 can be hepatotoxic at dosages of >3 -4 grams/day and at lower dosages in patients with chronic 2064 alcohol use or liver disease (American Ge riatrics Society Panel on the Pharmacological 2065 Management of Persistent Pain in Older Persons, 2009) . 2066 Discuss effects that opioids might have on ability to safely operate a vehicle or other machinery, 2067 particularly when opioids are initiated, when dosage s are increased, or when other central 2068 nervous system depressants, such as benzodiazepines or alcohol, are used concurrently. 2069 Discuss increased risks for opioid use disorder, respiratory depression, and death at higher 2070 dosages, along with the importance o f taking only the amount of opioids prescribed, i.e., not 2071 taking more opioids or taking them more often. 2072 Review increased risks for respiratory depression when opioids are taken with benzodiazepines, 2073 other sedatives, alcohol, non -prescribed drugs such as heroin, or other opioids. 2074 Discuss risks to household members and other individuals if opioids are intentionally or 2075 unintentionally shared with others for whom they are not prescribed, including the possibility 2076 that others might experience overdose at the same or at lower dosage than prescribed for the 2077 patient, and that young children are susceptible to unintentional ingestion. Discuss storage of 2078 opioids in a secure, preferably locked location and options for safe disposal of unused opioids 2079 (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2020a) . 2080 Discuss the importance of periodic reassessment to ensure that opioids are helpi ng to meet 2081 patient goals and to allow opportunities for opioid dosage reduction and/or discontinuation and 2082 89 consideration of additional nonpharmacologic or nonopioid pharmacologic treatment options if 2083 opioids are not effective or are harmful. 2084 Discuss expec tations for clinician and patient responsibilities to mitigate risks of opioid therapy 2085 and planned use of precautions to reduce risks, including naloxone for overdose reversal (see 2086 Recommendation 8), and clinician use of prescription drug monitoring progra m information (see 2087 Recommendation 9) and toxicology screening (see Recommendation 10). 2088 Consider whether cognitive status might interfere with management of opioid therapy and, if 2089 so, determine whether a caregiver can responsibly co -manage medication thera py. Discuss the 2090 importance of reassessing medication use over time with both the patient and caregiver (as 2091 appropriate). 2092 2093 Given the possibility that benefits of opioid therapy might diminish or that risks might become 2094 more prominent over time, it is impor tant that clinicians elicit patients' experiences and preferences and 2095 review expected benefits and risks of continued opioid therapy with patients periodically (see 2096 Recommendation 7). 2097 2098 Interventional approaches to subacute and chronic pain 2099 Interventional approaches such as arthrocentesis and intraarticular glucocorticoid injection for 2100 pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis (Wallen & Gillies, 2006) or osteoarthritis (Bellamy et al., 2006) 2101 and subacromial corticosteroid injection for rotator cuff disease (Buchbinder, Green, & Youd, 2003) can 2102 provide short -term improvement in pain and function. Evidence is insufficient to determine the extent 2103 to which repeated glucocorticoid injection increases potential risks such as articular cartilage changes (in 2104 osteoarthritis) and sepsis (Bellamy et al., 2006) . Interventional pain management specialists offer 2105 additional interve ntions that can alleviate pain as part of a comprehensive pain management approach 2106 90 (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2019b) , including epidural steroid injections (for 2107 lumbar disc), nerve ablation procedures (e.g., radiofrequency denervation 2108 for low back pain), and neurostimulation procedures (e.g., peripheral nerve stimulation, spinal cord 2109 stimulation). Evidence is limited for many of these pro cedures, and additional research is needed to 2110 establish the clinical benefits of specific interventional procedures for specific pain conditions (Chou et 2111 al., 2021; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2019b) . Rare, s erious adverse events have 2112 been reported with epidural injection (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2014c) . 2113 2114 Multimodal therapy for subacute and chronic pain 2115 Integrated pain management requires coordination of medical, psychological, and social aspects 2116 of healthcare and includes primary care, mental and behavioral healthcare, and specialist services when 2117 needed (The Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee, 2015) . Multimodal therapies and 2118 multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation -combining app roaches (e.g., psychological therapies 2119 with exercise) can reduce long -term pain and disability compared with usual care and compared with 2120 physical treatments (e.g., exercise) alone. Nonpharmacologic therapies can also provide synergistic 2121 benefits when nono pioid or opioid pain medications are used (U.S. Department of Health and Human 2122 Services, 2019b) . When needed, medications should ideally be combined with nonpharmacologic 2123 therapy to pr ovide greater benefits to patients in improving pain and function. Multimodal therapies are 2124 not always available or reimbursed by insurance and can be time -consuming and costly for patients, and 2125 disparities for being able to access multimodal care exist. T here is evidence that less-intensive 2126 multidisciplinary rehabilitation can be similarly effective to high -intensity multidisciplinary rehabilitation 2127 (Skelly et al., April 2020) . Multimodal therapies should be considered for patients not responding to 2128 single -modality therapy, and combinatio ns should be tailored depending on patient needs, cost, 2129 convenience, and other individual factors. 2130 91 Depending on patient co -morbidities and benefit -to-risk ratio in individual patients, 2131 combinations of medications (for example, two nonopioid medications wi th different mechanisms of 2132 action or a nonopioid with an opioid medication) might also be used. In some cases, medication 2133 combinations might provide complementary or synergistic benefits and/or facilitate lower dosing of 2134 individual medications (Chou et al., April 2020) , as has been demonstrated in trials of patients with 2135 neuropathic pain (Chou et al., April 2020) . However, caution should be used to avoid synergistic risks of 2136 medications. For example, combinations of medications that depress the cent ral nervous system and 2137 cause sedation (see Recommendation 11), such as an opioid with gabapentin, have been associated with 2138 increased risk of overdose compared with either medication alone (Chou et al., April 2020) . 2139 Opioid selection and dosage 2140 3. When starting opioid therapy for acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should prescribe 2141 immediate considera tions : 2144 Clinicians should not treat acute pain with ER/LA opioids or initiate opioid treatment for 2145 subacute or chronic pain with ER/LA opioids, and clinicians should not prescribe ER/LA opioids for 2146 intermittent or as needed use. 2147 ER/LA opioids should be reserved f or severe, continuous pain. Some ER/LA opioids should be 2148 considered only for patients who have received certain dosages of opioids (e.g., 60 mg daily of 2149 oral morphine, 30 mg daily of oral oxycodone, or equianalgesic dosages of other opioids) of 2150 immediate -release opioids daily for at least 1 week. 2151 When changing to an ER/LA opioid for a patient previously receiving a different immediate - 2152 release opioid, clinicians should consult product labeling and reduce total daily dosage to 2153 account for incomplete opioid c ross-tolerance. 2154 Clinicians should use additional caution with ER/LA opioids and consider a longer dosing interval 2155 when prescribing to patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction because decreased clearance of 2156 medications among these patients can lead to ac cumulation of drugs to toxic levels and 2157 persistence in the body for longer durations. 2158 92 Although there might be situations in which clinicians need to prescribe immediate -release and 2159 ER/LA opioids together (e.g., opioids to immediate -release 2160 opioids by temporarily using lower dosages of both), in general, avoiding the use of immediate - 2161 release opioids in combination with ER/LA opioids is preferable, given the potential increased risk 2162 for adverse events, including respiratory depression and overdose. 2163 Methadone should not be the first choice for an ER/LA opioid. Only clinicians who are familiar 2164 with methadone's unique risk profile and who are prepared to educate and closely monitor their 2165 patients, including assessing risk for Q T prolongation and considering electrocardiographic 2166 monitoring, should consider prescribing methadone for pain. 2167 Only clinicians who are familiar with the dosing and absorption properties of the ER/LA opioid 2168 transdermal fentanyl and are prepared to educate their patients about its use should consider 2169 prescribing it. morphine. e vidence reviews 2174 found effects of opioids on short -term pain and function were generally consistent across duration of 2175 action (short - or long -acting) and opioid type (opioid agonist, partial nisms 5 trials directly comparing different 2177 types of opioids found a mixed mechanism agent associated with greater pain relief versus a pure opioid 2178 agonist, with fewer nonserious adverse events (Chou et al., April 2020) . A fair -quality study showed a 2179 higher risk for overdose among patients treated with ER/LA opioids than among those treated with 2180 immediate -release opioids, especially within the first 2 weeks of therapy, with relative risk decreasing 2181 with longer duration of exposure (Chou et al., April 2020; Miller et al., 2015) . The clinical evidence 2182 reviews did no t find evidence that continuous, time -scheduled use of ER/LA opioids is more effective or 2183 safer than intermittent use of immediate -release opioids or that time -scheduled use of ER/ LA opioids 2184 reduces risks for opioid use disorder (Chou et al., April 2020) . In 2014, the FDA modified the labeling for 2185 ER/LA opioid pain medications, noting serious risks and recommending that ER/LA opioids be reserved 2186 93 for \"management of pain severe enough to require daily, around -the-clock, long -term opioid treatment\" 2187 when immediate -release opioids) are 2188 ineffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain\" 2189 and not used as \"as needed\" pain relievers (U.S. Food and Drug Adm inistration, 2013) . FDA has also 2190 noted that some ER/LA opioids are only appropriate for opioid -tolerant patients, defined as patients 2191 who have received certain dosages of opioids (e.g., 60 mg daily of oral morphine, 30 mg daily of oral 2192 oxycodone, or equ ianalgesic dosages of other opioids) for at least 1 week (U.S. Food and Drug 2193 Administration, 2014b) . Time -scheduled opioid use can be associated with greater total average daily 2194 opioid dosage compared wit h intermittent, as -needed opioid use (Von Korff et al., 2011) . Abuse - 2195 deterrent technologies have been employed to prevent manipulation intended to defeat extended - 2196 release properties of ER/LA opioids and to prevent opioid use by unintended routes of administration, 2197 such as intravenous inject ion of oral opioids. As indicated in FDA guidance for industry on evaluation and 2198 labeling of abuse -deterrent opioids (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2015a) , although abuse - 2199 deterrent technologies are expected to make manipulation of opioids more difficult or to reduce th e 2200 potent effects of manipulation, they do not prevent opioid misuse or overdose through oral intake the 2201 most common route of opioid misuse \u2014 and can still be misused by nonoral routes. The \"abuse - 2202 deterrent\" label does not indicate that there is no risk for misuse or opioid use disorder. No studies 2203 were found in the clinical evidence reviews assessing the effectiveness of abuse -deterrent technologies 2204 as a risk mitigation strategy for deterring or preventing opioid misuse, use disorder, or overdose (Chou 2205 et al., April 2020) . Experts agreed with the recommendation for clinicians to initiate opioid treatment 2206 with immediate -release o pioids extended -release/long -acting (ER/LA) opioids and 2207 appreciated discussion of the lack of evidence for \"abuse -deterrent\" formulations. 2208 In comparing different ER/LA formulations, the clinical evidence reviews found inconsistent 2209 results f or overdose risk with methadone versus other ER/LA opioids used for chronic pain, with two 2210 94 cohort studies of Medicaid beneficiaries finding methadone associated with increased risk of overdose 2211 or all -cause mortality versus morphine and one cohort study of Veterans Affairs patients finding 2212 methadone associated with decreased risk (Chou et al., April 2020) . Methadone has been associated 2213 with disproportionate numbers of overdose deaths relative to the frequency with which it is prescribed 2214 for pain (Paulozzi, Mack, & Jones, 2012) . In addition, methadone is associated with cardiac arrhythmias 2215 along with QT prolongation on the electrocardi ogram, and it has complicated pharmacokinetics and 2216 pharmacodynamics, including a long and variable half -life and peak respiratory depressant effect 2217 occurring later and lasting longer than peak analgesic effect (Grissinger, 2011; Lugo, In regard other ER/LA formulations, the 2219 absorption and pharmacodynamics of transdermal fentanyl are also complex, with gradually increasing 2220 serum concentration during the first part of the 72 -hour dosing inte rval, as well as variable absorption 2221 based on factors such as external heat. In addition, the dosing of transdermal fentanyl is in mcg/hour, 2222 which is not typical for a drug used by outpatients and can be confusing. These complexities might 2223 increase the ris k for fatal overdose when methadone or transdermal fentanyl is prescribed. 2224 Clinicians should not treat acute pain with ER/LA opioids or initiate opioid treatment for 2225 subacute or chronic pain with ER/LA opioids, and clinicians should not prescribe ER/LA op ioids for 2226 intermittent use. Given longer half -lives and longer duration of effects (e.g., respiratory depression) 2227 with ER/LA opioids such as methadone, fentanyl patches, as oxycodone, not prescribe ER/LA opioids for the treatment of acute pain. ER/LA opioids should be reserved for severe, continuous pain 2230 and should be considered only for patients who have received certain dosages of immediate -release 2231 opio ids daily (e.g., 60 mg daily of oral morphine, 30 mg daily of oral oxycodone, or equianalgesic 2232 dosages of other opioids) for at least 1 week. When changing to an ER/LA opioid for a patient previously 2233 receiving a different immediate -release opioid, clinicia ns should consult product labeling and reduce 2234 95 total daily dosage to account for incomplete opioid cross -tolerance. Clinicians should use additional 2235 caution with ER/LA opioids and consider a longer dosing interval when prescribing to patients with renal 2236 or hepatic dysfunction because decreased clearance of medications among these patients can lead to 2237 accumulation of medications to toxic levels and persistence in the body for longer durations. Although 2238 there might be situations in which clinicians need to pre scribe immediate -release and ER/LA opioids 2239 together (e.g., transitioning patients opioids to immediate -release opioids by temporarily 2240 using lower dosages of both or in patients with opioid use disorder treated and stabilized on methadone 2241 who nee d short -acting opioids for acute pain ), in general, avoiding the use of immediate -release opioids 2242 in combination with ER/LA opioids is preferable, given potentially increased risk. 2243 When an ER/LA opioid is prescribed, using one with predictable pharmacokin etics and 2244 pharmacodynamics is preferred to minimize unintentional overdose risk. In particular, unique 2245 characteristics of methadone and of transdermal fentanyl make safe prescribing of these medications 2246 for pain especially challenging. Methadone should not be the first choice for an ER/LA opioid. Only 2247 clinicians who are familiar with methadone's unique risk profile and who are prepared to educate and 2248 closely monitor their patients, including risk assessment for QT prolongation and consideration of 2249 electroca rdiographic monitoring, should consider prescribing methadone for pain. A clinical practice 2250 guideline regarding methadone prescribing for pain has been published previously (Chou et al., 2014) . 2251 Because dosing effects of transdermal fentanyl are often misunderstood by both clinicians and 2252 patients, only clinicians who are familiar with the dosing and absorption properties of transdermal 2253 fentanyl and are prepared to educate their patients about its use should consider prescribing it. 2254 2255 4. When opioids are initiated for opioid -na\u00efve patients with acute, subacute, or chronic pain , 2256 clinicians should prescribe the lowest dosage to achieve expected effects. If opioids are continued 2257 for subacute or chronic pain , clinicians should use caution when prescribing opioids at any dosage, 2258 96 should carefully evaluate individual benefits and risk s when considering increasing dosage , and 2259 should avoid increasing dosage above levels likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits relative 2260 to risks to patients (recommendation category: A, evidence type: 3). 2261 Implementation considerations : 2262 When opioids are initiated for opioid -na\u00efve patients with acute, subacute, or chronic pain , 2263 clinicians should prescribe the lowest dosage to achieve expected effects. 2264 For patients not already taking opioids, the lowest dose to achieve expected effects can be 2265 determin ed using product labeling as a starting point with calibration as needed based on the 2266 severity of pain and on other clinical factors such as renal or hepatic insufficiency (see 2267 Recommendation 8). 2268 The lowest starting dose for opioid -na\u00efve patients is often equivalent to a single dose of 2269 approximately 5 to 10 MME or a daily dosage of 20 -30 MME/day. A listing of common opioid 2270 medications and their dosage in MME equivalents is provided (Table). 2271 Risks of opioid use, including risk for overdose and overdose death, increase continuously with 2272 dosage, and there is no single dosage threshold below which risks are eliminated. 2273 If opioids are continued for subacute or chronic pain , clinicians should use caution when 2274 prescribing opioids at any dosage and sh ould generally avoid dosage increases when possible . 2275 Many patients do not experience benefit in pain or function from increasing opioid dosages to 2276 50 MME/day but are exposed to progressive increases in risk as dosage increases. Therefore, 2277 before increasi ng total opioid dosage to 50 MME/day, clinicians should pause and carefully 2278 reassess evidence of individual benefits and risks. If a decision is made to increase dosage, 2279 clinicians should use caution and increase dosage by the smallest practical amount. 2280 Additional dosage increases beyond 50 MME/day are progressively more likely to yield 2281 diminishing returns in benefits relative to risks to patients as dosage increases further. Clinicians 2282 should carefully evaluate a decision to further increase dosage based on individualized 2283 assessment of benefits and risks and weighing factors such as diagnosis, incremental benefits for 2284 pain and function relative to risks with previous dosage increases, other treatments and 2285 effectiveness, and patient values and preferences. 2286 The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, 2287 rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician -patient 2288 decision making. Further, these recommendations apply specific ally to starting opioids or to 2289 increasing opioid dosages, and a different set of benefits and risks applies to reducing opioid 2290 dosages (see Recommendation 5). 2291 2292 Supporting Rationale 2293 97 Benefits of high -dose opioids for pain are not well established. F ew trials evaluated opioid 2294 dosages of (90 MME/day) (Chou et al., April 2020) . Opioid dosages of 50 to 90 MME/ day were 2295 associated with a minimally greater (below the threshold for small) improvement in mean pain intensity 2296 compared with doses less than 50 MME/day (mean difference -0.26, 95% CI -0.57 to -0.02); there was 2297 no difference in mean improvement in function (Chou et al., April 2020) . Analyses of placebo -controlled 2298 trials also found some evidence of a plateauing effect at 50 mg o r greater MME/day (Chou et al., April 2299 2020) . One trial of more liberal dose escalation compared with maintenance of current dosage found no 2300 difference in outcomes related to pain or function (Chou et al., April 2020) . 2301 At the same time, risks for serious harms related to opioid therapy, including opioid misuse, 2302 overdose, and death, increase at higher opioid dosage, without a single point below which there is no 2303 risk (Coyle et al., 2018) . One cohort study from the clinical evidenc e reviews found higher dosages of 2304 opioids were associated with increased risk of all -cause mortality; one cohort study found modest 2305 associations between higher dose of long -term opioid and increased risk of falls and major trauma; one 2306 case -control study fo und opioid doses higher than 20 MME/day were associated with increased odds of 2307 road trauma injury when the analysis was restricted to drivers, with no dose -dependent association at 2308 doses higher than 20 MME/day; and cohort studies found association between higher opioid dose and 2309 risk of various endocrinological adverse events (Chou et al., April 2020) . Patients on higher doses 2310 reported reliance on opioids despite ambivalence about their benefits (Chou et al., April 2020) . 2311 Four observational studies identified in the clinical evidence reviews consistently found an 2312 association between higher doses of long -term opioids and risk of overdose or overdose mortality (Chou 2313 et al., April 2020) . Opioid dosages for chronic pain of 50 -<100 MME/day in observational studies have 2314 been associated with increased risks for opioid overdose by factors of 1.9 to 4.6 compared with dosages 2315 of 1-<20 MME/day, and dosages 100 MME/day with increased risks of overdose 2.0 -8.9 times the risk 2316 at 1-<20 MME/day, after adjusting for confounders based on demographics, comorbidities, concomitant 2317 98 medications, and other factors (Bohnert et al., 2011; Dunn et al., 2010; Go mes, Mamdani, Dhalla, 2318 Paterson, & Juurlink, 2011) . When prescribed for acute pain, similar associations have been found, with 2319 dosages of 50 -<100 MME/day associated with 4.73 times and dosages 100 MME/day associated with 2320 6.64 times the risk for opioid overdose compared with dosages of 1 -<20 MME/day (Bohnert et al., 2321 2011) . The MME cut points in these studies (e.g., 20 MME, 50 MME, 10 0 MME) were selected by the 2322 authors for research purposes, and while their findings are consistent with progressive increases in 2323 overdose risk being associated with increases in prescribed opioid dosages, they do not demonstrate a 2324 specific dosage threshold below which opioids are never associated with overdose. In a national sample 2325 of Veterans Health Administration patients with chronic pain who were prescribed opioids, mean 2326 prescribed opioid dosage among patients who died from opioid overdose was 98 MME (m edian 60 2327 MME) compared with mean prescribed opioid dosage of 48 MME (median 25 MME) among patients not 2328 experiencing fatal overdose (Bohnert, Logan, Ganoczy, A narra tive review conducted 2329 by FDA staff concluded that although there is not a single dosage threshold below which overdose risk is 2330 eliminated (Coyle et al., 2018) , the studies included in the review show an increasing risk of serious 2331 adverse health outcomes, including misuse, overdose, and death associated with increasing opioid dose. 2332 Note that these studies examined dose -response risk of overdose for full -agonist opioids and not for 2333 partial agonist opioids such as buprenorphine, which is unlikely to have the same continuous association 2334 between dosage and overdose risk because respiratory depressant effects of buprenorphine reach a 2335 plateau (Dahan et al., 2006) . 2336 Several experts expressed concern that including specific dosage thresholds in a main 2337 recommendation statement would emphasize them as \"authoritative\" absolutes and would lead to non - 2338 collaborative tapers or other potentially harmful consequences. In additi on, experts noted the lack of a 2339 single standard formula for calculating MMEs (Dasgupta et al., 2021) . However, experts agreed there is a 2340 need for thresholds as benchmarks and suggested instead including them in the supporting text 2341 99 following the main recommendation statement. Experts also agreed with separating recommendations 2342 on dosage into a recommendation applying to patients starting opioids and patients already receiving 2343 opioids at higher dosages. 2344 When opioids are used for acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should start opioids at the 2345 lowest possible effective dosage. For patients not already taking opioids, the lowest dose to achieve 2346 expected effects can be determined using product labeling as a starting point with calibration as 2347 needed based on the severity of pain and on other clinical factors such as renal or hepatic insufficiency 2348 (see Recommendation 8). The lowest starting dosage for opioid -na\u00efve patients is often equivalent to a 2349 single dose of approximately 5 to 10 MME or a daily dosage of 20 -30 MME/day. A listing of common 2350 opioid me dications and their dosage in MME equivalents is provided (Table). For example, a label for 2351 hydrocodone bitartrate usu al 2352 adult dosage is one or two tablets every four to six hours as needed for pain. The total daily dosage 2353 should not exceed 8 tablets. \" Clinicians should use additional caution when initiating opioids for patients 2354 aged 65 years and for patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency because of a potentially smaller 2355 therapeutic window between safe dosages and dosages associated with respiratory depression and 2356 overdose (see Recommendation 8). Formulations with lower opioid doses (e.g., hydrocodone bitartrate 2357 2.5 mg with acetaminophen 325 mg) are available and can facilitate dosing when additional caution is 2358 needed. Product labeling regarding tolerance includes guidance for patients already taking opioids. In 2359 addition to opioids, clinicians should consider cumulat ive dosages of other medications, such as 2360 acetaminophen, that are combined with opioids in many formulations and for which d ecreased 2361 clearance of medications might result in accumulation of medications to toxic levels. Acetaminophen 2362 can be hepatotoxic at dosages of >3 -4 grams/day and at lower dosages in patients with chronic alcohol 2363 use or liver disease (American Geriatrics Society Panel on the Pharmacological Management of 2364 Persistent Pain in Older Persons, 2009) . 2365 100 Clinicians should ge nerally avoid unnecessary dosage increases, use caution when increasing 2366 opioid dosages, and increase dosage by the smallest practical amount because overdose risk increases 2367 with increases in opioid dosage. Although there is limited evidence to recommend sp ecific intervals for 2368 dosage titration, rapid dosage increases put patients at greater risk for sedation, respiratory depression, 2369 and overdose. For opioid -na\u00efve outpatients with acute pain treated with an opioid for a few days or less, 2370 dosage increases are usually unnecessary and should not be attempted without close monitoring, given 2371 the risks of respiratory depression. In the context of long -term opioid use, when dosage is increased, 2372 clinicians should re -evaluate patients after increasing dosage for change s in pain, function, and risk for 2373 harm (see Recommendation 7). 2374 Before increasing total opioid dosage to 50 MME/day, clinicians should pause, given that 2375 dosage increases to more than 50 MME/day are unlikely to provide significantly improved pain control 2376 for most patients while overdose risk increases with dosage, and carefully reassess evidence of 2377 individual benefits and risks. If a patient's opioid dosage for all sources of opioids combined reaches or 2378 exceeds 50 MME/day, clinicians should implement additi onal precautions, including increased frequency 2379 of follow -up (see Recommendation 7) and offer naloxone and overdose prevention education to both 2380 patients and the patients' household members (see Recommendation 8). 2381 Additional dosage increases beyond 50 MM E/day are progressively more likely to yield 2382 diminishing returns in benefits relative to risks to patients, and clinicians should carefully evaluate a 2383 decision to increase dosage based on individualized assessment of benefits and risks and weighing 2384 factors such as diagnosis, incremental benefits for pain and function relative to risks with previous 2385 dosage increases, other treatments and effectiveness, and patient values and preferences. 2386 Some states require clinicians to implement clinical protocols at speci fic dosage levels. For 2387 example, before increasing long -term opioid therapy dosage to >120 MME/day, clinicians in Washington 2388 state must obtain consultation from a pain specialist who agrees that this is indicated and appropriate 2389 101 (State of Washington Department of Health, 2019) . Clinicians should be aware of rules related to MME 2390 thresholds and associated clinical protocols est ablished by their states. 2391 2392 5. For patients already receiving higher opioid dosages , clinicians should carefully weigh benefits and 2393 risks and exercise care when reducing or continuing opioid dosage. If risks outweigh benefits of 2394 continued opioid therapy, clinicians should optimize other therapies and work closely with 2395 patients to gradually taper to lower dosages or, if warranted based on the individual clinical 2396 circumstances of the patient, to appropriately taper and discontinue opioids. Unless th ere are 2397 indications of a life -threatening issue, such as warning signs of impending overdose, e.g., 2398 confusion, sedation, or slurred speech, opioid therapy should not be discontinued abruptly, and 2399 clinicians should not abruptly or rapidly reduce opioid dosa ges from higher dosages 2400 (recommendation category: B, evidence type: 4). 2401 Implementation considerations : 2402 Clinicians should consider tapering to a reduced opioid dosage, or tapering and discontinuing 2403 opioid therapy, and discuss these approaches with patient s prior to initiating changes, when 2404 risks outweigh benefits (potentially including avoiding risks of tapering) of continued opioid 2405 therapy. 2406 Patient agreement and interest in tapering is likely to be a key component of successful tapers. 2407 For patients agree ing to taper to lower opioid dosages as well as for those remaining on higher 2408 opioid dosages, clinicians should establish goals with the patient for continued opioid therapy 2409 (see Recommendations 2 and 7) and maximize pain treatment with nonpharmacologic an d 2410 nonopioid pharmacologic treatments as appropriate (see Recommendation 2). 2411 Clinicians should collaborate with the patient on the tapering plan, including patients in decisions 2412 such as how quickly tapering will occur and when pauses in the taper may be warranted. 2413 Clinicians should follow up frequently (at least monthly) with patients engaging in opioid 2414 tapering. 2415 When opioids are reduced or discontinued, a taper slow enough to minimize symptoms and signs 2416 of opioid withdrawal (e.g., anxiety, insomnia, ab dominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, diaphoresis, 2417 mydriasis, tremor, tachycardia, or piloerection) should be used. 2418 102 Tapers can be completed over several months to years depending on the opioid dosage and 2419 should be individualized based on patient goals and con cerns . Longer durations of previous 2420 opioid therapy might require longer tapers. 2421 Tapers of 10% per month or slower are likely to be better tolerated than more rapid tapers, 2422 particularly when patients have been taking opioids for longer durations (e.g., for a year or 2423 longer). 2424 Significant opioid withdrawal symptoms can signal the need to further slow the taper rate. 2425 At times, tapers might have to be paused and restarted again when the patient is ready and 2426 might have to be slowed once patients reach low dosa ges. 2427 Tapers should not be reversed without careful assessment of benefits and risks of increasing 2428 opioid dosage or without maximizing nonopioid treatments for pain and addressing behavioral 2429 distress. 2430 Once the smallest available dose is reached, the inter val between doses can be extended. 2431 Goals of the taper may vary \u2014some patients might achieve discontinuation; others might attain 2432 a reduced dosage. If the clinician has determined with the patient that the ultimate goal of 2433 tapering is discontinuing opioids, opioids may be stopped when taken less frequently than once a 2434 day. 2435 Clinicians should access appropriate expertise if considering tapering opioids during pregnancy 2436 because of possible risk to the pregnant patient and to the fetus if the patient goes into 2437 withdrawal. 2438 Clinicians should advise patients that there is an incre ased risk for overdose on abrupt return to a 2439 previously prescribed higher dose, caution that it takes as little as a week to lose tolerance, 2440 provide opioid overdose education, and offer naloxone. 2441 Clinicians should remain alert to signs of anxiety, depress ion, and opioid misuse or opioid use 2442 disorder (see Recommendations 8 and 12) that might be revealed by an opioid taper and provide 2443 treatment or arrange for management of these co -morbidities. 2444 Clinicians should closely monitor patients who are unable to ta per and who continue on high - 2445 dose or otherwise high -risk opioid regimens (e.g., opioids prescribed concurrently with 2446 benzodiazepines) and should work with patients to mitigate overdose risk (e.g., by providing 2447 overdose education and naloxone \u2014see Recommenda tion 8). 2448 Clinicians can use periodic and strategic motivational questions and statements to encourage 2449 movement toward appropriate therapeutic changes and functional goals. 2450 Clinicians have a responsibility to provide or arrange for coordinated management of patients' 2451 pain and opioid -related problems, including opioid use disorder. Clinicians should not abandon 2452 patients. 2453 103 Payers, health systems, and state medical boards should not use this clinical practice guideline to 2454 set rigid standards related to dose or duration of opioid therapy, and should ensure that policies 2455 based on cautionary dosage thresholds do not result in rapid tapers or abrupt discontinuation of 2456 opioids, and th at policies do not penalize clinicians for accepting new patients who are using 2457 prescribed opioids for chronic pain, including those receiving high doses of opioids. 2458 While Recommendation 5 specifically refers to patients using long -term, high -dose opioid 2459 therapy for subacute or chronic pain, many of the principles in these implementation 2460 considerations and supporting rationale, including communication with patients, pain 2461 management and behavioral support, and slower taper rates, are also relevant when 2462 discontinuing opioids in patients receiving shorter durations and/or lower -dosages (see also 2463 Recommendations 6 and 7). 2464 Supporting Rationale 2465 Patients receiving long -term, high dose opioid therapy for chronic pain are at increased risk for 2466 adverse events includi ng overdose mortality (Bohnert et 2010; Gomes et al., 2011; 2467 K. S. Gordon et al., 2020; Kaplovitch et al., 2015) . However, discontinuation of long -term, high dose 2468 opioid therapy has been associated with adverse events including mental health crisis, overdose events, 2469 and overdose mortality (Agnoli et al., 2021; K. S. Gordon et al., 2020; James et al., 2019; Mark & Parish, 2470 2019) . One study found that while sustained opioid therapy discontinuation (defined by the authors as 2471 opioid discontinuation for at least 3 months) was associated with an approximate 50% reduction in risk 2472 of overdose, dose variability was 2473 Narwaney, & Xu, 2019) Another study found that both starting and stopping opioids were associated 2474 with overdose or suicide risk; risk associated with stopping increased the longer patients ha d received 2475 opioids before stopping. Death rates for overdose or suicide increased immediately after starting or 2476 stopping treatment with opioids, with the incidence decreasing over about three to twelve months (E. 2477 M. Oliva et al., 2020) . In particular, discontinuation of opioids over short time periods has been 2478 associated with greater risks. FDA has advised that risks of rapid tapering or sudden discontinuation of 2479 opioids in physically dependent patients include acute withdrawal symptoms, exacerbation of pain, 2480 serious psychological distress, and thoughts of suicide (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2019c) . One 2481 104 observational study found that am ong adults prescribed stable higher opioid dosages (mean 50 2482 MME/day) long -term, increasing maximum monthly dose reduction velocity by 10% was associated with 2483 an adjusted incidence rate ratio of 1.09 for overdose (95% CI, 1.07 -1.11) and of 1.18 for mental health 2484 crisis (95% CI, 1.14 -1.21) (Agnoli et al., 2021) . Another study of long -term, high -dose (>120 2485 MME/day) opioid therapy found that each additional week of tapering time before opioid 2486 discontinuation was associated with a 7% relative reduction in the risk of opioid -related emergency 2487 department visits or hospitalizations (Mark & Parish, 2019) . The clinical evidence reviews did not find 2488 studies comparing different rates of opioid tapering, but a taper support intervention ( psychiatric 2489 consultation, opioid dosage tapering, and 18 weekly meetings with a physician assistant to explore 2490 motivation for tapering and learn pain self -management skills ) was associated with better functional 2491 outcomes (specifically improvement in pain interference) compared to usual care, with effects persisting 2492 at 34 -week follow -up (Chou et al., April 2020) . A systematic review (Frank et al., 2017) found that a mong 2493 studies rated as \"good\" or \"fair\" quality, when opioids were tapered following discussion with patients 2494 who agreed to taper, opioid dose reduction was associated with improved pain, function, and quality of 2495 life. Thes e results suggest that involving patients in decisions regarding continuation or discontinuation 2496 of opioid analgesics, as well as practices including behavioral support, integration of nonpharmacologic 2497 pain management, and slower tapers, may improve outcom es. 2498 Experts appreciated the complexity of managing patients already receiving higher dosages of 2499 opioids long -term. While some experts felt there should be more consideration of obtaining informed 2500 consent prior to tapering opioids, others believed that inf ormed discussion is more appropriate than 2501 informed consent when considering tapering opioids given clinicians' overriding responsibility to avoid 2502 providing treatment that harms patients. Some experts were concerned that over -emphasizing risks of 2503 tapering c ould increase harm from continued high -dosage opioid use. 2504 2505 105 Determining whether, when, and how to taper opioids 2506 The benefits and the risks of opioid therapy change over time and should be re -evaluated 2507 periodically (see Recommendations 6 and 7). Opioid ther apy should be limited to circumstances where 2508 benefits of therapy outweigh risks. Because tapering opioids can be harmful in some circumstances, 2509 benefits of continuing opioids in patients who have already received them long term might include 2510 avoiding risks of tapering and discontinuing opioids. In situations where benefits and risks of continuing 2511 opioids are considered to be close, shared decision -making with patients is particularly important. 2512 Unless there is a life -threatening issue, such as imminent over dose, the benefits of rapidly tapering or 2513 abruptly discontinuing opioids are unlikely to outweigh the significant risks of these practices (Mark & 2514 Parish, 2019; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2019a) . However, following slow, 2515 voluntary reduction of long -term opioid dosages, many patients report improvements in function, 2516 quality of life, anxiety, and mood with out worsening pain or with decreased pain levels (Frank et al., 2517 2017) . Clinicians and patients should consider whether opioids continue to meet treatment goals, 2518 whether opioids are exposing the patient to an increased risk for serious adverse events or opioid use 2519 disorder, and whether benefits continue to outweigh risks of opioids. Clinicians should not insist on 2520 opioid tapering or discontinuation when opioid use may be warranted (i.e., when benefits of opioids 2521 outweigh risks) (Kroenke et al., 2019; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2019a) . Clinicians 2522 should access appropriate expertise if considering tapering opioids during pregnancy because of 2523 possible risk to the pregnant patient and to the fetus if the patient go es into withdrawal. For pregnant 2524 people with opioid use disorder, medications for opioid use disorder are preferred over withdrawal 2525 management (i.e., discontinuation of opioids through either short - or medium -term tapering) (American 2526 Society of Addiction Medicine, 2015; Ecker et al., 2019; Substance Abuse and Mental Healt h Services 2527 Administration, 2018b) . 2528 106 Some patients using more than one respiratory depressant (e.g., benzodiazepines an d opioids) 2529 might require tapering one or more medications to reduce risk for respiratory depression. Tapering 2530 decisions and plans should be coordinated with prescribers of all respiratory depressant medications 2531 (see Recommendation 11). If benzodiazepines a re tapered, they should be tapered gradually due to risks 2532 of benzodiazepine withdrawal (anxiety, hallucinations, seizures, delirium tremens, and, in rare cases, 2533 death (Haque, Watson, & Bryant, 1990; Lann & Molina, 2009) ). Patie nts who are not actually taking 2534 opioids (such as patients who are diverting all opioids they obtain) do not require tapers. 2535 Consistent with the HHS Guide for Clinicians on the Appropriate Dosage Reduction or 2536 Discontinuation of Long -Term Opioid Analgesics (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2537 2019a) , clinicians should consider tapering to a reduced opioid dosage, or tapering and discontinuing 2538 opioid therapy, and discuss with these approaches with patients prior to initiating changes when 2539 The patient requests dosage reduction or discontinuation 2540 Pain improves and might indicate resolution of an underlying cause 2541 When opioid therapy has not meaningfully reduced pain or improved function 2542 The patient has been treated with opioids for a prolonged period (e.g., years), and current 2543 benefit -risk balance is unclear (e.g., decreased positive effects due to tolerance, symp toms such 2544 as reduced focus or memory that might be due to opioids) 2545 The patient is receiving higher opioid doses without evidence of benefit from the higher dose 2546 The patient experiences side effects that diminish quality of life or impair function 2547 There is current evidence of opioid misuse 2548 The patient experiences an overdose or other serious event (e.g., an event leading to 2549 hospitalization or injury ) or has warnin g signs for an impending event such as confusion, 2550 sedation, or slurred speech 2551 107 The patient is receiving medications (e.g., benzodiazepines) or has medical conditions (e.g., lung 2552 disease, sleep apnea, liver disease, kidney disease, fall risk, advanced age) that increase risk for 2553 adverse outcomes 2554 2555 Clinicians should review benefits and risks of continued high -dose opioid therapy with patients . 2556 Established patients already taking high dosages of opioids, as well as patients transferring from other 2557 clinicians, might consider the possibility of opioid dosage reduction to be substantially anxiety - 2558 provoking, and tapering opioids can be especially challenging after years on high dosages because of 2559 physical and psychological dependence. However, patients should be o ffered the opportunity to re - 2560 evaluate their continued use of opioids at high dosages. Clinicians should empathically review benefits 2561 and risks of continued high -dosage opioid therapy and should offer to work collaboratively with the 2562 patient to taper opioid s to safer dosages. 2563 Whenever possible, clinicians should collaborate with patients in making decisions about 2564 whether and how to taper opioids and share decision -making with patients. Whether the goal of the 2565 taper is stopping opioids or reducing opioids to a point where benefits outweigh risks depends on the 2566 individual patient's circumstances and individualized assessment of benefits and risks, informed by open 2567 discussion between the patient and clinician. Tapering is more likely to be successful when patie nts 2568 collaborate in the taper (Dowell & Haegerich, 2017) . Clinicians should review risks and benefits of the 2569 current therapy with the patient and decide i f tapering is appropriate based on individual circumstances. 2570 Clinicians can discuss with patients their perceptions of risks, benefits, and adverse effects of continued 2571 opioid therapy, include patient concerns in taper planning, and include patients in dec isions such as 2572 which medication will be decreased first and how quickly tapering will occur . If the current opioid 2573 regimen does not put the patient at imminent risk, tapering does not need to occur immediately, and 2574 clinicians can take time to obtain patien t buy -in (Dowell & Haegerich, 2017) . For patients who agree to 2575 108 taper opioids to lower dosages, clinicians should collaborate with the patient on a taperi ng plan, 2576 including patients in decisions, such as which medication will be decreased first (e.g., in patients 2577 prescribed more than one opioid) and how quickly tapering will occur. 2578 Advice to patients prior to tapering 2579 Patients should be advised that overall, following voluntary reduction of long -term opioid 2580 dosages, most patients report stable or improved function, anxiety, and mood without worsening pain 2581 or even with decreased pain levels (Berna, Kulich, & Rathmell, 2015; et al., et al., 2019; et al., 2017) . Other patients report insomnia, 2583 anxiety, depression, and increased pain, particularly in the short t erm (Berna et al., 2015; Goesling et al., Tauben, & 2020) . Increased pain may be related to hyperalgesia or opioid withdrawa l and can 2586 be prolonged in some patients (Manhapra et al., 2018) . It can be helpful to counsel patients that 2587 worsening of pain is a frequent s ymptom of opioid withdrawal that tends to diminish over time (U.S. 2588 Department of Health and Human Services, 2019a) . Clinicians should advise patients that there is an 2589 increased risk for overdose on abrupt return to a previously prescribed higher dose, caution that it takes 2590 as little as a week to lose tolerance, and warn that there is a risk of overdose if they return to their 2591 original dose (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense, 2017) . Clinicians should 2592 provid e opioid overdose offer naloxone. 2593 Pain management during tapering 2594 Clinicians should commit to working with patients to improve function and decrease pain, 2595 whether or not opioids are tapered. Nonopioid treatments should be integrated into patients' pain 2596 management plans based on an individualized assessment of benefits an d risks considering the patient's 2597 diagnosis, circumstances, and unique needs (see Recommendation 2). Integrating behavioral and 2598 nonopioid pain therapies before and during a taper can help manage pain (Frank et al., 2017 ) and 2599 109 strengthen the therapeutic relationship. For patients agreeing to taper to lower opioid dosages as well 2600 as for those remaining on higher opioid dosages, clinicians should establish goals with the patient for 2601 continued opioid therapy (see Recommenda tions 2 and 7) and maximize pain treatment with 2602 nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic treatments as appropriate (see Recommendation 2). 2603 Behavioral health support during tapering 2604 Integrating behavioral and nonopioid pain therapies and treatment for c omorbid mental health 2605 conditions before and during a taper can help manage pain (Frank et al., 2017) , strengthen the 2606 therapeutic relationship, and improve the likelihood of positive tapering outcomes (Sullivan et al., 2017) . 2607 Mental health co -morbidities including depression and anxiety are common in patients with painful 2608 conditions, especially in patients receiving long -term opioid therapy (Sullivan, 2 018) . Depressive 2609 symptoms predict taper dropout (Berna et al., 2015; Darnall et al., 2018) . Primary care clinicians should 2610 collaborate with mental health specialists and with other spe cialty clinicians as needed to optimize 2611 nonopioid pain management (see Recommendation 2), as well as psychosocial support for anxiety 2612 related to the taper. Clinicians should consider arranging for consultation with a behavioral health 2613 specialist before initiating a taper in patients with serious mental illness, who are at high suicide risk, or 2614 with suicidal ideation (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2019a) . Clinicians should remain 2615 alert to signs of anxiety, depression, and opioid misuse or opioid use disorder (see Recommendations 8 2616 and 12) that might be reveale d by an opioid taper and provide treatment or arrange for management of 2617 these co -morbidities. Successful tapering studies have used at least weekly follow -up (Frank et al., 2618 2017) , and clinicians should follow up frequ ently (at least monthly) with patients engaging in opioid 2619 tapering. Clinicians can acknowledge patient fears about tapering (Veterans Health Administration PBM 2620 Academic Detailing Service, 2016) , ask how they can support the patient (Veterans Health 2621 Administration PBM Academic Detailing Service, 2016) , and make sure patients receive appropriate and 2622 accessible psychosocial support (Sullivan et al., 2017; U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and 2623 110 Department of Defense, 2017) . Many patients fear stigma, withdrawal symptoms, pain, and/or 2624 abandonment (Henry et al., 2019) , and it can be helpful to tell patients what to expect (e.g ., the rate will 2625 be kept slow to minimize withdrawal symptoms; pain may worsen at first but usually improves over 2626 time) and that the clinician will support them through the process. 2627 Tapering rate 2628 Evidence to support specific tapering rates is limited. The rate of tapering should be 2629 individualized based on the clinical situation of the patient. When opioids are reduced or discontinued, a 2630 taper slow enough to minimize symptoms and signs of opioid withdrawal (e.g., anxiety, insomnia, 2631 abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, diaphoresis, mydriasis, tremor, tachycardia, or piloerection) should 2632 be used. Tapers can be completed over several months to years depending on the opioid dosage and 2633 should be individualized based on patient goals and concerns . Longer durations of previous opioid 2634 therapy might require longer tapers. Evidence on optimal taper rate is emerging. Tapers of 2635 approximately 10% per month or slower are likely to be better tolerated than more rapid tapers, 2636 particularly when patients have been taking opioid s for longer durations (e.g., for a year or longer). A 2637 decrease of 10% of the original dose per week or slower (until approximately 30% of the original dose is 2638 reached, followed by a weekly decrease of approximately 10% of the remaining dose) is unlikely to 2639 trigger withdrawal (Berna et al., 2015) and can be successful for some patients, particularly after opioid 2640 use for weeks to months ra ther than years. Significant opioid withdrawal symptoms can signal the need 2641 to further slow the taper rate. At times, tapers might have to be paused and restarted again when the 2642 patient is ready and might have to be slowed once patients reach low dosages t o allow gradual 2643 accommodation to lower opioid dosages and development of new skills for management of pain and 2644 emotional distress. Tapers should not be reversed without careful assessment of benefits and risks of 2645 increasing opioid dosage or without maximiz ing nonopioid treatments for pain and addressing 2646 behavioral distress (Rich et al., 2020) . Once the smallest available dose is reached, the interval between 2647 111 doses can be extended. If t he clinician has determined with the patient that the goal is discontinuing 2648 opioids, opioids may be stopped when taken less frequently than once a day. 2649 More rapid tapers might be needed for patient safety under certain circumstances (e.g., for 2650 patients wh o have experienced overdose on their current dosage). However, unless there are 2651 indications of a life -threatening issue, such as warning signs of impending overdose , opioid therapy 2652 should not be discontinued abruptly, and clinicians should not abruptly red uce opioid dosages from 2653 higher dosages. When opioids have been prescribed continuously for longer than a few days, sudden 2654 discontinuation may precipitate significant opioid withdrawal (Mark & Parish, 2019) . Rapid tapering or 2655 sudden discontinuation of opioids in physically dependent patients can also increase risks of 2656 psychological distress and opioid -related emergency department visits and hospitalizations (Mark & 2657 Parish, 2019; U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2019c) . Ultrarapid detoxification under anesthesia is 2658 associated with substantial risks, including death, and should not be used (Berlin et al., 2013) . 2659 Managem ent of opioid withdrawal during tapering 2660 The first approach to withdrawal symptoms and signs should generally be consideration of 2661 slowing or pausing the taper rate. If needed, short -term oral medications might also help manage 2662 withdrawal symptoms (Veterans Health Adminis tration PBM Academic Detailing Service, 2016) . These 2663 include alpha -2 agonists for the management of autonomic signs and symptoms (e.g., sweating, 2664 tachycardia). Alpha -2 agonists clonidine and lofexidine are more effective than placebo in reducing 2665 severit y of withdrawal (Gowing, Farrell, Ali, & White, 2016) from heroin or methadone in the context of 2666 abrupt (not gradual) discontinuation. There is not similar research in patients tapering from long -term 2667 opioid treatment for pain (Berna et al., 2015) , but the alpha -2 agonist tizanidine has been used to help 2668 taper patients from long -term, high -dose opioids for chronic pain (Sturgeon et al., 2020) . Other 2669 medications addressing specific symptoms (NSAIDs, ac etaminophen, or topical menthol/methyl 2670 or bismuth subsalicylate 2672 for diarrhea) have a lso been used (Veterans Health Administration PBM Academic Detailing Service, 2673 2016) . 2674 Tapering when patients have opioid use disorder 2675 Some patients with unanticipated challenges to tapering, such as inability to make progress in 2676 tapering despite opioid -related harm, might have undiagnosed opioid use disorder. Therefore, patients 2677 experiencin g such challenges should be assessed for opioid use disorder using Diagnostic and Statistical 2678 Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition ) criteria and if criteria for opioid use disorder are met, offered 2679 medication treatment (see Recommendation 12) and nalo xone for opioid overdose reversal (see 2680 Recommendation 8). 2681 Other challenges to tapering 2682 Emerging evidence suggests that patients for whom risks of continued high -dose opioid use 2683 outweigh benefits but who are unable to taper and who do not meet criteria for opioid use disorder 2684 might benefit from transition to buprenorphine (Chou, Ballantyne, & Lembke, 2019; Fishman & Kim, 2685 2018; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2019a) . Buprenorphine is an opioid partial 2686 agonist that can treat pain as well as opioid use disorder (Pade, Cardon, Hoffman, & Geppert, 2012) , and 2687 has other properties that may be helpful (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of 2688 Defense, 2017) , including less respiratory depression (Dahan et al., 2006) and overdose risk than other 2689 opioids (Chou et al., 2019) . While overdose is less likely with buprenorphine than with full agonist 2690 opioids , overdose is still possible, particularly if buprenorphine is taken concurrently with other 2691 respiratory depressants, such as full agonist opioids, benzodiazepines, or alcohol (Paone et al., 2015) . A 2692 specialty clinic offering opioid tapering services for patients receiving high -dosage opioids (defined in 2693 this study as >90 MME/day) for chronic pain f ound that 44.6% of patients referred for opioid taper were 2694 113 able to successfully taper to <90 MME/day, and an additional 18.8% who were unable to taper were 2695 able to successfully transition to sublingual buprenorphine (Sturgeon et al., 2020) . Different 2696 buprenorphine products, available at different doses, are approved for the trea tment of pain (e.g., 2697 Belbuca, Butrans) and for the treatment of opioid use disorder (e.g., Suboxone). While prescription of 2698 buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorder requires the clinician to have a waiver from the 2699 Substance Abuse and Mental Healt h Services Administration (SAMHSA) (see Recommendation 12), 2700 prescription of buprenorphine for treatment of chronic pain does not require a waiver (Chou et al., 2701 2019) . 2702 To avoid precipitating withdrawal, transitioning any patient taking full agonist opioids to 2703 buprenorphine requires careful timing of the initial buprenorphine dose (U.S. Department of Health and 2704 Human Services, 2019a) (see Recommendation 12 for application to patients with opioid use disorder). 2705 Patients should be in mild to moderate withdrawal from full agonist opioids before the first 2706 buprenorphine dose (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2019a) . To do this, it has been 2707 advised to wait at least 8 to 12 hours after the last dose of short -acting full agonist opioids and waiting 2708 longer following the last dose of long -acting f ull agonist opioids (e.g., at least 12-24 hours after the last 2709 dose of an ER/LA full -agonist opioid, longer for methadone) before the first dose of buprenorphine 2710 (Manhapra et al., 2018) . As an alternative for patients not yet in opioid withdrawal, some authors have 2711 described low dose initiation of buprenorphine to allow for initiation of buprenorphine in patients 2712 currently receiving full agoni st opioids for acute or chronic pain (Cohen et al., 2021 ). SAMHSA's 2713 Providers Clinical Support System ( https://pcssnow.org/ ) offers training and technical assistance as well 2714 as mentors to assist clinicians who are unfamiliar wi th initiation of buprenorphine and have additional 2715 questions related to the diagnosis and treatment of opioid use disorder in particular. Because the 2716 duration of action for analgesia is shorter than the duration of action for suppression of opioid 2717 withdraw al and stabilization of opioid use disorder Compton, & Samet, 2006) , dosing 2718 114 buprenorphine for pain is typically multiple times daily (e.g., 8mg sublingual tablet three times a day) 2719 rather than once a day dosing as done fo r the treatment of OUD (Manhapra et al., 2018; U.S. 2720 Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense, 2017) . 2721 Continuing high -dosage opioids 2722 Clinicians should closely monitor patients who are unable to taper and who continue on high - 2723 dose or otherwise high -risk opioid regimens (e.g., opioids prescribed concurrently with benzodiazepines) 2724 and should work with patients to mitigate overdose risk (e.g., by providing overdose education and 2725 naloxone \u2014see Recommendation 8). Clinicians can use periodic and strategic motiv ational questions and 2726 statements to encourage movement toward appropriate therapeutic changes (Dowell & Haegerich, 2727 2017) . Increasing opioid dosage in pat ients already receiving high dosages is likely to be associated with 2728 diminishing returns for pain relief and increased risks for adverse effects and should be avoided. 2729 Management of chronic pain with opioids can be challenging, as can management of opioid 2730 discontinuation (Dowell, Haegerich, et al., 2019) . However, clinicians have a responsibility to provide or 2731 arrange for coordinated management of patients' pain and opioid -related challenges. Clinicians 2732 should not abandon patients. Payers and health systems should not use this clinical practice guideline 2733 to set rigid standards related to dose or duration of opioid therapy, should ensure that policies based 2734 on cautionary dosage thresholds do not result in rapid tapers or abrupt discon tinuation of opioids. 2735 Care should be taken to ensure that policies do not penalize clinicians for accepting new patients who 2736 are receiving opioids for chronic pain. Patients prescribed opioids but unable to access ongoing care 2737 (Lagisetty et al., 2019) may be at risk for abrupt opioid discontinuation and may miss opportunities to 2738 receive life -saving interventions, including monitoring for and management of mental health and 2739 substance use co -morbidities . 2740 Opioid duration and follow -up 2741 115 6. When opioi ds are needed for acute pain, clinicians should prescribe no greater quantity than 2742 needed for the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids (recommendation 2743 category: A, evidence type: 4). 2744 Implementation considerations : 2745 Nontraumatic, nonsurgical acute pain can often be managed without opioids (see 2746 Recommendation 1). 2747 Opioids are sometimes needed for treatment of acute pain (see Recommendation 1). When the 2748 diagnosis and severity of acute pain warrant use of opioids, clinic ians should prescribe no greater 2749 quantity than needed for the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids. For 2750 many common causes of nontraumatic, nonsurgical pain, when opioids are needed, a few days 2751 or less are often sufficient, and shorte r courses can minimize the need to taper opioids to prevent 2752 withdrawal symptoms at the end of a course of opioids. However, durations should be 2753 individualized based on the clinical circumstances of the specific patient . 2754 Clinicians should generally avoid pr escribing additional opioids to patients \"just in case\" pain 2755 continues longer than expected. 2756 For postoperative pain related to major surgery, procedure -specific opioid prescribing 2757 recommendations are available with ranges for amounts of opioids needed (ba sed on actual use 2758 and refills and on consensus). 2759 To minimize unintended impact on patients with an unexpectedly prolonged duration of severe 2760 acute pain, clinicians, practices, and health systems should have mechanisms in place to provide 2761 timely re -evaluat ion for the subset of patients who experience severe acute pain that continues 2762 longer than the expected duration to confirm or revise the initial diagnosis and to adjust 2763 management accordingly . In particular, clinicians, practices, and health systems shoul d ensure 2764 all patients can access and afford additional evaluation and treatment, as needed, to minimize 2765 disparities across patients based on access to and affordability of care and refills . 2766 Longer durations of opioid therapy are more likely to be needed when the mechanism of injury is 2767 expected to result in prolonged severe pain (e.g., severe traumatic injuries). 2768 Patients should be evaluated at least every 2 weeks if they continue to receive opioids for acute 2769 pain. 2770 If opioids are continued for a month or longer, clinicians should refer to recommendations on 2771 subacute and chronic pain for follow -up (Recommendation 7 ) and tapering (Recommendation 5). 2772 If patients already receiving long -term opioids require additional opioids for superimposed 2773 severe acute pain (e.g., major surgery), opioids should be continued only for the duration of pain 2774 severe enough to require addi tional opioids, returning to the patient's baseline opioid dosage as 2775 soon as possible, including a taper to baseline dosage if additional opioids were used around the 2776 clock for more than a few days. 2777 If opioids are prescribed continuously (around the clock ) for more than a few days for acute pain, 2778 clinicians should prescribe a taper to minimize withdrawal symptoms on discontinuation of 2779 opioids. 2780 116 Taper durations might need to be adjusted depending on the duration of the initial opioid 2781 prescription (see suppo rting rationale for this recommendation for additional details). 2782 Tapering plans should be discussed with the patient prior to hospital discharge and with 2783 clinicians coordinating the patient's care as an outpatient. For tapering considerations when 2784 patient s have taken opioids continuously for longer than one month, see Recommendation 5. 2785 2786 Supporting Rationale 2787 Data suggest that for many patients presenting with common types of acute pain in primary 2788 care or emergency department settings, pain improves within days. Analysis of nationwide U.S. 2789 commercial insurance claims in 2014 found median durations of initial opioid analgesic prescriptions for 2790 acute pain indications in primary care settings were 4 -7 days (Mundkur et al., 2019) , suggesting that in 2791 most cases, clinicians considered an initial opioid prescription of 4 to 7 days' duration sufficient. Some 2792 patients (17.8%, ranging from 11.7% to 30.0% depending on the acute pain condition) obtained at least 2793 one refill within 30 days after their initial opioid prescription, suggesting that while for most patients, 2794 these durations might have been sufficient or more than necessa ry, there is likely to be variation across 2795 diagnoses and among patients in time to recovery. In an older study of the course of acute low back 2796 pain (not associated with malignancies, infections, spondyloarthropathies, fractures, or neurological 2797 signs) in a primary care setting, there was a large decrease in pain until the fourth day after treatment 2798 with paracetamol, with smaller decreases thereafter (Coste, Delecoeuillerie, de Lara, LeParc, & Paolaggi, 2799 1994) . A more recent single -center survey of patients prescribed opioids for acute pain on emergency 2800 department discharge (McCarthy et al., 2021) found that patients taking opioids continued them for a 2801 median of 4 days (interquartile range [IQR] 2 -7 days), including on the day of discharge, with vari ation 2802 across patients and diagnoses. Median numbers of days that patients continued taking prescribed 2803 opioids were 6 (IQR 4 -8) for back pain and for fractures, 2 (IQR 1 -5) for renal colic, 5.5 (IQR 4 -7) for 2804 musculoskeletal injury, and 3 (IQR 2 -6) for other diagnoses. Most patients (92.5%) reported having 2805 leftover pills, with 52.2% of pills unused overall. A Canadian study following patients for 14 days after 2806 117 discharge from the emergency department with opioid prescriptions for acute pain (Daoust et al., 2018) 2807 similarly found most (68%) total prescribed opioids were unused, and that t he quantity of morphine 2808 5mg tablets to prescribe in order to adequately s upply 80% of the patients with the amount of opioids 2809 they actually used was 20 tablets for musculoskeletal pain, 30 for fracture, 15 for renal colic or 2810 abdominal pain, and 20 for other pain conditions. 2811 Multiple studies since 2017 have found that many pati ents do not use all prescribed opioids 2812 after surgery and that prescribing a lower quantity of opioids postoperatively is associated with less 2813 opioid use without increases in pain score or in requests for refills of pain medication, and without 2814 significant reductions in satisfaction with pain management (Hill et al., 2017; Hill, Stucke, McMahon, et 2815 al., 2018; Howard et al., 2018) . One study found that, following 5 common surgical procedures, median 2816 opioid consumption was three 5mg ox ycodone pills or les s, and that following consensus 2817 recommendations intended to reduce unnecessary postoperative opioid prescribing published in 2018 2818 and 2019 would still result in 47% to 56% of pills prescribed remaining unused (K. A. Robinson et al., 2819 2020) . There is also evidence of variation in opioid needs across patients undergoing the same 2820 procedures based on individual factors including pa in at discharge and prior opioid use (Mallama et al., 2821 2021) . One study found that while a majority of patients us ed no or few (less than a total of 50 MME 2822 during their entire postoperative course) opioids, some patients required opioids for up to 15 days after 2823 surgery (Thiels et al., 2018) . 2824 The cl inical evidence reviews found observational evidence that opioid use for acute pain is 2825 associated with long -term opioid use, and that a greater amount of early opioid exposure is associated 2826 with greater likelihood of long -term use, noting recent evidence f or a dose and duration -response 2827 relationship (Brat et al., 2018; Brummett et al., 2017; Mundkur et al., 2019; National of State 2828 Legislatures, June 30, 2019.; Reznikoff, 2018; Shah et al., . Opioids prescribed for sur gery and other 2829 acute pain conditions that go unused (Bartels et al., 2016; Bicket, Long, Pronovost, Alexander, et al., 2021; Neuman, Bateman, & Wunsch, 2019) are a potential source for misuse and 2831 diversion. In addition, sudden discontinuation of opioids used continuously for longer than a few days 2832 may result in significant opioid withdrawal (Mark & Parish, 2019) . Therefore, limiting duration of opioids 2833 prescribed can minimize the need for a taper to prevent dist ressing or unpleasant withdrawal 2834 symptoms. 2835 Many common causes of nonsurgical, nontraumatic acute pain can often be managed without 2836 opioids (see Recommendation 1). When the diagnosis and severity of acute pain warrant the use of 2837 opioids, clinicians should prescribe no greater quantity than needed for the expected duration of pain 2838 severe enough to require opioids. A few days or less are often sufficient when opioids are needed for 2839 many common causes of nonsurgical acute pain and limiting th e duration of opioid therapy can 2840 minimize the need to taper to prevent withdrawal symptoms at the end of the course of opioids as well 2841 as limiting unused opioids. Certain circumstances (e.g., severe traumatic injuries) might require use of 2842 opioids for dura tions greater than 7 days. Durations should be individualized based on the clinical 2843 circumstances of the specific patient. 2844 When patients are discharged from the hospital following surgery, the course and dosage of any 2845 opioid medications given during hospit alization and prior to discharge can help predict ongoing pain 2846 management needs (Hill, Stucke, Billmeier, et al., 2018; Joo postoperative pain, -specific opioid prescribing recommendations are available with ranges 2848 for amounts of opioids needed (based on actual use and refills and on consensus) (Michigan Opioid 2849 Prescribing Engagement Network, 2020; Overton et al., 2018) (Thiels et al., 2018) . 2850 Clinicians should generally not prescribe additional opioids to patients \"just in case\" pain 2851 continu es longer than expected. However, in the event that pain continues longer than expected, it 2852 might be challenging for some patients to successfully navigate the healthcare system (e.g., clinician and 2853 pharmacy contact, transportation, need for assistance) to obtain additional medication as needed, 2854 119 leading to potential disparities in treatment. Clinicians, practices, and health systems should have 2855 mechanisms in place to provide timely re -evaluation for the subset of patients who experience severe 2856 acute pain th at continues longer than the expected duration to confirm or revise the initial diagnosis 2857 and to adjust pain management accordingly. In particular, clinicians, practices, and health systems 2858 should ensure all patients can access and afford additional evalua tion and treatment as needed to 2859 minimize disparities across patients based on access to and affordability of care and refills . 2860 Patients should be evaluated at least every 2 weeks if they continue to receive opioids for acute 2861 pain, and if opioids are conti nued for a month or longer, clinicians should refer to recommendations on 2862 subacute and chronic pain for follow -up (Recommendation 7) and tapering (Recommendation 5). If 2863 patients already receiving long -term opioids require additional opioids for superimpose d severe acute 2864 pain (e.g., major surgery), opioids should be continued only for the duration of pain severe enough to 2865 require additional opioids, returning to the patient's baseline opioid dosage as soon as possible, 2866 including a taper to baseline dosage if additional opioids were used around the clock for more than a 2867 few days. 2868 If opioids are prescribed continuously (around the clock) for more than a few days for acute 2869 pain, clinicians should prescribe a taper to minimize withdrawal symptoms on discontinuati on of 2870 opioids. Taper durations might need to be adjusted depending on the duration of the initial opioid 2871 prescription. For example, if opioids are used continuously for more than 3 days but for less than one 2872 week, clinicians can consider reducing the daily dosage to 50% for 2 days to ameliorate withdrawal 2873 when discontinuing opioids. When patients have taken opioids continuously for at least one week but 2874 less than one month, clinicians might consider a slower taper (e.g., reducing the daily dosage by 2875 approxi mately 20% every 2 days), a range consistent with tapering rates successfully used in studies of 2876 postoperative opioid prescribing (Joo et al., 2020; 2020) . When patients are discharged 2877 from the hospital following surgery, opioid dosages needed during hospitalization and prior to discharge 2878 120 can help predict tapering needs to prevent withdrawal (Hill, Stucke, Billmeier, et al., 2018; Joo et al., 2879 2020; Tamboli et al., 2020) . Tapering plans should be discussed with the patient prior to discharge and 2880 with clinicians coordinating the patient's care as an outpatient. For tapering considerations when 2881 patients have taken opioids continuously for longer than one mon th, see Recommendation 5. 2882 2883 7. Clinicians should evaluate benefits and risks with patients within 1 to 4 weeks of starting opioid 2884 therapy for subacute or chronic pain or of dose escalation. Clinicians should evaluate benefits and 2885 risks of continued therapy with patients every 3 months o r more frequently (recommendation 2886 category: A, evidence type: 4). 2887 Implementation considerations : 2888 In addition to evaluating benefits and risks of opioids before starting opioid therapy (see 2889 Recommendation 2), clinicians should evaluate patients to assess benefits and risks of opioids 2890 within 1 to 4 weeks of starting long -term opioid therapy or of dose escalation. 2891 Clinicians should consider follow -up intervals within the lower end of this range when ER/LA 2892 opioids are started or increased, given increased ri sk for overdose within the first 2 weeks of 2893 treatment, or when total daily opioid dosage is 50 MME/day. (Note: Overdose risk is doubled 2894 across multiple studies for dosages of 50 to <100 MME/day relative to <20 MME/day - see 2895 Recommendation 4). 2896 Shorter fol low-up intervals (within 3 days) should be strongly considered when starting or 2897 increasing the dosage of methadone, given the variable half -life of this drug (see 2898 Recommendation 3) and the potential for drug accumulation during initiation and during 2899 upward titration of dosage. 2900 An initial follow -up interval closer to 4 weeks can be considered when starting immediate -release 2901 opioids at a dosage <50 MME/day. 2902 Clinicians should regularly reassess all patients receiving long -term opioid therapy, including 2903 patie nts who are new to the clinician but on long -term opioid therapy, at least every 3 months. 2904 Clinicians seeing new patients already receiving opioids should establish treatment goals for 2905 continued opioid therapy (see Recommendation 2). 2906 Clinicians should re -evaluate patients who are at higher risk for opioid use disorder or overdose 2907 (e.g., patients with depression or other mental health conditions, a history of substance use 2908 disorder, a history of overdose, taking 50 MME/day, or taking other central nervous system 2909 depressants with opioids) more frequently than every 3 months. 2910 121 To minimize unintended impact on patients with challenges in accessing or affording follow -up 2911 visits, practices, and health systems should work to ensure all patients can access and af ford 2912 follow -up evaluation . 2913 In practice contexts where virtual visits are part of standard care (e.g., in remote areas where 2914 distance or other context makes follow -up visits challenging), follow -up assessments that allow 2915 the clinician to communicate with a nd observe the patient through telehealth modalities may be 2916 conducted. 2917 At follow -up, clinicians should review patient perspectives and goals, determine whether opioids 2918 continue to meet treatment goals, including sustained improvement in pain and function; 2919 whether the patient has experienced common or serious adverse events or early warning signs of 2920 serious adverse events or has signs of opioid use disorder. 2921 Clinicians should ensure that treatment for depression, anxiety, or other psychological co - 2922 morbidit ies is optimized. 2923 Clinicians should ask patients about their preferences for continuing opioids, given their effects 2924 on pain and function relative to any adverse effects experienced. If risks outweigh benefits of 2925 continued opioid therapy (e.g., if patient s do not experience meaningful, sustained 2926 improvements in pain and function compared with prior to initiation of opioid therapy; if 2927 patients are taking higher -risk regimens dosages 50 or without eviden ce of benefit; if patients believe benefits no longer outweigh 2929 risks; if patients request dosage reduction or discontinuation; or if patients experience overdose 2930 or other serious adverse events) , clinicians should work with patients to reduce opioid dosage or 2931 to discontinue opioids when possible, using principles from Recommendation 5. 2932 Clinicians should maximize pain treatment with nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic 2933 treatments as appropriate (see Recommendation 2). 2934 Supporting Rationale 2935 Although the clinical evidence reviews did not find studies evaluating the effectiveness of more 2936 frequent monitoring intervals (Chou et al., April 2020) , they did identify an observational study (Edlund 2937 et al., 2014) finding risk for opioid use disorder was associated with con tinuing opioid therapy for 3 2938 months or longer. In addition, the reviews identified a study finding that risk for overdose associated 2939 with ER/LA opioids might be particularly high during the first 2 weeks of treatment (Miller et al., 2015) . 2940 Another study fou nd the first 3 months after opioid initiation to be a higher risk period for opioid 2941 overdose (E. M. Oliva et al., 2020) . Patients who do not have pain relief with opioids at 1 month are 2942 unlikely to experience pain relief with opioids at 6 months (Kalso, Simpson, Slappendel, Dejo nckheere, & 2943 122 Richarz, 2007) . Although evidence is insufficient to determine at what point within the first 3 months of 2944 opioid therapy the risks for opioid use disorder increase, reassessment of pain and function within 1 2945 month of initiating opioids provi des an opportunity to modify the treatment plan to achieve pain 2946 treatment goals, minimize risks of long -term opioid use by tapering and discontinuing opioids among 2947 patients not receiving a clear benefit from these medications, and additional evaluation wit hin the first 2948 three months might provide opportunities to identify and mitigate risks for opioid use disorder and 2949 overdose. 2950 Experts noted that although there is little evidence for specific follow -up time frames, the 2951 recommendation was reasonable and ref lects common practice and therefore supported both the 2952 recommendation and the category A designation. Experts further noted that social determinants of 2953 health affecting ability to return frequently for care (e.g., role as unpaid caregiver, or work at a job with 2954 minimal paid time off) or payer issues (e.g., co -pays) could have consequences when recommending 2955 frequent visits and should be considered. 2956 Clinicians should evaluate patients to assess benefits and risks of opioids within 1 to 4 weeks of 2957 starting lon g-term opioid therapy or of dose escalation. Clinicians should consider follow -up intervals 2958 within the lower end of this range when ER/LA opioids are started or increased, given increased risk for 2959 overdose within the first 2 weeks of treatment (Miller et al., 2015) , or when total daily opioid dosage is 2960 50 MME/day, given overdose risk is doubled across multiple studies for dosages of 50 to <100 2961 MME/day relative to <20 MME/day (see Recommendation 4). Shorter follow -up intervals (within 3 days) 2962 should be stron gly considered when starting or increasing the dosage of methadone, given the variable 2963 half-life of this drug (see Recommendation 3) and the potential for drug accumulation during initiation 2964 and during upward titration of dosage. An initial follow -up inter val closer to 4 weeks can be considered 2965 when starting immediate -release opioids at a dosage <50 MME/day. 2966 123 In analyses of placebo -controlled trials , the clinical evidence reviews found that effects of 2967 opioids on mean improvement in pain and in function were greater at 1 to 3 months than at 3 to 6 2968 months (Chou et al., April 2020) . A cohort study found an association between longer duration of 2969 therapy and increased risk of new -onset depression (Chou et al., April 2020) . Because of potential 2970 changes in the balance of benefits and risks of opioid therapy over time, clinicians should regularly 2971 reassess all patients receiving long -term opioid therapy, including patients who are new to the clinician 2972 but on long -term opioid therapy, at least every 3 months. Clinicians seeing new patients already 2973 receiving opioids should establish treatment goals for continued opioid therapy (see Recommendation 2974 2). Clinicians should re -evaluate patients wh o are at greater risk for opioid use disorder or overdose 2975 (e.g., patients with depression or other mental health conditions, a history of substance use disorder, a 2976 history of overdose, taking 50 MME/day, or taking other central nervous system depressants with 2977 opioids) more frequently than every 3 months. To minimize unintended impact on patients with 2978 challenges in accessing or affording follow -up visits, practices, and health systems should work to ensure 2979 all patients can access and afford follow -up evalua tion. In addition, policymakers should minimize 2980 barriers to care (e.g., through promotion of paid time off) . In practice contexts where virtual visits are 2981 part of standard care (e.g., in remote areas where distance or other context makes follow -up visits 2982 challenging), follow -up assessments that allow the clinician to communicate with and observe the 2983 patient through telehealth modalities may be conducted. 2984 At follow -up, clinicians should review patient perspectives on progress and challenges in moving 2985 toward treatment goals, determine whether opioids continue to meet treatment goals, including 2986 sustained improvement in pain and function; whether the patient has experienced common or serious 2987 adverse events or early warning signs of serious adverse events or has signs of opioid misuse or opioid 2988 use disorder (e.g., difficulty controlling use, cravings, work, social or family problems related to opioid 2989 use); whether benefits of opioids continue to outweigh risks; and whether there is a need for opioid 2990 124 dosage reduct ion or discontinuation. Clinicians should assess benefits in function, pain control, and 2991 quality of life by asking patients about progress toward person -centered functional goals that have 2992 meaning for them (see Recommendation 2) and/or by using tools such as the three -item \"Pain average, 2993 interference with Enjoyment of life, and interference with General activity\" (PEG) Assessment Scale 2994 (Krebs et al., 2009) ; clinically meaningful improvement has been defined as a 30% improvement in 2995 scores for both pain and function (Ostelo et al., 2008) . Clinicians should also ask patients about common 2996 adverse effects such as constipation and drowsiness (see Recommendation 2), as well as ask ing about 2997 and assessing for effects that might be early warning signs for more serious problems such as overdose 2998 (e.g., sedation or slurred speech) or opioid use disorder (e.g., craving, wanting to take opioids in greater 2999 quantities or more frequently than prescribed, difficulty controlling use, work, social, or family problems 3000 related to opioid use ). Because depression, anxiety, and other psychological co -morbidities often coexist 3001 with and can interfere with resolution of pain, clinicians should use valida ted instruments to assess for 3002 these conditions (see Recommendation 8) and ensure that treatment for these conditions is optimized. 3003 Clinicians should ask patients about their preferences for continuing opioids, given their effects on pain 3004 and function relat ive to any adverse effects experienced. 3005 If risks outweigh benefits of continued opioid therapy (e.g., if patients do not experience 3006 meaningful, sustained improvements in pain and function compared with prior to initiation of opioid 3007 therapy; if patients ar e taking higher -risk regimens [e.g., dosages 50 MME/day or opioids combined 3008 with benzodiazepines] without evidence of benefit; if patients believe benefits no longer outweigh risks; 3009 if patients request dosage reduction or discontinuation; or if patients e xperience overdose or other 3010 serious adverse events) , clinicians should work with patients to reduce opioid dosage or to discontinue 3011 opioids when possible, using principles from Recommendation 5. Clinicians should maximize pain 3012 treatment with nonpharmacolog ic and nonopioid pharmacologic treatments as appropriate (see 3013 Recommendation 2). 3014 125 3015 Assessing risk and addressing harms of opioid use 3016 8. Before starting and periodically during continuation of opioid therapy, clinicians should evaluate 3017 risk for opioid -related harms and discuss with patients . Clinicians should work with patients to 3018 incorporate into the management plan strategies to mitigate risk, including offering naloxone 3019 when factors that increase risk for opioid overdose are present (recommendation category: A, 3020 evidence type: 4). 3021 Implementation considerations : 3022 Clinicians should offer naloxone when prescribing opioids to patients at increased risk for 3023 overdose, including patients with a history of overdose, patients with a history of substance use 3024 disorder, patients with sleep -disordered breathing, patients takin g higher dosages of opioids 3025 (e.g., 50 MME/day), patients taking benzodiazepines with opioids (see Recommendation 11), 3026 and patients at risk for returning to a high dose to which they have lost tolerance (e.g., patients 3027 undergoing tapering or recently relea sed from prison). 3028 Practices should provide education on overdose prevention and naloxone use to patients and 3029 offer to provide education to members of their households. 3030 Naloxone co -prescribing can be facilitated by clinics or practices with resources to p rovide 3031 naloxone training and by collaborative practice models with pharmacists or through standing 3032 orders for naloxone at pharmacies. 3033 Resources for prescribing naloxone in primary care and emergency department settings can be 3034 found through Prescribe to Pr event at http://prescribetoprevent.org ; additional resources are at 3035 https://samhsa.gov . 3036 In part because of concerns about cost of naloxone and access for some patients, this 3037 recommendation specifies that naloxone should be \"offered\" to patients. Clinicians, health 3038 systems, and payers should work to ensure patients can access naloxone, a potent ially lifesaving 3039 treatment. 3040 Clinicians should avoid prescribing opioids to patients with moderate or severe sleep -disordered 3041 breathing when possible to minimize risks for opioid overdose. 3042 When making decisions about whether to initiate opioid therapy for pain during pregnancy, 3043 clinicians and patients together should carefully weigh benefits and risks. For pregnant people 3044 already receiving opioids, clinicians should access appropriate expertise if considering tapering 3045 opioids because of possible risk to th e pregnant patient and to the fetus if the patient goes into 3046 withdrawal (see Recommendation 5). 3047 For pregnant people with opioid use disorder, medications for opioid use disorder 3048 (buprenorphine or methadone) have been associated with improved maternal outc omes and 3049 should be offered (see Recommendation 12). 3050 126 Clinicians should use additional caution and increased monitoring (see Recommendation 7) to 3051 minimize risks of opioids prescribed for patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency and for 3052 patients aged 65 years and should implement interventions to mitigate common risks of opioid 3053 therapy among older adults, such as exercise or bowel regimens to prevent constipation, risk 3054 assessment for falls, and patient monitoring for cognitive impairment. 3055 Clinicians sho uld ensure that treatment for depression and other mental health conditions is 3056 optimized, consulting with behavioral health specialists when needed. 3057 Clinicians should ask patients about their drug and alcohol use. 3058 Clinicians should use PDMP data (see Recommendation 9) and toxicology screening (see 3059 Recommendation 10) as appropriate to assess for concurrent substance use that might place 3060 patients at higher risk for opioid use disorder and overdose. 3061 Clinicians should provide specific counseling on increa sed risks for overdose when opioids are 3062 combined with other drugs or alcohol (see Recommendation 2) and ensure that patients are 3063 provided or receive effective treatment for substance use disorders when needed (see 3064 Recommendation 12). 3065 Although substance us e disorder can alter the expected benefits and risks of opioid therapy for 3066 pain, patients with co -occurring pain and substance use disorder require ongoing pain 3067 management that maximizes benefits relative to risks. See \"Pain management for patients with 3068 opioid use disorder\" section of Recommendation 12 for additional considerations specific to 3069 patients with pain and opioid use disorder. 3070 If clinicians consider opioid therapy for chronic pain for patients with substance use disorder, 3071 they should discuss increased risks for opioid use disorder and overdose with patients, carefully 3072 consider whether benefits of opioids outweigh increased risks , and incorporate strategies to 3073 mitigate risk into the management plan, such as offering naloxone (see Offering Naloxone to 3074 Patients When Factors That Increase Risk for Opioid -Related Harms Are Present) and increasing 3075 frequency of monitoring (see Recommend ation 7). 3076 If patients experience nonfatal opioid overdose, clinicians should evaluate for opioid use disorder 3077 and treat or arrange treatment if needed. Clinicians should work with patients to reduce opioid 3078 dosage and to discontinue opioids when indicated (see Recommendation 5) and should ensure 3079 continued close monitoring and support for patients prescribed or not prescribed opioids. 3080 If clinicians continue opioid therapy in patients with prior opioid overdose, they should discuss 3081 increased risks for overdo se with patients, carefully consider whether benefits of opioids 3082 outweigh substantial risks, and incorporate strategies to mitigate risk into the management 3083 plan, such as considering offering naloxone and increasing frequency of monitoring (see 3084 Recommendat ion 7). 3085 3086 Supporting Rationale 3087 3088 The clinical evidence reviews found evidence too limited to determine effects of patient 3089 demographics and comorbidities on risk of opioid -related harms (Chou et al., April 2020) . However, 3090 based on observational studies and expert opinion, certain risk factors are likely to increase 3091 127 susceptibility to opioid -related harms and warrant incorporation of additional strategies into the 3092 management plan to mitigate risk. Clinicians should assess these risk factors periodically, with frequency 3093 individualized to patient comorbidities and other risk factors. For example, factors that vary more 3094 frequently over time, such as alcohol use, require more frequent assessment. In addition, clinicians 3095 should offer naloxone and re -evaluate patients more frequently (see Recommendation 7) when factors 3096 that i ncrease risk for harm, such as sleep -disordered breathing, history of overdose, history of substance 3097 use disorder, higher dosages of opioids (e.g., 50 MME/day), and concurrent use of benzodiazepines 3098 with opioids, are present. Experts noted concerns with p otential downstream effects of offering 3099 naloxone for patients of limited means to afford the cost of purchasing naloxone. In part because of this 3100 concern, and also because in some settings, naloxone is directly provided by a practice or health system 3101 to pa tients, \"offering\" naloxone is recommended. Clinicians, health systems, and payers should work to 3102 ensure patients can access naloxone, a potentially lifesaving treatment. 3103 Patients with sleep -disordered breathing, including sleep apnea 3104 A case -control analy sis among Veterans prescribed opioids found that sleep apnea and chronic 3105 pulmonary disease were associated with increased risk for life -threatening respiratory central nervous 3106 system depression or overdose (Zedler et al., 2014) . Careful monitoring and cautious dose titration 3107 should be used if opioids are prescribed for patients with mild sleep -disordered breathing. Clinicians 3108 should avoid prescribing opioids to patients with moderate or severe sleep -disordered breathing, 3109 whenever possible, to minimize risks for opioid overdose. 3110 Pregnant people 3111 Opioids used during pregnancy might be associated with risks to both parent and fetus. Some 3112 studies have shown an association of opioid use in pregnancy with stillbirth, poor fetal growth, pre -term 3113 delivery, and birth defects (Broussard et al., 2011; Lind al., 2017; rker, & Werler, 2013) . In some cases, opioid use during 3115 pregnancy leads to neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (Hadi, da Silva, Natale, Boyd, & Morley - 3116 Forster, 2006) . At the same time, as noted by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 3117 \"a cautious approach to prescribing opioids should be balanced with the need to address pain... 3118 Pregnancy should not be a reason to avoid treating acute pain\" (\"Committee Opinion No. 711: Opioid Clinicians and patients toge ther should carefully 3120 weigh benefits and risks when making decisions about whether to initiate opioid therapy for pain during 3121 pregnancy. In addition, before initiating opioid therapy for individuals who can become pregnant, 3122 clinicians should discuss family planning and how long -term opioid use might affect any future 3123 pregnancy. When opioids are needed for treatment of acute pain in pregnant people, the lowest dose to 3124 achieve expected effects (see Recommendation 4) should be used for no longer than the expec ted 3125 duration of pain severe enough to require opioids (see Recommendation 6). For pregnant people with 3126 chronic pain, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that \"practice goals 3127 include strategies to avoid or minimize the use of opioids for pain management, highlighting alternative 3128 pain therapies such as nonpharmacologic (e.g., exercise, physical therapy, behavioral approaches), and 3129 nonopioid treatments\" Disorder in Pregnancy,\" 2017) . For pregnant people already receiving opioids, clinicians should access 3131 appropriate expertise if considering tapering opioids because of possible risk to the pregnant patient 3132 and to the fetus if the patient goes into withdrawal (see Recommendation 5). 3133 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists notes that e arly universal screening, 3134 brief intervention (e.g., engaging in a short conversation, providing feedback and advice), and referral 3135 for treatment of pregnant people with opioid use disorder im prove both maternal and infant outcomes 3136 (The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee on Obstetric Practice & American 3137 Society of Addiction Medicine, 2017) . For pregnant people with opioid use disorder, medications for 3138 129 opioid use disorder (buprenorphine or methadone) have been associated with improved maternal 3139 outcomes and should be offered (The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee 3140 on Obstetric Practice & American Society of Addiction Medicine, 2017) (see Recomm endation 12). 3141 The American Academy of Pediatrics has published recommendations for the care of infants 3142 with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, including that p regnant people with opioid use disorder 3143 should receive antenatal counseling to provide educati on on the clinical signs of withdrawal and 3144 enhance maternal understanding of postnatal treatment for neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (e.g., 3145 nonpharmacologic treatment including breastfeeding, and pharmacotherapy) and that all infants with 3146 long -term opi oid exposure should be observed for at least 72 hours (4 to 7 days if exposed to 3147 buprenorphine or sustained released opioids and 5 to 7 days if exposed to methadone) to monitor for 3148 the development of withdrawal (Patrick, Barfield, & Poindexter, 2020) . Clinicians caring for pregnant 3149 people receiving opioids for pain or receiving buprenorphine or methadone for opioid use disorder 3150 should arrange for delivery at a facility prepared to monitor, evaluate for, and treat neonatal opioid 3151 withdrawal syndrome. In instances when travel to such a facility would present an undue burden on the 3152 pregnant person, it is appropriate to deliver locally, monitor and evaluate the newborn for neonatal 3153 opioid withdrawal syndrome, and transfer the newborn for additional treat ment if needed. Previous 3154 guidelines have recommended that codeine be avoided whenever possible among mothers who are 3155 breastfeeding and, if used, should be limited to the lowest possible dose and to a 4 -day supply with re - 3156 evaluation thereafter (National Opioid Use Guideline Group, 2010) . 3157 Patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency 3158 A case -control study of risk of life -threatening respiratory central nervous system depression or 3159 overdose among veterans prescribed opioids found that renal disease and moderate or severe liver 3160 disease were associated with increased risk for life -threaten ing respiratory central nervous system 3161 depression or overdose (Zedler et al., 2014) . Clinicians should use addit ional caution and increased 3162 130 monitoring (see Recommendation 7) to minimize risks of opioids prescribed for patients with renal or 3163 hepatic insufficiency, given their decreased ability to process and excrete medications, susceptibility to 3164 accumulation of opio ids, and reduced therapeutic window between safe dosages and dosages 3165 associated with respiratory depression and overdose (Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacologic Basis 3166 of Therapeutics, 9th ed , 1996) (see Recommendations 3, 4, and 7). 3167 Patients aged 65 years 3168 Persons aged 65 years can be at risk for inadequate pain treatment (Becker et al., 2017; 3169 Bernabei et al., 1998; Institute of Medicine Committee on Advancing Pain Research Care and Education, 3170 2011; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2019b) . Older adults can also be at risk for 3171 changes in function that might be exacerbated by pain and contribute to deterioration in overall health 3172 and independence. Pain management for older patients can be challenging given increased ri sks of both 3173 nonopioid pharmacologic therapies (see Recommendation 2) and opioid therapy in this population. A 3174 case -control analysis among Veterans prescribed opioids found that age >55 years was associated with 3175 increased risk for life -threatening respirato ry central nervous system depression or overdose (Zedler et 3176 al., 2014) . Given reduced renal function and medicati on clearance even in the absence of renal disease, 3177 patients aged 65 years might have increased susceptibility to accumulation of opioids and a smaller 3178 therapeutic window between safe dosages and dosages associated with respiratory depression and 3179 overdose (Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacologic Basis of Therapeutics, 9th ed , 1996) . Some older 3180 adults might hav e a cognitive impairment, such as dementia, which can increase risk for medication 3181 errors and make opioid -related confusion riskier. In addition, older adults are more likely than younger 3182 adults to experience co -morbid medical conditions and more likely to receive multiple medications, 3183 some of which might interact with opioids. Functional assessment is especially important in patients 3184 aged 65 years to better assess impact of pain on function and independence. Clinicians should use 3185 additional caution and in creased monitoring (see Recommendation 7) for patients aged 65 years to 3186 131 ensure pain is addressed and to minimize risks of opioids prescribed and should educate older adults 3187 receiving opioids to avoid medication -related behaviors that increase risk such as saving unused 3188 medications. Clinicians should also implement interventions to mitigate common risks of opioid therapy 3189 among older adults, such as exercise or bowel regimens to prevent constipation, risk assessment for 3190 falls, and patient monitoring for cogn itive impairment. 3191 Patients with mental health conditions 3192 Because psychological distress frequently interferes with improvement of pain and function in 3193 patients with chronic pain, using validated instruments such as the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) - 3194 7 and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) -9 or the PHQ -4 to support assessment for anxiety, post - 3195 traumatic stress disorder, and/or depression (Kroenke, Spitzer, Williams, & L\u00f6we, 2010) might help 3196 clinicians improve overall pain treatment outcomes. Additional caution and increased monitoring (see 3197 Recommendation 7) might lessen the increased risk for overdose among patients with depression 3198 (Turner & Liang, 2015; Zedler et al., 2014) . Previous guidelines have noted that acute psychiatric 3199 instability (severe depression, unstab le bipolar disorder, or unstable psychotic disorder) or intermediate 3200 to high acute suicide risk precludes the safe use of self -administered long -term opioid therapy and that 3201 treatment for chronic pain with movement, exercise and cognitive behavioral therap y for pain may have 3202 benefit in treating depression, PTSD, and in reducing suicide risk (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs 3203 and Department of Defense, 2017) . In addition, patients with anxiety disorders and other mental health 3204 conditions are more likely to receive benzodiazepines, which can exacerbate opioid -induced r espiratory 3205 depression and increase risk for overdose (see Recommendation 11). Clinicians should ensure that 3206 treatment for depression and other mental health conditions as well as treatment for pain is optimized, 3207 consulting with behavioral health specialist s when needed. Treatment for depression can improve pain 3208 symptoms as well as depression and might decrease overdose risk (Turner & Liang, 2015) . For treatment 3209 of chronic pain in patients with depression, clinicians should consider using tricyclic or SNRI 3210 132 antidepressants for analgesic as well as antidepressant effects if these medications are not otherwise 3211 contraindicated (see Recommendation 2). 3212 Patients with substance use disorders 3213 Patients with substance use disorders including alcohol use disorder are likely to experience 3214 greater risks for opioid use disorder and overdose (Bohnert et al., 2011; Dunn et al., 2010; Zedler et al., 3215 2014) than persons without these conditions. Despite increased risk for opioid misuse and opioid use 3216 disorder when prescribed opioid analgesics (Edlund, Steffick, Hudson, Harris, & Sullivan, 2007; Reid et 3217 al., 2002) , patients with histories of substance use disorders are more likely than other patients to 3218 receive long -term opioid treatment for chronic pain (Edlund et al., 2010) . Previous guidelines have 3219 recommended screening or risk assessment tools to identify patients at higher risk for opioid misuse or 3220 opioid use disorder. However, the clinical evidence reviews found that currently available risk 3221 stratification tools (e.g., Opi oid Risk Tool, Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain Version 3222 1, SOAPP -R, and Brief Risk Interview) show limited and variable accuracy for classification of patients as 3223 at low or high risk for opioid use disorder or misuse (Chou et al., April 2020) . If these tools are used, they 3224 should be supplemented with other assessments, such as discussions with patients, fam ily, and 3225 caregivers, clinical records, PDMP data (see Recommendation 9), and toxicology screening data (see 3226 Recommendation 10). Clinicians should always exercise caution when considering or prescribing opioids 3227 and should not overestimate the ability of cur rently available risk stratification tools to rule out risks 3228 from long -term opioid therapy. 3229 Non -prescribed cocaine, methamphetamine) 3230 (Gladden, O'Donnell, Mattson, & Seth, 2019) and alcohol (Jones, Paulozzi, & Mack, 2014) are listed as 3231 contributory factors o n a substantial proportion of death certificates for prescription opioid -involved 3232 overdose deaths. Clinicians should ask patients about their drug (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 3233 2020) and alcohol us e. Single screening questions can be used (Saitz, Cheng, Allensworth -Davies, Winter, 3234 133 & Smith, 2014) . For example, the question \"How many times in the past year have you used an illegal 3235 drug or used a prescription medication for nonmedical reasons?\" (with an answer of one or more 3236 considered positive) was found in a primary care setting to be 100% sensitive and 73.5% specific for the 3237 detection of a drug use disorder compared with a standardized diagnosti c interview (P. C. Smi th, 3238 Schmidt, Allensworth -Davies, & Saitz, 2010) . Validate d screening tools such as the Drug Abuse Screening 3239 Test (DAST) (Yudko, Lozhkina, & Fouts, 2007) , the Tobacco, Alcohol, Prescription med ication, and other 3240 Substance use Tool (TAPS) (McNeely et al., 2 016) , and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test 3241 (AUDIT) (Reinert & Allen, 2007) can also be used. Clinicians should use PDMP data (see 3242 Recommendation 9) and toxicology screening (see Recommendation 10) as appropriate to assess for 3243 concurrent substance use that might place patients at higher risk for opioid use disorder and overdose. 3244 Clinicians should also provide specific counseling on increased risks for overdose when opioids are 3245 combined with other drugs or alcohol (see Recommendation 2) and ensure that patients receive 3246 effective treatment for substance use disorders when needed (s ee Recommendation 12). 3247 If clinicians consider opioid therapy for chronic pain, they should discuss increased risks for 3248 opioid use disorder and overdose with patients, carefully consider whether benefits of opioids outweigh 3249 increased risks, and incorporate strategies to mitigate risk into the management plan, such as offering 3250 naloxone (see Offering Naloxone to Patients When Factors That Increase Risk for Opioid -Related Harms 3251 Are Present) and increasing frequency of monitoring (see Recommendation 7) when opi oids are 3252 prescribed. Clinicians should communicate with patients' substance use disorder treatment providers if 3253 opioids are prescribed. Although substance use disorder can alter the expected benefits and risks of 3254 opioid therapy for pain, patients with co -occurring pain and substance use disorder require ongoing pain 3255 management that maximizes benefits relative to risks. See \"Pain management for patients with opioid 3256 use disorder\" section of Recommendation 12 for additional considerations specific to patients with 3257 opioid use disorder. 3258 134 Patients with prior nonfatal overdose 3259 Prior nonfatal overdose is associated with substantially risk for future nonfatal or fatal 3260 opioid overdose (M. Wharam, 2016) . Yet, a cohort 3261 study of commercially insured patients found that opioids were dispensed to 91% of patients after an 3262 overdose, and a substantial perc entage experienced a repeated opioid overdose, with a cumulative 3263 incidence at 2 years of 17% among patients receiving 100 or more MME/day, 15% among those 3264 prescribed 50 to 100 MME/day, 9% among those prescribed <50 MME/day, and 8% among those 3265 prescribed no opioids (M. R. Larochelle et al., 2016) . 3266 If patients experience nonfatal opioid overdose, clinicians should evaluate for opioid use 3267 disorder and treat or arrange treatment if needed. Buprenorphine or methadone for opioid use disorder 3268 following nonfatal are associated with reduced all -cause and opioid -related mortality (Marc R 3269 Larochelle et al., 2018) . Clinicians should work with patients to reduce opioid d osage and to discontinue 3270 opioids when indicated (see Recommendation 5) and should ensure continued close monitoring and 3271 support for patients prescribed or not prescribed opioids. If clinicians continue opioid therapy in 3272 patients with prior opioid overdose, they should discuss increased risks for overdose with patients, 3273 carefully consider whether benefits of opioids outweigh substantial risks, and incorporate strategies to 3274 mitigate risk into the management plan, such as considering offering naloxone (see Off ering Naloxone to 3275 Patients When Factors That Increase Risk for Opioid -Related Harms Are Present), involving patient - 3276 identified trusted family members, and increasing frequency of monitoring (see Recommendation 7). 3277 Offering naloxone to patients when factor s that increase risk for opioid -related harms are present 3278 Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that can reverse severe respiratory depression; its 3279 administration by laypersons, such as friends, family, and caregivers of persons who experience opioid 3280 overdose, can save lives (Walley et al., 2013) . Naloxone precipitates acute withdrawal among patients 3281 physically dependent on opioids. Serious adverse effects, such as pulmonary edema, cardiovascular 3282 135 instability, and seizures, have been reported but are rare at doses consistent with labeled use for opioid 3283 overdose (Enteen et al., 20 10). The clinical evidence reviews identified one observational study (Coffin 3284 et al., 2016) finding that provision of naloxone to patients prescribed opioids in primary care clinics was 3285 associated with decreased likelihood of emergency department visits (but no difference in risk of 3286 overdose) (Chou et al., April 2020) . 3287 Clinicians should offer naloxone when prescribing opioids to patients at increased risk for 3288 overdose, including patients with a history of overdose, patients with a history of substance use 3289 disorder, patients taking benzodiazepines with opioids (see Recommendation 11) , patients at risk for 3290 returning to a high dose to which they have lost tolerance (e.g., patients undergoing tapering or 3291 recently released from pr ison), and patients taking higher dosages of opioids (50 MME/day). 3292 Practices should provide education on overdose prevention and naloxone use to patients receiving 3293 naloxone prescriptions and to members of their households. Naloxone co -prescribing can be f acilitated 3294 by clinics or practices with resources to provide naloxone training and by collaborative practice models 3295 with pharmacists. Resources for prescribing naloxone in primary care settings can be found through 3296 Prescribe to Prevent at http://prescribetoprevent.org . 3297 3298 9. When prescribing initial opioid therapy for acute, subacute, or chronic pain, and periodically 3299 during opioid therapy for chronic pain, clinicians should review the patient's history of controlled 3300 substance prescriptions using state prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) data to 3301 determine whether the patient is receiving opioid dosages or combinations that put the patient at 3302 high risk for overdose (recommendation category: B, evidence type: 4). 3303 Implementation considerations : 3304 Ideally, PDMP data should be reviewed before every opioid prescription for acute, subacute, or 3305 chronic pain. This is recommended in all jurisdictions where PDMP availability and access 3306 policies, as well as clinical practice settings, make this practicable (e.g., clinician and delegate 3307 access permitted). 3308 136 At a minimum, during long -term opioid therapy, PDMP data should be reviewed before an i nitial 3309 opioid prescription and then every 3 months or more frequently. The recommendation category 3310 B acknowledges variation in PDMP availability and circumstances. However, because PDMP 3311 information can be most helpful when results are unexpected, and to mi nimize bias in 3312 application, clinicians should apply this recommendation when feasible to all patients rather 3313 than differentially based on assumptions about what they will learn about different patients. 3314 Clinicians should use specific PDMP information abou t medications prescribed to their patient in 3315 the context of other clinical information, including their patient's history, physical findings, and 3316 other relevant testing, in order to help them communicate with and protect their patient. 3317 Clinicians should re view PDMP data specifically for prescription opioids and other controlled 3318 medications patients have received from additional prescribers to determine whether a patient is 3319 receiving high total opioid dosages or combinations (e.g., opioids combined with 3320 benz odiazepines) that put the patient at high risk for overdose. 3321 PDMP -generated risk scores have not been validated against clinical outcomes such as overdose 3322 and should not take the place of clinical judgment. Clinicians should not dismiss patients from 3323 their practice on the basis of PDMP information. Doing so can adversely affect patient safety, 3324 could represent patient abandonment, and could result in missed opportunities to provide 3325 potentially lifesaving information (e.g., about risks of prescription opioid s and overdose 3326 prevention) and interventions (e.g., safer prescriptions, nonopioid pain treatment [see 3327 Recommendations 1 and 2], naloxone [see Recommendation 8], and effective treatment for 3328 use disorder [see Recommendations 8 and 12]) . 3329 Clinicians should take actions to improve patient safety: 3330 o Discuss information from the PDMP with their patient and confirm that the patient is aware 3331 of any additional prescriptions. Occasionally, PDMP information can be incorrect (e.g., if the 3332 wrong name or birthdate has been entered, the patient uses a nickname or maiden name, or 3333 another person has used the patient's identity to obtain prescriptions). 3334 o Discuss safety concerns, including increased risk for respiratory depression and overdose, 3335 with patients found to be receiving prescription opioids from more than one clinician or 3336 receiving medications that increase risk when combined with opioids (e.g., benzodiazepines; 3337 see Recommendation 11) and offer naloxone (see Recommendation 8). 3338 o Use extreme caution w hen prescribing opioids and benzodiazepines concurrently, 3339 appreciating that some patient circumstances warrant prescribing of these medications 3340 concomitantly. Clinicians should communicate with others managing the patient to discuss 3341 the patient's needs, pr ioritize patient goals, weigh risks of concurrent benzodiazepine and 3342 opioid exposure, and coordinate care (see Recommendation 11). 3343 o Consider the total MME/day for concurrent opioid prescriptions to help assess the patient's 3344 overdose risk (see Recommendatio n 4). Buprenorphine should not be counted in the total 3345 MME/day in calculations given its opioid partial agonist properties that confer a ceiling 3346 effect on respiratory depression. If patients are found to be receiving high total daily dosages 3347 of opioids, di scuss safety concerns with the patient, consider in collaboration with the 3348 137 patient if tapering to a safer dosage is warranted (see Recommendation 5), and offer 3349 naloxone (see Recommendation 8). 3350 o Discuss safety concerns with other clinicians who are prescrib ing controlled substances for 3351 their patient. Ideally, clinicians should first discuss concerns with their patient and inform 3352 him or her that they plan to coordinate care with the patient's other clinicians to improve the 3353 patient's safety. 3354 o Screen for subst ance use and discuss concerns with their patient (see Recommendations 8 3355 and 12). 3356 If clinicians believe their patient might be diverting (sharing or selling prescription opioids 3357 and not taking them), consider toxicology testing to assist in determining whe ther 3358 prescription opioids can be discontinued without causing withdrawal (see Recommendations 3359 5 and 10). A negative toxicology test for prescribed opioids might indicate the patient is not 3360 taking prescribed opioids, although clinicians should consider othe r possible reasons for this 3361 test result, such as false negative results or misinterpretation of results (see 3362 Recommendation 10). 3363 3364 Supporting Rationale 3365 PDMPs are databases overseen by states, territories, counties, and the District of Columbia that 3366 collect information on controlled prescription drugs dispensed by pharmacies in most jurisdictions and, 3367 in select jurisdictions, by dispensing clinicians as we ll. The clinical evidence reviews did not find studies 3368 evaluating the effectiveness of PDMPs for risk mitigation. However, among patients receiving 3369 concurrent treatment with opioids and benzodiazepines, overdose risk is further increased among 3370 patients rec eiving these treatments from multiple prescribers rather than one prescriber, highlighting 3371 potential room for improvement in care coordination (K. P. Chua, Brummett, Ng, & Bohnert, 2021) . 3372 PDMP data also can be helpful wh en patient medication history is not otherwise available (e.g., for 3373 patients from other locales) and when patients transition care to a new clinician. A contextual evidence 3374 review (Chou et al., April 2020) identified a survey of physicians in Maryland (D. H. Lin et al., 2017) 3375 finding that while barriers towards PDMP review were noted, including not knowing about the program, 3376 registration difficulties, and difficulty accessing data, most participants felt that PDMPs improved opioid 3377 prescribing by decreasing opioid prescription amounts and increasing comfort with prescribing opioids 3378 138 (Chou et al., April 2020) . Integration of PDMPs with electronic health records (EHRs) can reduce burden 3379 on clinicians compared to having to access a separate system (Centers for Disea se Control and 3380 Prevention, 2017; U.S. Government Accountability Office, 2020) . Special attention should be paid to 3381 ensure that PDMP information is not used in a way that is harmful to patients. For example, PDMP 3382 information has been used to dismiss pati ents from clinician practices (Irvine et al., 2014) , which might 3383 adversely affect patient safety and result in untreated or undertreated pain. Many state laws require 3384 PDMP use under specific circ umstances (B. Lee, Zhao, Yang, Ahn, & Perry, 2021) . Experts noted concern 3385 about PDMP risk scores or other algorithmic interpretations from software platforms that can lead to 3386 distrust between clinicians and patients and stigmatization, particularly for patients with conditions such 3387 as opioid use disorder. Risk scores are reportedly generated by applyi ng trade secret -protected 3388 algorithms to information from patient EHRs and other sources such as court records and criminal and 3389 sexual trauma histories; these algorithms may disparately impact women, people of color, and people 3390 who live in poverty (J. Oliva, 2021) . Importantly, while one PDMP -generated risk measure has shown fair 3391 concurrence with the WHO Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST), these 3392 scores have not been externally validated against clinical outcomes (Cochran et al., 2021) (J. Oliva, 3393 2021) . Such risk scores should not take the place of clinical judgment. Rather, clinicians should use 3394 specific PDMP information about medications prescribed to their patient in the context of other clinical 3395 information, includin g their patient's history, physical findings, and other relevant testing, in order to 3396 help them communicate with and protect their patient. Experts raised varying points regarding 3397 frequency of PDMP use, with many agreeing PDMPs should be consulted prior to every opioid 3398 prescription, several agreeing that universal application would mitigate bias in application to different 3399 patients, and others believing it might not be warranted or feasible to check the PDMP in all cases, 3400 particularly prior to prescribing o pioids for acute pain for a small number of days. Ideally, PDMP data 3401 should be reviewed before every opioid prescription for acute, subacute, or chronic pain. This is 3402 139 recommended in all jurisdictions where PDMP availability and access policies make this pr acticable (e.g., 3403 clinician and delegate access permitted). At a minimum, PDMP data should be reviewed before initial 3404 opioid prescriptions for subacute or chronic pain and then every 3 months or more frequently during 3405 long -term opioid therapy. T he recommend ation category B acknowledges variation in PDMP availability 3406 (PDMPs now exist in most but not all U.S. jurisdictions) and circumstances (e.g., a clinician might 3407 reasonably determine that a patient with severe acute pain presenting in the emergency departme nt 3408 during a PDMP system access failure would be adversely impacted by waiting hours for a prescription). 3409 However, because PDMP information can be most helpful when results are unexpected, and to minimize 3410 bias in application, clinicians should apply this re commendation when feasible to all patients rather than 3411 differentially based on assumptions about what they will learn about specific patients. 3412 Clinicians should review PDMP data for prescription opioids and other controlled medications 3413 patients might have received from additional prescribers to determine whether a patient is receiving 3414 high total opioid dosages or combinations (e.g., opioids combined with benzodiazepines) that put the 3415 patient at high risk for overdose. If patients are found to have high opio id dosages or combinations of 3416 medications that might put them at risk for overdose, or multiple controlled substance prescriptions 3417 written by different clinicians, clinicians should take actions to improve patient safety (see above 3418 Implementation Considera tions). 3419 3420 10. When prescribing opioids subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should consider toxicology 3421 testing to assess for prescribed medications as well as other prescribed and non -prescribed 3422 controlled substances (recommendation category: B, evidence type: 4). 3423 Implementation considerations : 3424 Clinicians should not dismiss patients from care based on a toxicology test result because this 3425 could constitute patient abandonment and could have adverse consequences for patient safety, 3426 potentially including the patient o btaining opioids or other drugs from alternative sources and 3427 the clinician missing opportunities to facilitate treatment for substance use disorder. 3428 140 Prior to starting opioids and periodically during opioid therapy, clinicians should consider 3429 toxicology te sting to assess for prescribed opioids as well as other prescription and 3430 nonprescription controlled substances that increase risk for overdose when combined with 3431 opioids, including nonprescribed and illicit opioids and benzodiazepines. 3432 Clinicians, practic es, and health systems should aim to minimize bias testing and should not 3433 apply this recommendation differentially based on assumptions about what they will learn about 3434 different patients. 3435 Predicting risk is challenging, and currently available tools do n ot allow clinicians to reliably 3436 identify patients who are at low risk for substance use or substance use disorder. Rather, 3437 clinicians should consider toxicology screening results as potentially useful data, in the context of 3438 other clinical information, for all patients, and consider toxicology screening whenever its 3439 potential problems can be mitigated. 3440 Clinicians should explain to patients that toxicology testing will not be used to dismiss patients 3441 from care and is intended to improve their safety. 3442 Clini cians should explain expected results (e.g., presence of prescribed medication and absence 3443 of drugs, including non -prescribed controlled substances, not reported by the patient) and ask 3444 patients about use of prescribed and other drugs and whether there mig ht be unexpected 3445 results. 3446 Toxicology screening can be performed with a relatively inexpensive presumptive immunoassay 3447 panel that tests for opiates as a class, benzodiazepines as a class, and several non -prescribed 3448 substances. 3449 The use of confirmatory test ing can add substantial costs and should be based on the need to 3450 detect specific opioids , such as those that are being prescribed, and those that cannot be 3451 identified on standard immunoassays or on the presence of unexpected toxicology test results. 3452 Clinicians should be familiar with the drugs included in toxicology screening panels used in their 3453 practice and should understand how to interpret results for these drugs . For example, a positive 3454 \"opiates\" immunoassay detects morphine, which might reflect patient use of morphine, codeine, 3455 or heroin, but does not detect synthetic opioids and might not detect semisynthetic opioids. In 3456 some cases, posi tive results for opioids might reflect metabolites from opioids the patient 3457 is taking and might not mean the patient is taking the specific opioid for which the test was 3458 positive. 3459 Restricting confirmatory testing to situations and substances for which results can reasonably be 3460 expected to affect patient management can reduce costs of toxicology testing. 3461 Clinicians may wish to discuss unexpected results with the local laboratory or toxicologist and 3462 should discuss unexpected results with the patien t. 3463 Discussion with patients prior to specific confirmatory testing can sometimes yield a candid 3464 explanation of why a particular substance is present or absent and obviate the need for 3465 expensive confirmatory testing on that visit. For example, a patient mi ght explain that the test is 3466 negative for prescribed opioids because she felt opioids were no longer helping and discontinued 3467 them. If unexpected results are not explained, a confirmatory test using a method selective 3468 enough to differentiate specific opioi ds and metabolites (e.g., gas or liquid 3469 chromatography/mass spectrometry) might be warranted. 3470 141 Clinicians should use unexpected results to improve patient safety (e.g., change pain 3471 management strategy [see Recommendation 2], carefully weigh benefits and ri sks of reducing or 3472 continuing opioid dosage [see 5], offer naloxone [see Recommendation 8], offer or refer for substance use 3474 disorder treatment [see Recommendation 12], all as appropriate). 3475 3476 Supporting Rationale 3477 The clinical evidence reviews did not find studies evaluating the effectiveness of toxicology 3478 screening for risk mitigation during opioid prescribing for pain. However, concurrent use of opioid pain 3479 medications with other opioid pai n medications, benzodiazepines, or heroin or other non - 3480 pharmaceutical opioids can increase patients' risk for overdose. Toxicology tests can provide 3481 information about drug use that is not reported by the patient. In addition, toxicology tests can assist 3482 clinicians in identifying when patients are not taking opioids prescribed for them, which might in some 3483 cases indicate diversion or other clinically important issues such as difficulties with adverse effects. The 3484 most commonly drug -tested bodily specimen is urine; oral fluid (saliva) testing is also available (Cone & 3485 Huesti s, 2007) , but testing protocols using oral fluid are not as well -established. On October 25, 2019, 3486 SAMHSA published guidelines for the inclusion of oral fluid specimens in federal executive branch 3487 agencies' toxicology testing programs (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 3488 2019) , effect ive January 1, 2020. Toxicology testing results can be associated with outcomes and 3489 practices that harm patients (e.g., stigmatization, inappropriate termination from care). False positive 3490 and false negative presumptive results are not uncommon, a problem which can be compounded 3491 because clinicians commonly misinterpret results (I. Chua et al., 2020; Starrels, Fox, Kunins, & 3492 Cunningham, 2012) , leading to inappropriate consequences for patients. Urine t oxicology tests do not 3493 provide accurate information about how much or what dose of opioids or other drugs a patient took. 3494 Testing for fentanyl is not currently available in widely -used toxicolog y assays, potentially leading to 3495 false assurance. Ideally, clinicians would only test for substances for which results could affect patient 3496 management. However, it can be challenging or impossible for clinicians to tailor widely used toxicology 3497 142 panels to i nclude the specific substances most relevant to clinical decisions for their patient. Toxicology 3498 testing costs are not always covered fully by insurance and can be a burden for patients, and clinician 3499 time is needed to interpret, confirm, and communicate r esults. 3500 Experts noted concerns that biases and disparities affecting which patients have toxicology tests 3501 could have disproportionately negative consequences among Black and Latinx patients. In addition, 3502 testing costs would have the greatest consequences for patients with the least ability to pay. Because of 3503 these concerns, some experts felt grading the recommendation as category A could potentially reduce 3504 bias and disparities. However, others thought that while universal application could mitigate bias in who 3505 is tested, it would not mitigate stigma associated with testing. In addition, experts noted concerns about 3506 accuracy, clinician interpretation, testing costs, and potential for a wait for test results to delay care. 3507 Because of concerns about imperfect accuracy, problems in interpretation, potential stigma, and 3508 cost, the recommendation is rated category B. However, clinicians, practices, and health systems should 3509 aim to minimize bias in its application and should not apply this recommendation d ifferentially based on 3510 assumptions about what they will learn about different patients. Predicting risk is challenging, and 3511 currently available tools do not allow clinicians to reliably identify patients who are at low risk for 3512 substance use disorder (Chou et al., April 2020) . Rather, clinicians should consider toxicology test results 3513 as potentially useful data, in the context of other clinical information, for all patients, and consider 3514 toxicology testing whenever its potential problems can be mitigated. For example, clinicians can become 3515 familiar with the drugs included in toxicology testing panels used in their practice and u nderstand how 3516 to interpret results, and practices and health systems can ensure a laboratorian or toxicologist is 3517 available to discuss unexpected results, that costs to patients are not burdensome, and that practice 3518 policies regarding testing and frequency can minimize bias. For example, routine use of testing with 3519 standardized policies at the practice or clinic level might help destigmatize their use. Because truly 3520 143 random testing might not be feasible in clinical practice, some clinics obtain a specimen at every visit, 3521 but only send it for testing on a random schedule. 3522 Prior to starting opioids and periodically during opioid therapy, clinicians should consider 3523 toxicology testing to assess for prescribed opioids as well as other prescription and non -prescribed 3524 substances that increase risk for overdose when combined with opioids, including non -prescribed and 3525 illicit opioids and benzodiazepines. Before ordering toxicology testing, clinicians should have a plan for 3526 responding to unexpected results. Clinicians should explain to patients that toxicology testing will not be 3527 used punitively (e.g., will not be used to dismiss patients from care) and is intended to improve their 3528 safety. Clinicians should also explain expected results (e.g., presence of prescribed medication and 3529 absence of substances, including non -prescribed substa nces, not reported by the patient). Clinicians 3530 should ask patients about use of prescribed medications and other substances and ask whether there 3531 might be unexpected results. This will provide an opportunity for patients to provide information about 3532 change s in their use of prescribed opioids or other drugs. 3533 In most situations, initial toxicology testing can be performed with a relatively inexpensive 3534 immunoassay panel that tests for opiates and benzodiazepines as classes, and several non-prescribed 3535 substanc es. Patients opioids (e.g., buprenorphine, 3536 methadone) require specific testing for those agents. The use of confirmatory testing can add 3537 substantial costs and should be based on the need to detect the specific opi oid that is prescribed and 3538 those that cannot be identified on standard immunoassays or on the presence of unexpected toxicology 3539 test results. Clinicians and health systems should work to minimize inequitable cost burdens for patients 3540 and limit specific tes ting to situations when it is necessary. Clinicians should be familiar with the 3541 compounds included in toxicology testing panels used in their practice and should understand how to 3542 interpret results. For example, a positive opiate immunoassay test result de tects morphine, which might 3543 reflect patient use of morphine, codeine, or heroin, but this immunoassay does not detect synthetic 3544 144 opioids (e.g., fentanyl or methadone) and (e.g., buprenorphine). that detects oxycodone and 3546 oxymorphone, but these may need to be ordered or identified separately in a toxicology testing panel . 3547 In some cases, positive results for specific opioids might reflect metabolites from opioids the patient is 3548 taking and might not mean the patient is taking the specific opioid for which the test was positive. For 3549 example, hydromorphone is a metabolite of hydrocodone, and oxymorphone of 3550 oxycodone. Detailed considerations for interp retation of urine toxicology test results, including which 3551 tests to order and expected results, drug detection time in urine, and drug metabolism have been 3552 published previously (Washington State Agency Medical Directors' Group, 2015) . A review including 3553 interpretation of oral fluid sample toxicology test results is also available (Cone & Huestis, 2007) . 3554 Restricting confirmatory testing to situations and substances for which results can reasonably be 3555 expected to affect patient management can reduce costs of toxicology testing, given the substantial 3556 costs associated with confirmatory testing methods. 3557 Clinicians may wish to discuss unexpected results with the local la boratory or toxicologist and 3558 should discuss unexpected results with the patient. Discussion with patients prior to specific 3559 confirmatory testing can sometimes yield a candid explanation of why a particular substance is present 3560 or absent and obviate the nee d for expensive confirmatory testing on that visit. For example, a patient 3561 might explain that the test is negative for prescribed opioids because she felt opioids were no longer 3562 helping and discontinued them. If unexpected results are not explained, a conf irmatory test using a 3563 method selective enough to differentiate specific opioids and metabolites (e.g., gas or liquid 3564 chromatography/mass spectrometry) might be warranted to clarify the situation. 3565 Clinicians should use unexpected results to improve patient safety (e.g., change pain 3566 management strategy [see Recommendation 2], carefully weigh benefits and risks of reducing or 3567 continuing opioid dosage [see Recommendation 5], re 7], offer naloxone [see Recommendation 8], offer or refer for substance use disorder treatment [see 3569 Recommendation 12], all as appropriate). If tests for prescribed opioids are repeatedly negative, 3570 including confirmatory tests, and the clinician has verified that the patient is not taking the p rescribed 3571 opioid, clinicians can discontinue the prescription without a taper and discuss options for safe disposal 3572 of unused opioids (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2020a) . 3573 Clinicians should not dismiss patients from care based on a toxicology test result because this 3574 could constitute patient abandonment and could have adverse consequences for patient safet y, 3575 potentially including the patient obtaining opioids from alternative sources and the clinician missing 3576 opportunities to facilitate treatment for substance use disorder. 3577 3578 11. Clinicians should use extreme caution when prescribing opioid pain medication and 3579 benzodiazepines concurrently and consider whether benefits outweigh risks of concurrent 3580 prescribing of opioids and other central nervous system depressants (recommendation category: 3581 B, evidence type: 3). 3582 Implementation considerations : 3583 Although there are circumstances when it might be appropriate to prescribe opioids to a patient 3584 who is also prescribed benzodiazepines (e.g., severe acute pain in a patient taking long -term, 3585 stable low -dose benzodiazepine therapy), clinicians should use ex treme caution when prescribing 3586 opioids and benzodiazepines concurrently. In addition, clinicians should consider whether 3587 benefits outweigh risks of concurrent use of opioids with other central nervous system 3588 depressants pregabalin). 3590 Clinicians should check the PDMP for concurrent controlled medications prescribed by other 3591 clinicians (see Recommendation 9) and should conside r involving pharmacists as part of the 3592 management team when opioids are co -prescribed with other central nervous system 3593 depressants. 3594 In patients receiving opioids and benzodiazepines long -term, clinicians should carefully weigh the 3595 benefits and risks of c ontinuing therapy with opioids and benzodiazepines and discuss with 3596 patients and other members of the patient's care team. 3597 146 Risks of concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine use are likely to be greater with unpredictable use 3598 of either medication, with use of high -dose opioids and high -dose benzodiazepines in 3599 combination, or with use with other substances including alcohol (as compared to long -term 3600 stable use of low -dose opioids and low -dose benzodiazepines without other substances). 3601 In specific situations, be nzodiazepines can be beneficial, and stopping benzodiazepines can be 3602 destabilizing. 3603 Buprenorphine or methadone for opioid use disorder should not be withheld from patients taking 3604 benzodiazepines or other medications that depress the central nervous system . 3605 If risks are determined to outweigh benefits of continuing opioid and benzodiazepine therapy at 3606 current dosages and a decision is made to taper, it might be safer and more practical to taper 3607 opioids first. There can be greater risks of benzodiazepine wi thdrawal relative to opioid 3608 withdrawal, and tapering opioids can be associated with anxiety (see Recommendation 5). 3609 Clinicians should taper benzodiazepines gradually prior to discontinuation because abrupt 3610 withdrawal can be associated with rebound anxiety , hallucinations, seizures, delirium tremens, 3611 and, in rare cases, death. The rate of tapering should be individualized. 3612 If benzodiazepines prescribed for anxiety are tapered or discontinued, or if patients receiving 3613 opioids require treatment for anxiety, evidence -based psychotherapies (e.g., CBT) and/or specific 3614 antidepressants or other nonbenzodiazepine medications approved for anxiety should be 3615 offered. 3616 Clinicians should communicate with clinicians managing the patient to discuss the patient's 3617 needs, pr ioritize patient goals, weigh risks of concurrent benzodiazepine and opioid exposure, 3618 and coordinate care. 3619 3620 Supporting Rationale 3621 Benzodiazepines and opioids both cause system depression, and 3622 benzodiazepines can potentiate opioid -induced decreases in respiratory drive. Epidemiologic studies 3623 find concurrent benzodiazepine use in large proportions of opioid -related over dose deaths (Dasgupta et 3624 al., et al., 2011; Jones & McAninch, 2015) . The clinical evidence reviews identified 3 cohort 3625 studies finding an association between concurren t use of benzodiazepines and opioids versus opioids 3626 alone and increased risk of overdose (Chou et al., April 2020) . A case -cohort study found concurrent 3627 benzodiazepine prescription with opioid prescription to be associated with a near -quadrupling of risk for 3628 overdose death compared with opioid Ilgen, & Bohnert, 2015) . 3629 147 The clinical evidence reviews did not find studies evaluating the effectiveness of avoiding co -prescribing 3630 of benzodiazepines and opioids on risk of overdose (Chou et al., April 2020) . The clinical evidence 3631 reviews additionally identified 3 observational studies finding an association between concurrent use of 3632 gabapentinoids and opioids versus opioids alone and increased risk of overdose, with higher risks at 3633 increased gabapentinoid doses (Chou et al., April 2020) . 3634 Experts noted that rather than nece ssarily being a direct cause of overdose, benzodiazepines 3635 might serve as a marker for risk of overdose due to underlying conditions, that -in specific situations - 3636 benzodiazepines can be beneficial, and that stopping benzodiazepines can be destabilizing. In addition, 3637 experts noted that long -term, stable use might be safer than erratic, unpredictable use. Due to these 3638 considerations, several experts felt recommending extreme caution with concurrent prescription of 3639 opioids and benzodiazepines was more appropriate than a recommendation to avoid prescribing opioid 3640 pain medication and benzodiazepines concurrently and that category B would be more appropriate than 3641 category A for this recommendation . 3642 Although there are circumstances when it might be appropriate to prescribe opioids to a patient 3643 receiving benzodiazepines (e.g., severe acute pain in a patient taking long -term, stable low -dose 3644 benzodiazepine therapy), clinicians should use extreme caution when prescribing opioids and 3645 benzodiazepines concurrently. In addition, given that other central nervous system depressants (e.g., 3646 Food and Drug Administration, 2019b) can 3648 potentiate respiratory depression associated with opioids, clinicians should consider whether bene fits 3649 outweigh risks of concurrent use of these medications. Clinicians should check the PDMP for concurrent 3650 controlled medications prescribed by other clinicians (see Recommendation 9) and should consider 3651 involving pharmacists as part of the management tea m when opioids are co -prescribed with other 3652 central nervous system depressants. 3653 148 In patients receiving opioids and benzodiazepines long -term, clinicians should carefully weigh 3654 the benefits and risks of continuing therapy with opioids and benzodiazepines an d discuss with patients 3655 and other members of the patient's care team. In specific situations, benzodiazepines can be beneficial, 3656 and stopping benzodiazepines can be destabilizing. Importantly, as emphasized in an FDA advisory (U.S. 3657 Food and Drug Administration, 2017) , buprenorphine or methadone for opioid use disorder should not 3658 be withheld from patients taking benzodiazepines or other medications that depress the central nervous 3659 system. While the combined u se of these medications increases risks, the harm caused by untreated 3660 opioid use disorder can outweigh these risks. 3661 If risks are determined to outweigh benefits of continuing opioids for pain and benzodiazepine 3662 therapy at current dosages and a decision is made to taper one or more medications , it might be safer 3663 and more practical to taper opioids first (see Recommendation 5). There can be greater risks of 3664 benzodiazepine withdrawal relative to opioid withdrawal, and tapering opioids can be associated with 3665 anxiety. Clinicians should taper benzodiazepines gradually prior to discontinuation because abrupt 3666 withdrawal can be associated with rebound anxiety, hallucinations, seizures, delirium tremens, and, in 3667 rare cases, death (Haque et al., 1990; Lann & Molina, 2009) . Tapering rates should be individualized. 3668 Examples of benzodiazepine tapers and tips for managing benzodiazepine withdrawal are available (U.S. 3669 Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense, 2015; Veterans Health Administration PBM 3670 Academic Detailing Service) . CBT increases tapering success rates and might be particularly helpful for 3671 patients struggling with a benzodiazepine taper (Paquin, Zimmerman, & Rudolph, 2014) . If 3672 benzodiazepines prescribed for anxiety are tapered or discontinued, or if pati ents receiving opioids 3673 require treatment for anxiety, evidence -based psychotherapies (e.g., CBT) and/or specific anti - 3674 depressants or other nonbenzodiazepine medications approved for anxiety should be offered. Clinicians 3675 should communicate with mental healt h professionals managing the patient to discuss the patient's 3676 149 needs, prioritize patient goals, weigh risks of concurrent benzodiazepine and opioid exposure, and 3677 coordinate care. 3678 3679 12. Clinicians should offer or arrange treatment with medication for patients wi th opioid use disorder 3680 (recommendation category: A, evidence type: 1). 3681 Implementation considerations : 3682 Although stigma can reduce the willingness of individuals with opioid use disorder to seek 3683 treatment, opioid use disorder is a chronic, treatable diseas e from which people can recover and 3684 continue to lead healthy lives . 3685 If clinicians suspect opioid use disorder, they should discuss their concern with their patient and 3686 provide an opportunity for the patient to disclose related concerns or problems. 3687 Clinicians should assess for the presence of opioid use disorder using DS M-5 criteria. 3688 For patients meeting criteria for opioid use disorder, particularly if moderate or severe, clinicians 3689 should offer or arrange for patients to receive treatment with medication for opioid use disorder. 3690 Clinicians should not dismiss patients from their practice because of opioid use disorder because 3691 this can adversely affect patient safety and could represent patient abandonment. 3692 Medication treatment of opioid use disorder has been associated with reduced overdose and 3693 overall mortality . Iden tification of opioid use disorder represents an opportunity for a clinician to 3694 initiate potentially life -saving interventions, and it is important for the clinician to collaborate 3695 with the patient regarding their safety to increase the likelihood of succes sful treatment. 3696 For pregnant people with opioid use disorder, medication therapy with buprenorphine or 3697 methadone has been associated with improved maternal outcomes and should be offered. 3698 Clinicians unable to provide treatment themselves should arrange f or patients with opioid use 3699 disorder to receive care from a substance use disorder treatment specialist, such as an office - 3700 based buprenorphine or naltrexone treatment provider, or from an opioid treatment program 3701 certified by SAMHSA to provide methadone or buprenorphine for patients with opioid use 3702 disorder. 3703 All clinicians, and particularly clinicians prescribing opioids in communities without sufficient 3704 treatment capacity for opioid use disorder, should obtain a waiver to prescribe buprenorphine. 3705 Clinici ans prescribing opioids should identify treatment resources for opioid use disorder in the 3706 community and should work together to ensure sufficient treatment capacity for opioid use 3707 disorder at the practice level. 3708 150 Although identification of an opioid use d isorder can alter the expected benefits and risks of 3709 opioid therapy for pain, patients with co -occurring pain and opioid use disorder require ongoing 3710 pain management that maximizes benefits relative to risks. 3711 Supporting Rationale 3712 Opioid use disorder (previously classified as opioid abuse or opioid dependence in the 3713 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , 4th edition [DSM -IV] [American Psychiatric 3714 Association, 2000] is defined the DSM -5 as a \"problematic pattern of opioid use leading to clinically 3715 significant impairment or distress.\" (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) . Treatment with opioids for 3716 pain is associated with increased risk for opioid use disorder, particularly if opioids are prescribed for 3717 more than 90 days (Edlund et al., 2014) . A systematic review found the rate of opioid \"addiction\" among 3718 chronic pain patie nts averaged between 8% and 12% in studies published between 2000 and 2013 3719 (Vowles et al., 2015) . More recently, studies have found prevalence estimates of 23.9% and 26.5% for 3720 any pres cription opioid use and 5.2% and 9.0% for moderate to severe opioid use disorder 3721 (using DSM -5 diagnostic criteria) among adults receiving long -term opioid therapy for pain, with slightly 3722 lower prevalence (21.5% for any and 4.2% for moderate to sev ere opioid use disorder) in clinics with 3723 more consistent use of risk reduction practices (Boscarino et al., 2020) (Von Korff et al., 2017) . 3724 Opioid use disorder is manifested by at least 2 out of 11 defined criteria occurring within a year 3725 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) : 3726 (1) Taking opioids in larger amounts or over a longer period of time than intended 3727 (2) Having a persistent desire or unsuccessful attempts to red uce or control opioid use 3728 (3) Spending excess time obtaining, using or recovering from opioids 3729 (4) Craving for opioids 3730 (5) Continuing opioid use causing inability to fulfill work, home, or school responsibilities 3731 (6) Continuing opioid use despite havin g persistent social or interpersonal problems 3732 (7) Lack of involvement in social, occupational or recreational activities 3733 151 (8) Using opioids in physically hazardous situations 3734 (9) Continuing opioid use in spite of awareness of persistent physical or psycho logical problems 3735 (10) Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: 3736 a. A need for markedly increased amounts of opioids to achieve intoxication or desired 3737 effect, or 3738 b. Markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of an opioid. 3739 (11) Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: 3740 a. The characteristic opioid withdrawal syndrome, or 3741 b. Opioids (or a closely related) substance is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal 3742 symptoms. 3743 Note: C riteria 10 and 11 are not considered to be met for those taking opioids solely under 3744 appropriate medical supervision (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) . 3745 3746 Severity is specified as mild (2 -3 criteria), moderate (4 -5 criteria) or severe ( >6 criteria) 3747 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) . 3748 FDA-approved medications indicated for the treatment of opioid use disorder and/or the 3749 prevention of relapse include buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone. The clinical evidence reviews 3750 found evidence on the effectiveness of interventions (e.g., medicat ions, behavioral treatments) for 3751 opioid use disorder related to prescription opioids to be limited (Chou et al., April 2020) . However, 3752 moderate quality evidence shows buprenorphine (a opioid) and methadone (a full 3753 agonist opioid) to be effective in preventing relapse among patients with opioid use disorder involving 3754 heroin (Fullerton et al., 2014; Mattick, Breen, Kimber, & Davoli, 2009, 2014) , though the presence of 3755 pain among patients in these studies is generally not described. In addition, a small number of studies 3756 have evaluated buprenorphine for patients with prescriptio n opioid dependence (based on DSM -IV 3757 152 (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) criteria) and found it effective in preventing relapse (Fiellin et 3758 al., 2014; Weiss et al., 2011) . One study found that among p eople with opioid use disorder, prior 3759 prescription opioid use predicts stabilization on buprenorphine (Varisco, Shen, & Thornton, 2020) . 3760 Another trial that performed buprenorphine induction and then randomized patients to buprenorphine 3761 taper versus maintenance was terminated early without reporting of planne d outcomes because all 3762 patients randomized to the taper arm switched to maintenance or experienced a relapse; five of six 3763 patients in the maintenance arm completed the trial (Blondell et al., 2010) . In another trial identified by 3764 the clinical evidence reviews, there was no difference between buprenorphine/naloxone and 3765 methadone in likelihood of retention in the study, pain, function, or self -reported side effects (Neumann 3766 et al., 2013) . Buprenorphine and methadone treatment of opioid use disorder have been associated 3767 with reduced overdose mortality (Krawczyk et al., 2020) and reduced overall mortality (Pearce et al., 3768 2020) . Naltrexone (an opioid antagonist) can also be used for opioid use disorder, particularly for highly 3769 motivated persons (Krupitsky et al., 2011; Minozzi et al., 2011) . Naltrexone blocks the effects of opioids 3770 if they are used. Naltrexone has not been evaluated in people with concomitant pain and opioid use 3771 disorder, and opioid medications for pain cannot be used in patients receiving nal trexone. Naltrexone 3772 requires adherence to daily oral therapy or monthly, long -acting injections. The effectiveness of oral 3773 naltrexone can be limited by poor medication adherence (Minozzi et al., 2011) ; oral naltrexone should 3774 not be used except under very limited circumstances (American Society of Addiction Medicine, 2020) , 3775 e.g., for patients who would be able to comply with observed dosing to enhance adherence (American 3776 Psychiatric Association, 2013; American Society of Addiction Medicine, 2020) . Naltrexone must also be 3777 started following full withdrawal from opioids, which is a challenge for some patients, but for patients 3778 who have already completed or are able to com plete withdrawal, naltrexone has been found to have 3779 comparable effectiveness as buprenorphine in prevention of relapse (J. D. Lee et al., 2018) . 3780 153 Some studies suggest that using behavioral therapies in combination with medications for 3781 opioid use disorder can reduce opioid misuse and increase retention during treatment (Amato, Mi nozzi, Davoli, & Vecchi, 2011; Connock et al., 2007) . At the same time, a study of treatment for prescription 3783 opioid dependence (based on DSM -IV (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) criteria) found opioid 3784 agonist treatment with buprenor phine and standard medical management (including basic counseling 3785 recommending abstinence and self -help group participation) as effective as buprenorphine combined 3786 with more intensive opioid dependence counseling (ODC: addiction, recovery, and relapse prev ention 3787 education with self -help and lifestyle change recommendations, interactive exercises, and take -home 3788 assignments delivered by trained substance use treatment or mental health professionals in 45 -60 3789 minute sessions based on drug counseling manuals wit h demonstrated efficacy); neither standard 3790 medical management nor ODC alone, without buprenorphine, was effective in preventing relapse 3791 (Weiss et al., 2011) . Current recommendations for treatment of opioid use disorder include that 3792 patients' psychosocial needs be assessed, and patients offered or referred to psychosocial treatment in 3793 collaboration with qualified behavioral healthcare providers based on individual patient needs, but that 3794 a patient's decision to decline psychosocial tre atment or the absence of available psychosocial 3795 treatment should not preclude or delay medications for opioid use disorder (American Society of 3796 Addiction Medicine, 2020) . Additional recommendations have been published on goals, components of, 3797 and types of effective psychosocial treatment to use in conjunction with pharmacological treatment of 3798 opioid use disorder (American Society of Addiction Medicine, 2020) . 3799 Experts agreed with the strength of the language in the recommendation statement, specifically 3800 with the word \"should\" and with recommendation cat egory A, and some noted they thought the 3801 evidence type should be 1. Several experts thought opioid agonist/opioid partial agonist and opioid 3802 antagonist treatment should not be framed as equal options for opioid use disorder, noting that opioid 3803 154 agonist and opioid partial agonist treatment have stronger evidence for better outcomes, does not 3804 require abstinence, have less challenges with inductions, and are much more widely utilized. 3805 If clinicians suspect opioid use disorder based on patient concerns or behav iors or on findings in 3806 prescription drug monitoring program data (see Recommendation 9) or from toxicology testing (see 3807 Recommendation 10), they should discuss their concern with their patient and provide an opportunity 3808 for the patient to disclose related concerns or problems. Clinicians should assess for the presence of 3809 opioid use disorder using DSM -5 criteria (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) . Opioid use disorder 3810 can co-exist with other substance use disorders, and patients who are actively using substances 3811 during opioid use disorder treatment might require greater support, potentially including involvement 3812 of an addiction specialist (American Society of Addiction M edicine, 2020) . Clinicians should ask about 3813 use of alcohol and other substances (see Recommendation 8). Alternatively, clinicians can arrange for a 3814 substance use disorder treatment specialist to assess for the presence of opioid and other substance use 3815 disorders. 3816 For patients meeting criteria for opioid use disorder, particularly if moderate or severe, 3817 clinicians should offer or arrange for patients to receive treatment with medication for opioid use 3818 disorder. Patients with opioid use disorder may benef it from counseling and referrals to mutual help 3819 groups such as Narcotics Anonymous (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Adm inistration, 3820 2021c) . Clinicians should also offer naloxone and training on proper use for overdose reversal to 3821 patients with opioid use disorder and to their household members/significant others (American Society 3822 of Addiction Medicine, 2020) (see Recommendation 8). Clinicians should not dismiss patients from their 3823 practice because of opioid use disorder because this can adversely affect patient safety and could 3824 represent patient abandonment. Identification of opioid use disorder represents an opportunity for a 3825 clinician to initiate potentially life -saving interventions, and it is important for the clinician to collaborate 3826 with the patient regarding the ir safety to increase the likelihood of successful treatment. Detoxification 3827 155 on its own, without medications for opioid use disorder, is not recommended for opioid use 3828 disorder due to increased risks of relapse, overdose, and overdose death (American Society of Addiction 3829 Medicine, 2020) . 3830 For pregnant people with opioid use disorder, medication therapy with buprenorphine or 3831 methadone has been associated with improved maternal outcomes and should be offered (see 3832 Recommendation 8 (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2018a) ). 3833 Transmucosal buprenophine (without naloxone) has been recommended durin g pregnancy to avoid 3834 potential prenatal exposure to naloxone, especially if injected, and evidence on the safety of naloxone in 3835 pregnant people remains limited (American Society of Addiction Medicine, 2020; The American College 3836 of Obst etricians and Gynecologists Committee on Obstetric Practice & American Society of Addiction 3837 Medicine, 2017) . However, combination buprenorphine/naloxone products are frequently used, and 3838 experts have noted that combination products are likely to be safe and effective fo r pregnant individuals 3839 when taken as prescribed (American Society of Addiction Medicine, 2020; The American College of 3840 Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee on Obstetric Practice & American Society of Addiction 3841 Medicine, 2017) . The American Coll ege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also recommends that if a 3842 woman is stable on naltrexone prior to pregnancy, the decision regarding whether to continue 3843 naltrexone treatment during pregnancy should involve a careful discussion between the provider and 3844 the patient, weighing the limited safety data on naltrexone with the potential risk of relapse with 3845 discontinuation of treatment (The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee on 3846 Obstetric Practice & American Society of Addiction Medicine, 2017) . The American Academy of 3847 Pediatrics recommends that for infants of mothers receiving buprenorphine or methadone for opioid 3848 use disorder who have not had relapse for >90 days, breastfeeding should be supported if there are no 3849 other contraindications (e.g., HIV infection) while for infants of women with active substance use or with 3850 relapses within the last 30 days, breast feeding should be discouraged (Patrick et al., 2020) . 3851 156 To expand access to buprenorphine, in April 2021, the Practice Guidelines for the Administration 3852 of Buprenorphine for Treating Opioid Use Disorder (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 3853 2021) exempted eligible physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, 3854 certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives from previous Controlled 3855 Substances Act certification requirements related to train ing, counseling and other ancillary services 3856 (i.e., psychosocial services). To prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder for up to 30 patients in 3857 an office -based setting, clinicians can now forgo or choose to undertake training but must still receive a 3858 waiver from SAMHSA. Information about qualifications and the process to obtain a waiver are available 3859 from SAMHSA (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2021b) . 3860 Additional recommendations have been published previously on induction, use, and monitoring 3861 of buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder (American Society of Addiction Medicine, 2020; 3862 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2021c) . Buprenorphine for treatment of 3863 opioid use disorder is usually combined with naloxone in a sublingual or buccal film or tablet (e.g., 3864 Suboxone), to reduce the potential for misuse of buprenorphine when injected. Naloxone is not 3865 absorbed orally, but i f buprenorphine/naloxone is manipulated and injected, naloxone can buprenorphine became available in 3867 2018 (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2020b) . As a partial agonist, b uprenorphine should generally 3868 not be initiated until there are objective signs of withdrawal, in order to avoid precipitating withdrawal. 3869 As an alternative for patients not yet in opioid withdrawal, some authors have described a low -dose 3870 induction approach (sometimes referred to as \"microdosing\") (Randhawa, & Nolan, 2020; Robbins, 3871 Englander, & Gregg, 2021) to avoid precipitated withdrawal when initiating buprenorphine, although 3872 there is limited evidence to date regarding this approach. For standard (not low -dose) buprenorphine 3873 induction, o nce objective signs of withdrawal are observed, bupreno rphine should be initiated, usually 3874 at a dose of 2 to 4 mg (American Society of Addiction Medicine, 2020) and titrated upwards under 3875 157 supervision at app roximately 2hour intervals as needed to control withdrawal symptoms in 2 or 4 mg 3876 increments, up to 8 mg buprenorphine total over the first 24 hours (Indivior, 2017) . On the second day, 3877 the patient can be given a single dose consisting of the total of the doses received the first day. If there 3878 are residual withdrawal symp toms, the dose may be increased in 4 mg increments, up to a maximum of 3879 16 mg total in the 2nd 24 hours (Indivior, 2017) . Protocols for initiating buprenorphine by patient s at 3880 home following an initial encounter with a healthcare provider to establish the diagnosis of OUD and 3881 discuss medication therapy options are in use by more experienced clinicians (Joshua D. Lee, Vocci, & 3882 Fiellin, 2014) . Most patients are maintained on 8 mg to 16 mg per day (Soeffing, Martin, Fingerhood, 3883 Jasinski, & Rastegar, 2009) , with a range of 4 to 24 mg per day (Indivior, 2017) ; (American Society of 3884 Addiction Medicine, 2020) there is some e vidence that suggests that 16 mg per day or more might be 3885 more effective than lower dosages (American Society of Addiction Medicine, 2020) . 3886 Importantly, o pioid dosage thresholds for caution in the treatment of pain are not applicable to 3887 opioid agonist treatment of opioid use disorder (Houry, 2018) recommended dosages of methadone 3888 and buprenorphine for opioid use disorder (American Society of Addiction Medicine, 2020) differ from 3889 those for pain management . There is no recommended duration limit for treatment of opioid use 3890 disorder with buprenorphine or metha done, and discontinuation is associated with risks for relapse and 3891 opioid overdose (American Society of Addiction Medicine, 2020) . If discontinued, bup renorphine should 3892 be tapered very gradually (over several months) (American Society of Addiction Medicine, 2020) . 3893 Compared to b uprenorphine, which can be prescribed by waivered clinicians in any setting or 3894 dispensed from a SAMHSA -certified opioid treatment program (OTP), ongoing methadone treatment for 3895 opioid use disorder can only be provided through an OTP. As short -term exceptio ns, any clinician can 3896 administer (but not prescribe) up to one day's supply of methadone or buprenorphine to treat acute 3897 opioid withdrawal per day for up to 3 days, while working to refer the patient to opioid use disorder 3898 treatment, and patients already r eceiving opioid use disorder treatment may continue to directly 3899 158 receive methadone or buprenorphine treatment in an emergency department or in a hospital during 3900 inpatient hospitalization (U.S. Department of Justice Drug Enforcement Administration) . 3901 Naltrexone does not require a waiver and can be prescribed in any setting. Additional 3902 recommendations have been published previously on naltrexone t reatment for opioid use disorder 3903 (American Society of Addiction Medicine, 2020) . A minimum of 7 to 10 days free of opioids is 3904 recommended prior to the first naltrexone dose to avoid precipitation of severe opioid withdrawal 3905 (Alkermes, 2020) . Extended -release injectable naltrexone generally administered every 4 weeks by 3906 deep intramuscular (IM) injection in the gluteal muscle at 380 mg per injection (American Society of 3907 Addiction Medicine, 2020) , alternating buttocks for each subsequent injection (Alkermes, 2020) . Some 3908 patients, including those who metabolize naltrexone more rapidly, might benefit from dosing as 3909 frequently as every 3 weeks (American Society of Addiction Medicine, 2020) . There is no recommended 3910 duration limit for treatment of opioid use disorde r with naltrexone. If discontinued, naltrexone can be 3911 stopped abruptly without withdrawal symptoms (American Society of Addiction Medicine, 2020) . 3912 Clinicians should warn patients who discontinue naltrexone of the risk of potentially fatal opioid 3913 overdose if opioid use is resumed (American Society of Addi ction Medicine, 2020) , due to the loss of 3914 tolerance to previous opioid dosage. 3915 Clinicians are strongly encouraged to provide medication treatment for their patients with 3916 opioid use disorder. Clinicians unable to provide treatment themselves should arra nge for patients with 3917 opioid use disorder to receive care from a substance use disorder treatment specialist, such as an office - 3918 based buprenorphine or naltrexone treatment clinician, or from an opioid treatment program certified 3919 by SAMHSA to provide methad one or buprenorphine for patients with opioid use disorder. Resources to 3920 help with arranging for Directory 3923 159 (https://dpt2.samhsa.gov/treatment/directory.aspx ). Clinicians should assist patients in finding qualified 3924 treatment specialists and should arrange for patients to follow up with these specialists, as well as 3925 arranging for ongoing coordination of care. Tr eatment need in a community is often not met by capacity 3926 to provide buprenorphine or methadone therapy (Jones, . 3927 Clinicians prescribing opioids in communities without sufficient treatment capacity for opioid use 3928 disorder should obtain a waiver to prescribe buprenorphine. SAMHSA's Providers Clinical Support 3929 System ( https://pcssnow.org/ ) offers training and technical assistance as well as mentors to assist 3930 clinicians in assessment for and the treatment of substance use disorders and specifically of opioid use 3931 disorder, and on the interface of pain and opioid misuse. Clinicians prescribing opioids should identify 3932 treatment resources for substance use disorders including opioid use disor ders in the community and 3933 should work together to ensure sufficient treatment capacity at the practice level. 3934 3935 Management of opioid misuse that does not meet criteria for opioid use disorder 3936 For patients with opioid misuse that does not meet criteria for opioid use disorder (e.g., taking 3937 opioids in larger amounts than intended without meeting other criteria for opioid use disorder) , 3938 clinicians should reassess the patient's pain, ensure that th erapies for pain management have been 3939 optimized (see Recommendation 2), discuss with patients, and carefully weigh benefits and risks of 3940 continuing opioids at the current dosage (see Recommendation 5). For patients who choose to but are 3941 unable to taper, cl inicians may reassess for opioid use disorder and offer buprenorphine treatment or 3942 refer for buprenorphine or methadone treatment if criteria for opioid use disorder are met. Even 3943 without a diagnosis of opioid use disorder, transitioning to buprenorphine f or pain can also be 3944 considered given reduced overdose risk with buprenorphine compared with risk associated with full 3945 agonist opioids (see Recommendation 5). 3946 3947 160 Pain management for patients with opioid use disorder 3948 Although identification of an opioid use disorder can alter the expected benefits and risks of 3949 opioid therapy for pain, patients with co -occurring pain and substance use disorder require ongoing pain 3950 management that maximizes benefits relative to risks. Cl inicians should use nonpharmacologic and 3951 nonopioid pharmacologic pain treatments as appropriate (American Society of Addiction Medicine, 3952 2020) (see Rec ommendations 1 and 2) to provide optimal pain management. For patients with pain who 3953 have an active opioid use disorder but are not in treatment, clinicians should consider buprenorphine or 3954 methadone treatment for opioid use disorder, which can also help w ith concurrent management of pain 3955 (American Society of Addiction Medicine, 2020) . For patients who are treated with buprenorphine for 3956 opioid use disord er and experience acute pain, clinicians can consider temporarily increasing the 3957 buprenorphine dosing frequency (e.g., to twice a day (American Society of Addiction Medicine, 2020) ) to 3958 help manage pain, given the duration of effects of buprenorphine is shorter for pain than for 3959 suppression of withdrawal (Alford et al., 2006) . For severe acute pain (e.g., trauma and/or unplanned 3960 major surgery), clinicians can consider additional as -needed doses of buprenorphine for patients 3961 receiving buprenorphine for opioid use disorder and short -term use of higher -potency nonopioid 3962 analgesics (e.g., NSAIDs) for disorder; patients receiving 3963 methadone for opioid use disorder who require additional opioids as treatment for pain management 3964 should be carefully monitored, and when feasible should optimally be treated by a clinician experienced 3965 in the treatment of pain in consultation with their opioid treatment program. (American Society of 3966 Addiction Medicine, 2020) . The ASAM National Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Opioid Use 3967 Disorder (2020 Focused Update) provides a dditional recommendations (see Part 9) (American Society of 3968 Addiction Medicine, 2020) for the management of patients receiving medications for opioid use disorder 3969 who have planned surgeri es for which nonopioid therapies are not anticipated to provide sufficient pain 3970 relief. 3971 161 Conclusions and future directions 3972 CDC indicated the intent to evaluate and reassess the 2016 CDC guideline as new evidence 3973 became available and to determine when the c losure of research gaps would prompt an update. To 3974 achieve these aims, CDC funded the AHRQ to conduct systematic reviews of the scientific evidence in 3975 the following five areas: chronic chronic pain; treatments for acute 3977 pain; and acute treatments for episodic migraine (Chou et al., April 2020; Chou et al., December 2020; 3978 Halker Singh et al., December 2020; McDonagh et al., April 2020; Skelly et al., April 2020) . Based upon 3979 these reviews, an update to the CDC 2016 Guideline was warranted. 3980 The evidence reviews that in formed this clinical practice guideline affirmed the appropriateness 3981 of the recommendations included in the 2016 CDC guideline for using opioids to treat chronic pain. The 3982 reviews also allowed CDC to expand the focus to include acute and subacute pain more explicitly. This 3983 clinical practice guideline also includes a new topline recommendation for patients with chronic pain 3984 who are already on higher opioid dosages. Specifically, the clinical practice guideline outlines how 3985 clinicians and patients should work together in assessing the benefits and risks of continued opioid use 3986 and if or when to taper opioids to a lower dosage or discontinue opioids all together in accordance with 3987 the HHS Tapering Guide (Dowell, Compton, & Giroir, 2019; U.S. Department of Health and Human 3988 Services, 2019a) . 3989 There are 4 key domains covered by the updated clinical practice guideline for prescribing of 3990 opioid pain medication for patients 18 and older for pain outside of sickle cell disease -related pain 3991 management, cancer pain treatment , palliative care, and end -of-life care . These include whether to 3992 initiate opioids for pain treatment; opioid selection and dosage; opioid duration and follow -up; and 3993 assessing the risks and addressing harms of opioid use. In addition, five guidin g principles were 3994 162 identified to inform implementation across recommendations that focus on the appropriate treatment 3995 of pain, flexibility to meet the care needs and clinical circumstances of each patient through a 3996 multimodal and multidisciplinary approach to pain management, avoiding misapplying the clinical 3997 practice guideline beyond its intended use, and vigilantly attending to health inequities and ensuring 3998 access to an appropriate, affordable, diversified, coordinated, and effective nonpharmacologic and 3999 pharmacologic pain treatment for all persons. 4000 A central tenet of this clinical practice guideline is that acute, subacute, and chronic pain needs 4001 to be appropriately and effectively treated independent of whether opioids are part of a treatment 4002 regimen. This is done by selecting one or more nonpharmacologic or pharmacologic treatment 4003 modalities that maximize patient safety and optimize outcomes in pain, function, and quality of life. A 4004 multimodal and multidisciplinary approach to pain management attending to the biological, 4005 psychological, and social characteristics of each person is critical (U.S. Department of Health and Human 4006 Services, 2019b) . The care provided needs to be individuali zed and person -centered (U.S. Department of 4007 Health and Human Services, 2019b) . Clinicians and patients should work together to identify treatment 4008 goals and tailor an approach that cons iders both the benefits and risks of available options (U.S. 4009 Department of Health and Human Services, 2019b) . Progress should be monitored over time and 4010 treatment protocols adjusted ac cordingly. Health systems and payers should work to ensure multimodal 4011 treatment options are available, accessible, and reimbursed for patients. Public and private payers 4012 should support a broader array of nonpharmacologic interventions such as exercise, mul tidisciplinary 4013 rehabilitation, mind -body interventions, cognitive behavioral therapy, and some complementary and 4014 integrative medicine therapies like acupuncture and spinal manipulation, given their increasingly known 4015 effectiveness (Skelly et al., April 2020) . Reimbursement is often cited as a principle barrier to why these 4016 nonpharmacologic treatments are not more widely used (Skelly et al., April 2020) . 4017 163 An integral part of providing access to and delivery of high -quality healthcare, including pain 4018 treatment, is understanding how the social determinants of health influence the healthcare provided 4019 and the differential outcomes observed (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2020 ). Social, 4020 economic, educational, and neighborhood -level factors may create and exacerbate health inequities 4021 experienced across the life course (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2020) . These social 4022 determinants of health are borne out of historical and contemporary injustices that advantage some and 4023 disadvantage others in society leading to the syste mic marginalization or oppression of some groups 4024 such as people from some racial and ethnic groups, people living in rural areas, persons experiencing 4025 homelessness, people with disabilities, people with substance use disorders, justice -involved 4026 populations , and non -US born persons among others (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 4027 2020a) . 4028 Outcomes are also influenced by the healthcare context (Agency for Healthcare Research and 4029 Quality, 2020) . Differential access to and coverage for high -quality, culturally and linguistically 4030 appropriate, health -literate care may influence attitudes towards healthcare and u se of available 4031 services (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2020) . Prejudice, bias, discrimination, and 4032 stereotyping by individual clinicians, practices, health systems, and payers serve to reinforce these 4033 health disparities (Institute of Medicine, 2003) . Clinicians, practices, health systems, and payers should 4034 attend to health inequities to ensure access to appropriate, diversified, effective nonpharmacologic and 4035 pharmacologic pain management options that are person -centered, affordable, accessible, and well - 4036 coordinated as well as protect patient safety and guard against unnecessary risks. This begins with 4037 raising awareness and acknowledging the presence of these inequities, st rengthening patient -clinician 4038 communication, leveraging community health workers, implementing multidisciplinary care teams, 4039 tracking and monitoring performance measures, and integrating quality improvement initiatives that 4040 support and invest in guideline concordant care for all persons (Institute of Medicine, 2003) . 4041 164 Special attention should be given to avoid misapplying this updated clinical practice guideline 4042 beyond its intended use or implementing policies purportedly derived from it that result in unintended 4043 consequences for patients (Dowell, Haegerich, et al., 2019) . This includes being inflexible on opioid dose 4044 and duration, discontinuing or dismissing patients from a practice, rapidly and non -collaboratively 4045 tapering patients who may be stable on a higher dose, and applying recommendations to populations 4046 that are not a focus of the clinical practice guideline such as patients with cancer, sickle cell disease, or 4047 during end -of-life care (Dowell, Haegerich, et al., 2019) . 4048 The uptake and widespread utilization of the 2016 CDC guideline hinged on its suc cessful 4049 dissemination. CDC invested in activities to support its translation and integration into clinical practice. 4050 Most notably, CDC produced a checklist and mobile app for clinicians to more readily follow guideline 4051 recommendations; fact sheets, posters , and public service announcements (PSAs) making key 4052 components of the guideline more accessible and understandable to clinicians and patients; and a 14 - 4053 module interactive, web -based training featuring self -paced learning, case -based content, knowledge 4054 checks, and integrated resources for clinicians (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021b) . CDC 4055 also developed and implemented a quality improvement (QI) and care coordination initiative to improve 4056 and encourage careful and selective use of long -term opioid therapy in the context of managi ng chronic 4057 pain (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018b) . This included 16 clinical quality improvement 4058 measures (Shoemaker -Hunt et al., 2021) as well as practice -level strategies to help health systems 4059 organize and improve the management and coordination of opioid therapy using an interdisciplinary 4060 team approach, establishing practice policies and standards, and leveraging EHR data to develop 4061 registries and track QI measures (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018b) . CDC invested in 4062 health IT and other clinical decision support tools by collaborating with the Office of the National 4063 Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) to create and integrate guideline -concordant care 4064 into clinical workflow (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021b) . In addition, C DC compiled 4065 165 complementary clinical recommendations from professional organizations for clinicians to reference for 4066 several common conditions associated with acute pain - including acute migraines, ankle sprains, dental 4067 pain, acute low back pain, and post -surgical pain (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020b) . 4068 All information in the web -based resource is based on external research (Mikosz et al., 2020) and 4069 existing published guidelines from professional organizations. The compilati on can further assist 4070 clinicians and patients, working together, in making safer and more effective pain management 4071 decisions. 4072 This updated clinical practice guideline provides overarching voluntary recommendations on the 4073 use of opioids to treat pain. To a ssist in the uptake and understanding of this clinical practice guideline, 4074 CDC will update existing resources to align with the new clinical practice guideline and develop new 4075 tools and resources for clinicians, health systems, patients, and others on the use of opioid and non - 4076 opioid pain treatments \u2014 including resources supporting health equity. Finally, CDC will work with 4077 public and private payers with the aim of improving coverage for nonpharmacologic treatments, 4078 increasing access to non -opioid pain medi cation, supporting patient counseling and coordination of 4079 care, increasing access to evidence -based treatments of opioid use disorder, and enhancing availability 4080 of multidisciplinary and multimodal care. Robust coverage and access (e.g., limited utilizatio n 4081 management and cost sharing for evidence -based treatments) and decision support (e.g., adjustment of 4082 EHR prescribing defaults) can be used to nudge clinicians and patients toward evidence -based 4083 treatments as default treatments for pain (Ancker et al., 2020) . 4085 This clinical practice guideline updates and expands upon the recommendations in the 2016 CDC 4086 Guideline and is based on the best available evidence as interpreted and informed by expert opinion and 4087 attending to the values and preferences of patients, caregivers, and clinicians. While clinical scientific 4088 evidence continues to advance and supports the recommendations in the clinical practice guideline, the 4089 166 strength of the evidence is sometimes weak and research gaps remain (Chou et al., April 2020; Chou et 4090 al., December 2020; Halker Singh et al., Dec McDonagh et al., April 2020; National 4091 Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine, Health and Medicine Division, Board on Health 4092 Sciences Policy, & Committee on Pain Management and Regulatory Strategies to Address Prescription 4093 Opioid Abuse, 2017; Skelly et al., April 2020; U.S. of Health and Human Services, 2019b) . 4094 4095 The areas in need of additional research include but are not limited to Efficacy of screening to ols to assess risk for opioid misuse and developing an opioid use disorder. Effective management of patients on high dose opioids; the application of multidisciplinary and multimodal models of pain treatment, and service delivery modalities including telehealth. Long -term comparative effectiveness of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies. Effects of therapies on non -pain outcomes. Treatment outcomes for specific pain conditions and how benefits and risks of therapies vary among sub -populations. Adapting evidence -based opioid prescribing and pain management strategies to meet the needs of special populations including people from so me racial and ethnic groups, older adults, and rural communities. Improved diagnostics in measuring pain. 167 Enhanced clinician and patient education about pain and the use of opioids; the assessment of practice -level strategies in health systems to improve management and care coordination for patients on opioid therapy. Transition from acute to chronic pain and how to apply effective diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic approaches. Effect of stigma as a barrier for treating pain and getting treatment f or an opioid use disorder. 4096 4097 In closing, the principle aim of this clinical practice guideline is to ensure people have access to 4098 safe, accessible, and effective pain management that improves their function and quality of life while 4099 illuminating and re ducing risks associated with prescription opioids, and ultimately reducing the 4100 consequences of prescription opioid misuse and overdose. Lessons learned from the development of 4101 the 2016 CDC guideline informed the process used to generate this update. CDC wi ll evaluate the clinical 4102 practice guideline to identify the impact of the recommendations on clinician and patient outcomes as 4103 well as the intended and unintended consequences. Communication between clinicians and patients 4104 about the risks and benefits of o pioids should be central to treatment decisions for patients in pain. This 4105 clinical practice guideline can help inform those decisions and assist clinicians in meeting the unique 4106 needs of each person. C DC will revisit this clinical practice guideline when remaining evidence gaps have 4107 sufficiently been addressed and another update is warranted.

Clin J Pain 2008;24:521 -7; *Multiply the dose for each opioid by the conversion factor to determine the dose in MMEs. For example, t ablets 5669 containing hydrocodone 5 mg and acetaminophen 325 mg taken four times a day would contain a total of 20 mg of 5670 hydrocodone daily, equivalent to 20 MME daily; extended -release tablets containing oxycodone 10mg and taken 5671 twice a day would contain a tot al of 20mg of oxycodone daily, equivalent to 30 MME daily. 5672 The following cautions should be noted: 1) All doses are in mg/day except for fentanyl, which is mcg/hr. 2) 5673 Equianalgesic dose conversions are only estimates and cannot account for individual variability in genetics and 5674 pharmacokinetics. 3) Do not use the calculated dose in MMEs to determine the doses to use when converting one 5675 opioid to another; when converting opioids, the new opioid is typically dosed at a substantially lower dose than 5676 the calculated MME dose to avoid overdose due to incomplete cross -tolerance and individual variability in opioid 5677 pharmacokinetics. 4) Use particular caution with methadone dose conversions because methadone has a long and 5678 variable half -life, and peak respiratory depressant effect occurs later and lasts longer than peak anal gesic effect. 5) 5679 Use particular caution with transdermal fentanyl since it is dosed in mcg/hr instead of mg/day, and its absorption 5680 is affected by heat and other factors. 6) Buprenorphine products approved for the treatment of pain are not 5681 included in the table due to their partial mu receptor agonist activity and resultant ceiling effects compared to full 5682 mu receptor agonists. 7) These conversion factors should not be applied to dosage decisions related to the 5683 management of opioid use disorder. 5684 5685 Tapentad agonist and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor.

CDC recommendations for prescri bing opioids for outpatients with pain outside of sickle cell 5754 disease -related pain management, cancer pain treatment, palliative care, and end -of-life care 5755 Determining whether or not to initiate opioids for pain 5756 5757 1. Nonopioid therapies are effective for many common types of acute pain. Clinicians should only 5758 consider opioid therapy for acute pain if benefits are anticipated to outweigh risks to the patient. 5759 (recommendation category: B, evidence type: 3). 5760 5761 2. Nonopioid therapies are preferred for subacute and chronic pain. Clinicians should only consider 5762 initiating opioid therapy if expected benefits for pain and function are anticipated to outweigh risks 5763 to the patient. Before starting opioid therapy for subac ute or chronic pain, clinicians should discuss 5764 with patients the known risks and realistic benefits of opioid therapy, should work with patients to 5765 establish treatment goals for pain and function, and should consider how opioid therapy will be 5766 discontinued if benefits do not outweigh risks (recommendation category: A, evidence type: 2). 5767 5768 Opioid selection and dosage 5769 5770 3. When starting opioid therapy for acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should prescribe 5771 immediate When are started for opioid -na\u00efve patients with acute, subacute, or chronic pain , clinicians 5775 should prescribe the lowest dosage to achieve expected effects. If opioids are continued for 5776 subacute or chronic pain , clinicians should use caution when prescribing opioids at any dosage, 5777 should carefully evaluate individual benefits and risk s when considering increasing dosage , and 5778 should avoid increasing dosage above levels likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits relative to 5779 risks to patients ( recommendation category: A, evidence type: 3). 5780 5781 5. For patients already receiving higher opioi d dosages , clinicians should carefully weigh benefits and 5782 risks and exercise care when reducing or continuing opioid dosage. If risks outweigh benefits of 5783 continued opioid therapy, clinicians should optimize other therapies and work closely with patients 5784 to gradually taper to lower dosages or, if warranted based on the individual clinical circumstances of 5785 the patient, to appropriately taper and discontinue opioids. Unless there are indications of a life - 5786 threatening issue, such as warning signs of impending overdose, e.g., confusion, sedation, or slurred 5787 speech, opioid therapy should not be discontinued abruptly, and clinicians should not abruptly or 5788 rapidly reduce opioid dosages from higher dosages (recommendation category: B, evidence type: 4) . 5789 5790 follow -up 5791 5792 6. When opioids are needed for acute pain, clinicians should prescribe no greater quantity than 5793 needed for the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids (recommendation 5794 category: A, evidence type: 4) . 5795 5796 7. Clinicians should evaluate benefits an d risks with patients within 1 to 4 weeks of starting opioid 5797 therapy for subacute or chronic pain or of dose escalation. Clinicians should evaluate benefits and 5798 209 risks of continued therapy with patients every 3 months or more frequently (recommendation 5799 cate gory: B, evidence type: 4) . 5800 and addressing harms of opioid use 5802 5803 8. Before starting and periodically during continuation of opioid therapy, clinicians should evaluate risk 5804 for opioid -related harms and discuss with patients . Clinicians should wo rk with patients to 5805 incorporate into the management plan strategies to mitigate risk, including offering naloxone when 5806 factors that increase risk for opioid overdose are present category: A, 5808 5809 prescribing initial opio id therapy for acute, subacute, or chronic pain, and periodically during 5810 opioid therapy for chronic pain, clinicians should review the patient's history of controlled substance 5811 prescriptions using state prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) data to d etermine whether 5812 the patient is receiving opioid dosages or combinations that put the patient at high risk for overdose 5813 (recommendation category: B, When prescribing opioids for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should consider toxicology 5816 testing to assess for prescribed medications as well as other prescribed and non -prescribed 5817 controlled substances (recommendation category: B, evidence type: 4) . 5818 5819 11. Clinicians should use extreme caution when prescribing opioid pain medication and 5820 benzodiazepines concurrently and consider whether benefits outweigh risks of concurrent 5821 prescribing of opioids and other central nervous system B, evidence type: 3) . 5823 5824 12. Clinicians should offer or arrange treatment with medication for patients with opioid use disorder 5825 (recommendation category: A, evidence type: 1) . 5826 5827 5828 * See full clinical practice guideline for recommendation categories and evidence ratings. 5829 These five guiding principles should broadly inform implementation across recommendations: 5830 1. Acute, subacute, and chronic pain need to be appropriately and effectively treated independent 5831 of whether opioids are part of a treatment regime n. 5832 2. Recommendations are voluntary and are intended to support, not supplant, individualized, 5833 person -centered care. Flexibility to meet the care needs and the clinical circumstances of a 5834 specific patient are paramount. 5835 3. A multimodal and multidisciplinary app roach to pain management attending to the physical 5836 health, behavioral health, long -term services and supports, and expected health outcomes and 5837 well-being needs of each person is critical. 5838 4. Special attention should be given to avoid misapplying this updated clinical practice guideline 5839 beyond its intended use or implementing policies purportedly derived from it that might lead to 5840 unintended consequences for patients. 5841 5. Clinicians, practices, health systems, and payers should vigilantly attend to health inequiti es, 5842 provide culturally and linguistically appropriate communication, and ensure access to an 5843 210 appropriate, affordable, diversified, coordinated, and effective nonpharmacologic and 5844 pharmacologic pain management regimen for all persons. 5845 5846 5847 5848 211 BOX 2. Interpretation of recommendation categories and evidence type 5849 5850 Recommendation categories 5851 Based on evidence type, balance between desirable and undesirable effects, values and preferences, 5852 and resource allocation (cost). 5853 Category A recommendation : Applies to all persons; most patients should receive the recommended 5854 course of action. 5855 Category B recommendation : Individual decision making needed; different choices will be appropriate 5856 for different patients. Clinicians help patients arrive at a decision consistent with patient values and 5857 preferences and specific clinical situations. 5858 5859 Evidence typ e 5860 Based on study design as well as a function of limitations in study design or implementation, 5861 imprecision of estimates, variability in findings, indirectness of evidence, publication bias, magnitude of 5862 treatment effects, dose -response gradient, and cons tellation of plausible biases that could change 5863 effects. 5864 Type 1 evidence : Randomized clinical trials or overwhelming evidence from observational studies. 5865 Type 2 evidence : Randomized clinical trials with important limitations, or exceptionally strong 5866 evid ence from observational studies. 5867 Type 3 evidence : Observational studies or randomized clinical trials with notable limitations. 5868 Type 4 evidence : Clinical experience and observations, observational studies with important 5869 limitations, or randomized clinical trials with "}
