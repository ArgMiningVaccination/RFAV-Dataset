Moderna also reported that its vaccine's efficacy rate was consistent across age, race, ethnicity and gender demographics as well as having a 100 per cent success rate in preventing severe cases of a disease that has killed nearly 1.5 million people.

We now have the data to prove it,\" Moderna Chief Medical Officer Tal Zaks said. \"We expect to be playing a major part in turning around this pandemic.\" Of the 196 people who contracted COVID-19 out of over 30,000 volunteers, 185 had received a placebo and 11 got the vaccine. Moderna reported 30 severe cases, all in the placebo group, which means the vaccine was 100 per cent effective against severe cases. Moderna shares opened 13 per cent higher at a record $144 following the results and then went on to hit a peak of $150.14, or a gain of 668 per cent so far this year. \"As the numbers of cases reported grows, confidence grows that this amazing protection will be maintained in a product that can be rolled out to protect the public,\" said Alexander Edwards, associate professor in biomedical technology at Britain's University of Reading. In addition to filing its US application, Moderna said it would seek conditional approval from the European Medicines Agency, which is already reviewing its data, and would continue to talk with other regulators doing similar rolling reviews. \"Although we await the full details of these results in published form, we can now assume that this vaccine will be approved for use in December,\" said Gillies O'Bryan-Tear, chair of policy and communications at Britain's Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine. He expected Britain's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency to approve the vaccine within two weeks. Moderna is just behind Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech - which applied for emergency approval on 20 November - in seeking to begin vaccinations in the US Source: AAP Pfizer has already applied for emergency use authorisation in the United States and Europe, putting it about a week ahead of Moderna. 'Just overwhelming' Moderna said it was on track to have about 20 million doses of its vaccine ready to ship in the United States by the end of 2020, enough to inoculate 10 million people. Switzerland's Lonza, which has a contract with Moderna to supply ingredients for the vaccine, rose 4.4 per cent. The vaccines developed by both Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech use a new technology called synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA) whereas others, such as Britain's AstraZeneca, are using more traditional methods. AstraZeneca has announced an average efficacy rate of 70 per cent for its shot and as much as 90 per cent for a subgroup of trial participants who got a half dose, followed by a full dose. But some scientists have expressed doubts about the robustness of the 90 per cent efficacy figure for the smaller group. Moderna's latest efficacy result is slightly lower than an interim analysis released on 16 November of 94.5 per cent effectiveness, a difference that Mr Zaks said was not statistically significant. \"At this level of effectiveness, when you just do the math of what it means for the pandemic that's raging around us, it's just overwhelming,\" said Mr Zaks, who said he cried when he saw the final results over the weekend. Both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines proved more effective than anticipated and were far superior to the 50 per cent benchmark set by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The past few weeks of positive vaccine results have ignited hopes for an end to a pandemic that has battered economies and come as new infections and COVID-19 hospitalisations are at record levels across the United States. Independent advisers to the FDA are scheduled to meet on 10 December to review Pfizer's data and make a recommendation to the US regulator. They will review Moderna's data a week later.

The distribution is expected to be easier than Pfizer's because while it needs to be stored in a freezer, it does not require the ultra-cold temperature needed by Pfizer's vaccine. Consistent across age and ethnicity Moderna said the 196 COVID-19 cases in its trial included 33 adults over 65 years old and 42 volunteers from racially diverse groups, including 29 Latinos, 6 Blacks, 4 Asian Americans and 3 multiracial participants. There was one death related to COVID-19 in the placebo group during the trial. \"This is as black and white as an effect on a population will be. Your chances of actually being sick if you've been vaccinated are decreased 20-fold,\" said Moderna's Mr Zaks. There was one death related to COVID-19 in the placebo group during the trial. Source: AFP Azra Ghani, chair in infectious disease epidemiology at Imperial College London, said Monday's details confirmed the vaccine was highly effective, including against severe cases. \"Whilst this does not exclude some risk of severe disease after vaccination given the relatively small number of severe cases, these results suggest very high efficacy,\" she said. Moderna reported no new side effects since its interim analysis, which showed the most common side effects were fatigue, injection site redness and pain, headache and body aches, which rose after the second dose and were short-lived. Mr Zaks said the vaccine caused significant flu-like symptoms in some participants which, \"goes hand-in-hand with having such a potent vaccine.\" But it has not caused any significant safety concerns so far, he said. Moderna said it was on track to have about 20 million doses of its vaccine ready to ship in the US by the end of 2020, enough to inoculate 10 million people. Source: ABACA Moderna plans to start a new trial to test the vaccine in adolescents before the end of the year, followed by another in even younger volunteers early in 2021. It hopes to have the vaccine available for adolescents by September, Mr Zaks said. Other vaccine makers have said they are studying their vaccines in young people as well. "}
