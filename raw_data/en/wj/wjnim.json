We know there are many questions around the COVID vaccine, including when it will become available to additional community members. To best provide accurate information, [we have a dedicated page on our website](https://www.nhcare.org/vaccine/) with a recorded vaccine briefing from our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. James Schultz, and FAQs. Neighborhood is proactively reaching out to patients 65+. Three successful drive thru COVID vaccination events for patients have been conducted at the Temecula, Menifee, and El Cajon locations. 525 patients received their first dose of the vaccine! If you are not a patient of Neighborhood Healthcare and are interested in receiving the vaccine, please note that as of January 23, 2021, the County of San Diego expanded the category of those eligible to include those aged 65 and up. Only healthcare workers and those 65 and older can visit vaccination sites. To make an appointment at a local vaccination site, we recommend visiting [sandiegocounty.gov](https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/sdc/hhsa/programs/phs/community_epidemiology/dc/2019-nCoV/vaccines/COVID-19-VaxEvents.html) or [myturn.ca.gov. ](https://myturn.ca.gov/) The six testing events hosted by Neighborhood Healthcare, between November 14, 2020 and January 23, 2021, have allowed for a total of 1,181 COVID tests to be completed!
