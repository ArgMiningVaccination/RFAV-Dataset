Severe nausea and vomiting, or morning sickness that lasts all day or further into pregnancy-called Hyperemesis Gravidarum\u2014is less common, but can cause health problems for both the mother and the developing fetus. [Acupuncture and TCM provide a natural and effective alternative](https://www.acupuncturetoday.com/mpacms/at/article.php?id=27775) for dealing with both mild and severe morning sickness. \"Morning sickness\" is somewhat of a misnomer, although [nausea during the first several weeks](https://americanpregnancy.org/healthy-pregnancy/pregnancy-health-wellness/morning-sickness-during-pregnancy-70943/) of pregnancy is often experienced early in the day, before eating. Having an empty stomach can exacerbate the queasy feeling of morning sickness. But why is it called morning sickness when it lasts all day? As many women know, morning sickness can strike at any time of day or night, and some women feel nauseous throughout the day. The majority (at least 70%, maybe more) of all pregnant women experience some nausea during early pregnancy. Morning sickness usually begins occurring when a woman is around 6 weeks pregnant, and goes away by about the 12th week of pregnancy, or the transition into the second trimester. However, some women will continue to feel morning sickness later in pregnancy. Medical science has not determined exactly what causes morning sickness, although it is generally thought to be related to changes in hormones, particularly an increase in hCG, known as the \"pregnancy hormone.\" A recent [research study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5862842/) found that a specific genetic sequence present in some women may account for increased nausea during pregnancy. Some [researchers at Cornell University have posited](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2000/05/morning-sickness-protects-mothers-and-their-unborn) that morning sickness may be an evolutionary development that prevents harm to babies in utero by keeping the mother's diet free of potentially toxic substances. They observed that in cultures where the staple diet relies more on starches and less on meat, pregnant women were [ less likely to experience morning sickness](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10858967/). For most women, the morning sickness that occurs in the early months of pregnancy is not dangerous to their health or that of the fetus. However, feeling nauseous a lot of time is certainly uncomfortable. Some lifestyle habits can help get the nausea and vomiting under control. Acupuncture treatment and herbs can help even more to provide relief from the daily nausea of morning sickness. For some women, morning sickness is more than just a nuisance. Not being able to keep any food down and vomiting repeatedly throughout the day for weeks or even months on end can cause serious health issues for mom and baby. Lack of proper nutrition, dehydration, and weight loss can lead to unwanted outcomes later on, including pre-term delivery and low birth weight of the infant. Hyperemesis gravidarum requires treatment. [Acupuncture help for morning sickness](https://www.uspharmacist.com/article/acupuncture-for-the-treatment-of-morning-sickness) is a natural alternative to drugs used to treat nausea. Top 5 Symptoms of Morning Sickness The symptom of [nausea during early pregnancy](https://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/morning-sickness/) is often what first lets a woman know she might be pregnant. Feeling queasy, dizzy, sensitive to smells, an aversion to certain foods, and occasionally vomiting are the most common signs of morning sickness. The sensations can be likened to those of motion sickness, or having a hangover. Many women report having a metallic taste in their mouth, and/or more saliva, which can contribute to feeling nauseated. Severe morning sickness is a more serious problem. Signs of hyperemesis gravidarum include: - Vomiting 3-4 times per day or more - Feeling [light-headed or dizzy](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dizziness-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)after vomiting - Dehydration: thirst, dry mouth, not having to urinate normally [Heart beating fast, heart palpitations](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-irregular-heartbeat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Losing weight during pregnancy (more than 10 pounds) Some women may be at higher risk for [hyperemesis gravidarum](https://www.marchofdimes.org/pregnancy/morning-sickness.aspx) if they are: having multiples (twins or triplets), if their mother also had severe morning sickness (genetics), or if they generally tend to have a more sensitive stomach, even when not pregnant. [Stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), [lack of sleep](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-sleep-better-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and hot weather can all trigger more nausea during pregnancy. Medical Treatment for Morning Sickness Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy is challenging to treat effectively, as care must be taken to avoid drugs that could harm the mother or the developing fetus. Often women are not treated for severe morning sickness until they have become so sick and dehydrated from vomiting that they need urgent care. At this point, a woman may need to be hospitalized and treated intravenously for dehydration. There has been a somewhat standard practice of people recommending and using [over-the-counter antihistamines](https://familydoctor.org/antiemetic-medicines-otc-relief-for-nausea-and-vomiting/) or antiemetics like Pepto-Bismol to help quell nausea. In a 6-year study of women with hyperemesis gravidarum, [researchers found](https://www.nurse.com/blog/2013/06/10/avoid-giving-antihistamines-for-morning-sickness-3/) that women who had used medications like Benadryl during pregnancy were more likely to experience adverse outcomes. A [combination](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/179633#causes) of vitamin B-6 and doxylamine is sometimes recommended. This drug combination is sold as an OTC sleep aid. [Phenothiazine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK343314/) is sometimes prescribed for women with morning sickness, but it's efficacy and safety for this use has not been studied extensively. These medicines are used because they seem relatively risk-free, but they still carry the risk of side effects, like drowsiness, headaches, dry mouth, etc. In many cases, they are not totally effective. Acupuncture and TCM herbal formulations offer relief from nausea and other pregnancy issues without any negative side effects. How Can Acupuncture Treat Nausea? According to TCM, Qi (life force energy) moves through the body along meridians, channels that connect the organ systems. The Chong meridian connects the reproductive organs to the brain and the heart. This particular energy channel is related to all concerns having to do with female reproductive health and gynecological conditions, including menstruation and pregnancy. Its relation to the heart means that it is also connected to feelings of [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), [panic attacks](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-panic-attacks-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and palpitations. Each woman's experience of morning sickness is different, so a TCM practitioner will look carefully at each individual patient to determine the specific imbalances causing the nausea and address them appropriately with acupuncture and herbs. In [TCM theory, morning sickness](http://www.tcm.ntu.edu.sg/articles/GYNECOLOGY/Pages/MORNING-SICKNESS.aspx) and hyperemesis gravidarum are related to the stomach, spleen, and liver. When a woman becomes pregnant, blood and Qi are strongly directed towards the pelvic area to nourish the womb (uterus) and the developing fetus. This surge of energy will also affect the digestive organs, potentially causing stomach problems. This is more likely to happen to women who have had weak digestion previously, perhaps due to a lack of proper functioning of the spleen. Likewise, the direction of more blood to the reproductive organs can cause a decrease in Yin energy in the Liver, thus increasing Yang energy. Liver fire can also trigger imbalance in the Stomach, leading to nausea and vomiting. A specific acupressure/acupuncture point on the wrist is especially helpful for reducing nausea. This acupoint is known as PC6, or Nei Guan, , which translates as \"Inner Pass.\" You may have seen special bracelets or wristbands recommended to help reduce nausea due to morning sickness (or motion sickness or postoperative nausea related to opioid medications). These products are designed to stimulate this acupressure point for nausea. While applying gentle pressure to this point can certainly be beneficial for women experiencing morning sickness, acupuncture treatment that includes this point and others is even more effective. A [systematic review ](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/729-fergie)of published studies related to the use of PC6 stimulation for nausea and vomiting found that this treatment produces clinically effective results, not only for pregnant women, but also for patients in [cancer treatment](https://myartofwellness.com/acupuncture-and-tcm-for-cancer-integrative-oncology/) and other people experiencing severe nausea. A [randomized trial](https://www.jpsmjournal.com/article/S0885-3924(00)00185-8/fulltext) conducted in Sweden to study the use of acupuncture treatment in conjunction with standard medical treatment for women with hyperemesis gravidarum found that acupuncture was not only very safe and free of side effects, but that women who received acupuncture were able to get over their severe nausea and vomiting more quickly than women getting only the standard treatment. [A study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11843784/) conducted at a maternity hospital in Australia compared women who received acupuncture for morning sickness to groups receiving placebo treatment or no treatment. The women who received acupuncture reported significantly less nausea and retching. Top 5 Tips to Help Morning Sickness Naturally, pregnancy is a time to embrace new lifestyle habits that are beneficial to both mother and baby. Eating a healthy diet during pregnancy can be especially difficult if you are feeling nauseous. Getting enough nutrition and rest during pregnancy is vital. - Eat plain, \"bland,\" warm foods. Avoid anything that is spicy, salty, fatty, fried, or cold. - Eat smaller meals/snacks at regular intervals throughout the day, so as to avoid the stomach being empty or too full, and to keep blood sugar levels steady. - Sip water slowly and regularly. Don't gulp down large amounts of liquid all at once. - Sip ginger tea, made by steeping a few slices of fresh ginger. - Actively prioritize stress reduction. Anxiety can exacerbate the nausea of morning sickness. Take frequent rest breaks. Ask your TCM provider to show you some gentle meditative exercises like Tai Qi or Chi Gong that can help relieve stress and nausea. Talking with a trusted healthcare professional who understands what you're going through can be helpful for calming anxieties about your pregnancy. Finding an [experienced acupuncturist](https://myartofwellness.com/dr-cai/) who can help you through any and all of the symptoms and worries that may come up during pregnancy, birth, and postpartum care can help to ease stress and discomfort. Acupuncture Near Me for Morning Sickness Acupuncture is an excellent modality not only for helping to relieve nausea due to morning sickness; TCM is a holistic form of medicine that can help women throughout pregnancy. Many discomforts and concerns may come up as a woman anticipates birth. Working with an integrative health provider who has a thorough understanding of gynecology and obstetrics from both Eastern and Western medical points of view can be beneficial to the physical and emotional health of both mother and baby.

Traditional Chinese Medicine is based on Qi, which is an invisible force that usually cannot be observed by modern science.

Therefore acupuncture and Chinese herbs are often not supported by double-blind, randomized trials, and they are considered alternative medicine therapies in the United States. [ How To Treat ED With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ed-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) By Qineng Tan, Ph.D. Let's face it: most men have probably had trouble getting hard on occasion, but if it's happening 50% of the time, or more often, then it may be a sign of men ED, or [erectile dysfunction](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/erectile-dysfunction/symptoms-causes/syc-20355776). ED refers to the inability to get or maintain an erection, making it difficult to have sexual intercourse. Acupuncture and TCM offer a natural solution for low sex drive and reproductive health problems, without over the counter ED pills. In the past few decades, this condition, which used to be referred to as \"impotence,\" has come to be perceived as a men's health issue or a [men's fitness issue](https://www.muscleandfitness.com/women/sex-tips/why-you-cant-get-hard/) that can be treated medically, rather than a personal problem. While it's great that men can get help from doctors for this condition without embarrassment or shame, ED medications may not solve the problem for everyone. [Stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), hormones, nutrition, exercise, emotions, and relationship dynamics all play a role in ED. ED can have a serious impact on a man's quality of life, as it affects self-esteem, romantic relationships, and [sperm count](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-oligospermia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and [fertility](https://myartofwellness.com/infertility-faqs/). It is [estimated](https://www.trendstatistics.com/health/erectile-dysfunction-statistics/) that about 30 million men in the U.S. experience erectile dysfunction (ED). By age 60, over 40% of men will probably experience ED. While ED drugs and over the counter ED pills help some men with ED symptoms, many men cannot use these medications because they interfere with others that are commonly used to treat heart disease. [Acupuncture](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/acupuncture-for-ed) and TCM provide an alternative treatment for ED that can help men with this issue. Top 10 Causes of ED ED is a complex problem, which can involve both physical and mental components. A physical problem that causes a man to experience ED a few times may lead to emotional stress around sex and low sex drive, making the problem worse. Because the brain and hormones contribute so vitally to arousal and erection, sometimes [ depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), or interpersonal feelings are the main cause of the issue. Some of the most common physical causes of ED include: - Heart problems, high blood pressure, clogged arteries, high cholesterol - Diabetes - Obesity - Use of certain prescription medications (antihypertensives, antidepressants) - Neurological conditions, such as Parkinson's disease or [Multiple Sclerosis](https://myartofwellness.com/what-is-ms-how-to-treat-multiple-sclerosis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [Alcoholism](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-addiction-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)or excessive consumption of alcohol [Smoking cigarettes/tobacco](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-quit-smoking-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Prostate problems like [BPH (enlarged prostate)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bph-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), or prostate [cancer](https://myartofwellness.com/acupuncture-and-tcm-for-cancer-integrative-oncology/) - Lack of sleep, [sleep disorders](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-sleep-better-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Low testosterone Sometimes erectile dysfunction is the reason men discover that they have a heart condition or [diabetes](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diabetes-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) that they didn't realize they had. When high cholesterol causes plaque to build up in the blood vessels, it's not only the heart that is affected. Atherosclerosis (narrowing of the arteries) can also affect a man's ability to get an erection by [restricting blood flow](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/circulationaha.110.017681) to the penis. Inability to maintain an erection can be a sign that a man has [hypertension](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-acupuncture-tcm/). What Is the Treatment for ED? The most common medical treatment for men with ED are PDE-5 medications (like Viagra, Cialis, or Levitra), which work to dilate the blood vessels that supply blood to the penis. These [ED drugs](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/erectile-dysfunction/in-depth/erectile-dysfunction/art-20047821) lower the blood pressure, which is why they cannot be used in conjunction with some other medications, including nitroglycerin or Imdur. If a man were to take both his ED pills and these medications, it could cause dangerously low blood pressure. Some men experience [side effects](https://www.healthline.com/health/erectile-dysfunction-medications-common-side-effects#dizziness) of taking these ED meds, including: headaches, blurred vision, dizziness, hot flushes, muscle pain, and diarrhea. In rare cases, men may have a painful erection that lasts longer than four hours (priapism), which can require medical treatment and/or cause permanent damage. If necessary, a doctor may numb the penis and use a needle to drain the blood that is trapped there, or use decongestant medications to help relieve the swelling. Other forms of therapy for ED include penile implants and penile injections. TCM acupuncture treatment for ED does not involve any needles inserted into the penis itself. How Can Acupuncture Help ED? According to TCM theory, ED is classified as a Jin Wei disorder and can follow one of a few patterns: - Liver qi stagnation - Blood stasis - Kidney deficiency TCM also acknowledges that stress, emotional and mental health disturbances are often a primary cause of ED, and seeks to incorporate counseling and awareness-building, both with the patient, and with the patient's partner, if applicable. Sessions with a TCM provider usually involve plenty of discussion and feedback; patients feel heard and understood, which can go a long way towards relieving anxiety surrounding the ED or other sexual disorders. TCM treatment for ED will include both acupuncture and herbs, which, combined, help to address the weakness or blockages that have developed around the liver and kidneys, strengthening the liver qi, relieving stagnation, and clearing dampness. [One study](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1847-acupuncture-heals-erectile-dysfunction-finding) showed that, after a course of treatment including 3-5 acupuncture treatment sessions and daily herbal supplementation, almost half of the men reported satisfaction with the results. [Another study](https://www.webmd.com/erectile-dysfunction/news/20000505/impotence-gets-needled-in-acupuncture-study#2) found that about two-thirds of the men who received TCM treatment reported feeling that they were \"cure,\" while the other third reported improved erections, but still felt that they needed more help. The group who received placebo treatment did not report improvement. Top 5 Tips for ED Men's Fitness The desire to overcome ED and get your sex life back on track can be a great motivation to clean up your diet and get rid of habits you know have been holding you back from peak men's health. Your acupuncturist can help you plan the best diet for men to help regulate hormones, reduce cholesterol, improve circulation, boost heart health and energy. - Eliminate alcohol, tobacco, and other recreational drugs. You may feel like these substances help you to relax and get in the mood, but on a deeper physiological level, they are compounding the problem. - Get more exercise. Ideally, balance cardio with some weight training. Losing fat and building muscle will help to balance the hormones and increase testosterone levels. - Take care of your mental health and emotional well-being. Foster open and honest communication about ED with your partner. Acquaint yourself with men's and women's health issues, so that you can care for each other with empathy. - Reduce stress. Prioritize a balanced, healthy lifestyle. Making time for yourself through regular exercise, meditation, and healing modalities like acupuncture can help improve your performance in all other areas of your life - Get adequate sleep. When the body doesn't get the deep rest it needs, it can lose all kinds of functionality. Acupuncture Near Me for ED ED is a sensitive men's health issue. Knowing that it's a common problem that affects lots of other men may help a little, but if ED is becoming a sexual problem that is negatively affecting your life and relationships, it's worth it to seek out help for erectile dysfunction. If conventional medical treatment for ED isn't working or isn't an option, or if you want to take a more holistic approach that will help also boost your fertility and longevity, consider acupuncture treatment for ED. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat Anxiety With TCM and Acupuncture ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) By Qineng Tan, L.Ac., Ph.D. and Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. Everyone experiences feelings of anxiety or apprehension at times. Sometimes people suffer from excessive feelings of dread or panic, even when they are not in immediate danger. In some cases, the complex cascade of emotional and physical sensations encompassed by [the term Anxiety](https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9948) is so pervasive that it becomes a chronic mental health condition. [TCM and Acupuncture offer a natural, highly effective treatment option to reduce anxiety symptoms](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1755-5949.2011.00254.x). We are currently living in a particularly harsh reality in which human life is filled with setbacks and potential danger. There is always a chance that something bad might happen to you or someone close to you. In recent weeks, [the coronavirus pandemic](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) has understandably created a pervasive sense of worry amongst the population, and the numbers of people filling prescriptions for anxiety-related medications, antidepressants and sleep aids has [increased dramatically](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/anti-anxiety-medication-prescriptions-have-spiked-34-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-04-16). Anxiety is clinically defined as a persistent feeling of worry, accompanied by physical sensations such as heart palpitations, dizziness, and sweating. Sometimes people describe it as being similar to the sensations you feel when you've tripped and you're falling, except that the scary feeling persists for a long time; it doesn't go away even when nothing is happening. Anxiety disorder is a very common mental health condition experienced by people of all ages; every year about [20% of Americans](https://adaa.org/about-adaa/press-room/facts-statistics) seek medical help for symptoms related to anxiety. If you are feeling heightened levels of distress that are affecting your ability to sleep, focus, or care for yourself or others, please be assured that help is available. Acupuncture and other [TCM treatment modalities offer a safe alternative](https://myartofwellness.com/what-is-acupuncture/what-we-treat/) to pharmacological drugs that can cause side effects and potentially lead to dependency and withdrawal symptoms. A [qualified acupuncturist](https://myartofwellness.com/our-doctors/) will conduct an in-depth consultation and create a program designed to specifically address each patient's individual combination of symptoms and life situation. What Are the Symptoms of Anxiety? Doctors classify types of anxiety disorders into several sub-categories, including Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Social Anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Phobia-related Disorders, and Separation Anxiety (anxiety in children). The most common symptoms of various types of Anxiety include: - Rapid or labored breathing - Rapid heartbeat or tachycardia - Feeling \"on edge\" or irritable - Sweating [Difficulty concentrating](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-adhd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [Memory loss](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-amnesia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Difficulty sleeping - Fatigue - Stomach upset - Anxiety headache Each person will present with a unique combination of symptoms and sensations, along with her own \"triggers\" or things that seem to cause the symptoms to manifest. Most people who seek medical care for their anxiety symptoms are either prescribed psychiatric tranquilizing medications such as Xanax or Atavan, referred for psychotherapy, or both. Some doctors use antidepressants such as Zoloft, Lexapro or Prozac to treat anxiety. These Selective Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) may help reduce symptoms in some cases, but all of these types of medications can cause side effects and lead to dependency. TCM and Acupuncture treatments not only address specific symptoms of anxiety, but address the root causes of the disorder. TCM Deals With All Types of Anxiety Disorders Anxiety, like [ depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and other mental health disorders, carries the disadvantage of being \"invisible.\" Other people, and even many medical professionals, simply can't see physical evidence of the problem, and can't empathize with the suffering involved. Well-meaning family members and friends might offer suggestions to \"calm down\" or reminders to stay positive, all with the implication that nothing is really wrong or that \"it's all in your head.\" Being plagued with constant self-doubt further amplifies the problem. Anxiety is a real health issue, and TCM offers effective modalities to address it. Modern medicine has only recently begun to make the [connection between emotional and physical](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18589562) maladies. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), on the other hand, has acknowledged for centuries that the mental, emotional and physical experiences of human beings are all inextricably linked. Sometimes a physical injury or traumatic experience can set the stage for a mental health problem. For example, a car accident that creates even minor injuries to the body might trigger future panic attacks, phobias, or P [ost Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ptsd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Other times, a mental health condition like chronic [Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)](https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/generalized-anxiety-disorder-gad) can affect sleep, eating, and other behaviors to such an extent that a person becomes more susceptible to illness and disease. It would not be surprising to see an increase in cases of Agoraphobia (fear of leaving one's home) and [Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD,](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-are-the-different-types-of-ocd-2510663) which sometimes causes compulsive hand-washing and cleaning as well as hoarding behaviors) as a result of the current coronavirus pandemic. People who experience multiple [panic attacks](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-panic-attacks-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) may be diagnosed with panic disorder. Anxiety disorders already tend to lead to feelings of isolation. Now that most people are spending far more time alone or sequestered with family members and roommates, already existing feelings of fear may be exacerbated. People who have never had to cope with anything beyond normal, mild anxiety may suddenly find themselves feeling real panic for the first time. Additionally, some might feel guilty or ashamed about reaching out for help for these problems when there are so many other people hurting for more apparent reasons. But there is real help for anxiety, and getting that help during this time of crisis makes sense. There is no need to suffer. [Find acupuncture near me](https://myartofwellness.com/) to address anxiety symptoms and the root causes before the problem becomes more severe and chronic. Acupuncture for Controlling Anxiety Conventional medicine generally attributes anxiety disorders to abnormal functioning of the brain and nervous system. The feelings associated with anxiety - the emotional sense of worry, the breathlessness and restlessness of the body, the behavioral instincts to freeze or to run - are all exaggerated responses to stress. [Stress is the body's natural reaction](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/stress/) to perceived dangers in the environment. When something threatens us, the sympathetic nervous system kicks into gear, and the adrenal glands pump out the hormones that flood the body with energy-what is often referred to as the \"fight or flight\" response. Normally, once the threat has passed, adrenaline will take some time to move through the body and then dissipate, and a feeling of relaxation is eventually restored. When a person has an anxiety disorder, this hormone release can be triggered by thoughts, and the fear of the physical response itself becomes a part of the vicious cycle. [Acupuncture treatment has been shown](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/integrative-mental-health-care/201810/acupuncture-anxiety) to act upon the nervous system, facilitating the release of serotonin, endorphins and noradrenaline, all of which contribute to relaxation and a sense of well-being. Stimulation of specific points have been clinically proven to reduce perceived feelings of anxiety as well as reducing the heart rate and blood pressure of patients. Auricular acupuncture, which specifically uses points on the ear, has been shown to be effective for anxiety. This method is particularly useful, as patients can be fitted with a tiny needle that can be stimulated with gentle pressure as needed to help alleviate symptoms as they appear. [Auricular acupuncture](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2206232/) has been used for thousands of years, not only in China, but all over the world. [Modern critical analysis has demonstrated that auricular acupuncture](https://journals.lww.com/anesthesia-analgesia/Fulltext/2001/02000/Auricular_Acupuncture__A_Potential_Treatment_for.49.aspx) affects the parasympathetic nervous system in ways that help alleviate pain and reduce anxiety symptoms. Electro-stim acupuncture, or [electro-acupuncture,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29705474) is another effective modality used by TCM doctors. How Does Acupuncture Benefit Anxiety Relief of Panic Attacks? One of the great advantages of acupuncture treatment over conventional methods of talk therapy and pharmacological intervention is that it has an immediately discernible effect. Patients often leave an acupuncture session with a deep sense of calm and relaxation. Reports of improved sleep usually follow quickly. In addition, the long-term effects of regular acupuncture sessions are cumulative, and people [report a sustained decrease](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Blog/723-panicattacksshenmen) in episodes of anxiety and panic attacks. One controlled study compared groups of patients treated with a regimen of acupuncture with moxibustion to a group prescribed a type of benzodiazepine medication. The [results showed higher efficacy](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1952-acupuncture-outperforms-drug-for-anxiety) in reducing anxiety symptoms among the patients receiving acupuncture. TCM Doctors' Top 10 Suggestions on Self Care for Anxiety Here are some natural remedies for anxiety you can utilize at home. With consistent practice, these habits will help alleviate stress and reduce anxiety symptoms. - Meditation for anxiety- Those struggling with anxiety may well be tired of hearing well-meaning friends suggesting they \"Relax!\" or \"just breathe.\" But studies have shown that regular meditation practice can significantly reduce anxiety. There are many methods; it is important to find a method that works for you. [This study](https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/9/6/751/1664700)suggested mindfulness meditation may be especially effective. - Waterfall Meditation - In this exercise, imagine yourself at the base of a waterfall. As you breathe in and out, picture the water gently raining down on you, trickling down each route until the tension inside you releases, relaxing parts of your body one section at a time. Allow your entire body to enter a peaceful and relaxed state. Let the image of the water wash away any stress or anxiety that burdens you. - Physical Exercise - By now it has been well documented that regular exercise is good for health in every way, lowering the risks of all types of chronic disease. Movement helps [reduce anxiety symptoms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3632802/)by reducing adrenal reactivity, increasing the output of endorphins and endogenous (naturally produced in the body) opioids, and even stimulating the growth of new brain cells. It is also suggested that exercise functions as a type of exposure therapy. When people become more used to the sensations of an increased heart rate, heavier breathing, and sweating due to cardiovascular activity, it increases their tolerance for these same symptoms when they appear as part of an episode of anxiety. If you are able to go for a walk or run while following social distancing guidelines, it is especially helpful to get some sun exposure, as well. Put on some music or a favorite workout video; rhythmic movement that engages the large muscle groups provides great benefits. - Tai Chi and Chi Gong -These ancient traditional forms are \"moving meditations\" that work upon the endocrine circulatory, and nervous systems to balance energies and strengthen Qi. - Good Eating Habits - Caffeine, sugar, processed and spicy foods can trigger anxiety. Complex carbohydrates like brown rice, barley, quinoa and oats are relaxing, as are nuts and chickpeas, which contain tryptophan. Now is a good time to become more intimately involved with preparing dishes at home, and this process can also be soothing: a mindfulness exercise that results in a healthy meal!

Social media has already been called into question for its apparent increase of anxiety among teenagers, but it has a real impact on people of all ages. Comparing your situation and surroundings to the carefully curated content you see on sharing platforms can make you feel pressure, shame, a sense of inadequacy. Commit to being grounded in your immediate surroundings and grateful for the blessings that are in your life right now. Recognize that, while it is important to [educate yourself about the novel coronavirus](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-and-prevent-covid-19-coronavius-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), many of the opinions being expressed online are not informed and are designed to provoke an emotional reaction. Avoid reading comments that you know might be triggering. - Sleep Better to Combat Sleep Anxiety - Repetitive, OCD intrusive thoughts and restless energy within the body can make sleeping difficult when you are experiencing sleep anxiety. Cortisol-another stress hormone-levels tend to rise in the evening, and many people register this sensation as anxiety at night. Eating simple carbohydrates like sweets or chips suppresses cortisol and offers a temporary feeling of relaxation. But consuming these foods or alcohol to artificially reduce stress leads to less restful sleep later.

Creating a structure for your life helps you feel that you are controlling what you can. - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Exercise - Use this exercise when feeling anxious or suffering a panic attack.

Look for the things, and then name them out loud. - 5 - Count five things in your immediate environment that you can SEE. - 4 - Count four things near you that you can TOUCH. - 3 - Count three things near you that you can HEAR. - 2 - Count two things you can SMELL. - 1 - Count one thing you can TASTE. How to Use 3 Acupressure Points for Anxiety Relief Acupressure is a technique patients can use anytime for symptom relief. Apply gentle, firm pressure to these points. - Liver 3 is a grounding point that helps redirect rising energy downward. Located between the first and second toes, you will find a very tender spot. Try applying gentle pressure here to alleviate irritability, headaches, TMJ, and anxiety. - You have probably seen the bands people sometimes wear around their wrists to prevent nausea. These are designed to put pressure on Pericardium 6, which quells queasiness. The point is located between the two tendons on your wrist, two fingers up from the wrist crease.

[ What is Multiple Sclerosis and How to Manage MS with TCM & Acupuncture ](https://myartofwellness.com/what-is-multiple-sclerosis-and-how-to-manage/) Multiples Sclerosis is autoimmune disease, Traditional Chinese Medicine & Acupuncture are very helpful to improve these condition. Dr.Tan's Case and Testimony Mr. M- a healthy 50-year old Caucasian gentleman\u2014first visited my office Art of Wellness Acupuncture a few years ago. As an attorney, he had been working very hard to support his two daughters, who were both in college. About four months ago, the onset of serve lower back pain along with tingling in his left leg changed his life completely. He saw several doctors, had a number of x-rays and an MRI which revealed a moderate bulging disk on L4-L5. He tried different pain pills, NSAIDs, and underwent three months of physical therapy, none of which had helped. Recently, he had been experiencing numbness and weakness in his left leg, and was suffering from depression due to his inability to carry on with daily work and regular activities. When he talked to me, I noticed that he constantly rubbed his eyes. I asked if he felt any abnormalities in his vision. He answered yes, and that he had periodic occurrences of blurred vision. When I suggested that he showed me how he walks, I noticed his poor balance. He tended to fall on his left side because his left leg did not seem to follow his motion. Then I checked his knee and ankle reflex and found that they were excessively active. I was almost certain that the condition that made him suffer so much in the last few months was not a simple bulging disk or sciatica; it was a disorder of the central nervous system-Multiple Sclerosis. Immediately, referred him to a neurologist and suggested that he have a brain and cervical MRI. Two weeks later, he came back to my office with a confirmed diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis. Mr. M. is just one of 200 patients who are diagnosed with MS every week in the United States. There are about 400,000 people in the U.S. and 2.5 million patients who are suffering from this disease in the world. Cause of MS [MS is an autoimmune disease](https://www.nationalmssociety.org/What-is-MS) in which infections or environmental changes can confuse the body's defense system. Sometimes a foreign antigen mimics a group of the body's own proteins. When the immune system response by mounting an attack against these foreign invaders, it inadvertently destroys the foreign antigen along with any similar antigens, including the body's own tissues. A recent study shows that a virus called adenovirus type 2 looks remarkably similar to the composition of the protective covering around the spinal cord and parts of the brain\u2014the myelin sheath cells. The attacks of the immune system of this virus along with the mistaken attack on the myelin sheath is believed to be the ultimate cause of multiple sclerosis [Common symptoms](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-sclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350269) of MS - numbness or tingling, usually in the leg or arm - muscle weakness - dizziness - spasticity - pain (moderate to severe) - Ataxia - Tremor - Slurred speech - Blurry, double vision or blindness - bladder malfunction - bowel dysfunction - sexual dysfunction - depression - euphoria - cognitive abnormalities - fatigue Most commonly, MS first manifests itself in a series of attacks followed by complete or partial remission as symptoms mysteriously lessen. These symptoms, however, will return later after a period of stability. This is called relapsing-remitting (RR) MS. Treatment of MS Unfortunately, there is no cure for MS yet. In Western Medicine, the treatment focuses mainly on decreasing the rate and severity of relapse. Beta interferons, anti-cancer drugs (to weaken the immune system), and steroids are commonly used for the treatment of MS. These medicines can reduce the number of MS lesions, delay the progression of the disease, and provide symptomatic relief for the patient. In TCM, a condition called \"Wei Syndrome\" with symptoms similar to MS, was documented 2000 years ago in a classic Traditional Chinese Medicine book called Emperor Classic Medicine. Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine has been involved in the treatment ever since. MS patients who have tried [acupuncture](https://myartofwellness.com/what-is-acupuncture/) report improvement in pain, spasticity, numbness and tingling, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and bowl, bladder function. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is very important for the MS patient. This includes: - Getting enough time to sleep and rest. Go to bed early - Exercise regularly. Tai Chi and Yoga are very good to help patient relax, balance and with muscle strength - Balanced diet, a lot of vegetables and enough protein from white meat - Stress management - Daily meditation and positive thinking - Staying connected with friends and joining a support group [How to reduce and prevent inflammation](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-reduce-and-prevent-inflammation/) Patient Story- Gilly I was diagnosed with Relapsing Remitting MS in 1991 and I had no idea what a crazy, unpredictable journey I was about to embark on. I woke up one morning, tried to get out of bed but my legs were like jello, I had no balance and had double vision. I was given a spinal tap and MRI and lesions were detected on my brain & cervical spine. When first diagnosed, my neurologist put me on one of the few FDA approved medicines for MS which don't cure the disease, but delay the progression. For that I inject myself daily and have done so for 17 years For the first 7 years after being diagnosed, I experienced relapses (flare up of symptoms) on average twice a year. The treatment for relapses was a 5 day course of steroids administered through IV, followed by 12 days of oral steroids. The relapses affected my motor skills the most, especially walking but after a treatment of steroids, I was almost as good as new. My friends suggested I try acupuncture. I was recommended to Dr Tan because he had studied MS in China. * Dr Tan has been monumental in my life. He has given me treatments for a multitude of injuries I've suffered over the years due to frequent falls and is an expert in pain relief. He treats me for stress relief which contributes my general wellbeing. Dr Tan is very knowledgeable about Western medicine and MS treatments so I always ask his opinion. I've been diagnosed with MS for 21 years and feel fortunate that Dr Tan has been treating me for a large part of that time. Although I partake in Western medicine, I know that Western medicine only treats the symptoms but Eastern medicine treats the cause of the symptoms. My MS has progressed to the stage that I now use a wheelchair full time. I go to acupuncture for preventative care. My immune system needs extra help especially during cold & flu season. I am very aware that MS is a 'designer' disease, and no two people have the exact same symptoms. I would encourage anyone with MS to avoid stress, keep up a healthy immune system and try to stay positive and happy, because your emotional state affects your physical being. [ How to Sleep Better with Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-sleep-better-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) By Qineng Tan, L.Ac., Ph.D. Do you suffer from [insomnia](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/insomnia/) or do you have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep? [Acupuncture](https://myartofwellness.com/what-is-acupuncture/) and [Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)](https://myartofwellness.com/what-is-traditional-chinese-medicine/) offers many solutions on how to sleep better without sleeping aids. TCM stresses the importance of getting a good night sleep. Chinese medicine has tools such as; exercise, Chinese herbal medicine, acupuncture, and meditation all which can help you get a good sleep so you can function at the highest potential throughout the day. Below you will read about TCM and the history it provides in regards to sleep and the many tips that can help you get the best sleep tonight. History of Sleep with TCM Sleep is a part of the interplay of yin and yang: yang energy is dominant when we are awake and active, and yin energy rules sleep. Night is yin; daylight is yang. This is all in keeping with the holistic, universal nature of TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) theory. Our bodies are designed to work with the movements of the earth, sun, and moon. When a person experiences insomnia, either hard to fall asleep or wake up often then difficult to fall back to sleep, there is a lack of balance. The body is out of sync with its environment. The yang energy is taking over, or not interplaying with yin appropriately. In TCM terminology, \"Shen\" is the spirit, the energy which controls our mental activities and thought. During sleep, Shen \"hides\" in the organs - predominantly the Heart and the Liver - resting, so that it can function with sharpness during our waking hours. Insomnia, in TCM, is often viewed, then, as a problem of the Heart system, or the Liver system. If one of these major organs is unable to \"house\" the Shen, then the Shen will wander restlessly, causing sleeplessness. Protective Qi cycles through the body continuously, but it follows different paths along the meridians at different times of the day and night. During the day, protective Qi, which fights off pathogens, moves through the yang meridians, and during the night, it flows through the yin meridians. If you find yourself waking up at a particular hour in the middle of the night every night - or feeling sluggish at one particular time every day - it is probably related to some deficiency of Qi in that area. Between the hours between 1:00 and 3:00 a.m. the liver meridian is actively supplying Qi to the liver system so that it can clean toxins from the blood. Then, between 3:00 and 5:00 a.m., the freshly cleaned blood and energy is being delivered to the organ systems. It is especially important to be sleeping soundly during that time. The liver does all the heavy lifting of cleaning and detoxifying the blood and therefore, the whole body. If the liver is stinted of its full rest and rejuvenation, night after night, we can be left feeling truly sick and tired. Sleeplessness may be the central problem for some people; for others, it's just a part of the big picture. Many people have gone so long without restful sleep that they have become used to it and just consider it their new \"normal.\" When you come in to [Art of Wellness](https://www.myartofwellness.com) for a visit, our doctors will ask many questions to get a sense of what kind of sleep problems you're having, including other symptoms that may be related to the same root issue. - Having trouble falling asleep may be related to an excess condition of the liver and/or gall bladder. - Waking easily and then having trouble falling back to sleep may point to a deficiency of the Heart Yin or too much internal heat. - Nightmares may indicate a gall bladder meridian problem, while repetitive, literal dreams (about work, for example) might indicate a heart/spleen problem. Sleep problems can be related to other conditions, such as depression, menopause in women, fibromyalgia, [chronic fatigue syndrome](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-fatigue-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and cardiovascular disease. How to Make Winter A Time of Rest and Renewal Getting a good night sleep is always important, but in the Wintertime. Nature and our bodies are really asking us to rest more, and more deeply, than we do during other times of the year. This is a time for the body to store energy. If we go at a frantic pace, and behave the same way we do in the middle of summer, we will become depleted. Unfortunately, our current culture does not necessarily support this idea. It seems we are asked to do more and be more than ever during the rush of the winter holiday season. It really is vital to prioritize \"doing less\" in order to preserve good health. People with sleep problems seek [tips](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/healthy-sleep-tips) for help. The practices in acupuncture and TCM help you to be calm. Visit the link and read some TCM tips for sleep. Top 20 Tips For Creating Calm so That You Can Get A Good Sleep - Choose carefully how many social commitments you make. You don't have to attend every gathering - only the ones that are meaningful to you. If it feels more like an obligation than fun, make a plan to stop in, extend your greetings, and then leave early. This way, you won't overeat, drink too much, and you can still get to bed a reasonable hour - Don't [exercise](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/17-tips-to-sleep-better)too vigorously close to bedtime. An evening walk, or gentle program of Tai Qi or yoga will help you work out excess energy with stimulating you further - Deep breaking techniques: using you lower abdomen, inhale deeply. Hold it for about 5 seconds, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. Repeat ten times. Deep breathing exercises not only relax your mind, but they help to dispel negative Qi from the body before bed - Create an oasis of calm in your bedroom, with good ventilation, restful colors and no devices. Set a time, half an hour to hour before going to bed, when you will discontinue watching TV or looking at your computer and phone. The light stimulus from the screen is not helpful for falling asleep. Reading a book, writing in a journal, coloring in a coloring book, are all activities that help you wind down for the night. - Change your [eating habits](http://choosemyplate.gov): many people wake up around 3 AM and find it difficult to fall back asleep. This may be cause by low blood sugar level due to the over activity for the adrenal gland. For a better sleep, try to balance your blood sugar level daily by eating small portions of food about every 3 hours and drinking a glass of warm, low fat milk or eating a handful of nuts\u2014such as raw walnuts or almonds, before bedtime. It helps to balance your blood sugar. Waking up in the middle of the night can be caused by fluctuating insulin levels - the result of too much sugar or alcohol in the evening. - Keep your feet warm by soaking them in hot water for 15-20 minutes before bedtime. Also, massaging the bottom of the feet can help to stimulate key kidney points. Give a good, fast rub to the center of your soles for a few minutes to warm them while getting into bed. - Stimulating acupressure points just before bedtime can be helpful. Use your thumb or fingertip to apply moderate pressure and rotate clockwise for 2-3 minutes. - Shen Men, called the \"Spiritual gate\" point, releases heart fire, excitement, anger, irritation and anxiety. - Tai Chong, a liver point can help alleviate insomnia due to excessive heat or stagnation in the liver, which can cause feelings of depression, stress, sadness. - Take off any constricting clothing (underwear), and wear loose, comfortable pajamas for bedtime. - There is an old saying: \"sleep like the crescent moon.\" Sleeping in a fetal position on your right side puts your heart above your liver, which helps drain blood, giving the heart some relief and extra nourishment to the liver. It also helps food move through your digestive system properly. - Keep away from interruptions: Turn off your phone after dinner or keep a note book by your bed. If you keep thinking about sometime important to do, write it down. - Listen to calm and relaxing music - Sleep and wake at the same time every day, yes that includes weekends. Do not stay in bed for too long even when you do not have to go to work. Your body needs to have a regular sleep-wake cycle in order to function at its maximum - Reduce the water temperature for baths and showers: when the water temperature is well about body temperature, your body heat increases. Then when you get out of the water, your body heat decreases. Try to avoid such fluctuation of the body temperature. - Keep your bedroom simple and clean: limit the number of electronic devices such as TV's, computers from your bed room - Do not play video games at night - Obey the 20-minute rule: if you do not successfully fall asleep in twenty minutes, get up and do something else until you feel tired and ready to sleep again. - Waterfall Meditation. In this exercise, imagine yourself at the base of a waterfall. As you breathe in and out, picture the water gently raining down on you, trickling down each route until the tension inside you releases, allowing your entire body to enter a peaceful and relaxed state. - Oneness Meditation. Just as in the Waterfall exercise, picture yourself standing beneath a waterfall. This time, however, instead of relaxing parts of your body one section at a time, allow your entire body to relax simultaneously. Let the image of the water wash away any stress or anxiety that burdens you. If you have tried all of these things are still not sleeping well, please come see us to find the underlying problem.
