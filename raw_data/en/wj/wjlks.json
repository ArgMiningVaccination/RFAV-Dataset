How Long Does THC Stay in Human Milk? Is CBD Safe While Nursing? Are Edibles Safer During Pregnancy? Getty Images. Marijuana use is as old as the plant itself. Now that states across the country are legalizing it for medicinal or recreational use (or both), researchers are taking a fresh look at how marijuana affects people in specific ways. Many new parents may wonder if it's safe to smoke weed, use cannabidiol (CBD) products, or take edibles while breastfeeding or chestfeeding. The reality is the data on how any marijuana products impact a nursing infant is limited and not conclusive. The effects of long-term use is especially not clear. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises against any use of marijuana while pregnant or nursing. It explains that chemicals from any form of marijuana can be passed on from the nursing parent to the infant through milk\u2014and these chemicals may impact various neurodevelopmental processes in the infant. So, should nursing parents stop using marijuana products? Here's everything you need to know about marijuana, CBD, and edibles when nursing. Why Moms Are Pioneering the Marijuana Industry What Are the Effects of THC on Nursing Babies? As marijuana use becomes legal around the U.S. and more nursing parents are using it, there is concern about how tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component of cannabis, may impact infant growth and brain development. The research is limited. And while the CDC advises against THC use when nursing, studies have been examining the effects and showing different data. One study found marijuana exposure in nursing infants led to a decrease in infant motor development compared to non-exposed infants. Other research doesn't show such an impact, including a 2021 study which found human milk containing THC may not cause short-term harm to preterm babies when it comes to breathing difficulty, lung development, or feeding issues. The study is great news for infants who are exposed to THC-positive milk, but this particular study only shows a glimpse of how THC affects developing babies. It's unclear what any long-term effects may be. \"I have always allowed parents who use THC to breastfeed and provide pumped breast milk for their premature babies, as long as they do not use other illicit drugs, but encourage them to cut back since we do not know the effect of THC exposure on the long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of preterm infants,\" says Jessica Madden, MD, IBCLC, a board-certified neonatologist, pediatrician, and lactation consultant, working at the NICU at Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland. \"I will continue to caution them that we do not know the effect of THC on their babies' long-term brain development and milestones.\" Joel Gator Warsh, MD, a board-certified pediatrician in Beverly Hills, California, says that while the data in this newer study is encouraging, more research needs to be done. \"I recommend patients minimize exposure to all chemicals, including THC, when breastfeeding, but I do feel that the benefit of breastfeeding outweighs the risks from THC,\" he says. \"If one has to decide to breastfeed or not, this study lends additional data that parents should continue to breastfeed as much as possible, even if using THC.\" But with research so conflicting, parents may want to limit or abstain from THC while nursing to help keep human milk safe and healthy, advises Sonal Patel, MD, CLE, a pediatrician, neonatologist, and breastfeeding specialist. In addition, it is wise to avoid alcohol, smoking, vaping, and illicit drug use. Any medications should also be cleared with a pediatrician or lactation consultant for safety. And always take more precaution with preterm babies when it comes to feeding. \"Do not informally milk share if you have a preterm infant,\" says Dr. Patel. \"Preterm infants are susceptible to infections with bacteria and viruses, and, from a safety standpoint, if they receive donor breast milk, it needs to come from a dedicated milk bank or supplier where it is either pasteurized or sterilized prior to consumption.\" Jessica Madden, MD I will continue to caution them that we do not know the effect of THC on their babies' long-term brain development and milestones. \u2014 Jessica Madden, MD How Long Does THC Stay in Human Milk? It's clear that THC is excreted in small amounts into human milk. So, what if you've used a product and want to wait till it's out of your system before you nurse? Research has found THC can be detected in human milk anywhere from six days to more than six weeks. Is CBD Safe While Nursing? The aforementioned study on preterm infants did not look at CBD use, which has become widely popular to treat anxiety and other mental health issues. Although CBD is also found in marijuana, it is not the same as THC and does not cause a high. As marijuana becomes legal across the U.S., CBD products are also being legalized, can be easily purchased over the counter, and are often touted as being as safe as vitamins. Keep in mind, the only CBD product that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved is a prescription brand Epidiolex, which treats epilepsy. But like THC products, there is limited data on CBD's impact on nursing babies. This is a reason why the medical community and the CDC advises against it. CBD and Breastfeeding: Is It Safe? Are Edibles Safer During Pregnancy? What's the deal with edibles and breastfeeding or chestfeeding? Experts say it's best to avoid these too. The CDC says edibles, which are food products that contain marijuana, can also be passed from the nursing parent to an infant through their milk. The Bottom Line Questions still swirl around the safety of THC and nursing, especially when it comes to long-term outcomes. However, the CDC does not support the use of THC, CBD, or any similar products in pregnant people or nursing parents. Until more research and studies are available that can demonstrate the short- and long-term effects of cannabis products on a developing infant, the standard recommendation is to avoid them.
