You may feel conflicted because you don't want harsh chemicals in your home but you want clear drains, so use non-toxic products. We have solutions and tips to help keep your home drains toxic free and clean! Going [Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_cleaning) is the thing these days! Green enthusiasts are taking thoughtful strides toward an eco-friendly environment. So how does this work with household issues like clogged drains? Home remedies of course! Here are several ways of clearing a drain clog without toxic chemicals: 1. Dish Soap and Hot Water Boil about two liters of water and mix in a few tablespoons of liquid dish soap. Take this mixture and slowly pour down the sink. This method may take a few tries, but it will work great on grease clogs because it is heating the grease back to a liquid so it can travel all the way out of the pipe. 2. Wire Coat Hanger Straighten the hanger out but leave the hook. Make sure you have a grocery bag or something to discard your findings. Use the hook end of the hanger to fish in the drain and pull up any food or hair buildup that is clogging the passageway in the pipe. After removing as much as you possibly can, run hot water down the sink. 3. Baking Soda & Vinegar Clear the area around your sink and put a 1/2 cup of baking soda down the drain. Follow that with a 1/2 cup of vinegar. Now plug your drain and let it sit for an hour. Then, unplug the drain and pour a pot of boiling water down it. Continue pouring boiling water down the drain until it is clear. 4. Salt, Borax, and Vinegar Start with 1/4 cup of salt, 1/4 cup of Borax, and then a 1/2 cup of vinegar. Add a pot of boiling water and let it sit for at least an hour or until it clears. Finally, rinse with hot tap water to clear all ingredients down the drain. 5. Baking Soda & Salt Mix salt and baking soda together. About a 1/2 cup of each and pour down the drain. Let it sit for a minimum of a half hour or as long as overnight. Once it has a significant time, clear it with a pot of boiling water. The tougher the clog, the longer it needs to sit. 6. Plunger This tactic is mainly for the kitchen sink. Food gets stuck at the curve of the drain under the sink where it's hard to reach with a hook, so try a plunger to clear it. First, empty your sink of any dishes or rags. Fill the sink halfway with warm tap water and plunge away. We recommend a rubber plunger. What are the benefits of using green solutions? Green solutions are safer to breathe than toxic chemicals. They won't eat away at your pipes, which will save you money and headaches down the road. Overall it is just a great way to help out the environment! What is so wrong with using synthetic cleaners? Synthetic cleaners have sodium hydroxide or sulfuric acid in them. This means they will eat away at the pipes. It doesn't matter if the pipes are made of metal or plastic these chemicals will eat at them over time. They are tempting to use because these types of cleaners tend to work faster and are cheaper than a plumber upfront, but they will cause more problems in the long run. How can I avoid having clogged drains? Here are some additional tips: - Never put grease, oil, banana peels, potato peels, eggshells, bones, pits or seeds down the drain. - Put ice cubes in your garbage disposal to sharpen the blades. - Run cold water when the disposal is on. - For a fresh sent put tiny citrus or lemon peels in the disposal. - Put a hair trap in your bathroom sinks, tubs, and showers.
