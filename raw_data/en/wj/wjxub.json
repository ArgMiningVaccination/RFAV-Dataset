We incorporate care options to ensure patients can get back to an optimum level of health through alternative treatments, in addition to traditional Western medicine practices. Conventional (Western) medical treatments and complementary treatments can help achieve that balance and support a patient's personal healing needs. Queen's North Hawai'i Community Hospital offers patients a range of holistic care services at no charge. Patients are offered three types of essential oils: lavender (for relaxation), grapefruit (for alertness), or peppermint (for nausea). A few drops are applied to a cotton ball, which is then taped to the patient's gown at shoulder level. Oshibori, or \"hot towels\" in Japanese, is a complimentary service offered daily to patients along with essential oils. Patients may request a few drops of essential oil be placed on the hot towel, which is then placed on the neck or held in one's hands. The warmth and pleasant scent bring comfort and relaxation. The CARE Channel is available on televisions in every patient room . It offers soothing music and imagery that aids in relaxation, enhances sleep throughout the night, and encourages wakefulness during the day. Healing Touch and Reiki is a \"laying of hands\" to help patients become more relaxed. These energy sessions energize, balance and promote well-being on physical, emotional, mental and spiritual levels. Patients can heal faster because of reduced pain, stress and anxiety. Healing Touch and Reiki promote relaxation and sleep, and facilitate the body's natural ability to heal. Friends and family are welcome to stay and participate in the sessions if desired. Animal-assisted therapy is a volunteer service that provides a therapeutic visit to our patients, visitors and staff. Comfort therapy dogs are escorted through the hospital by their handlers, bringing joy to the people they visit. Colorful lap blankets are sewn by community members, blessed by local churches, and gifted to patients. The blankets are filled with heart-centered prayers and positive intentions, and are given to patients to keep. "}
