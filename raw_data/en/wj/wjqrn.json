Introduction According to the data available on April 8, 2020, the corona- virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected at least 209countries, with more than 1,350,000 reported cases and 79,000 deaths. 1The World Health Organization (WHO) ofcially declared the coronavirus a \"pandemic\" on March 11, 2020. An epidemic is the unexpectedly high incidence of a disease in a community or region during a given time period;it becomes a pandemic when it affects an even wider geographical area. Health care systems in developed coun- tries \u2014not to mention the developing countries \u2014have been challenged by the overwhelming number of patients. Up to April 8, 2020, there were more than 81,000 cases and 3,300 deaths in China from the COVID-19 pandemic.2 Hong Kong is geographically located in Guangdong (formerly Canton), the second-most affected province in China after Hubei. It has become one of the most affected cities in ChinaKeywords homeopathy COVID-19 Hong Kong China clinical featuresAbstract Background Hong Kong is geographically located in the province of Guangdong which, after Hubei, has been the region of China second-most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.Compared to the pathognomonic symptoms of the named disease, homeopathic symp- toms are always more helpful for homeopathic prescriptions. Aim This study reports and summarizes the homeopathic symptoms observed in 18 conrmed/suspected epidemiologically related cases in cluster outbreaks of COVID-19 in Hong Kong in early 2020.Methods Homeopathic symptoms from this case series were collected from 18 consecutive patients who, in addition to th eir concurrent conventional treatment or traditional Chinese medicine, actively sought help from homeopathy as an adjunctivemeasure for symptomatic relief from COVID-19. Cases were categorized according to outbreak clusters, focusing mainly on the homeopathic symptoms. In the analysis, frequency of all homeopathic medicines, common rubrics in all the cases, commonrubrics in each of the top-ranked remedies, and differentiating symptoms for each top-ranked remedy were determined.Results Homeopathic symptoms of 18 cases, each identi e da sm i l da n db e l o n g i n gt o one of six separate clusters, are reported . Eighteen common symptoms screened out of 79 selected rubrics constituted two sets of homeopathic symptom pictures: Bryonia alba (n\u00bc4) and Gelsemium sempervirens (n\u00bc12). Eight and seven differentiating features, respectively, were identi ed for Bryonia alba and Gelsemium sempervirens . Conclusion The common symptoms of 18 mild COVID-19 cases constituted two sets of homeopathic symptom pictures, indicating Bryonia alba orGelsemium sempervirens ; they were indicated in 4 and 12 cases, respectively, out of the 18 in total. received March 31, 2020accepted after revision April 19, 2020 published online June 5, 2020DOI https://doi.org/ 10.1055/s-0040-1710545.ISSN 1475-4916.Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Faculty of Homeopathy Case SeriesTHIEME 146 Published online: 2020-06-05since the second wave of the epidemic there. With the in flux of imported cases from other countries, more than 950conrmed cases were reported in Hong Kong by April 8, about 10-fold the number of cases resulting from the rst wave in late February 2020. The WHO traditional medicine (TM) Strategy 2014 to 2023 3was developed and aimed to \"support Member States in developing proactive policies and implementing actionplans that will strengthen the role TM plays in keeping populations healthy \". Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) played an important role in the COVID 2019 treatmentprotocol in China. On February 17, 2020, the National Health Commission (NHC) of the People 'sR e p u b l i co fC h i n a reported that 85% of con rmed COVID-19 patients had been treated with TCM. 4A recent systematic review showed that, based on the evidence from SARS and H1N1 in fluenza prevention, TCM could be an alternative approach for theprevention of COVID-19 in high-risk populations. 5 In January 2019, at the World Integrated Medicine Forum in Goa, India, Dr. Geetha Krishnan G. Pillai, representativefrom the cine Unit of WHO, stated: \"Even today, for millions of people across the globe, Traditional Medicine is their rst line of medical care, and in many communities the only one. Considering this fact, it is highly essential to build an integrated health care model which uses the strengths ofTM alongside the advances in modern medical technologies. It is necessary to re-think the strategies and policies of nations who try to achieve the Universal Health Coverage(UHC) goal by only relying on investments made on hugely infrastructure-driven, highly cost-intensive, health care ser- vices. It is high time to think of using the TM knowledge,which is community based, low cost, and socially acceptable, with its health preservation-based approaches, for support- ing the achievement of UHC goals \". As a TM in Europe and many other countries worldwide, homeopathy was used in history 6during the epidemics strongly evidence-based regimensfor conventional vaccines and anti-viral medication in the current COVID-19 pandemic, homeopathy has been used, respectively, by 4 -5% and 45 -50% of the populations in Hong Kong and its adjacent city, Macau; it has been used as an adjunctive measure in the management of in fluenza-like diseases alongside conventional medicine or TCM. According to the Organon by Samuel Hahnemann, every epidemic should be treated as if it were something \"new and unknown \"(\u00a7100). A homeopathic practitioner \"does not immediately perceive the complete picture of the epidemic in the rst case that he treats \"(\u00a7101): we must closely observe series of cases \"since each collective disease reveals itself in the totality of its signs and symptoms \"(\u00a7101). Characteristic symptoms that are peculiar to the epidemic are important elements for the totality of a symptom picture(\u00a7102). Instead of helping an individual to boost up his or her self-healing power, we should aim at treating the whole epidemic region as one patient: that is, the whole \"energypattern \"can only be revealed by different patients with the same disease but different constitutions. By identifying thepeculiar and uniform characteristics for most patients in the same outbreak, we can identify one or several remedies that are most consistently serviceable in the epidemic for peoplewith good past health (\u00a7241). In different epidemic areas, there are differences in weather, diet, collective emotional status, strains of virus, etc., and therefore the named diseasemay present itself with different symptomatology in differ- ent regions, which will require different homeopathic med- icines. Besides, within a given population affected by thesame virus, we will probably see distinct sets of symptoms, which will indicate the need for different medicines. Compared to the pathognomonic symptoms of the dis- ease, homeopathic symptoms are more helpful for homeo- pathic prescriptions. The objective of this case series is to report and share the sets of homeopathic symptoms identi-ed in 18 symptomatic COVID-19 patients in Hong Kong who used homeopathy as adjunctive care for symptom relief. It is not the intention of the authors to suggest homeopathicprescription guidelines for COVID-19 symptoms because of the likely variation in symptomatology in different countries and the limitations of our available data. Methods Considering the limited availability and the considerable false- negative rate of diagnostic tools, especially at the earlier stage of the outbreak, and with reference to the diagnostic criteria inthe 7th edition of the diagnosis and treatment protocol in China, 15consecutive patients were included only if they had fullled at least one of the following criteria: 1. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive for 2019-novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV); 2. M/immunoglobulin G) speci c for COVID-19; 3. Presenting with fever, chills, or respiratory symptoms, and related to an outbreak cluster. Acluster is dened as three or more symptomatic patients identi able in a 2-week period in a small unit such as family, ofce, or school class \u2014that is, each cluster will have arisen from an epidemiologically related index case \u2014and with one or more cases being RT-PCR positive. Categorization of severity was as follows under the treat- ment protocol in China: 1. Mild: fever or respiratory symptoms without pneumonia features on imaging. 2. Moderate: fever or respiratory symptoms, with pneumo- nia features on imaging. 3. Severe: respiratory rate >30 per minute, or oxygen satu- ration /C2093% at rest. 4. Critical: respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation support, or shock or organ failure requiring intensive care. All the patients actively sought adjunctive care from homeopathy. All except one (Case HK6.1) used homeopathy Homeopathy Vol. 109 No. 3/2020Homeopathic Clinical Features of COVID-19 Patients To, Fok 147 in addition to their concurrent conventional or TCM treat- ment. All except one suspected case (HK6.1) were consultedthrough telephone calls or video calls. Patients were requested to ll in an electronic patient registration form when they made appointments for suspected COVID-19symptoms, and the consultation would then be offered for free through video calls. In the case of a patient with fever/ respiratory symptoms who walked into the consulting roomswithout making an appointment, personal protective equip- ment based on droplet and contact precaution was provided to the staff. If a case was diagnosed as COVID-19 before theysought help from homeopathy, distant consultation and follow-up were done by video or audio calls during their quarantined period. If a case was suspected to be COVID-19when they sought help from homeopathy, they were advised to follow the most updated instruction of quarantine and treatment from the Hong Kong government. The 18 case takings were performed by TKL, a homeopathic practitioner with more than 10 years of experience in homeo- pathic practice. A standard questionnaire on common homeo-pathic symptoms was lled in by all diagnosed/suspected COVID-19 patients, with or without the help of a consulting- room assistant, before the consultation with author KLAT.Verbal consent to share anonymized clinical information for academic purposes was obtained from each patient. Cases are presented according to their outbreak cluster, dened as above. The case presentations focused mainly on the homeopathic symptoms. Full repertorizations, with Syn- thesis Repertory 2009V last updated in RadarOpus 2.2.12, arepresented for each individual case. Homeopathic medicines were delivered to patients within 24 hours after consultation. Follow-up checkpoints forpatients were suggested as 12 hours, 24 hours, 3 days, 7 days, and 14 days after the intake of the rst dose of medicine. Patients, however, were encouraged to keep contact with the assistants even at time points other than the above. At each checkpoint, patients were asked to give an overall severityrating of their symptoms and general well-being: 100 was the designated \"reference \"score for a patient in the 24 hours immediately before the rst dose of medicine; 0 was the score when all of the patient 's symptoms disappeared and general well-being returned to normal (i.e., 100% improvement of symptoms); 200 was the score when the severity of symptomsand general well-being was twice as bad as before. There was no upper limit of the score, and any percentage score between the above examples was eligible. In the analysis, frequency of all homeopathic medicines, common symptoms in all the cases, and common rubrics for each of the top-ranked remedies are presented. Differentiat-ing features are also presented. Besides, differentiating features are also presented, those being de ned as rubrics that ful lled the following criteria: 1. Present in at least 50% of cases for the top-ranked remedy; 2. Present in no more than 2 cases for other top-ranked remedies. The article was rst written in Chinese and translated by author YYYF into English.Findings The 18 patients were identi ed in six separate clusters of COVID-19, each cluster comprising 1, 1, 5, 5, 5 and 1 case or cases, respectively. Cluster no.1 Case HK1.1 The patient was a 62-year-old woman, with good past health and repeated close contact in a cluster with more than 10 RT-PCR positive cases, diagnosed in February 2020. She had repeated close contact with the cluster since January 25, 2020, developed bone pain and mild dry cough inearly February. The patient 's symptoms were categorized as mild, but they gradually worsened without fever for nearly 1 month. They were treated with TCM for 4 weeks; homeopa-thy was added at the fourth week for persistent symptoms. The patient did not take any conventional medication. An RT- PCR test, carried out once after 4 weeks of TCM and 2 days ofhomeopathy, was negative. The following homeopathic symptoms were found: 1. Slow onset and progression of symptoms. 2.

The patient reported that symptoms improved by50% within 15 minutes after the rst dose, and perspiration followed and further improved. On the rst day, she reported her symptoms as improved for 2.5 hours after each dose of theremedy, and therefore the dosage was increased to 2-hourly. She reported more than 60% (score of <40) improvement in symptoms at day 3. Repertorization is shown in Fig. 18 . Fig. 17 Repertorization of Case HK5.5. Fig. 16 Repertorization of Case HK5.4. Homeopathy Vol. 109 No. 3/2020Homeopathic Clinical Features of COVID-19 Patients To, Fok 158 Analysis The case series comprises 10 young men and 8 young/middle- aged women, each with mild symptoms. The most frequently indicated medicines for the 18 cases were Gelsemium semper- virens used in 80% of the cases in clusters 3, 4, and 5. Eighteen common symptoms with a minimum frequency of 4 were screened from 79 selected rubrics from all the cases and are summarized in Table 1 . These common symptoms constructed the characteristic symptom pictures of the two commonly indicated medi-cines: Bryonia alba and Gelsemium sempervirens .I ti sk n o w n in the literature that Bryonia alba and Gelsemium sempervi- rens are related remedies: Bryonia alba is found to have good function when it is prescribed following the initial prescrip- tion of Gelsemium sempervirens . 16 Frequencies of all common symptoms (present in >2 cases) in the four cases of Bryonia alba are summarized in Table 2 . And frequencies of all common symptoms (present in>3 cases) in the 12 cases of Gelsemium sempervirens are summarized in Table 3 . Eight and seven differentiating homeopathic features were identi ed for Bryonia alba and Gelsemium sempervi- rens, respectively, shown with repertorization in Tables 4 and 5. Discussion This case series provides in detail the full repertorization of a few clusters in Hong Kong. More experience from other countries or regions will be helpful to nd out if the homeopathic symptomatology pattern is consistent or not.From the experience in Hong Kong, the homeopathic features of the patients who were categorized as mildwere quite obvious and characteristic. Common symptoms of the disease, such as dry cough, fatigue, sore throat and shortness of breath, would not be very helpful in nding the simillimum because these symptoms are present in several homeopathic medicines. Homeopathic symptoms that were strange, rare, and peculiar in classical textbooks were readilyvisible at a higher frequency compared to times without the epidemic. Examples include the chills that went up and down the back, the band-like headache, and the relief of headache from profuse urination. It is important to emphasize that no direct causation effect can be concluded from a case series which, by denition, was observational and non-controlled: the reported percentage improvements in symptoms shouldtherefore be viewed accordingly. Other limitations of this case series include its small sample size and the lack of severe or critical COVID-19 cases; the majority of the casesin this series were young and all were categorized as mild. Information about homeopathic clinical features of the severe and critical cases would be very useful for homeo-paths around the world. However, more than 80% of all conrmed COVID-19 cases have been categorized as mild or moderate. 17These were the patients with relatively good past health compared to the severe or critical patients, who often suffered from chronic co-morbidities.18Dr. Hahne- mann stated in The Organon that the remedies identi ed from the peculiar and uniform characteristics of patients in the same outbreak would be consistently serviceable in the epidemic for people with good past health (\u00a7241). In otherwords, Hahnemann observed more than 200 years ago that the relatively healthy patients showed a more homoge- neous homeopathic clinical picture in epidemics, so that Fig. 18 Repertorization of Case HK6.1. Homeopathy Vol. 109 No. 3/2020Homeopathic Clinical Features of COVID-19 Patients To, Fok 159 the few remedies identi ed from case series could be applicable in most patients according to the Law of Similars. Thus, by identifying the homeopathic clinical features in the mild COVID-19 patients, the peculiar characteristic of theepidemic in the region should be revealed. In severe and critical cases, a more individualized pattern of homeopathic symptoms would be expected because of their co-existingconstitutional susceptibilities. Conclusion The 18 mild COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong presented twomain sets of homeopathic symptom pictures, indicatingTable 1 Homeopathic rubrics with a minimum frequency of 4 in the 18 cases Rubrics Frequency 1 Generals -Slow manifestation 18 2M the eyes open; 5C o u h \u2014Tickling Chill-Beginning in -back-dorsal region Back-Coldness -extending and - -Thirst -large quantities; for 4 17 Cough - 18 Generals -Perspiration -after-amel. 4Table 2 Homeopathic rubrics with a minimum frequency of 3 in the 4 cases of Bryonia alba Rubrics Frequency 1 Generals -Slow manifestation 4 2 Stomach -Thirst -large quantities; for 4 3C o u -Tickling -throat; -Tickling -Chest4 4M d -Aversion to 3 5 Generals -Food and Drinks -warm drinks -desire3 6 o a t 3 9C o u g 3 10 -Lying-agg.

These medicines were indicated in 4 and 12 cases, respectively, out of the 18 cases in total. Highlights 1. Homeopathy was used in Hong Kong in the COVID-19 pandemic as an adjunctive measure for symptom relief alongside conventional medicine or TCM. 2. Homeopathic symptoms are always more helpful than pathognomonic symptoms of the named disease for homeopathic prescription. 3. Homeopathic symptoms of 18 cases from six clusters were reported. 4. Eighteen common symptoms with a minimal frequen- cy of four were screened from 79 selected rubrics fromall the cases. 5. The common symptoms constituted two sets of ho- meopathic symptom pictures: Bryonia alba and Gelse-mium sempervirens . They were used in 4 and 12 cases respectively out of the 18 cases. 6. Eight and seven differentiating features were identi- ed for Bryonia alba and Gelsemium sempervirens, respectively. Conflict of Interest None declared.
