The need for special guidance arises from the complexity of many aspects of vaccine composition and formulation. The fundamental requirements for product information particulars for medicines appear in European law, with guidance being found in a number of documents including the following: - \"Guideline on Summary of Product Characte ristics\", \"Readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use\", and \"Packaging information of medicinal products for human use authorised by the Community\", published by the European Commission. - \"Note for guidance on stability testing of new drug substances and products\", \"Note for guidance on stability testing of existing drug substances and products\", \"Note for guidance on maximum shelf life of sterile products after first opening or following reconstitution\", the QRD product information templates for SPC, label and PL, the \"Compilation of QRD decisions on stylisti c matters in product information\", and the \"Compilation of QRD decisions on the use of terms\", published by the EMEA. - The European Pharmacopoeia, and the \"Lis t of standard terms for pharmaceutical dosage forms, routes of administration, and containers\", published by the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines. - For Applications in the centralised procedure general guidance can be found in the \"QRD templates with explanatory notes\", published by EMEA. Applicants are advised to take this Note for Guidance into account when submitting applications for Marketing Authorisation (MA) for new vaccines, and on the occasions of applying for renewals of existing vaccine MAs. Guidance specific to the product information for influenza vaccines appears in the \"Note for Guidance on harmonisation of requirements for influenza vaccines\", published by the EMEA.CPMP/BWP/2758/02 EMEA 2003 Page 4/16 SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS The pharmaceutical sections of the SPC are 1, 2, 3, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5 and 6.6. 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT The entries under Section 1. in the SPC for vaccines should appear in the following order: - Invented name, - [strength], - pharmaceutical form, - common name of the product, and take into account the following guidance: Trade name of the medicinal product European Commission rules for trade names for medicinal products should be observed. Strength It is acceptable not to include the strength where it is not straightforward. Pharmaceutical form Although the SPC Guideline allows the omission of the pharmaceutical form in cases where it is not straightforward, it is recommended that the pharmaceutical form should be stated for all vaccines. The appropriate standard term, or a co mbination of standard terms, should be used to express the pharmaceutical form. In the special case of the pre-filled syringe pres entation of a vaccine which is also marketed in (a) different container(s), the ph armaceutical form of the pre-filled syringe presentation only should be expressed as \"<solution> <suspension> for injection in a pre-filled syringe\". In all other cases, the container should not be included in the pharmaceutical form. Common name of the vaccine The common name should be understood to mean the title of the relevant European Pharmacopoeia monograph, where one exists . In cases where there is no European Pharmacopoeia monograph, the stylistics and precedents of European Pharmacopoeia monograph titles should be observed, including the use of words such as \"live\", \"adsorbed\" or \"virosome\" in parenthesis, if relevant. 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION The principal entries under Section 2. in the SPC should appear in the following order: - Qualitative and quantitative declaration of each active substance, - qualitative and quantitative declaration of any adjuvant or adsorbent present, - a reference to the list of excipients in Section 6.1, and take into account the following guidance: Active substance(s) CPMP/BWP/2758/02 EMEA 2003 Page 5/16 The qualitative and quantitative composition, in terms of the presence of the active substance(s), should normally be expressed per dose unit. For polyvalent vaccines, the active substances would ideally appear in the order of the relevant monograph title of the European Pharmacopoeia, where one exists. However, in the case of a presentation consisting of more than one container or chamber, the composition should be presented on a per container/chamber basis. Abbreviations for active substance names (including carrier protein) should not be used in the SPC. Directive 2001/83/EC requires that in Section 2. of SPCs, the usual common name or chemical description of active substances shal l be used. As there are no INNs for vaccine antigens, each active substance name should be in conformity with European Pharmacopoeia monograph terminology for vaccine antigens in so far as is possible. For non-pharmacopoeial active substances, the active substance name should ideally be expressed according to its formal Latin/Greek name, or according to th e disease being protected against, taking historical and pharmacopoeial precedents for the naming of similar vaccine antigens into account. Taxonomic names for cellular microorganisms s hould be italicised. Names of microbial genera should not be abbreviated. Generally, for bacteria and viruses, the strain, serotype or other appropriate sub-species desi gnation should be included in the name of each antigen, if relevant. The nature of any cellular system(s) used for production, and if relevant the use of recombinant DNA technology, including the use of the expression \"produced in XXX cells <by recombinant DNA technology>\"should be mentioned in the SPC, following the pattern set by the following examples: - \"produced in human diploid (MRC-5) cells\"; - \"produced Escherichia technology\"; - \"produced in chick-embryo cells\". For polyvalent vaccines, the information on the cellular system(s) used for production may be presented as (a) footnote(s) within Section 2. Otherwise, the inclusion of a mention of the production process in vaccine active substance names should normally be restricted to the use of the following terms: - \"live, attenuated\" (in the case of vacc ines containing living micro-organisms), - \"inactivated\" (in the case of vaccines containing killed micro-organisms). Information on the means used to attenuate or inactivate an active substance should not be given, unless this information is necessary for defining the nature of the active substance, for example in the case of a formaldehyde/heat treated cholera vaccine antigen. CPMP/BWP/2758/02 EMEA 2003 Page 6/16 Adjuvants/adsorbents If an adjuvant or adsorbent is present in the vaccine, it should be included in Section 2. Qualitative and Quantitative Composition. Eur opean Pharmacopoeia nomenclature should be employed where possible, with the exception that \"aluminium hydroxide, hydrated, for adsorption\" may be written as \"aluminium hydroxide, hydrated\". Aluminium compounds are normally referred to as adsorbents. The quantitative declaration of aluminium compounds should be in terms of the quantity of Al per dose. For polyvalent vaccines in particular, and also for monovalent vaccines where this is found convenient, the qualitative and quantitative partic ulars for the adjuvant(s)/adsorbent(s) may be presented as (a) footnote(s) within Section 2. of the SPC. Abbreviations for adjuvant/adsorbent names sh ould not be used in the SPC or PL. Where justified, however, abbreviations may be cons idered for the labelling on space limitation grounds, on condition that any such abbrev iations are designated in Section 2. Multidose preparations In case of multidose preparation include the following statement: \"This is a multidose container. See Section 6.5 for th e number of doses per vial\". Reference to the list of excipients Point 2 of the SPC should conclude with the statement \"For excipients, see Section 6.1\". 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM The statement of pharmaceutical form appearing in Section 3. should be identical to that appearing in Section 1. This section should conclude with a descripti on of the product as presented for marketing. 6 PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS 6.1 List of Excipients The excipients should be listed in accordance with the SPC Guideline using the appropriate common names. As with all excipients, preservatives should be listed qualitatively but not quantitatively in Section 6.1. Residues of reagents used in production should not be listed in Section 6.1. Certain residues such as residues of antibiotic or other antimi crobial agents used in production that are known allergens with a potential for inducing undesira ble effects should, however, be mentioned in Section 4.3. For vaccines, which are presented in more than one container or in dual-chamber syringes, the excipients should be listed per container or per chamber. Abbreviations for excipients should not be used in the SPC or PL. However, where justified by space considerations, abbreviations for excipient names may appear on the labelling, on condition that these abbreviations are designated in Section 6.1. CPMP/BWP/2758/02 EMEA 2003 Page 7/16 Adjuvants and adsorbents should not be listed in Section 6.1. However, if such materials are present in the vaccine, this section should contain a reference to their appearance in Section 2. 6.2 Incompatibilities Only pharmaceutical (i.e. physical, chemical or bi ological) incompatibilities should be stated in Section 6.2. The appropriate standard QRD statement viz. <Not applicable>, <In the absence of compatibility studies, the vaccine must not be mixed with other medicinal products>, or <The vaccine must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in Section 6.6> should appear. Pharmacological incompatibilities of the vaccine such as in vivo interactions with other drugs or with food should not appear in Section 6.2 as they belong in the clinical parts of the SPC. 6.3 Shelf life The shelf-life declaration(s) should be in accor dance with the SPC Guideline and with related guidance documents, addressing the shelf lives of un-reconstituted and reconstituted vaccines as necessary. 6.4 Special precautions for storage The declaration of the precautions for stor age should be in accordance with the SPC Guideline and with related guidance documents. 6.5 Nature and contents of container The declaration of the nature and contents of the container(s) should be in accordance with the SPC Guideline and with related guidance documents. In the case of multidose presentations, the number of doses per vial should be stated. 6.6 Instructions for use, handling <and disposal> In the case of vaccines intended for reconstitution, the appearance of the product before reconstitution will be found in Section 3., wh ile the post-reconstituti on appearance belongs in 6.6. For all vaccines, there should also be a direc tion to examine the appearance of the product before administration. Additional directions should be added as necessary. Information necessary for the pharmacist or other health professional to prepare the product for administration to the vaccinee should appear in 6.6. However, information necessary for the physician or other health care professiona l to administer the product to the vaccinee should not appear in Section 6.6, as this inform ation belongs in the clinical sections of the SPC. In the case of live vaccines, there should, as a minimum, be a direction for disposal of product, materials which have come into contact with the product, and/or waste material, in accordance with local requirements for the proper disposal of such materials. In the case of inactivated vaccines, there shoul d, as a minimum, be a direction for safe disposal in accordance with local requirements. CPMP/BWP/2758/02 EMEA 2003 Page 8/16 LABELLING European guidance documents and templates provide comprehensive guidance on labelling. For vaccines, the following additional guidance should be taken into account. Outer Packaging For the statement of active substances, the active substance(s), and the adjuvant/adsorbent, if present, should be expressed qualitatively, and quantitatively per dose unit, as they appear in Section 2 of the SPC, with the exception that, in the case of space limitations, abbreviations for certain adjuvants or adsorbents, as designated in the SPC, may be acceptable in special circumstances. For multidose presentations, the number of doses in the container(s) should be stated. Information about the cellular systems used as production substrates may be omitted from the carton labelling. The word \"micrograms\" shou ld normally be spelled out as such in the labelling, with the exception that, in the case of severe space limitations, it may be acceptable to use \"\u00b5g\" if justified and there are no safety concerns. The list of excipients should appear on the carton labelling and be expressed as in Section 6.1 of the SPC. However, where there are space limitations, abbreviations for certain excipients, as designated in the SPC, may be acceptable. For cartons containing ancillary items such as sw abs, needles etc, carton labels should include a list of the total contents of the carton. A full statement of the precautions for dispos al of unused product and/or waste material should appear on the carton labelling, unless space considerations prevent this, in which case a reference to the appearance of the disposal directions in the PL is sufficient. Small immediate packaging Pharmaceutical form short terms according to th e current \"List of Standard terms\" may be used in case of space limitation, but only if cons istently used in all language versions of the label. In cases of severe space limitation, the pharmaceutical form may be omitted. Peel-off labelling MA Holders may consider the addition to the immediate packaging of peel-off labels, which could be used for inserting immunisation details into patient records. PACKAGE LEAFLET (PL) European guidance documents and templates provide comprehensive guidance on PLs. As required by Directive 2001/83/EC, the package leaflet should be drawn up in accordance with the SPC, and be written in clear and understandable terms for the user. As in the SPC, abbreviations of terms should not be used, as there are no space limitations in the leaflet. The nature of any cellular system(s) used for production, and if relevant the use of recombinant DNA technology, should be mentioned in the leaflet in a manner consistent with the SPC, including the use of the expression such as \"produced in XXX cells <by recombinant DNA technology>\". Complete information regarding instructions for use, handling and disposal by the user should be included in the PL. The word \"micrograms\" should be used instead of the abbreviation \" \u00b5g\". CPMP/BWP/2758/02 EMEA 2003 Page 9/16 Where an adjuvant or adsorbent is present in a vaccine, the leaflet should include the following or an equivalent statement: \"Substance-X is included in this vaccine as an <adjuvant>,<adsorbent>. <Adjuvants> <Adsorbants> are substances included in certain vaccines to accelerate, improve and/or prol ong the protective effects of the vaccine\".
