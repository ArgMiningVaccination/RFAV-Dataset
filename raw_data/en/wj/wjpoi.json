It Is normal for a woman to [put on weight during pregnancy](https://parenting.firstcry.com/articles/weight-gain-pregnancy-much-good/?ref=interlink), and even after birth and breastfeeding, it could be difficult to get back to pre-pregnancy weight.

However, there are a few things you can do to incorporate a balanced detox diet while breastfeeding. What Is Detox? A human being's body is exposed to several harmful substances called toxins daily. It could be in their food, drinks or environment, or even topical creams. It is nearly impossible to get rid of them entirely. The word detox refers to the body's natural ability to detoxify itself. If not, then we would all be victims of these harsh toxins that we intake every day. From the lungs to the liver, almost every organ in the body has its way of keeping itself clean. However, your body could need a boost at times, and there is nothing wrong with providing that additional help. It is all about striking the right balance when implementing a detox diet to lose weight and help your body stay healthy. Does Detox Diet Work?
