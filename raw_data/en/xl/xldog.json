About 135 million Indians are experiencing obesity due to their unhealthy food habits ( [1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1871402118303655)). This puts women, men, and even children equally at the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and cancer ( [2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19940414/)). A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7039458/) predicted that the overweight prevalence may double among Indian adults aged 20-69 years by the year 2040, while the rate of obesity may triple. The prevalence of overweight among women will increase from 14.7% to 27.4% by 2040, and the prevalence of obesity is estimated to increase from 4.4% to 14.0% by 2040. Fortunately, following an Indian diet for weight loss is quite effective. Which Indian diet are we talking about? It is a four-week lactovegetarian diet plan, specially designed using Ayurvedic ingredients that induce weight loss and improve health ( [3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352618115000438)). Plant-based diets, including vegan and vegetarian diets, are highly effective in bringing down the risk of obesity and related diseases ( [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5466943/)). The best part about it is that Indian cuisine is replete with vibrant spices, fresh herbs, and rich flavors. In this article, we dig deeper into this doctor-approved four-week diet plan, how it works, and more. Keep reading! In This Article What Is The Indian Diet Plan? A weight loss diet that is based on whole, nutrient-dense foods is sustainable and is generally recommended for long-term success. The Indian diet plan is a 4-week vegetarian/lactovegetarian diet for people struggling to lose weight on other diets. Following a diet chart for weight loss can be a helpful tool in achieving your fitness goals, as it provides a structured plan for healthy eating. The rise of obesity and obesity-related diseases across ages in India prompted the creation of this diet. However, a balanced plant-based diet is good for human health and wellness irrespective of ethnicity and geographical location. It is important to note that a weight loss diet chart is typically tailored to an individual's specific needs and goals. Following a diet chart for weight loss for females can be an effective way to lose weight and improve overall health, but it is important to consult a healthcare professional before starting any new diet. Remember, a perfect diet chart for weight loss in one month is one that advocates sustainable weight loss, with a focus on balanced meals and exercise. How Does It Work? Generally, a weight loss diet chart for females should include a balance of whole grains, lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats, tailored to individual needs and preferences. Similarly, an Indian diet chart for weight loss for females may include traditional foods such as dal, roti, vegetables, and yogurt, with an emphasis on portion control and moderation. The Indian diet plan works in the following ways: - It is a lacto-vegetarian diet. This means you will consume lots of [dietary fiber](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/amazing-foods-that-are-rich-in-fibre/)from vegetables and leafy greens. You will also consume milk protein and calcium. A veg diet plan for weight loss requires the inclusion of healthy protein sources. Dietary fiber helps improve satiety and bowel movement ( [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK218764/)). Milk and [milk products](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/benefits-of-milk-for-skin-hair-and-health/) increase the number of good gut bacteria, increase satiety, and strengthen the bones ( [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5425481/)). - It is low calorie. The Indian diet is a 1500-calorie diet. The foods included in the list are delicious but do not burden the body with too many calories. The lesser calories you consume, the better the chances of you losing weight. - It has the power to heal. Ayurveda is the \"medicine of life\". This age-old science encourages the consumption of foods that help create a balance between the mind, heart, and spirit. Being on this diet can help you stay stress-free and calm, both of which are necessary for weight loss. - It is digestion and diabetes-friendly. The foods included in this diet plan keep your digestion active, which, in turn, boosts metabolism. It also includes foods with a [low glycemic index](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/glycemic-index-foods-list/), a boon for people with type 2 diabetes. Overall, a diet for weight loss should focus on reducing calorie intake. A high-fiber lacto-vegetarian Indian diet plan is a great option for slimming down. But you must know which foods you need to consume and in what quantities. A beginner diet plan for weight loss for females should be simple and sustainable. Portion control is one of the key factors of weight loss. One of the ways you can measure your food intake to develop a fat-loss diet chart is by knowing how many calories should you consume per day. Here's a table that will help you estimate your daily calorie intake and determine a weight-loss food chart. Recommended Caloric Intake For Indians ( [7](https://www.nin.res.in/downloads/DietaryGuidelinesforNINwebsite.pdf)) (As per the National Institute of your calorie intake depends on the level of activity you do every day. If you are sedentary, 1900 calories will just help to maintain the current weight. To lose weight, you may either start exercising or subtract 500 calories from 1900 calories ( [8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3225890/)). The goal is to create a negative calorie balance in your meal plan. In this post, we have a 4-week 1500-calorie diet plan.
