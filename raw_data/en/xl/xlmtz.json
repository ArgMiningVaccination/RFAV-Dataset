There are only a few places on Earth that have all of these qualities consistently, and perhaps the best one is atop Mauna Kea on Hawaii. Yet generations of wrongs have occurred to [create the great telescope complex](http://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2015/12/09/politics-in-hawaii-threatens-to-end-astronomy-as-we-know-it/)that's up there today, and astronomers continue to lease the land for far less than it's worth despite violating the original contract. That's astronomy as we know it so far, and perhaps [the Mauna Kea protests](http://yro.slashdot.org/story/15/12/03/0359227/giant-telescope-project-stalled-by-hawaiian-natives)signal a long awaited end to that.
