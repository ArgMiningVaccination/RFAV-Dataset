Established in 1997 in Gold Run, CA, we were one of the first truly holistic veterinary clinics to serve the Sierra Foothills and beyond. Now located in Colfax, California, we practice integrative medicine and specialize in treating small animals with Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine (TCVM). We use acupuncture and Chinese herbal formulas as well as western herbs and medicine to treat the whole animal. We also have a strong interest in animal behavior and use flower essences and herbs to treat animals whose behavior issues originate from an imbalance. Our mission is to provide a balanced and gentle approach to your pet's healthcare. MASK POLICY: YEAR 2023 We would like to friendly remind that in order to come into our facility with your pet, a mask will be required for entry. The mask should fully cover your nose & mouth, and we have masks available to you. If you wish not to wear a mask, you will need to remain outside while your pet is being seen. This is for the safety of our veterinarian. Thank you for your understanding "}
