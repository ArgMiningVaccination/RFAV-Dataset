No they have not done an ecg or anything. They telling me it is just anxiety. Mmmhmmm. Almost 3 weeks and still have chest pain, pins and needles now up to my hips and elbows. Left side of face now tingling. Still shooting pains in my head. Dr is going to send me for nerve tests. But they absolutely refuse to admit it was the vaccine. [@judes](https://vestibular.org/participant/judes/) thanks for your reply, it has made me certain I have made the right decision not to get the 3rd booster jab, I have been gently pressured at work to get it ! I am actually ok now, but the intense attack lasted for 2 months in total. 2 months of literally wanting to die. I sincerely hope you are ok now x [@emma](https://vestibular.org/participant/emma/) So sorry to hear.My son has bad symptoms,going into 8th month now.Not sure if he will be able to continue to work.Scared.

[@maddie628](https://vestibular.org/participant/maddie628/) I'm so sorry to hear that. I take a lot of vitamins for my heart. Vitamin E, B-complex, Fish oil, Potassium, Zinc, COQ10, Milk Thistle, L-Arginine,Astaxanthin, Turmeric Curcumin, Garlic and Vitamin D. I still wake up at 2am and I can't go back to sleep at all. My heart is a little better and pin and needles are going away. I hope he gets better [@judes]thanks for your reply, it has made me certain I have made the right decision not to get the 3rd booster jab, I have been gently pressured at work to get it ! I am actually ok now, but the intense attack lasted for 2 months in total. 2 months of literally wanting to die. I sincerely hope you are ok now x Hey Debbie - I'm so relieved to hear you didn't get the 3rd jab! That said, let's not forget I had my 3rd only 15 weeks after my 2nd and now the recommendations are to wait 6 months. I'm like...WTF? Who in our provincial government decided to tell me to get it so soon after the 2nd? At any rate, I would wait if I were you and if you can. I'm at 6 weeks ? and still...not great, but the fact that you are so much better after 2 months gives me hope. I am better, but I am still not able to work and can't go anywhere, so it's all relative... I go into a store and BAM! Instant and severe head pain, vertigo, disorientation, nausea...and it goes on for days. It can't be just us! I'm just SO happy you are feeling better and that you are waiting for the 3rd jab. Please stay in touch and keep us posted. Big hugz! So glad I found this page. I had both pfizer vaccines, first one just sore arm afterwards. Second one, standard reported side effects, fever, fatigue and sore arm. A week later after my second vaccine woke up in the middle of the night thinking I was having a heart attack. That continued as well as dizziness and heavy head a few weeks later. Two months on dizziness and heavy head still there. Anxiety is through the roof. My doctor referred me to the cardiologist who I'm seeing next week. Blood tests and all other exams are clear. I do have vestibular problems but never this bad. Hope it goes away soon... Hi all New to this forum. I am in utter utter hell as 2 months and 5 days ago I had the first Pfizer dose and felt mildly dizzy immediately, was not stressed as figured it was my body's initial response and it would go in a couple of days. No it got worse. I have not had one minutes break from the dizziness and strange eye/sight problems in the entire 9 weeks since. I have done nothing for the whole 2 months but try to get better. Not one doctor, including the one who gave me the vaccine promising it was all safe as anything, has helped me in any way. I am treated like I am a neurotic hypochondriac. No plan of action, no contacting me to see if things have improved. I have been to the doctor 9 times, Emergency. I have tried acupuncture, Traditional Chinese Medicine, bioresonance, kineisiology, a month of homeopathic remedies, drowsy prescription antihistamine, Endep, massive doses of every vitamin known to man, tissue salts etc etc. And nothing. I have suffered from extremely bad migraines for 30 years, had labyrinthitis once but never ever any vestibular problems or vertigo. Just before getting the Pfizer I tried propranolol (beta blockers)for 5 weeks hoping it would prevent migraines. It did seem to work but I did have mild dizziness after taking it each day - this is a normal reaction and was absolutely fine and always went away quickly afterwards. Can anyone help me please? [@makanahi](https://vestibular.org/participant/makanahi/) hi Mark, how are you doing now? am 2 months post the second Pfizer vaccine and all of my symptoms are as follows: Dizziness Tingling Shooting pain through body Tingling toes both feet Tingling shooting through body Swelling of arms and chest separate occasions Spasms started in toes and chest Recent - Spasms all over body accompanied by tingling Pins and needles left hand, left foot, arm in other spots of body Headaches Full body ache worst in morning gets slightly better through day Weakness Loss of muscle Blurry vision painful back of eyes and sensitivity to light Black flashes In vision Bladder spasm followed by urinary incontinence Stomach spasms followed by string like faeces/Loss of appetite Heartburn Recent - Tingling and spasms in eye and face Forgetting things regularly. Takes alot longer to remember basic things and can't remember things that presently occurred. Lack of sleep Fatigue throughout day Constant dry mouth Pain sitting down or leaning on muscle after a short period Body shaking Hot flushes sweating Sweating palms of feet and hands at random Waking up numb/pins and needles lower arms feels like no blood flow Joint pain and cracking New- fingers twitching after intense stabbing pain Muscle stiffness Hands and feet more than often cold Floaters in vision Eyesocket pain Chin around mouth tingling and spasm Foot and calves cramp 2 months I am now unable to sleep and my heart seems to accelerate as I am about to go to sleep. Chest pain is getting significantly worse. I am very concerned when to you see your symptoms wear off? thanks [@chelsun](https://vestibular.org/participant/chelsun/) hi chelsun, how are you doing now? How many months post the vaccine did you see improvement if symptoms? Eeek. Not sure if I'm doing this right. No they have not done an ecg or anything. They telling me it is just anxiety. Mmmhmmm. Almost 3 weeks and still have chest pain, pins and needles now up to my hips and elbows. Left side of face now tingling. Still shooting pains in my head. Dr is going to send me for nerve tests. But they absolutely refuse to admit it was the vaccine. Did you do your nerve test? Anything showed up on the reports? How are you feeling these days? [@quail444](https://vestibular.org/participant/quail444/) unfortunately same for me. It's been 5 months now with depersonalization/derealization symptoms, eye floaters and tinnitus. I take supplements, I do yoga and talk therapy just to deal with these symptoms and I hope one day I will get better. It's crazy that doctors do not give you the possibility that all these might relate to the vaccine. "}
