Countywide elected officials include the Auditor-Controller/Clerk-Recorder, Assessor, Treasurer-Tax Collector, District Attorney, and Sheriff/Coroner. The Board of Supervisors is responsible for providing policy direction, approving the County budget, and representing the County in a number of areas including its dependent special districts. The County Administrator advises, assists, and acts as an agent for the Board of Supervisors in all matters under the Board's jurisdiction. The Board of Supervisors is guided by the Mission, Vision, and Values statement adopted on March 13, 2007, and by the County of Alameda Strategic Vision Initiative, adopted on November 3, 2008. Mission To enrich the lives of Alameda County residents through visionary policies and accessible, responsive, and effective services. Vision Alameda County is recognized as one of the best counties in which to live, work and do business. Strategic Vision The Alameda County Strategic Vision provides a multi-year, comprehensive and far-reaching roadmap for establishing Alameda County as one of the best counties in which to live, work and do business. The Strategic Vision consists of five areas, corresponding to the County's core services and community priorities: Environment and Sustainability, Safe and Livable Communities, Healthy and Thriving Populations, Housing, and Transportation. 2016-17 FINAL BUDGET SUMMARY 2015-16 Final 2016-17 Final Change All 7,688.27 7,696.62 8.35 * General Fund includes Grants and Measure A Note: This table summary does not include the County Service Areas (CSAs) for Police Protection, Emergency Medical Services, Vector Control, Lead Abatement, and Other Public Ways and Facilities. These CSAs are included in their department chapters in the County Budget document which can be found at acgov.org. Alameda County was established in 1853. The County's almost 821 square miles encompass a varied geography ranging from bay wetlands to rolling open spaces to hillside lakes and streams. Alameda is the seventh most populous county in California, and has 14 incorporated cities and several unincorporated communities. The total population is estimated to be 1,627,865 as of January 2016, a 2% increase from a year ago. Oakland is the seat of County government and the largest city.

Population growth has occurred with the natural net increase of births over deaths, but also from substantial immigration, and Alameda County is now one of the most ethnically diverse regions in the Bay Area and the nation. Based on the 2010 Census, 31% of the population is foreign born. There is no majority racial or ethnic group in Alameda County. According to the California Department of Education, 67 languages were spoken by English language learners in the K-12 public school systems in Alameda County in 2015-2016.

The unemployment rate has dropped to 4.6% in Alameda County as of August 2016, which is about half of what it was four years ago, and better than California's 5.5% rate and the 4.9% rate for the nation. However, many labor experts contend the drop is at least partly attributable to people dropping out of the labor force as they give up looking for work or those who have had to settle for part-time jobs.

Alameda County advances legislation that will allow it to better serve its residents. HEALTH 8195d4fe-ac85-48b1-972a-2bdcc7335732 0a9e4e46-718b-4849-bf6f-6ceff931178d Proposal: Food As Medicine Assembly and Senate Concurrent Resolution The County proposes a concurrent resolution of the State Assembly and Senate to encourage local jurisdictions across California to create \"Food as Medicine\" programs. Discussion/Key Components Nationally, and in California, rates of diabetes among adults and young adults have tripled or more in the last 30 years. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevent (CDC) reports that 29 million people have diabetes today\u20143 million more than in 2010\u2014and possibly 1 in 4 are not aware that they have the condition. [1] A recent UCLA study concluded that in California, 46 percent of adults - almost half - are prediabetic or have undiagnosed diabetes, compared with about nine percent of adults who already have a diagnosis. For many, this health crisis begins in childhood and adolescence. Approximately one in three California young adults are pre-diabetic. Children who are obese or at-risk for obesity are at high risk for being pre-diabetic, or developing full-blown diabetes before their 18th birthday. African-American, Latino, and Filipino children are at particularly high risk. [2] Without intervention, 30 percent of those with prediabetes will develop type 2 diabetes within five years. Up to 70 percent will develop type 2 diabetes within their lifetime. This is a sobering estimation for the individuals who will be affected, but it is also a looming tidal wave to the healthcare system and to the national economy. The costs of obesity to the healthcare system will continue to skyrocket without significant efforts to prevent the progression from prediabetes to diabetes, now accounting for a full 21 percent of annual national healthcare spending. In terms of prevention strategies, we know that good food promotes good health, and also that certain chronic diseases, from diabetes to heart disease to obesity, can be dramatically improved through healthy eating. For children and youth, the quality of their diets directly affects cognitive growth and development, ability to concentrate and learn, and physical fitness and emotional health. [3] Too many people in our state who could benefit most from the health benefits of good nutrition lack access to fresh, healthy food. Doctors know their patients need to eat better, but they do not have adequate tools to make that happen. ALL IN Alameda County has a bold vision for focusing our health systems and our communities on the promotion of well-being through a system of \"Food as Medicine,\" in which medical providers will give \"food prescriptions\" to thousands of low-income patients that can be filled at \"farmacies\" located at their health centers or schools. Along with the food, families of pediatric patients will receive a voucher for a 6-week hands-on cooking class, complete with recipe cards and cookbooks to take home, taught by nutrition staff from the Alameda County Public Health Department. These classes will be offered at convenient locations in neighborhoods. Families will also be visited at home by a nurse who will assess their cooking capacity, defined as both knowledge and equipment. Behavioral changes and health outcomes will be tracked by medical researchers at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital. PAGE | 15 Legislative Proposals 2017 Alameda CountyFood as Medicine is a multi-sector initiative led by several partners: ALL IN Alameda County (an initiative of Alameda County Supervisor Wilma Chan), UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital, the Deputy Sheriffs' Activities League, the Alameda County Public Health Department, and the Alameda County Community Food Bank. ALL IN Alameda County will develop and incubate the initiative, spending a year identifying best practices with a small group of health providers, and then scaling the initiative throughout the county in 2017. Many hospitals, nonprofit organizations, and local governments have already begun integrating food into their routine medical care. Current efforts range from small-scale food prescription programs to system-wide changes in funding procedures for medically tailored foods. For example, the Food Pantry at Boston Medical Center, the Food Shelf at Hennepin County Medical Center, and Connecticut-based Wholesome Wave give food prescriptions to low-income, food-insecure patients at risk for or struggling with diet-related diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease. Locally, the Alameda Health System\u2014Alameda County's public hospital system\u2014has also launched their own \"Food as Medicine\" programs with the goal of making fresh, healthy foods accessible to children and their families. Highland Hospital's Pediatric Medical Clinic in partnership with the People's Grocery offer the Bite-to-Balance Program to their patients. [4] Highland Hospital has also partnered with Mandela Marketplace to run a weekly stand that offers affordable, locally grown, sustainable, pesticide-free produce to patients. The food stand accepts cash, credit cards, and EBT. Hayward Wellness and Cooking Matters launched their Healthy Eating for Good Health Program, which increased access to nutritious foods for low-income families in communities where obesity is prevalent. [5] These replicable models work and are cost-effective. For example, the Bite-to-Balance Program found that more than 70 percent of the children who participated maintained or decreased their Body Mass Index (weight relative to height), and had significant improvements in cholesterol and blood sugar levels\u2014two key indicators of pre- diabetes. Participating families also demonstrated greater appreciation of the importance of eating healthy. [6] Another pilot program for diabetic food pantry clients that provided participants with diabetes-appropriate food found improvements in blood glucose levels, fruit and vegetable intake, and medication compliance.

(2015). A Pilot Food Bank Intervention Featuring Diabetes-Appropriate Food Improved Glycemic Control Among Clients in Three States. Health Affairs, 34 (11), 1956-1963. Benefits The health and social benefits of changing the eating habits of diabetic and pre-diabetic individuals are immense. So, too, are the cost-savings to health systems charged with the care of people with diabetes over the course of the chronic disease. The diabetes epidemic is overwhelmingly costly for our health care system, especially the PAGE | 16 Legislative Proposals 2017 Alameda Countyindigent care system. According to an analysis from the California Center for Public Health Advocacy, \"In California, total health care and related costs for the treatment of diabetes is about $24.5 billion each year. The disease adds an extra $1.6 billion dollars every year in just hospitalization costs, with hospital stays for patients with diabetes costing nearly $2,200 more than for patients without diabetes. Three-quarters of that care is paid through Medicare and Medi-Cal, including $254 million in costs that are paid by Medi-Cal tax dollars. On average, medical expenditures for people with diabetes are 2.3 times more expensive than for those without diabetes.\" By managing this disease through healthy eating, significant healthcare savings across the lifespan of each patient can be gained. Food as Medicine programs could become an integral part of the whole person initiative under the new State Waiver, and can lead to change in physician practices in the long term. Moreover, Food as Medicine programs have the potential to transform our healthcare system by building its capacity to address one of the key social determinants of health: access to fresh, healthy foods. HUMAN SERVICES 657c7ed2-886c-439f-bbb5-ce42bf05c4ef 38bdc0a9-43c2-4a0e-8e37-9f54be0f0c86 Proposal: AB 833 Individualized Child Care Subsidy Pilot Clean Up Legislation Modify law implemented by AB 833 (Bonta 2015) which enables Alameda County to undertake a pilot for subsidized child care to cover Alternative Payment (AP) vouchers and 24 month eligibility redetermination for part day state preschool. Discussion/Key Components AB 833 allows Alameda County to modify rates, parent eligibility exit levels, and eligibility redetermination intervals among other state mandated criteria governing subsidized child care programs in order to retain local contract dollars and serve more families. However, Alameda County wants to apply the pilot to both forms of subsidized care--Title 5 centers which have contracts with the California Department of Education and Alternative Payment vouchers distributed by Alternative Payment agencies. Additionally, although the County was allowed to reduce eligibility redetermination to once every 24 months for Title 5 centers, the California Department of Education did not allow Alameda County to apply this reform to part day state preschool programs--a subset of Title 5 contractors. This bill would allow the County to apply this policy to the Title 5 centers, should they choose to participate. Benefits Allowing application of a variety of local criteria to both Alternative Payment vouchers and Title 5 centers would create a more coherent and equitable system for providers and parents. Under the pilot, there are roughly 7,900 children in center based contracts whose families can retain child care above the state income cutoff, and AB 833 clean up legislation would enable families of the roughly 4,800 children with Alternative Payment vouchers the same higher income exit threshold. 26c26d1a-b51e-4f41-aa3b-390793e96c82 Proposal: Reproductive Health Education for Foster Youth Pursue a State budget request to provide dedicated funding to counties for reproductive health education for foster youth. To ensure that funds are used effectively and efficiently, counties would be required to use an evidence-based curriculum, such as Making Proud Choices. The California Department of Social Services (CDSS) could be directed to administer a program to interested counties that provides funding, oversight, and training for providing reproductive health education to foster youth. PAGE | 17 Legislative Proposals 2017 Alameda CountyDiscussion/Key Components Foster youth experience disparate reproductive health outcomes at an alarmingly higher rate than youth in the general population. Specifically, 26 percent of 17 year-olds girls in foster care in California have been pregnant at least once. This is compared to a pregnancy rate of 2.8 percent for all California teens, ages 15 to 19. In addition, 34.3 percent of girls who were in foster care at age 17 in California will give birth at least once by age 21. However, there is not a dedicated funding source provided to counties that can support reproductive health education for foster youth. This means that all 58 county child welfare agencies must pursue grants and other funding sources that are often limited in amount and availability to educate all foster youth. Providing reproductive health education to foster youth ages 14 - 19 would focus on the prevention of unplanned pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections and diseases. This is necessary to avoid the devastating impact that teen pregnancy can have on a youth's educational attainment and career/life goals. By age 22, only around 50 percent of teen mothers have received a high school diploma and only 30 percent have earned a General Educational Development (GED) certificate, whereas 90 percent of women who did not give birth during adolescence receive a high school diploma. Teen fathers have a 25 to 30 percent lower probability of graduating from high school than teenage boys who are not fathers. Even foster youth that do not experience teen pregnancy are much less likely to graduate high school than other youth. It is critical that foster youth receive reproductive health training to support their successful transition to adulthood. Benefits Providing reproductive health education to foster youth is intended to prevent unplanned pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections and diseases. This is expected to improve the educational outcomes for foster youth and reduce State and County costs by eliminating the need for services and benefits due to a pregnancy or sexually transmitted infection or disease. The State funds requested by this proposal could result in additional local flexibility for preventive service provision to youth that increases their well-being and health. Some counties, including Alameda, are providing this type of education to foster youth but face the funding issues described.

Cannabis should be reclassified in order to facilitate research. Removal of cannabis from Schedule 1 will allow for researchers to easily conduct research on its potential medical application without being hindered by stringent United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) security demands. PAGE | 19 Legislative Proposals 2017 Alameda County Discussion/Key Components Researchers face challenging obstacles to studying drugs on Schedule 1. Cannabis can only be used under special government license for research. There are additional stringent criteria in the approval process by the DEA and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for trials. Researchers who want to conduct cannabis research must submit to lengthy application processes that can last years, pass numerous review processes, and purchase the cannabis from the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) to conduct the research. The research is limited by the THC potency level in NIDA cannabis which is lower than cannabis products used by patients. Furthermore, as a Schedule 1 drug, it is more difficult to obtain federal research grants compared to substances on Schedules 2 and 3. Benefits Removal of cannabis from Schedule 1 will allow researchers to easily conduct research on its potential medical application without being hindered by stringent DEA security demands. The ultimate outcome for expanding research of cannabis is to analyze its medicinal properties so we further understand its health benefits and effects.

The Supplemental Poverty Measure differs from the official poverty measure in that it accounts for differences in the cost of living across the country. The high cost of housing in California contributes to the high poverty rate. Fair Market Rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Alameda County increased over $6,000 per year between 2015 and 2016. Wages have not kept pace with growing costs and families continue to struggle to make ends meet. During the recession, the State slashed funding for core health and human services programs (cutting over $ 15 billion between 2008 and 2013). There have been some restorations over the past few years but too many core public services are underfunded following years of deep cuts. The State and federal government should restore cuts to safety-net programs and make strategic enhancements to better serve individuals and families. Alameda County Poverty and Hunger In 2015, 11.4 percent of Alameda County residents (approx. 183,200 individuals) lived below the official poverty line. The rates are even higher for children, with 13.6 percent (approx. 46,300 children) living in poverty. The Alameda County Community Food Bank estimates that one in three children in Alameda County face the threat of hunger every day. Safety-Net Programs A recent California Poverty Measure report found that social safety net programs helped keep almost three million California residents out of deep poverty (half the federal poverty level) and moderated the impact of poverty, especially for children. Safety net benefits such as CalFresh (food stamps), CalWORKs, and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) are critical resources to help meet basic needs. Cost of Living According to the Self-Sufficiency Standard, an adult with two children in Alameda County would need to work 40 hours per week at $31.40 per hour ($66,326 annually) to cover basic costs for housing, food, health care, transportation, child care, and taxes. This is equivalent to more than three full-time jobs at the California minimum wage. For comparison, the federal poverty level for a family of three was $20,160 in 2016. Early Care and Education High-quality, affordable child care is out of reach for many California families. Research from the California Budget and Policy Center finds that on average, a single mother in Alameda County would have to spend over 60 percent of her income to afford center-based child care for two children. Access to quality early care and education is critical for children, especially those living in poverty. Research shows that a child's exposure to high-quality preschool and early learning opportunities contributes to higher academic achievement, increased high school graduation rates, and greater readiness for college and careers. Aging Adults and Individuals with Disabilities Based on data from the California Department of Finance, the Alameda County adult population aged 65 and above is projected to increase over 40 percent in the next 10 years. According to the California Elder Economic Security Index (a county-specific measure of the minimum income necessary to cover basic needs for retired older adults), about a half of seniors lack adequate resources to meet their basic needs. In addition, according to 2015 Census data, 19.5 percent of individuals with disabilities in Alameda County live below the federal poverty line. During the recession, State funding for aging adults and individuals with disabilities was severely cut. Racial Wealth Gap The racial wealth gap in the U.S. is staggering. A 2016 study by CFED (Corporation for Enterprise Development) and PAGE | 22 Policy Overview 2017 Alameda Countythe Institute for Policy Studies found that if average Black family wealth continues to grow at the same pace it has over the past three decades, it would take Black families 228 years to amass the same amount of wealth White families have today. For the average Latino family, it would take 84 years. Without assets, families do not have a cushion in case of emergency, nor can they plan for the future by purchasing a home, sending their kids to college, or starting a business. In addition to the millions of families who live below the federal poverty line, Alameda County has a large number of families who are one illness, job loss, or other crisis away from poverty. Policies should promote savings and wealth building. Need to Restore and Invest Alameda County supports public policies that strengthen the social safety net for the most vulnerable while also investing in our future. Specifically, the County supports policies that provide high-quality early care and learning experiences for children; help aging adults and those living with disabilities live healthier, more independent, and more engaged lives; educate and develop our workforce; make strategic investments in places and neighborhoods with the highest need; encourage and support savings and wealth-building; and promote the economic and social well-being of individuals, families, neighborhoods, and communities. The Human Services Chapters outline a policy agenda for advancing economic prosperity and equity so that all individuals, children, and families have the opportunity to succeed. HEALTH 32478558-bda5-465d-94e4-1183409d1251 Health, disease and death are not randomly or evenly distributed. Illness concentrates among low-income people, people of color, and people with disabilities residing in certain geographical places. Inequities in economic, social, physical and service environments continue to create and maintain clear patterns of poor health in Alameda County, statewide, and nationally. PAGE | 23 Policy Overview 2017 Alameda CountyDespite increasing life expectancy for all racial groups, the gap in life expectancy between Blacks and Whites in Alameda County has persisted. In 2012 to 2014, life expectancy at birth for African Americans was seven years less than for Whites. Compared to Asian Americans, the group with the highest life expectancy, African American life expectancy at birth was 12 years less. Similar inequities exist when comparing neighborhoods in Alameda County with the highest poverty levels to those with the lowest poverty levels (see chart below). The geographic concentrations of race, poverty, disability, and poor health reflect a legacy of discrimination and segregation, as well as present day policies and practices that perpetuate unjust and unequal patterns. Due to constant pressures and lack of control over their environment, as well as experiences of racism and discrimination, people living in these high poverty neighborhoods often face a chronic stress response, which over time actually wears down body systems and increases the risk of health conditions like hypertension or diabetes. In order to address the health inequities between different racial and ethnic groups and other subpopulations, policies must be adopted that correct the social and environmental inequities underlining these health outcomes. A core mission of Alameda County's Health Care Services Agency is to eliminate these health and social inequities. Females of all racial/ethnic groups live longer than their male counterparts, over four years on average. As indicated by the data above, the average African American life expectancy is foreshortened. However, when both gender and race/ethnicity are taken into account, the gap widens to almost 17 years, with the average African American male living 71.4 years compared to the average Asian female who lives 88.2 years. PAGE | 24 Policy Overview 2017 Alameda County The ten leading causes of death in Alameda County account for approximately 74% of all deaths. Of these ten leading causes of death in Alameda County, over 90% were caused by chronic diseases including cancer, heart disease, stroke, chronic lower respiratory disease, Alzheimer's, diabetes, hypertension, and liver disease. The table below outlines these ten leading causes of death. Although chronic diseases are among the most prevalent and costly health problems, they are also among the most preventable. Access to prevention and health care services affect chronic disease burden and outcome. To a large PAGE | 25 Policy Overview 2017 Alameda Countydegree, the major chronic diseases-heart disease, cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes\u2014result from our lifestyles and our habits of daily living. Socioeconomic status is also an important determinant of chronic disease risk. People who are poor, have lower levels of education, or are isolated are more likely to engage in a wide array of risk-related behaviors. The social environment influences risk behaviors through the shaping of norms, patterns of social control, or environmental opportunities that determine individual behavior choices. Additionally, the social environment can impact people in ways that go beyond individual behavior choice. These can include factors which individuals may have little control over and can impact the health of entire communities, such as: exposure to environmental hazards, lack of access to quality education, and lack of clean and affordable housing. Alameda County supports policy solutions that address each of these intervention points in order to prevent chronic diseases and reduce their inequitable burden across different racial and ethnic groups, as well as other subpopulations. When looking at the burden of chronic disease it's also important to factor in the issues of mental illness. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) report that people with mental health and substance use conditions die 25 years earlier than the general population mostly due to preventable health conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular, respiratory, or infectious diseases (including HIV). The stigma associated with mental illness often prevents those that are in the most need of treatment, for these preventable diseases, from accessing and utilizing primary care services, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. The life course perspective brings a critical additional lens to this understanding of health, highlighting the importance of ensuring that babies and children live in supportive community environments that will foster optimal health, development, and well-being over the course of their lives. The life course perspective suggests that health disparities do not stem just from differential access to health care but are the result of broad social, economic, and environmental factors that affect one's experiences and opportunities over a lifetime, with the greatest impact occurring during critical periods of development, such as pregnancy, early childhood, and adolescence. However, without the reversal of the cumulative disadvantages and inequities experienced over a lifetime or several lifetimes there will continue to be racial inequities in birth outcomes. Multi-level interventions are needed to address these disparities - both by providing needed services and by advancing systemic change to address the root causes that have shaped the neighborhood conditions where poor health clusters. On the other end of the life spectrum, Alameda County experienced a 54% increase in 60+ populations between 1980 and 2010. Current projections predict that Alameda County will have a senior population of 513,367 by the year 2040. If this projection is accurate, Alameda County will have a 108% increase in the senior population between 2010 and 2040, compared with the 54% increase experienced over the previous 30 years. Disability increases with age as one-third of adults 65 years of age and above in Alameda County live with at least one disability. In Alameda County persons with disabilities are economically vulnerable because they are more likely to live in poverty, have lower incomes, less education and higher housing cost burdens as compared to those without disabilities. In 2015, there were 160,705 persons with a disability representing nearly 10% of the Alameda County population. African Americans have the highest percentage of persons with a disability in Alameda County (17%) followed by American Indian/Alaskan Natives (15%) and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (13%). Regarding utilization of health care services, persons with disabilities in Alameda County were more likely to receive medical care in emergency departments and were more likely to delay seeing a physician and obtaining prescription medication in the past year than those without disabilities. In addition, in Alameda County persons with disabilities reported higher prevalence of heart disease, high blood pressure, asthma and diabetes compared to those without disabilities. Persons with disabilities also reported high prevalence of obesity and smoking compared to those without disabilities. Finally, those with disabilities were more likely to have experienced a serious mental health issue in the past year than those without disabilities. Access to prevention and healthcare services are paramount to addressing these health care disparities. Implementation of the Affordable Care Act provides a historic opportunity to provide access to preventative health PAGE | 26 Policy Overview 2017 Alameda Countyservices to previously underserved populations. California and Alameda County have led the country in aggressively implementing the ACA. However, many challenges still lie ahead to ensure that all those who can benefit from the new law are able to do so. This includes a need to expand the number of primary care providers and to increase the Medi-Cal reimbursement rate to ensure access to care for all Medi-Cal beneficiaries. Additionally, certain Alameda County residents, such as undocumented immigrants, will not benefit from the new law. Continued legislative action will be needed to ensure that no one falls through the cracks of our healthcare system. Additional challenges remain due to budget cuts at both the state and federal levels that have occurred over the last several years. These cuts disproportionately impacted our most vulnerable populations including people with disabilities, seniors, and low-income children and adults. Some efforts have been made to address funding losses, but additional funding and reinvestment of lost services is necessary to preserve the safety net system of care. Alameda County supports policies that allow everyone, no matter who they are, where they live, how much money they make, their ability, or the color of their skin, to have access to the same opportunities to lead a healthy, fulfilling and productive life. The following legislative priorities proposals reflect this vision. ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH bc87fb1e-a429-471d-8588-db9fd9c4a7be The Mission of Alameda County's Environmental Health department is to protect the Health, Safety and Well-Being of residents in the County through promotion of Environmental Quality and Food Safety. This is accomplished through the following regulatory and direct service programs: Food Safety: The department enforces the California Retail Food code (Calcode) via a vigorous inspection program for retail food establishments which include; restaurants, markets, bakeries, liquor stores, bars, certified farmers' market, food service at fairs and festivals, catering trucks, hot dog carts, ice cream trucks, produce vehicles, and food vending machines. The food safety program also conducts multi-lingual food safety classes, conducts plan reviews for new and remodeled facilities, and issues permits, investigates complaints and suspected food borne illnesses, and carries-out food recalls. The public is kept informed via a restaurant grading system that requires food facilities including mobile food trucks to display color coded placards issued by the department attesting to a facilities compliance with food safety laws. Hazardous Materials, Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUFT) Spills, Leaks Investigation and Cleanup (SLIC) Local Oversight Programs: Through Memoranda of Understanding with the State of California Department of Toxics Substances Control (DTSC)and the Regional Water Quality Control board, is a Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA) which enforces state law with respect to the Hazardous materials management plan program(HMMP/HMBP), underground storage tank program, tiered permitting program, local oversight SLIC/LUFT program and risk management program in the cities of Alameda, Albany, Castro Valley, Dublin, Emeryville, Oakland, Piedmont, Newark, San Lorenzo, Sunol, and the unincorporated areas of Fremont, Hayward, Livermore, Pleasanton, San Leandro and parts of Byron, Mountain House and Tracy. Solid & Medical Waste: The Department is the Local Enforcement Agency (LEA) for Medical Waste under the Medical Waste Management Act (MWMA) and for Solid Waste disposal laws regulating transfer stations and landfills. The Solid Waste LEA also oversees the management of 42 closed landfills in the county. The Medical Waste program pursuant to a County ordinance regulates tattoo and body art establishments. Land Use (Septic): The Land Use Program administers a local wastewater management program for onsite wastewater treatment systems (OWTS) or septic systems in both unincorporated and incorporated areas of the County under the authority of Chapter 15.18 of the Alameda County General Ordinance Code. OWTS are useful and necessary structures that allow habitation at locations that are removed from centralized wastewater treatment systems. Vector Control and Household Hazardous Waste Service Programs: The Vector Control program's mission is to PAGE | 27 Policy Overview 2017 Alameda Countyprevent and minimize the spread of vector-borne diseases, injury and discomfort to the residents of Alameda County. The program provides assistance to residents and the community as a whole by monitoring and controlling rodent and other disease vectors, assisting residents in mitigating vector infestations on their property, surveillance of vector borne diseases such as West Nile fever and Lyme disease. The Department operates the Household Hazardous Waste program under a MOU with the Alameda County Waste Management Authority, (ACWMA) the JPA charged with AB939 responsibilities for the County with respect to proper handling for Household Hazardous Waste, and CESQG (small business) waste. The program has 4 facilities that accept hazardous waste from the public and small businesses pursuant to state and federal regulations. PUBLIC SAFETY 34e503c6-1c6a-4caa-b74d-1e912d770269 The State of California is decreasing the number of individuals in state prison, thereby increasing pressure on County Public Safety Departments and stretching thin our available resources. Historically, Alameda County has retained individuals locally who have been convicted of low level felonies such as nonsexual, nonviolent, and non serious crimes. The County supports efforts in the area of rehabilitation and programs providing options for incarcerated and/or formerly incarcerated individuals to make safer, healthier and crime free-choices. The County also supports collaborative efforts among government entities, community-based organizations, non-profit entities, and private entities to provide services to reduce the rate of recidivism. Health Care and Other Services Improve Outcomes In keeping with the progressive nature of Alameda County, public safety agencies have formed stronger working relationships with Social Services, Health Care, and the Community Development Agency (particularly in the area of housing) with the aim of helping to reduce poverty and recidivism. Alameda County supports legislation that expands health insurance coverage for individuals who are at risk for incarceration and those who have been incarcerated. As part of Medi-Cal expansion through the Affordable Care Act, over one million Californians became newly eligible for Medi-Cal in 2014 and this expansion means that more previously incarcerated individuals are now eligible for Medi-Cal. This is significant, as more than half of all prison and jail inmates (including 56 percent of state prisoners, 45 percent of federal prisoners and 64 percent of local jail inmates) were found to have mental health problems, according to a study published by the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics. The Medi-Cal expansion makes prevention and early intervention for treatment of mental health problems and substance use more accessible. By being able to access medical treatment for these issues, it directly addresses a major factor that leads to incarceration thereby helping to reduce recidivism. By extension, it is anticipated that this could help Alameda County reduce the number of people cycling through the criminal justice system and also contribute to reducing racial disparities in incarceration frequently correlated with disparate access to treatment. Alameda County supports legislation to assist more people in accessing health coverage and the other public benefits for which they are eligible. The County supports and applauds the repeal of the lifetime drug felony ban for CalWORKs and CalFresh. Beginning in April 2015, individuals with a prior drug felony will now be able to access these critical public benefits to help them stabilize. In addition to cash and nutrition assistance, CalWORKs and CalFresh both offer employment and training support. Restoring access to these benefits will improve outcomes for very vulnerable families and, in turn, could reduce the risks for reoffending. Realignment Alameda County supports legislation that provides more funds for realignment. Realignment is a State initiative that protects the public from being victimized by crime through providing strong opportunities for individuals who have committed crimes to access resources such as education, employment training, substance abuse counseling and mental health services. This aims to reduce criminal behavior and by channeling lower level offenders to community corrections programs strengthened through community-based punishment, improved supervision strategies, and evidence-based practices and supervision practices demonstrated by research to reduce recidivism. It also includes employing proven alternatives to incarceration for low-risk offenders. PAGE | 28 Policy Overview 2017 Alameda CountyAlameda County's realignment plan is managed by the Community Corrections Partnership Executive Committee (CCPEC). The committee is chaired by the Probation Chief, and includes the Sheriff, District Attorney, Public Defender, local Police Chief, Social Services Services Agency Director, and a representative from the Superior Court. The committee provides planning, oversight, implementation, and assessment of realignment in the County. Realignment objectives and goals are accomplished through the expanded use of evidence-based practices and programming that will promote positive behavioral change and outcomes. Individuals in Alameda County convicted of crimes eligible under realignment may receive a term of felony probation, though crimes more serious in nature may see defendants sentenced to local prison. Individuals on probation are supervised by the Alameda County Probation Department, and those sentenced to local prison will continue to serve their prison sentence in Santa Rita county jail under the jurisdiction of the Alameda County Sheriff's Office, and not in state prison under the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Most inmates released from state prison are supervised by Alameda County Probation under Post Release Community Supervision. District Attorney The District Attorney is the only entity that has the constitutional and statutory authority to file criminal charges against an individual. The filing decision is at the discretion of the District Attorney and each case is evaluated at all stages. The District Attorney continues to work with the defense bar, including the Public Defender, to implement programs that provide alternatives to incarceration. The District Attorney has created the Early Intervention Court (EIC) for realignment-eligible individuals charged with low-level felony crimes. The EIC refers individuals to programs after they are out of custody. The District Attorney also collaborates with pre-trial release organizations to divert eligible individuals charged with misdemeanors from being formally charged and/or having their cases dismissed after successful completion of a program. The District Attorney will continue to effectively negotiate with the Public Defender and defense attorneys to identify alternatives to incarceration through formal felony probation. The District Attorney's office has documented that the use of felony probation has been effective, with an average of a 27 percent recidivism rate. The Public Defender and District Attorney continue to meet and navigate processes and protocols to provide early termination of formal probation and Clean Slate programs that will allow convictions to be set aside under appropriate circumstances. When an individual on felony probation, Post Release Community Supervision, or Parole is alleged to have committed a new offense, the District Attorney has the option of filing new charges and a violation, or solely filing a revocation petition. The District Attorney has similar power to revoke Post Release Community Supervision and Mandatory Supervision. The District Attorney's Office staffs the courts that handle these revocation proceedings. Alameda County Family Justice Center (ACFJC) In June 2015, the Alameda County Family Justice Center celebrated its tenth year serving victims of crime. Created by the District Attorney's Office, the ACFJC serves victims of domestic violence and their children, victims of sexual assault, elder abuse, and human trafficking. Since the inception of the ACFJC, more than 115,000 people have been served. The ACFJC, under the leadership of the District Attorney's Office, has introduced several initiatives including: STEP-UP (Survivor Training Empowerment Program - Utilizing your Potential): A women's empowerment and independence program for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. STEP-UP also serves as a diversion program for women charged with public assistance fraud. Natalie's Nook: A 1-2-3 Read program for children who have witnessed interpersonal violence. The program also provides counseling and child-youth engagement services. Youth The District Attorney's Office is committed to utilizing alternative methods to serve youth in the Juvenile Justice System. As an alternative to pursuing criminal charges, the District Attorney's Office partners with the non-profit Community Works in comprehensive restorative justice programs. The District Attorney's Office has a robust PAGE | 29 Policy Overview 2017 Alameda CountyTruancy Mediation Program that includes the Truancy Family Court Program. Additionally, the Office participates in Girls Court and the Mental Health Court for Youth. Additionally, we recognize the need for gender-specific restorative justice programs to best serve the needs of the participating youth. Two of these programs are 'My Life, My Choice' (providing alternatives to detention that specifically link young men to mentors and career paths) and the Young Women's Saturday Program (an educational and counseling program for young women who have been commercially sexually exploited, or are at risk for being exploited). Alameda County supports more programs and opportunities for youth. Law enforcement entities within the county have already created opportunities for youth to help foster a positive view of law enforcement and provide them with valuable work experience. For example, the Alameda County District Attorney's Office has a program for youth called the District Attorney's Justice Academy (DAJA). This program provides youth (aged 16 to 18) with the opportunity to learn about the justice system by participating in educational seminars and paid internships. DAJA Students are placed in a paid internship in a legal or government office to gain work experience and different skills required in the professional workforce. Violence Prevention Alameda County supports budgetary and legislative actions that address the root causes of all forms of violence, improve public safety, shift resources from incarceration to prevention, and benefit communities disproportionately affected by violence (including low-income communities, communities of color, and people with disabilities). Alameda County is committed to pursuing solutions that recognize the impact of mental health, drug use, and poverty on those involved in, or at risk of involvement in, the criminal justice system. Alameda County opposes legislation that focuses on suppression strategies that do not ameliorate root causes and risk factors, unless they are balanced by primary prevention support. Alameda County defines violence as intimate partner violence, family violence, gun violence, gang violence, suicide, homicide, commercial sexual exploitation of minors, youth violence, hate violence, sexual assault, as well as child and elder abuse. Alameda County defines public safety as efforts that promote crime prevention and reduction, collaborative and positive community-law enforcement relationships, non-violent conflict resolution, restorative justice, successful reintegration of people with criminal convictions into communities, living wage jobs, educational opportunities, affordable housing, and the protection of all community members' civil rights. In 2005, Alameda County adopted a Violence Prevention Blueprint that identifies and elevates prevention strategies that address the root causes and risk factors for violence, critical for improving public safety. In 2009 the Violence Prevention Initiative (VPI), established to implement the Blueprint strategies, focused on building assets, resiliency among youth, families and those reentering the community from incarceration, as well as ensuring capacity building with community partners. While prevention strategies are expensive in the short-term, we expect long-term savings from the investment in our community. Ultimately, investing state and federal resources in preventing and breaking the cycle of violence will save our county and community money. Violence is an issue that impacts all sectors of our community, but it disproportionately impacts low-income communities, communities of color and people with disabilities. As a result, resources and legislation for preventing violence and protecting public safety should prioritize these specific communities. PLANNING LAND USE AND HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT d5fad467-37f2-48a0-8d63-f3785d0efc5c The County proposes policies that foster the health and well-being of all individuals and communities by supporting and developing a built environment that promotes economic and other opportunities for residents, contributes to health, and encourages modes of transportation that reduce greenhouse gases (GHG). The \"built environment\" refers to the human made surroundings that provide the setting for human activity, such as roads, buildings, sidewalks, farms, or parks. Such legislation would seek to reduce the use of car trips, prevent displacement, reduce pollution, reduce greenhouse gases, improve access to public transportation, improve safety, increase the supply of affordable housing, make communities walkable and bikeable, and increase access to parks, green space, grocery PAGE | 30 Policy Overview 2017 Alameda Countystores, community/school gardens and farmers' markets. These efforts improve housing conditions, supply, and affordability, which add to the economic vitality of households and make communities safer and more vibrant, and strengthen community interaction. Affordable housing has a positive community impact enhancing housing stability, employment, mental and physical health, and school attendance. Affordable housing also reduces active substance use, criminal justice recidivism, and other negative community impacts. Many communities in California are exploring and developing community choice energy programs, termed Community Choice Aggregation, community-based energy programs or public utility. As an alternative to Investor Owned Utilities (IOUs), community choice programs can be more effective in creating green/renewable energy with more local economic development impact. Legislation should not be supported that limits the ability of local governments to create energy procurement programs. Roadblocks should not be put in place to benefit the status quo, and new laws should promote the creation of more renewable energy, limit use of fossil fuels, and allow for more energy efficiency programs. TRANSPORTATION d17b5f98-141d-4f74-a605-dfcea06e22fc Alameda County is responsible for the planning, implementation, and maintenance of transportation infrastructure in unincorporated areas, including the design, construction, and maintenance of roadways, bridges, pedestrian facilities, bicycle facilities, and traffic control facilities. The County strives to provide, maintain, and preserve public infrastructure in an efficient and effective manner while promoting a healthy and sustainable environment that supports safe and livable communities. Funding Shortfall An aging infrastructure, rising construction costs, new regulatory requirements, and reduced revenues contribute to a funding shortfall. Other factors, such as heavier vehicles, better vehicle fuel efficiency, increasing traffic and accommodation of alternative modes of transportation like public transit, bicyclists and pedestrians, also place increased demands on roads. New sustainable sources of revenues must be created, and a significant portion should be focused on preservation of the existing roadway network and improving safety for non-motorized users. Once the system is in a state of good repair, the need for maintenance will be reduced. Adequate funding is critical to both ongoing maintenance of and improvements to the transportation infrastructure to provide safe and convenient travel along and across streets for all users, including motorists, emergency vehicles, pedestrians, bicyclists, public transportation, and emergency vehicles. This also meets the needs of people with disabilities, transportation of freight, including commercial goods which supports local jobs. With increasing fuel efficiency and the introduction of hybrid and electric vehicles, revenues from the Gas Tax, the primary source for transportation infrastructure maintenance and project delivery, are expected to continue to decline. The leveraging power of existing revenue streams continues to decline, while budget constraints have delayed needed maintenance and improvements. Legislative Priorities State legislative priorities for the transportation program include supporting any method of increasing the gas tax and alternative methods of increasing transportation revenues through a variety of sources including, but not limited to, fuel taxes, Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT) fees, Vehicle License Fees (VLF). Additional priorities include supporting any legislation which increases roadway safety, particularly in rural areas and school zones, and improves bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure throughout Alameda County. Ensuring the financial integrity of the Highway Trust Fund for the future is the highest federal legislative priority for Alameda County. Additional federal priorities include protecting identified revenue allocation structures in the implementation of the transportation reauthorization bill to ensure increased and stable funding for the nation's PAGE | 31 Policy Overview 2017 Alameda Countytransportation infrastructure. Alameda County also supports legislative remedies to streamline regulatory burdens and improve regulatory inefficiencies which continue to hinder the effective and timely delivery of transportation projects. To achieve those goals, Alameda County supports advocating for funding support to provide adequate staffing at the local, State, and federal regulatory agencies. Alameda County also supports legislative priorities set forth by the California State Association of Counties (CSAC), County Engineer's Association of California (CEAC), the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC), and Alameda County Transportation Commission (ACTC) which benefit transportation and infrastructure improvements in the unincorporated areas of Alameda County. EDUCATION c506f085-4f38-43ec-876d-385e93d9d58d Ensuring high quality educational opportunities and access for all residents across the life course are vital to the achievement of the County's vision of being one of the best counties in which to live, work and do business and are essential to our shared and individual prosperity and health. Despite the large array of educational resources in this County, and the recent improvements in reducing disparities in educational outcomes in some school districts, there is still a persistent racial and socio-economic gap in educational outcomes. In part, educational performance and attainment gaps stem from a differential access to high-quality educational opportunities which are rooted in long-term, national patterns of underfunding early childhood programs and schools serving low-income youth and youth of color. A student's path toward high school graduation and future economic security is set even before a child starts school, and therefore support for academic success must begin during the critical prenatal and early childhood periods. Access to quality early childhood education, Pre-K, transitional kindergarten and kindergarten are vital building blocks for students from birth to eight years and are important to educational attainment, achievement and health outcomes for all children, particularly boys of color. Research shows that positive education results are strongly correlated with access to early childhood programs; Pre- Kindergarten (Pre-K) education, especially for low-income children of color, effectively decreases future special education placement, improves grade retention, and increases high school graduation and college attendance. However, nationally, publicly funded Pre-K or Head Start programs are underfunded and do not meet enrollment needs. In the County, at least 3,000 preschool-aged children who qualify for financial assistance for family child care remain on waiting lists due to lack of funding according to an analysis of 2014-2015 data by the Early Care and Education Planning Council. In California, African American and Latino students are significantly more likely than Whites and Asians to attend schools facing critical resource challenges, which include lack of competitive salaries to attract experienced, highly credentialed teachers and discourage teacher turnover; shortages of educational materials; rundown facilities; fewer resources for English language learners and undocumented students, and a lack of parent engagement programs. From a very early age, many County youth, specifically low-income youth of color, are exposed to trauma and violence at home and in their communities. This exposure to Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) contributes significantly to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, anxiety and depressive disorders, chronic health conditions, and results in barriers to learning. A safe and healthy environment that protects the community from stress, violence and poverty from the prenatal period and onward is essential for academic success. This is particularly true for boys of color, who from early childhood, experience some of the most significant disparities in health and education outcomes. Additionally, measures that support student health also impact educational attainment. There is a strong need to improve the identification of students with disabilities and to provide supports for these students. In California students with disabilities continue to rank among the lowest in the nation in math and reading assessments. School attendance impacts academic performance and likelihood of graduation. High poverty neighborhoods have higher rates of students chronically absent from school (missing 10 percent or more school days) compared to affluent PAGE | 32 Policy Overview 2017 Alameda Countyneighborhoods. Student absenteeism also impacts school district income from the State which is based on attendance, and further erodes the school's ability to meet the educational and social needs of students. Although great strides to address educational disparities in the County have been made, significant, persistent gaps in academic achievement and opportunity still exist throughout the County. As a result, there is a need for continued investment in education for all County school districts, especially in programs that serve our highest needs students and low-income students of color, particularly boys of color. IMMIGRATION 5606a49e-e239-4bcf-a70b-12389966a79d According to the Immigration Policy Center, 1 in 4 Californians is an immigrant (foreign-born). In Alameda County, the percentage of the population is even higher, as 30.8% of our residents are foreign born. Of the 10.2 million immigrants in California, 45.6% are naturalized US citizens. Immigrants and their adult, US born children account for 28.9% of all California voters. In addition, immigrants are a major part of the California economy, comprising 34.6% of the California workforce and paying roughly $30 billion in federal taxes, $5.2 billion in state income taxes, and $4.6 billion in sales taxes each year. Immigrants' have an integral role in California's economic and social fabric, and policies that support California's immigrant populations support the overall well-being of California. Ra\u00fal Hinojosa-Ojeda, founding director of the North American Integration and Development Center at the University of California, Los Angeles, estimates that within the first three years of a legalization program for undocumented immigrants now in the country, the wages of undocumented California workers would increase by $26.9 billion, generating an additional $5.3 billion in tax revenue and creation of 633,000 new jobs. All of California would benefit from the boost that a path to legal status would provide. California and the nation are weakened without immigration reform. The current system is expensive - the federal government has spent an estimated $186.8 billion on immigration enforcement since the last major immigration reform in 1986. The current system also places the health of immigrants and the broader community at risk. According to the U.S. Border Patrol, between 1998 and 2012, 5,570 migrants died crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in the quest to reach family members and jobs. Furthermore, policies that increase stress and anxiety damage the physical and mental health of immigrants, whether they are authorized residents or not. Fear of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement also increases immigrants' vulnerability to crime and violence and decreases public safety overall. Additionally, barriers to health care access for immigrant populations leads to decreased health care utilization and results in sicker people while placing serious strains on emergency care systems. In California, Alameda County is home to the second highest percentage of immigrants fleeing from violence and sexual abuse in their country of origin (after Los Angeles). This number continues to rise and includes unaccompanied immigrant youth (UIY), immigrant adults and families with children who have made the dangerous journey across borders to flee extreme violence in their home countries. The majority of UIY in the U.S. come from Central America where gang violence is prevalent and boys as young as six years old are routinely targeted to join gangs or risk being killed. Young girls are often targeted for sexual abuse or exploitation. Many UIY and immigrant adults and families have experienced or witnessed violence including: kidnappings, beatings, arson, rape, extortion, murder of loved ones, and are fleeing extreme persecution and abuse. As a result, some have attempted suicide. Once detained in the US, UIY face many challenges including finding legal representation for immigration proceedings (they do not have a right to an appointed attorney), identifying a sponsor as a prerequisite for release from juvenile detention. Additional hardships include low levels of educational attainment and few employment opportunities. Displacement from their countries of origin, in combination with the challenging processes of acculturation, including socio-economic integration, lack of resources, difficulty finding affordable housing and restricted access to health care puts young people and immigrant families in situations of extreme social vulnerability. Issues of access to mental and physical health care, coupled with the physiological consequences of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE), results in an increased risk for health disparities over the lifespan. PAGE | 33 Policy Overview 2017 Alameda CountyJOBS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 6b90f49d-37ce-4d30-bf6d-11743bdcae4c Alameda County has emerged from the recession with a steady recovery; the unemployment rate in July 2016 was down to 4.8 percent. However, the effects of the economic recovery are not being felt by all workers. Unemployment rates remain higher for African Americans and Latinos (9.6 percent and 6.8 percent, respectively statewide as of July 2016). Many of the new jobs created during the recovery are low-wage jobs that offer little or no opportunity for advancement. Additionally, women, and especially women of color, are more likely to have low-paying jobs. A large share of a low-income worker's earnings goes to paying rent, which makes it difficult to get ahead. In Alameda County, a worker would need the equivalent of four full-time jobs at minimum wage to afford a two-bedroom apartment. Stagnant wages combined with rising local rents are contributing to the mass displacement of communities that once were firmly rooted in Alameda County. Poverty and unemployment continue to disproportionately impact people of color across our County. According to a 2014 data report by Alameda County Public Health Department, in Alameda County, 1 in 15 White residents live in high-poverty neighborhoods compared to one in nine Asians, one in four Latinos, and one in three Black residents. Deeply concentrated and persistent poverty has been exacerbated by State and federal policies that destabilized entire families and neighborhoods. In the face of long-standing disinvestment, residents in high poverty neighborhoods face limited job availability, transportation barriers, few child care options, and the lack of quality education and training opportunities. There is a lack of resources and opportunities for stable employment that offers a living wage and benefits. Fewer economic resources often mean tradeoffs between paying for food, housing, or healthcare. All of these economic factors at the individual and community level contribute to a clear social gradient in health and well- being. On average, there is a seven year difference in life expectancy between the most and least affluent neighborhoods in the County. This gap is even starker in some cities; it rises to 15 years when comparing the historically disinvested neighborhood of West Oakland to the affluent Oakland Hills. Access to an educated, skilled, and healthy workforce is critical to the economic vitality of our local communities, State, and country. Persistent inequity puts us at a competitive disadvantage. Investment is needed in education, job creation, economic development, workforce programs, youth employment opportunities, and programs that help alleviate barriers to work. Alameda County supports State and federal policies that make strategic investments to bolster community economic development and help create shared prosperity and collective well-being. The Jobs and Economic Development Chapters detail a State and federal policy agenda for advancing economic equity in Alameda County. FLOOD CONTROL AND WATER RESOURCES 6f2dc39a-fb53-4118-a51f-30c07f8f1e8e Much of Alameda County is in a flood plain. Prior to the 1950's, large portions of the County flooded repeatedly resulting in closed businesses and schools, interrupted transportation and utility services, and even deaths. In 1949, the State Legislature created Alameda County Flood Control and Water Conservation District (the \"District\"). The District designed and constructed flood control infrastructure assuming full build-out of the County. Cities and unincorporated areas, grouped by \"zones\" corresponding to area watersheds and community boundaries, joined the District to gain protection from devastating floods. The District's flood control infrastructure \u2014 a system of pump stations, erosion control structures, dams, and hundreds of miles of pipeline, channels, levees, and creeks \u2014 protects nine zones in western Alameda County stretching from Emeryville to Fremont. Work continues to upgrade or replace aging equipment, keep flood control channels clear of silt and debris, and evaluate the impact of new developments on creeks and channels. PAGE | 34 Policy Overview 2017 Alameda CountyTo ensure continued protection from flooding and to protect its natural resources, Alameda County supports legislative remedies aimed at increasing funding for restoration projects and developing adaptive strategies to deal with climate change and sea level rise. Furthermore, regulatory inefficiencies continue to hamper the effective and timely delivery of flood control projects. Delivery of projects is often bogged down by the multiple and mostly redundant approval processes and long time frames, including environmental clearance and mitigation, design approval, right of way certification, and project financing. To this end, Alameda County seeks legislative remedies to streamline regulatory burdens and advocate for funding to support adequate staffing at the local, State, and federal regulatory agencies. PAGE | 35 Policy Overview 2017 Alameda CountyState Legislative Priorities 770200ed-326c-408d-8525-6df802bdbbdd PAGE | 36HUMAN SERVICES 7a78aa65-e777-4c58-b6cc-4efee3ef61a0 CREATE A HUMAN SERVICES SYSTEM THAT IS RESPONSIVE TO COMMUNITY NEEDS 6e2165ce-9e77-4d3b-bf76-01bbf83f63fb Low-income individuals and families need restoration of critical benefits, increased flexibility, expansion of programs that work, and the simplification/streamlining of processes and systems to ensure they are able to access all the benefits for which they are eligible. Alameda County supports public policies that strengthen the social safety net for the most vulnerable while also advancing economic prosperity and equity so that all individuals, children, and families have the opportunity to succeed. Better Facilitate Access to Benefits Streamline and integrate public assistance benefits enrollment. Support policies and systems that make it easier for individuals and families to have access to, apply for, utilize, retain, and recertify for benefits, including CalWORKs, CalFresh, General Assistance, and Medi-Cal. Maintain continuity of benefits . Enact policies that help individuals and families maintain coverage and benefits. Specifically, we support automatic renewals for families living on a fixed income or households who are highly unlikely to experience changes in income that could terminate eligibility. Whenever possible, benefit renewal dates should be aligned across different programs to make it easier for clients. Support technological advancements that promote access to services and administrative efficiencies. Promote and utilize technology to streamline benefits enrollment, such as auto-enrolling clients and encouraging the use of self-service tools. Expand and leverage data-sharing agreements. Improve policies and systems to make it easier for agencies to share data to better serve clients. Focus on Effective Implementation and Staff Training Reasonable timelines and funding for implementation of new policies/procedures. The State should work with stakeholders, including counties, when determining timelines and funding for rolling out new policies and procedures. Ensure there is a training region for computer systems. Staff trainers need the ability to create test cases to avoid breaching confidentiality when teaching workers. The State should make sure there is a dedicated training region for each of the systems used for human services programs. Include training funding as part of new laws/changes. Standardize all new laws or changes that impact the practice of human services programs to include training funding. Resources to train staff are vital to successful implementation of program changes. Create a statewide workgroup for trainers/staff development managers. This forum would allow for sharing across the State on best practices and facilitate better collaboration. Increase Access to Safe, Affordable Housing Increase supports for affordable housing and homelessness prevention. Alameda County supports a range of policies and programs that prevent and resolve homelessness and housing instability. We support evidence- based programs, including housing first, rapid re-housing, long-term housing subsidies, and models that include wrap-around transitional housing and housing support services. Additionally, we support polices to end housing discrimination. Increase supports and services for individuals and families experiencing homelessness. Alameda County supports funding and policies that ensure adequate emergency shelter. Investments in supportive housing result in the decreased use of homeless shelters, hospitals, emergency rooms, jails, and prisons. PAGE | 37 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda CountyFor additional homelessness and housing priorities, please see the Planning, Land Use, and Housing and Community Development Chapter. Better Serve Boys and Men of Color and Fathers Create and expand ladders of opportunity for boys and men of color. President Obama launched the My Brother's Keeper Initiative, which aims to address persistent opportunity gaps faced by boys and young men of color and to ensure that all young people can reach their full potential. Alameda County supports this Initiative and policies and partnerships that focus on addressing critical challenges, risk factors, and opportunities at key life stages to improve long-term outcomes and create ladders of opportunity for all young people. Promote fatherhood and father-friendly practices. Better serving fathers and men as partners in their families and communities results in significant benefits in terms of child development/well-being, public health, community cohesion, and economic development/prosperity. Alameda County supports President Obama's Fatherhood and Mentoring Initiative along with policies to develop demonstration programs to test father- friendly program designs that solicit and facilitate father engagement. Achieve Racial Equity and Advance Opportunities for All Support public policies and practices that eliminate racial disparities and ensure equitable opportunities and better futures for all Alameda County residents. Policies and practices should promote equity and reduce disparities based on race, ethnicity, sovereignty, national origin, immigration status, gender, sexual orientation/gender identity, age, disability status, and socioeconomic status. Policies should address all forms of racism, particularly institutional and structural racism, which have played a central role historically and currently in creating and perpetuating persistent social and health inequities. Promote Economic Stability and Wealth Building Asset building policies and programs include a range of opportunities including matched-saving accounts, homeownership assistance, financial education, free tax preparation, access to affordable financial services, and credit building products and services. Broadening savings and asset ownership opportunities will help move families and individuals from just breaking even to actually getting ahead. Remove asset limits for public assistance benefits. Asset limits create disincentives for low-income families to save money for emergencies. Policies should promote savings and ensure individuals and families do not have to spend down any cushion they have before qualifying for public assistance. Maintain and expand savings programs. Policies should help low-income individuals and families accumulate assets through increased savings and investments. Alameda County supports a variety of savings accounts and incentive programs that are designed to help low-income individuals build assets and opportunities (such as Individual Development Accounts (IDAs), Children's Savings Accounts, and retirement accounts). Restrict payday lending and other predatory financial products and services. Alameda County supports policies that protect consumers from predatory credit products, specifically by prohibiting, or capping rates on, payday loans andpromoting low-cost, consumer friendly, alternatives. Expand the presence of mainstream financial institutions in underserved communities. Many neighborhoods lack access to mainstream financial institutions and instead rely on predatory lenders, such as check cashers, payday lenders, and pawn shops that drain millions of dollars from communities through high fees and usurious loans. Alameda County supports efforts to encourage safe, affordable financial products that protect income and assets. Expand access to credit and capital. Difficulty accessing financial services, affordable credit, and investment capital has long been a problem, especially in low-income and historically disinvested communities. Alameda PAGE | 38 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda CountyCounty supports efforts to help low-income individuals and communities gain access to low-cost financial products and services, high-return savings products, and investment capital that meet the specific needs of economically underserved communities. Protect assets and savings. Alameda County supports policies that preserve assets and protect individuals and families from predatory practices. Specifically, protections for student loan borrowers and policies that promote access to education, lessen student debt burdens, and make loan repayment more manageable. Defaulting on a student loan can ruin a borrower's credit and impact future opportunities. Promote retirement savings . Less than half of California's private sector workers have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan. Alameda County supports State and federal policies that promote retirement savings that make it easier to save. Expand State tax credits for low-income and foster families. \u00b0 Expand the State Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). California should expand the State version of the EITC to reduce the regressive tax burden on the working poor, put more money in their pockets, and make saving for the future possible. \u00b0 Restore the refundable portion of the Tax Credit for Child and Dependent Care Expenses. In 2011, California repealed the refundable portion of the Tax Credit for Child and Dependent Care Expenses (SB 86).This resulted in the loss of a benefit that provided $70 million to California's lowest-income families with children. Alameda County supports restoring the refundable portion of that tax credit. \u00b0 Expand refundable tax credits. More State tax credits (including the Dependent Tax Credit and the Tax Credit for Child and Dependent Care Expenses) should be fully refundable so that all low-income families, even those without a tax liability, can benefit from the credits. \u00b0 Implement a refundable tax credit for foster parents. This tax credit would be in line with the Continuum of Care Reform goal of increasing the availability of home-based care for youth. Reduce or eliminate Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) fees. Low-income California families that receive CalWORKs spend approximately $19 million of their cash benefits each year in out-of-network ATM fees to access the benefits on their EBT cards. Alameda County supports actions that will reduce or eliminate EBT fees. Fund asset building in county social service agencies. Alameda County Social Services Agency has piloted asset building programs for current and former public benefits recipients. These programs provided credit building, financial education, and one-on-one coaching to help individuals and families save money and achieve self-sufficiency. California should consider funding similar efforts and piloting innovations that build off the lessons learned in the asset building field. Invest in Place-Based Initiatives Too many children in our communities are growing up in neighborhoods with no grocery stores, closed parks, and struggling schools. Recognizing that people and place are inextricably linked, place-based initiatives take a comprehensive approach to community development and aim to revitalize multiple aspects of neighborhood to create lasting change for its residents. Promote and expand place-based strategies that concentrate resources and investment in communities with the highest levels of need. Alameda County supports place-based economic investments that increase opportunity in low-income communities and communities of color. A place-based approach should include strategies to bring public benefits and services out into the community and to provide wealth building, wage subsidies, and job supports to residents. PAGE | 39 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda CountyRESTORE AND ENHANCE SAFETY NET PROGRAMS 3a4aae63-8df0-4bfa-8380-66e17a572e22 Strengthen CalWORKs CalWORKs (California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids) provides monthly income assistance and employment-related services aimed at moving children out of poverty and helping families meet basic needs. Alameda County supports a range of policy changes to ensure this safety net program is addressing poverty and promoting financial stability. Increase the CalWORKs Maximum Aid Payment (MAP) and reinstate a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). The suspension of the annual COLA and CalWORKs grant reductions during the recession resulted in grants that are now below 50 percent of the federal poverty level and too small to cover basic necessities. Including recent increases, the current maximum grant is $714/month for a family of three and remains below pre-recession levels. Eliminate the asset test for CalWORKs . Eliminating the asset test altogether would reduce administrative costs and allow staff to spend more time working with clients. At a minimum, the State should eliminate the vehicle asset test for CalWORKs. For low-income working families, having access to a reliable car is critical to finding and maintaining employment and becoming financially stable. Eliminate deprivation for CalWORKs. To be eligible for CalWORKs, the child(ren) in the family must be deemed deprived of parental support. To qualify for deprivation in a two-parent household, the primary wage earner must not have worked more than 100 hours in the past four weeks. This rule creates a disincentive to work and is difficult to administer. The elimination of the deprivation requirement would reduce administrative costs and align CalWORKs rules with the CalFresh and Medi-Cal programs, which no longer have deprivation requirements. Increase CalWORKs earned income disregard. A CalWORKs family's grant decreases as the family earns more income. However, a portion of earned income, known as the \"earned income disregard,\" is excluded from the grant calculation. Alameda County supports policies that increase or modify the earned income disregard to encourage work and allow CalWORKs families to keep more of their earnings, and grant levels to be higher. Increase housing and homelessness assistance for CalWORKs families. Lack of access to safe, affordable housing is a barrier for many CalWORKs families. Alameda County supports policies and programs that expand access, including additional funding for the CalWORKs Housing Support Program and policy changes that allow additional flexibility to meet temporary housing needs. Increase the Welfare-to-Work (WTW) time clock. California currently has a 24-month WTW time clock; however, CalWORKs families often face multiple barriers to achieving steady work that allows for financial stability. Alameda County supports policies that increase flexibility and the time individuals can access education, training, and additional supportive services to pursue sustainably gainful employment. Ensure CalWORKs is focused on alleviating poverty and preventing material hardship among children and families. Alameda County supports policies that help integrate disparate CalWORKs programmatic components into a comprehensive program that is customized to meet the evolving needs of each family, keep children out of poverty, and support parents in reaching financial stability. Increase the CalWORKs 48-month lifetime limit. California is among the more restrictive states with a 48- month lifetime time limit, a full year lower than the federal limit of 60 months. Vulnerable families may need to return to aid due to economic downturns or new family hardships. Alameda County supports policies that ensure benefits are in place when families need support. Support Adults Without Dependents Low-income childless adults are not eligible for most state or federal cash aid programs. A comprehensive PAGE | 40 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countyapproach is needed to strengthen the social safety net for all individuals, including those who are not caring for children. Increase State and federal supports for low-income adults without dependents . Alameda County supports policies that provide increased cash aid, employment assistance, and other supportive services for low-income adults without dependents. Programs should recognize and address barriers to employment while also encouraging participation in the labor market to improve economic well-being. Improve Access to Food Alameda County supports policies and programs that help children, individuals, and families access healthy, nutritious food. Specifically, we support streamlining and strengthening enrollment into CalFresh and ensuring this vital program reaches individuals and families experiencing food insecurity. CalFresh is California's food stamp program [known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) at the federal level], which provides assistance for households to purchase nutritious food. Support efforts to simplify and streamline benefits enrollment. Alameda County supports State efforts and rule changes to streamline and simplify applications and recertifications to enroll more eligible individuals and families in CalFresh. Increase CalFresh outreach and enrollment for older adults. According to the Alameda County Community Food Bank, residents over 50 years old now make up more than one-third of their clients. This need is only expected to increase as older adults are the fastest growing segment of the population in Alameda County. Alameda County supports increased CalFresh outreach and enrollment efforts for seniors along with efforts to increase the minimum benefit allotment (currently $16/month). Support efforts to maintain benefits enrollments and reduce churn in CalFresh. Churn occurs when a client exits and then reenters the program within four months; this process results in a loss of benefits for the individual or family and is costly to both clients and the agencies that administer the program. Alameda County supports policies that help individuals and families maintain benefits. Expand access to summer meals. When school is not in session, many low-income children lose access to free and reduced-price school breakfasts, lunches, and afterschool snacks they rely on during the regular school year. Alameda County supports policies to coordinate and expand access to free meals during the summer months and connect kids to healthy nutrition assistance. Support food banks. Alameda County supports efforts to help local food banks secure nutritious food. Specifically, funding the State Emergency Food Assistance Program and expanding tax credits for food donations. Better Assist Immigrants, Refugees, and Asylees Currently a third of Alameda County residents are foreign-born. The existing system of services and providers who work with immigrants, refugees, and asylees is complicated and can be difficult to navigate and access. As one of eight Refugee-Impacted counties in California, Alameda County recognizes the unique needs of immigrant populations to access services, gain employment, and integrate into their new communities. Increase access to services for immigrants. Alameda County supports the expansion of benefits and services for immigrants, refugees, and asylees. In particular, immigrants need access to basic assistance, including health care and nutrition supports. Additional supports and services for refugees and asylees. Alameda County supports additional State and federal funding to expand services available to refugees and asylees. Specifically, we support increasing Refugee Cash Assistance payment levels, providing homelessness and housing supports, expanding employment and vocational training programs, and increasing other supportive services. For more information, please see the Immigration Chapter. PAGE | 41 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda CountyADVANCE FOSTER YOUTH WELL-BEING AND STRENGTHEN CHILD WELFARE SERVICES 90617e1d-a626-436e-81b4-d9b9862d5709 The Alameda County Social Services Agency's Department of Children and Family Services serves children and youth who have experienced, or are at-risk of experiencing, abuse, or neglect. Enhance Services and Programs Alameda County supports a range of increases in child welfare funding and supportive services to improve the well-being of children. Successfully implement Continuum of Care Reform (CCR) and Resource Family Approval (RFA). As the State moves forward with efforts to move children out of congregate care and into more family-based settings, Alameda County supports continued conversations with stakeholders and ensuring there are adequate county resources to support the transition. Funding is needed to recruit/retain additional care providers, ensure adequate behavioral health services, provide supportive services and resources to families and children, and successfully implement RFA. \u00b0 Ensure that placements are available, fully funded, and supported with services. Specifically, placements need to meet the needs of youth whose plan is to transition to a family-like setting but who currently need a more intensive placement and supportive services. As part of the CCR, California Department of Social Services (CDSS) should pay special attention to youth with special needs, such as those who have experienced commercial sexual exploitation and/or youth struggling with alcohol or other drug addiction \u00b0 Support for local service and program design to reduce the number of placement changes that youth experience. Youth in need of intense and coordinated service delivery often require a level of planning for placement upon their entrance into foster care or when leaving a prior foster home placement that cannot be completed within existing time limits for assessment centers. Exceptions to these time limits are needed in certain circumstances to improve the service and placement planning and delivery process and avoid placement changes for youth. \u00b0 Protect foster youth to make certain that placements meeting their specific needs for care and services are available and willing to accept the youth for placement. Protections and oversight are needed to require Foster Family Agencies (FFAs) and Short-Term Residential Treatment Centers (STRTC) to accept youth who are available for foster care placement when the FFA or STRTC has an available bed and can provide the care and services needed by the youth. \u00b0 Strengthen CCR implementation by developing standards for FFA and STRTC service delivery . These requirements will establish a minimum level of services for foster youth and address inconsistent service provision among providers to meet the needs of foster youth and improve their well-being. Part of a potential solution is to provide Community Care Licensing with additional oversight authority of FFA service provision. \u00b0 Align RFA requirements with existing requirements in the Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children (ICPC) . Amendments are needed to clarify that ICPC expedited placements can be processed as an emergency placement under the rules for RFA. Such a change will help counties continue to comply with the ICPC timeframes and place children according to RFA rules. \u00b0 Promote local agreements between counties and placement providers that deliver safe and caring homes to foster youth. An example is allowing for flexibility that upholds a county's placement agreement with an FFA or STRTC for a youth with high service and care needs that is funded by an amount above statewide rates for FFAs or group homes when no other local placement structured to meet the youth's needs is available. \u00b0 Ensure that all youth are placed with relatives whenever possible. A change to State law is needed to provide a Child Welfare Agency with statutory authority to support changing a foster youth's placement to a relative despite the child having a \"stable\" placement in foster care with a non-relative, at any stage of dependency. Such a change recognizes that permanency with a relative over a non-relative is in the long- PAGE | 42 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countyterm best interests of the child. Funding for services and income supports needed by parents seeking to reunify with their children who are in foster care. This could include: \u00b0 Funding for child care and housing \u00b0 Additional funding and policies to support the availability and quality of substance abuse programs for parents. Specifically, support of substance abuse family residential programs that allow for 1) an entire family, including both parents, to reside together, and 2) single fathers to reside in the program with their child(ren). Typically, residential programs do not allow the family to remain together, which causes additional trauma to children who must separate from one or both parents. Additional resources that could promote better outcomes for children . Examples include culturally relevant mental health services, educational supports, employment/linked learning opportunities, matched-savings accounts, developmental child care (including post-permanency), respite services for relative and foster caregivers, services and resources promoting father engagement, housing subsidies, and improved mental health service delivery to foster youth through the increased availability of licensed clinicians trained in empirically-based treatments for youth who have experienced trauma. The continued provision of flexible funding through the Title IV-E Waiver. The waivers have enabled counties to increase the use of community services to prevent child abuse and neglect and divert families away from formal child welfare services.This has increased permanence for children through strategies like family finding and engagement. Strengthen policies, services, and other resources to address the disproportionate presence of African American, Latino, and Native American children in foster care. Support leadership and funding to improve conditions in low-income communities of color that contain high levels of unemployment, crime, homelessness, substance abuse, and disproportionate experiences with the child welfare system. Increase funding to support counties in monitoring and providing services to foster youth who are authorized by the court to receive psychotropic medications. The children served by the foster care system have experienced severe trauma; for some, medication is appropriate when thoughtfully prescribed as part of an overall treatment plan that includes non-pharmacological interventions as well. Alameda County supports additional funding for behavioral health services for youth and to support counties in providing oversight and monitoring of psychotropic medications prescribed to foster youth. Expand child welfare funding and resources to populations with unique needs: \u00b0 Youth in foster care who are also parents. Parenting foster youth are in particular need of services that promote their educational attainment, parenting skills, and resources that support their transition to independence. \u00b0 Children of foster youth. Provide resources and supports for children of foster youth. In particular, Alameda County supports continuing to provide resources, including but not limited to an Infant Supplement, while the parent is temporarily away from placement but still caring for their child (for instance when they are living in a shelter). This change will help ensure food and other basic necessities to the infant until they both return to an eligible foster setting. \u00b0 Undocumented children of undocumented parents who are under child welfare supervision. Additional resources are needed to ensure that these families receive the necessary services to prevent the child from entering into or remaining in foster care. \u00b0 Families who speak a language other than English. Resources are needed to support counties in hiring additional bilingual staff to provide assistance to children and families in their preferred language. \u00b0 Support for children of incarcerated parents. Additional funding and programs that promote the health, safety, and well-being of the children of incarcerated parents and the efforts of parents to reunify with their children are needed. \u00b0 Parents and children with disabilities. Foster children with disabilities, their parents, and their caregivers need additional support to navigate systems and services that may meet their developmental, educational, and medical needs. Disabled parents also may need additional resources and support to access needed PAGE | 43 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countyservices. \u00b0 Commercially Sexually Exploited Children (see section below). Establish Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits for all eligible foster youth and allow those benefits to remain in suspense for the duration of their stay in foster care. Current law leads to situations where foster youth who are both disabled and from impoverished backgrounds risk being dropped from, or not able to access, SSI even though they meet other eligibility criteria. Alameda County supports policy changes that ensure all foster youth who are eligible can apply for SSI benefits and maintain their SSI eligibility throughout their involvement in foster care, without the need for an annual temporary suspension of the Title IV-E or federal payment. Support agreements with consulates and foreign governments for the protection of foster youth. Statewide agreements with foreign consulates and governments are needed to enhance the services provided to minors and their parents when the parent or child is a foreign national. These agreements should clarify the responsibilities between parties to protect the safety of minors during custody and dependency proceedings involving minors who have experienced abuse or neglect. Support Caregivers and Provide Permanency for Foster Youth Increase funding for foster and adoptive parent recruitment, training, and retention . Alameda County encourages additional support, funding, and other resources designed to increase the number of qualified caregivers available to provide stable and loving foster and adoptive homes. These changes will help to address what licensed foster parents and relative caregivers often cite as critical factors in deciding whether or not to serve as a foster parent: inadequate reimbursement rates, high costs of child care, and the lack of supportive services. Examples of potential supports and resources include: \u00b0 Increased funding for subsidized child care and respite care \u00b0 Funding for one-time expenses, such as a bed \u00b0 Specialized training and targeted support services, including those that offer in-home based services, for caregivers of foster youth with acute mental health needs or commercially sexually exploited children \u00b0 A statewide public education campaign to promote interest in foster parenting \u00b0 A refundable tax credit for foster parents Expand funding for post-placement services to support permanence for children who have left foster care through reunification, adoption, or guardianship. Policies should help maintain the child in their home and prevent reentry to foster care. For example, housing and child care assistance to help parents provide a safe and stable environment as well as supervision for their child(ren) while they are at work or school. There are limited housing and child care slots available through existing resources, and additional resources should be targeted specifically to these families. Other examples include substance abuse treatment and mental health services that are culturally responsive to the child and the adoptive parent or guardian. Provide Kin-GAP benefits to children whose relative guardianship was established in Probate Court . Although Probate Court guardianships with a non-relative can be eligible for Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) Foster Care payments, relative guardianships established in Probate Court do not qualify for Kin-GAP, even though many of these children have needs similar to youth who have a guardianship established in Juvenile Court. Providing Kin-GAP benefits to these probate guardianship youth will improve their transition to adulthood and may reduce their need for social services as an adult. Remove barriers to legal guardianship for youth. Current law doesn't allow for guardianships by Non- Relative Extended Family Members (NREFMs) and non-related foster parents for youth under age six. Alameda County supports providingstatutory authorization for courts to establish guardianships when a NREFM is the caregiver to a child under age six or to a child within a sibling group with at least one sibling under age six, whenever the child is unable to return to their parent's or guardian's care. The intent of this change is not to divert children away from adoption but instead provide as many options available as possible to provide legal permanence for foster children. PAGE | 44 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda County Continued support for policies and resources that meet the needs of LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning) foster youth. Alameda County encourages additional laws and policies, such as SB 731 (Statutes of 2015), that promote the protections of rights of foster youth who are LGBTQ. Resources are also needed to further the recruitment and retention of resource families that will provide effective care for LGBTQ youth. Support the enhancement and strengthening of connections between foster youth and persons in their support network. Additional resources and improved policies are needed that help maintain networks of service providers, family, and friends that serve the best interests of foster youth, even though they are not the parent or resource parent to the youth.These support networks are vital to the health and well-being of foster youth. Allow for continued benefits after age 18 for all former foster youth who exited from foster care to a guardianship prior to their 18th birthday. Current law limits eligibility for these benefits based on the youth's age at the time the guardianship was established. These limits have created a disincentive for permanency for these children. Alameda County supports policies that extend Federal and State Kin-GAP (to relative guardians) and State AFDC-FC (to non-related guardians) benefits to age 21 for youth who otherwise meet eligibility criteria except for the age at which the guardianship was established. Improve Assistance and Services for Transition-Age Youth Additional supports and programs for transition-age foster youth (ages 14 - 21). In October 2010, California passed AB 12, also known as the California Fostering Connections to Success Act, in response to the federal Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act (Public Law 110-351). AB 12 changed foster care significantly by optionally extending foster care until age 21. Although some transition-age foster youth now have the benefit of extended foster care, these youth often remain in need of additional funding, policies, and programs that support their transition out of foster care and into independent adulthood. Specifically, Alameda County supports: \u00b0 Increased financial support for programs that assist foster youth in the transition to financial stability . Examples include post-emancipation assistance such as secondary education, job training, housing, and access to health care. \u00b0 Additional funding for safe and stable housing and supportive services such as substance abuse or mental health treatment. There is a specific need for financial support of a continuum of care of substance abuse programs for minors. \u00b0 Flexibility with placement requirements for non-minor dependents (NMDs) in Extended Foster Care who are in need of in-patient substance abuse treatment. If a NMD's temporary stay in an in-patient facility could be considered a Supervised Independent Living Placement, for example, this would allow the otherwise eligible youth to remain in Extended Foster Care and receive related services that support their transition to independence, rather than forcing their exit from care. Expand Independent Living Program (ILP) eligibility to include older youth in Family Maintenance . Youth who are nearing adulthood (age 16 - 18) and receiving in-home child welfare services, such as Family Maintenance, are in need of services supporting their transition to independence as healthy and responsible adults. An expansion of eligibility requirements for ILP funds could allow for the provision of services to these youth. Provide counties funding to fulfill credit report monitoring and assistance activities to foster youth. Identity theft is a major concern for youth in foster care and can destroy their credit. For foster children who \"age out\" of the system as young adults, the consequences of identity theft are particularly devastating and can make it difficult to rent an apartment or obtain educational loans. Alameda County supportsadditional funding for counties to assist with monitoring credit reports on behalf of foster youth and ensuring that youth receive assistance in interpreting their reports and clearing any inaccuracies, as required by State and federal law. Provide funding to support reproductive health training. Although some funding is currently available for PAGE | 45 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countyreproductive health education of foster youth through grants, a dedicated funding stream is needed statewide to ensure that these trainings are available to all foster youth, as well as child welfare staff and foster parents who are working with or caring for foster youth. Foster youth are a vulnerable population in particular need of education that promotes their health and provides the knowledge needed to prevent sexually transmitted infections and teen pregnancy. Ensure the Safety and Well-Being of Commercially Sexually Exploited Children (CSEC) Additional funding and supports for Commercially Sexually Exploited Children (CSEC). Responding to CSEC requires a multi-pronged response that does not criminalize the youth for their actions and includes prevention, intervention, and after care. Alameda County supports additional funding and resources, beyond what is currently provided to counties, to expand training, tailor services, and support collaborative work with other systems. More funding is needed to address the immediate needs of victims, including clothing and safe shelter, and to provide long-term services to assist CSEC victims in achieving positive outcomes of permanency and well-being. Align Child Welfare Requirements with Local Best Practice Efforts Flexibility allowing for exemptions in existing requirements concerning social worker contacts with foster youth that unfairly penalize counties. Policy changes are needed to remove penalties when social workers are unable to make monthly face to face contact with a foster youth who has run away from placement and his or her current whereabouts are unknown. The existing requirements do not consider and give credit for the social worker's efforts to locate and make contact with the youth. SUPPORT ADULTS, SENIORS, AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES 4d2e0e5e-787e-4f10-81ec-72ffb950bd31 It is projected that the Alameda County senior population will increase by over 40 percent in the next ten years and approximately 50 percent of all seniors in Alameda County do not have adequate financial resources to address their daily needs. In addition, approximately one in five people with disabilities in Alameda County live below the federal poverty line. Enhance Systems and Programs Permanently restore funding for In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS ). IHSS is a federal, State, and locally funded program designed to provide assistance to those eligible aged, blind, and disabled individuals who, without this care, would be unable to remain safely in their own homes. IHSS providers and clients have experienced a series of cuts in recent few years. Alameda County supports a permanent restoration of these cuts. Ensure IHSS recipients are able to find care that meets their needs. New IHSS overtime rules could potentially place an undue burden on recipients and make it more difficult to find and manage providers. Alameda County supports policies that streamline administration and make it easy for recipients to access and manage their care. Protect vulnerable populations in community care facilities. Licensed community care facilities, including residential care facilities for the elderly and day programs for adults and seniors are inspected by California Community Care Licensing. Alameda County supports annual unannounced inspection visits. Restore cuts to the Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Payment (SSI/SSP) and reinstate an annual State cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). SSI is federally funded and provides income support for individuals who are aged 65 or older, blind, or have a disability; the SSP is the California program that augments SSI. Deep cuts to SSI/SSP over the past few years have compromised the ability of low-income California seniors and people with disabilities to afford necessities, such as housing and groceries. These cuts are exacerbated by the fact that SSI/SSP recipients are not eligible for food assistance through the CalFresh Program. Alameda County supports restoring these benefits and including an annual COLA. PAGE | 46 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda County Increase funding available to develop and support affordable, accessible, and integrated housing options for seniors and persons with disabilities. Older adults and persons with disabilities often live on fixed incomes and appropriate housing options available are scarce and incomes are not increasing at the same rate as housing prices. Local affordable housing resources are severely limited, which is adversely impacting the health, care, and quality of life of seniors and people with disabilities. Support and expand programs for equitable access to advance care planning (ACP) and end-of-life services at any age. Advance care planning gives people a way to think about death and dying allowing them to confront dying directly instead of being a \"vague, unmanageable concept\" or leaving the end of life decisions up to others once the patient is unable to meaningfully participate in the process. Supporting programs that provide culturally relevant outreach and understanding of palliative care and hospice to our diverse populations will increase equitable access and utilization of end-of- life services. Fully support the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The ADA prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in employment, transportation, public accommodation, communications, and governmental activities. Alameda County opposes all efforts to erode the legislative mandate of the ADA.Specifically, we oppose ADA notification bills that seek to create barriers to filing a complaint, resulting in loss of access and civil rights. Increase employment opportunities for older adults and individuals with disabilities. Alameda County supports policies that help older adults and individuals with disabilities access training and employment opportunities that lead to competitive and integrated employment. Specifically, we support policies such as subsidized employment or tax incentives that encourage employers to hire older adults and individuals with disabilities. Support Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act implementation and improvements . Created in 2014, ABLE accounts are tax-advantaged savings accounts for individuals with disabilities and their families.Savings in ABLE accounts do not affect eligibility for SSI, Medicaid and other public benefits. Alameda County supports implementation of the California ABLE Act and policies that enhance and improve the current laws. Coordinate the System of Care for Older Adults Alameda County supports a coordinated service delivery system that protects, supports, and advocates for an aging population. Specifically, we support the integration and simplification of the complex system of senior services to ensure policies and programs are consumer-focused and that residents have access to and receive the services they need. Support and expand programs and policies that promote Healthy Aging/Aging in Place . Older adults often lack access to information and resources about social service and health issues, or are unaware of preventative measures they can take to remain healthier for longer. Alameda County supports policies that promote healthy aging, independence, and well-being of seniors who wish to age in place, or who wish to remain in their homes as they age. Increase funding for Area Agency on Aging (AAA) Programs. The services that the AAA provides to residents age 60 and older are often underfunded or restricted. Alameda County supports increased State and federal funding and flexibility. Reduce nutrition insecurity for seniors. According to the Alameda County Community Food Bank, residents over 50 years old now make up more than one-third of their clients. This need is only expected to increase as older adults are the fastest growing segment of the population in Alameda County; however, State and federal funding for senior nutrition is limited and restrictive. Alameda County supports increased funding and greater funding flexibility for senior nutrition programs and services. Support and funding for Elder Courts. Many seniors find the legal system complicated and difficult to navigate, which creates a barrier to remediation of legal issues such as elder abuse, housing disputes, and more. Elder Courts facilitate legal issues specifically for seniors, including coordinating, scheduling, and making referrals to providers. Expand and fund programs that support caregivers. Families are the major provider of long-term care for PAGE | 47 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countyolder adults, but research has shown that caregiving exacts a heavy emotional and financial toll. Almost half of all caregivers are over age 50, making them more vulnerable to a decline in their own health, and one-third describe their own health as fair to poor. Alameda County supports increased efforts to support caregivers through creation of a Blue-Ribbon Caregiver Council and restoration of funding to Caregiver Resource Centers. Promote retirement savings. Less than half of California's private sector workers have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan. Alameda County supports State and federal policies that promote retirement savings and make it easier to save. Increase funding for programs that support the integration of health care and social services focused on aging and advance care planning . Funding a whole person approach to care and reducing barriers to the integration of health and social service systems will increase the coordination of services and allow sharing of vital health information. The integration of advance care planning into a health and social services regimen allows time to put social supports in place before self-care and mobility are limited by the downward trajectory of a terminal illness. The ability to stay at home with integrated health care and social services may reduce hospital readmissions, futile treatments, and suffering from symptom burdens, while also improving the quality of care at the end of life. Restore and increase funding for community-based programs for seniors. Over the past few years, senior safety net funding for multiple programs under the Older Californians Act and Older Americans Act has been eliminated or severely reduced. Alameda County supports reinstating and increasing funding for these and other programs that support seniors. Increase funding to expand services specifically for older adults with mental health and co-occurring substance abuse issues. Behavioral health concerns are not a normal part of the aging process. Mental illness and substance use disorders are major impediments to living well in old age; they cause considerable personal suffering and make it difficult for older people to achieve their potential. Older adults who become disabled by mental illness deserve the same guarantee of care already extended to those who face other kinds of disabilities. For more information on these issues, please see the Behavioral Health section in the Health Chapter. Restore and enhance the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program (LTCOP). LTCOP is mandated, through State and federal law, to protect residents' rights and ensure that residents are treated with respect and dignity. Complaints identified and investigated by Ombudsmen are often the precursors to more severe cases of abuse and neglect. Increased ongoing funding would enable the program to conduct vital unannounced monitoring visits to all long-term care facilities in California; recruit, supervise and train volunteer Ombudsmen; investigate more complaints per year; and advocate for residents rights and safety. Increase funding, capacity, and access to critical senior services and programs. Alameda County supports restorations and expansions of programs that help older adults age with independence and dignity in their homes and communities. This includes the Adult Day Health Care, Multipurpose Senior Services Program (MSSP), PACE (Program of All-Include Care for the Elderly), and other Medi-Cal funded services. Protect Vulnerable Adults Alameda County Division of Adult Protection consists of Adult Protective Services (APS), Office of the Public Guardian-Conservator (PG/PC), and the Public Administrator's Office (PA). Together these programs provide a continuum of services that form a safety net for vulnerable adults. Increase ongoing funding for APS training. Training for APS workers and their partner agencies is severely underfunded and has not kept pace with rising cases. The 2016-17 State budget included a one-time training augmentation but additional ongoing funding is needed. APS workers receive a small fraction of the funding provided to child welfare workers who deal with similar situations. It is imperative that APS workers receive comprehensive training so that they may provide elder and dependent adult victims of abuse, neglect, and exploitation with the same types of essential services that child abuse victims receive. Alameda County supports increased federal and State funding for APS training. Funding and supports to preserve housing and prevent eviction for seniors and dependents adults who are PAGE | 48 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countyvictims of abuse or neglect. Senior and dependent adults who are the victims of abuse or neglect are among the most vulnerable to becoming homeless. Alameda County supports State and federal funding for services, case-management, and resources to help preserve stable housing for vulnerable elders and dependent adults. Increase services and supports for elderly or dependent adults who are victims of financial abuse. Financial abuse is estimated to account for 40 percent of all forms of reported abuse against seniors. Dependent adults also face similar challenges. Additional services and supports are needed for education, prevention, and investigation of financial abuse and exploitation of these populations. Raise awareness of elder and dependent adult abuse. Specifically, Alameda County supports State and federal efforts to better define elder and dependent abuse and ensure consistency in data tracking and reporting. Efforts should be made to lift up the issue and raise public awareness of this silent epidemic. Enhance coordination to respond to crimes against elders and dependent adults. Alameda County supports State and federal efforts to make it easier for agencies (including law enforcement, District Attorneys, Public Guardians, Victim/Witness Programs, and the Victims Compensation Board, etc.) that respond to crimes against elder and dependent adults to coordinate services. This should include support to identify, prevent, and remedy elder and dependent adult abuse. Improve data collection on elder and dependent adult abuse. There is a lack of good data on elder and dependent abuse. The most recent national numbers (from 2009) estimate that 11 percent of older Americans experience abuse, neglect, or exploitation in the community (this survey excluded individuals in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities). The actual prevalence is likely even higher. The National Council on Aging also estimates that only one in 14 cases of abuse come to the attention of officials. Additional State and federal support is needed to improve local data collection on the incidence of elder and dependent adult abuse. Increase services and supports for elderly or dependent adults who are victims of crimes. Individuals with disabilities and seniors have a disproportionately high victimization rate. According to the most recent Bureau of Justice Statistics report, the rate of serious violent crimes is three times higher for those with disabilities than those without. Additional services and supports are needed for education, prevention, and investigation of abuse and exploitation of seniors and individuals with disabilities. Increase support and statewide coordination of APS. There are currently inconsistencies among APS programs in California counties. Alameda County supports efforts to better coordinate and promote uniformity in the development and adoption of best practices in protective services casework throughout the State. These efforts should also include consistency in data collection so that there is comparable data across counties and updating of the APS State Regulations. Increased safeguards and protections for adults with caregivers. Alameda County supports increased protections for adults who name caregivers as their power of attorney, executor of their wills, or identify the caregiver as an heir. It is important to ensure the adult is making an informed decision and is not being exploited. Require California Department of Developmental Services (CDDS) to act as limited probate conservator. Require CDDS, which oversees the Regional Centers, to act as probate conservator when one of their consumers is in need of a limited conservatorship and there is no appropriate family member or friend able to act. CDSS currently has this capability and does petition in some cases, but prefers not to act. This leaves the burden on individual counties, a model which does not best serve people with developmentally disabilities. Oppose making Lanterman-Petris-Short (LPS) hearing records public. LPS hearings concern the involuntary civil commitment of an individual to a mental health institution in the State of California. Alameda County believes LPS proceedings should continue to be confidential. Increase funding for the Public Guardian-Conservator (PG/PC). Counties currently augment funding for PG/PC with no dedicated State funding source to meet the increasing demand for services. Alameda County supports a budget allocation from the State to provide counties with additional funding for this vital and critical service. Protect the rights of individuals with mental illness. Current law provides that individuals cannot be indiscriminately placed in involuntary settings without due process, which includes LPS conservatorship and a PAGE | 49 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countyfinding of grave disability.Alameda County opposes efforts that could circumvent due process and the protections that are currently in place to protect the rights of residents who have a mental illness. Better Serve Veterans Alameda County supports policies that assist veterans with accessing benefits, housing, and stable employment. Increase employment opportunities for veterans. Alameda County supports policies that help veterans access employment in the public and private sectors. Specifically, Alameda County supports funding for prior- learning assessments that allow veterans to earn college credit for their military training and skills learned in service. Reduce veteran homelessness and provide supportive treatment and services. Alameda County supports a range of policies that address the root causes of veteran homelessness. Specifically, policies that improve employment opportunities, increase substance abuse prevention and treatment programs, establish affordable housing, and improve rehabilitation efforts for homeless veterans. Increase funding for County Veterans Service Offices (CVSOs). CVSOs assist California veterans in navigating the claims process and accessing all State and federal benefits for which they are eligible. EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION PLANNING COUNCIL 934da17f-d9e4-46f9-beca-272f3ec182f7 In 2017-2018, the Planning Council will monitor, take positions and make recommendations on State issues, legislation and initiatives that significantly impact ECE quality, access and affordability and advocate for family centered, inclusive, developmentally and culturally appropriate practices for all children in care as well as those in transitional kindergarten and specifically: Support legislative efforts to support successful implementation of the AB 833 pilot including scaling policies covered in the pilot. Continue to expand ECE access for families, including increased local, state, private and federal funding for infant/toddler care and access for all eligible and homeless families. Continue to increase Standard Reimbursement and Regional Market Rates. Streamline and create efficiencies such as coordinated regulatory, contracting and reimbursement processes within the current federal and state programs. Continue to improve quality in early care and education, including addressing facilities, staff wages and Quality Rating and Improvement System funding. Increase ECE professional development including but not limited to dedicating paid days of training for staff Increase staff compensation and benefits to reflect the professional work in the field. Restore the Centralized Eligibility List (CEL). Increase the frequency of Community Care Licensing Visits to annual visits (aligns with County Social Services agency) Increase funding for Local Planning Councils to pre-recession levels and preserve local flexibility. Restore the Alternative Payment agency support services rate. Update the income guidelines to use most recent census income data. Allow 24 month eligibility redetermination for all child care subsidies. Allow income eligibility guidelines to be waived for Alternative Payment vouchers and Title 5 contracts for up to 10% of families who have children with special needs. Allow CalWORKs parent volunteering in child care programs to count towards work requirements. Base income eligibility on net income, not gross income or gross income minus taxes. Increase mental health resources and connections with ECE programs. PAGE | 50 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda CountyALAMEDA COUNTY INTERAGENCY CHILDREN'S POLICY COUNCIL cb6f791b-a3cd-4680-adaf-387479a19b51 The Alameda County Interagency Children's Policy Council (ICPC) engages in cross-system collaboration by improving interagency communication, developing child-friendly policies and practices, and initiating systems changes that result in healthy, safe, and thriving children and youth throughout Alameda County. Comprised of County department directors and leaders, ICPC provides advocacy and leadership to improve and enhance service delivery and outcomes for children and youth. Our priorities for legislative advocacy are guided by a set of overarching principles that emphasize equity, upstream investment, and interagency collaboration. ICPC supports legislative actions that: Address and change the policies, programs, and practices that perpetuate racial inequities; Recognize and mitigate systemic inequities in all public systems; Prioritize the health and well being of children, youth, and families; Support evidence-based policies and programs to ensure healthy, educated children, stable families, and safe and supportive communities; Bolster, enhance, and innovate safety net programs that serve our most vulnerable populations; Address income and wealth inequality by providing equitable access to economic opportunity and self- sufficiency for all Alameda County residents; Remove barriers to public and private interagency collaboration; and Preserve and increase funding streams dedicated to upstream and preventative investments in children and youth. Our vision for healthy, safe, and thriving children, youth, and families includes ensuring the following priorities are addressed. ICPC advocates for policy change and legislative action that increases equitable outcomes across the following domains: Healthy Ensure all children are born healthy; Give families and caregivers adequate support they need to care for young children; Support consistent access to quality medical, dental, and behavioral health care; Support prevention of childhood obesity and increase overall family health; Ensure access to safe spaces for physical activity within children's own communities; Ensure access to quality nutritious foods in schools and communities; and Guarantee access to safe drinking water in schools and communities. Safe Strengthen all families to ensure all children and youth live in safe and stable environments; Ensure safe, affordable housing for all families with children and youth, and unaccompanied transitional age youth; Prioritize prevention, diversion, and restorative justice practices that impede youth involvement in juvenile justice systems; Support children and youth who are victims of crime and sexual violence through provision of services and support and preempt criminalization of child and youth victims; Guarantee freedom from mistreatment, abuse, neglect, and violence; and Address and mitigate the impacts of trauma on children, youth, and families. Thriving Ensure all families have the ability to meet basic needs- nutritious food, shelter, clothing, health care, and accessible transportation; PAGE | 51 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda County Enable all caregivers to participate fully in the workforce and contribute to the economic well being of their families and Alameda County; Support the healthy social-emotional development of children and youth; Guarantee that all children\u2014beginning in early childhood\u2014have equitable access to a 21st century education that promotes success in life and future careers; Provide robust resources that enable county-involved youth to achieve self-sufficiency, academic success, and reach their professional goals; and Ensure children and youth have the right to a voice and representation in matters that impact them. HEALTH 19c236e2-9fab-483d-b433-55794eba3670 HEALTH CARE ACCESS, QUALITY, AND AFFORDABILITY b89007cf-cb0e-484f-af74-19dcaab34f09 All key provisions of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) are in place as of January 2014, and the legislation has been successful in reducing the rates of uninsured and in the nation. According to the US Census Bureau, the rate of U.S. residents who were uninsured fell from 13.3% in 2013 to 10.4% in 2014; in California, the rate of uninsured fell from 17.2% in 2013 to 12.4% in 2014, a decline of almost 5 percentage points. In the County, the rate of uninsured fell from 12.6% in 2013 to 8.2% in 2014. However, there were still approximately 65,000 people with incomes <200% FPL who were uninsured in the County. The County embraces the \"Triple Aim:\" improving patient experience, satisfaction and quality, the health of populations, and cost-effectiveness. For health care reform to further succeed, we must maximize eligibility, enrollment and retention in health insurance and access to appropriate and high quality health care. Special attention should be paid to policies that: Increase access to health insurance. Simplify the health insurance application process for all, especially hard- to-reach and underserved populations. Support legislation that would streamline enrollment and retention for Medi-Cal. Increase access to health care. The County supports legislation that provides lower cost and more accessible treatment alternatives in community settings; promotes efficiency; incentivizes physicians to go into primary care; incentivizes expanded medical staffing, including use of advanced-practice nurses where there are physician shortages and the use of a wider range of healthcare team members, such as community health workers. Expand dental care access and preventive services for low-income Californians. Dental health is a preventive disease, an integral part of overall health and can have impacts on children's growth, development, self-esteem, and learning. The County supports policies that would increase prevention services and new more efficient models of care, such as the virtual dental home and expanded dental teams. Ensure linguistically and culturally appropriate communication with patients . The County supports legislation that encourages use of appropriate written materials from insurance companies, providers and pharmacy companies, and promotes standards and adequate training for in-person communication at the point of care. Support state-wide comprehensive health care for undocumented persons. Expand health care access and coverage for undocumented individuals and families and the expansion of Medi-Cal and Covered California to cover the remaining uninsured. Promote payment reform that increases the ability to provide preventive services and establishes risk- sharing between hospitals and primary care. Support payment reform that incentivizes positive health outcomes, not just the ability to bill for more tests or visits. It should promote health education and allow same-day visits for better integrated care , and enable doctors to spend more time with patients at the initial visit to improve the quality of overall care. PAGE | 52 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda County Ensure maintenance and enhancement of the safety net system. Increase provider rates; improve transitions of care (e.g. from acute or specialty care to primary care medical homes); and support policies that provide coverage to those with part-time or temporary employment. Use the opportunities provided by the 1115 Medi-Cal 2020 Waiver to enhance integration and effectiveness of the safety net healthcare system. Support adequate Per Member Per Month (PMPM) payments for health home services and the new Health Home Program under Affordable Care Act Section 2703. Support Whole Person Care Pilot and other similar efforts : Enhance integration of mental health and substance use treatment, primary care, and social services to create seamless care and support of social determinants of health for patients. This may include supporting capacity to appropriately share data across systems in order to improve coordination and efficiency of care; and payment reforms, e.g. ability to bill for behavioral health visits that occur on the same day as primary care visits. Support policies that enable systems and providers to reduce health inequities . As an example, the County supports infrastructure for the collection, analysis, and utilization of race, language, and ethnicity and disability data in monitoring and planning to reduce or eliminate disparities. Support improved treatment of chronic pain while reducing inappropriate prescription of opioids and their unsafe storage and disposal. For example, support coverage for and access to acupuncture, physical therapy, and other non-pharmaceutical interventions to treat chronic pain and opioid addiction, and reduce barriers to opioid medication collection sites. MEDI-CAL AND HEALTH CARE REFORM 70e4019c-54c9-4109-a190-54cc485e98eb The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) allowed states to expand Medicaid (Medi-Cal in California). Medi-Cal is California's health insurance program for eligible low-income individuals and families. Beginning in January 2014, Medi-Cal was expanded to include income-eligible childless, non-disabled, adults. Enrollment locally and across the State exceeded all predictions and one-third of California residents are currently receiving Medi-Cal. Alameda County supports efforts to leverage health care reform to enroll children, individuals, and families in the full range of benefits for which they are eligible. For more information on public benefits (CalFresh and CalWORKs), please see the Human Services Chapter. Eliminate the asset test for ALL Medi-Cal categories. With the Medi-Cal expansion, the newly eligible population does not have an asset test. However, other populations receiving Medi-Cal still have resource limits ($2,000 for an individual; $3,000 for a couple).Asset limits are a disincentive to save and Alameda County supports the elimination of these tests for all categories of Medi-Cal. Fully restore Denti-Cal. Good dental hygiene is crucial to overall health and can have impacts on job prospects and self-esteem. Alameda County supports the partial restoration of adult dental Medi-Cal benefits (Denti-Cal) that began in May 2014 and a full restoration of 2009 funding levels. Untreated oral infections complicate medical conditions and are often a source of increased medical costs. Restore Medi-Cal optional benefits. Optional benefits (including Audiology, Chiropractic, Incontinence Cream and Washes, Optician/Optical Lab, Podiatry, and Speech Therapy) were cut in 2009 in response to the State fiscal crisis. The acupuncture benefit was restored starting in July 2016. Restoring the other benefits would increase services for Medi-Cal recipients and broaden the care they can receive under the program, increasing their overall health and well-being. Increase Medi-Cal provider reimbursement rates. California has some of the lowest provider reimbursement rates in the country and recent rate cuts raise concerns about consumer access at a time when millions of new individuals are enrolled in Medi-Cal. Alameda County supports increases in Medi-Cal reimbursement rates and policies that make it easier to claim reimbursements. Provide adequate funding for Medi-Cal Administration. Medi-Cal caseloads have increased significantly since health care reform (a nearly 90 percent increase in Alameda County since 2014). Medi-Cal administration funding for counties needs to be sufficient to handle increased workloads and meet case management standards. Increase the Medi-Cal Aged and Disabled (A&D) income disregards. The income disregards for the Medi-Cal PAGE | 53 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda CountyA&D program (which provides free, comprehensive coverage to persons over the age of 65 and those with disabilities) have not increased since the program began in 2001. This has resulted in eligibility decreasing from 13 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) to 123 percent. When a senior has even a small increase in their income that puts them over the limit, they are forced into the Medi-Cal Medically Needy program with a high share of cost. Alameda County supports increasing the Medi-Cal A&D income limit to 138 percent FPL to align the A&D program with income limits under the Medi-Cal expansion and reduce the number of seniors paying a large share of cost before Medi-Cal will cover services. CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S SERVICES 535209ec-7a53-4f7b-8c2b-9ea013aa821a Started in 1927, California Children's Services (CCS) is the oldest public health program in California. CCS provides case management and care coordination to 180,000 (6,500 in Alameda County) clients, birth to 21, who have serious injuries or chronic, disabling and/or life threatening medical conditions such as cancer, spina bifida, cerebral palsy and sickle cell disease. The CCS program also sets standards for pediatric specialty care in the state of California and certifies physicians, clinical Special Care Centers, neonatal and pediatric intensive care units, and hospitals that provide specialized pediatric medical and surgical services. Support continued funding for California Children's Services as a system of care. Support legislation that will maintain and strengthen CCS as pediatric system of care for children/youth with serious injuries and medically complex conditions. CCS provides a robust regionalized architecture for pediatric specialty care anchored by centers of excellence consisting of CCS-certified regional hospitals and multi-disciplinary Special Care Centers. CCS also establishes and enforces statewide standards for provider participation that underlie the statewide system of quality pediatric care for all children in California. Support maintenance of CCS program standards and quality case management. Advocates for children in California have identified three key components in the CCS program that are particularly valued by families and must be protected. Support legislation that maintains and strengthens these key components: (1) maintenance of a statewide network of approved physicians and other health care providers, hospitals, and Special Care Centers that can be accessed by any CCS-enrolled child regardless of the child's place of residence and that set the pediatric standard of care for all children in the state; (2) referral to the appropriate pediatric sub- specialists, hospitals and Special Care Centers with the expertise to care for each individual child's specific conditions; and (3)provision of case management, service authorizations and care coordination by professionals with specific expertise in the care of children with special health care needs. Support California Children's Services and other programs for children with disabilities to help them thrive. Support legislation allowing CCS programs to enhance existing services by serving the whole child, intensifying care coordination for those who need it most, and providing enhanced supports to CCS medical homes and other CCS providers. A whole child focus in CCS will streamline administrative processes and reduce system fragmentation by integrating pediatric primary care, subspecialty care, and mental health services. These program enhancements would be expected to improve both family and provider satisfaction, and intensive care coordination is shown to reduce costs, improve outcomes and increase parent satisfaction . Support full funding of all medically necessary medications, including non-formulary and compounded medication s and dietary supplements. Pharmacies need to be paid to provide all medically necessary pharmaceuticals to CCS children . Support legislation to improve the ability of all Medi-Cal pharmacies (children's hospital pharmacies, small neighborhood pharmacies, and big chain pharmacies) to provide medically necessary non-formulary medications, dietary supplements, and compounded medications to CCS children. Support legislation that will ensure all changes to CCS proceed slowly, carefully and with great deliberation, ensuring rigorous independent evaluation of all elements of CCS redesign . Any evaluation of CCS redesign should assess access to services, family/provider satisfaction, clinical and process outcomes, and cost savings. Surveys conducted by DHCS demonstrate that CCS families are overwhelmingly satisfied with the services they currently receive from CCS, with satisfaction higher than what is typically found for managed care plans (89% of parents reported being very satisfied or satisfied with case management services). Making changes to CCS too quickly or without adequate, independent data evaluating proposed changes could PAGE | 54 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countyadversely affect CCS children/youth BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES 355e1100-3c77-48d0-8d55-84b4c69ba5d9 Behavioral health problems (mental health and/or substance use disorders) are significant public health problems impacting millions, and are associated with other chronic diseases that often result in morbidity and mortality. The effects of mental illness range from minor disruptions in daily functioning to incapacitating personal, social, and occupational impairments and premature death. Support for the following items will assist Alameda County in providing a fiscally sound, comprehensive continuum of behavioral health services ranging from prevention/early intervention, treatment and recovery/support that will foster increased access to services, a reduction in stigma and discrimination and improved health outcomes for Alameda County residents with behavioral health conditions: Increase funding to expand services specifically for older adults with mental health and co-occurring substance abuse issues. Mental health problems are not a normal part of the aging process. Mental illness and substance use disorders are major impediments to living well in old age, cause considerable personal suffering and make it difficult for older people to achieve their potential. Older adults who become disabled by mental illness deserve the same guarantee of care already extended to those who face other kinds of disabilities. Increase funding to build a competent geriatric behavioral health workforce to meet the demands of the rapidly aging population. The unique characteristics of geriatric mental health and substance use treatment creates important requirements for workforce competencies, and includes the ability to detect possible mental health and substance use conditions in older adults who may have coexisting physical health conditions as well as cognitive and functional impairments. Expand the 1915(i) State Plan Amendment to include evidence-based supported employment services as a billable rehabilitation service under Medi-Cal. Research shows that 60-70% of adults with psychiatric disabilities would like to be employed yet 85% do not work. Expansion of the 1915(i) State Plan Amendment by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to include evidence-based supported employment services as a billable service will allow Alameda County to participate in federal cost sharing and provide a viable financial model for this tremendously important resource. Expand permanent supportive housing for individuals who are homeless and/or disabled . Multiple research studies and policy papers articulate the benefits of expanding permanent supportive housing (affordable housing coupled with appropriate supportive services) for homeless individuals and individuals with disabilities. California lags behind other states that have developed ongoing statewide commitments to further the creation of permanent supportive housing. The Department of Health Care Services should allow health plans to develop innovative approaches to meet the housing needs of their clients and should play a leading role in advocating for the expansion of affordable housing resources at the State and federal level. End the Medi-Cal lock out of reimbursable mental health and substance use disorder treatment services for youth and adults who are incarcerated. 50% or more of State prisoners meet the criteria for a diagnosis of drug abuse or dependence, but only 10% receive medically based drug treatment. Among youth, as many as four out of five teens in the juvenile justice system have drug or alcohol problems, yet fewer than 20% have access to substance abuse treatment programs. Additionally, more than 8 in 10 formerly incarcerated individuals have chronic physical, mental, or substance abuse disorders that create significant, distinct reentry challenges and service needs. Medi-Cal reimbursable treatment services to incarcerated individuals in both juvenile and adult prison systems have the potential to yield substantial health and economic benefits. Advocate for the reduction of individuals with mental illness and co-occurring substance use disorders incarcerated in county jails. More than 2 million adults with serious mental illnesses are admitted to county jails nationally each year. Once incarcerated, people with mental illnesses tend to stay longer in jail and are at a higher risk of re-incarceration than individuals without these illnesses. Reducing the number of mentally ill in the criminal justice system by providing responsible alternatives can save money, reduce recidivism, improve public safety and provide better outcomes for the offenders. PAGE | 55 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda County Promote increased education and enforcement of the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (MHPAEA or \"parity\"). MHPAEA is a federal law requiring that if certain health plans provide coverage for mental health or substance use disorder services, they must provide services in a manner comparable to coverage provided for medical and surgical care. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has identified five primary components that are critical for successful implementation and monitoring of parity: (1) open channels of communication, (2) standardization of materials, (3) creation of templates, workbooks and other tools, (4) implementation of market conduct exams and network adequacy assessments, and (5) collaboration with multiple agencies and stakeholder groups. These five approaches, when implemented in a coordinated manner, can help ensure parity for all Californians. Support the development and implementation of a statewide peer and family support specialist certification program as a part of the state's comprehensive mental health delivery system. Peer specialist services include but are not limited to: wellness, resilience and recovery coaching; navigating systems and community services; assisting in the development of individual wellness plans; and outreach to potential beneficiaries. Peer specialists have been shown to be more effective than traditional providers in reaching populations that are historically underserved by the health care system. Peer services also assist to expand and diversify the health care workforce, mainly the non-physician workforce, which is an area of particular focus for the California State Department of Health Care Services. REDUCING INEQUITIES IN CHRONIC DISEASES 3b9c0365-2c97-45d8-aad1-9c5ca1e160bc In Alameda County the 4 leading causes of death: cancer, heart disease, stroke, and chronic lower Respiratory Disease, are due to chronic diseases and account for 57% of all deaths. Diabetes and Hypertension account for another 5.7% of deaths. Despite increase in life expectancy among all racial/ethnic groups, there has been a growing disparity in life expectancy. For example in 1960 African-Americans in Alameda County had a life expectancy 4.0 years less than Caucasians and in 2010 despite marked increases in both racial/ethnic groups the disparity had increased to 6.5 years. Support chronic disease screening, detection, education and care management system - Chronic diseases disproportionally affect people of color. Poor screening, access to care, and the lack of understanding of how to manage these diseases leads to complications and premature death. The County supports expanding and enforcing a chronic disease system of care that includes the payment and provision of making self- management education accessible to people with chronic disease to manage their disease. Enforce standards-based physical education in public schools as mandated in the Ed Code - Students must be instructed by a credentialed physical education specialist in grades 1-6, for 200 minutes every 10 days, and in grades 7-12, for 400 minutes every 10 days. According to the California Department of Education, less than 30% of all County students in grades 5, 7, and 9 can pass 5 out of 6 of the required areas of the California Fitness test. Promote the initiation and prolonged duration of breastfeeding - Breastfeeding has been proven to provide a broad range of health benefits to both baby and mother including reducing a child's chance of becoming overweight or obese. Encouraging and supporting breastfeeding, and enforcing laws that protect low-wage workers, allow family leave, foster child bonding, and create breastfeeding-friendly work places will lay a foundation of good health. Limit the marketing of junk food to children - The Institute of Medicine recently issued a comprehensive list of recommendations to combat the obesity crisis, including the creation of guidelines to limit the marketing of junk food to children. In recent years this marketing has increased greatly, particularly concentrated in low income communities, leading to an increase in childhood obesity and its associated diseases. Expand the availability of healthful foods and beverages, and decrease the availability of unhealthful foods and beverages . Healthful and nutritious foods and beverages must be made more easily available in low- income neighborhoods paired with a decrease in access to unhealthful foods and beverages. The State's pilot program to increase access to healthful foods should be expanded and greater financial incentives and/or assistance should be provided to retailers to implement the changes. PAGE | 56 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda County Decrease the availability of unhealthful beverages through a sugar sweetened beverage/\"soda\" tax or fee. In the County, approximately 60% of adolescents and 31% of children consume one or more sodas per day. Greater consumption of sugar sweetened beverages is associated with dental caries, diabetes, overweight, and obesity among both adults and children. A soda tax or fee would gain broader support when funds raised are reinvested in the communities most disproportionately affected by the obesity epidemic. Improve utilization of food assistance programs - The complexity of applying for and maintaining eligibility for food assistance programs is frequently a barrier to low-income families. Streamlining the application for nutrition programs - CalFresh (formerly Food Stamps), Women, Infants and Children (WIC), and School Meals Program (Breakfast/Lunch) would greatly increase the numbers of children served. Increase the tobacco excise tax with 20% of any new tobacco tax designated for tobacco control programs with the goal of decreasing adult tobacco-use prevalence from 12% to 10% by 2017. Reduce smoking, limit secondhand smoke exposure, decrease youth access to tobacco products and marketing, and promote health equity among California's diverse populations: The County supports provisions that 1) protect individuals from secondhand smoke exposure, 2) strengthen laws to reduce youth access to tobacco products, 3) counter pro-tobacco influences including advertising and media images or content, 4) reduce or eliminate the retailing of new tobacco or nicotine products, 5) promote tobacco cessation, 6) Incorporate health equity, language access, and cultural competency standards in all tobacco control agencies, programs, processes, and practices, 7) Increase support to priority populations' advocacy and leadership alliances in tobacco control, 8)Strengthen the capacity of agency and institution personnel to achieve tobacco-related health equity, and 9) Conduct monitoring, surveillance, evaluation, and research; disseminate findings to reduce tobacco-related health disparities and measure progress toward achieving health equity and social justice. Create \"Asthma-Friendly\" communities: The County supports policies that create \"Asthma-Friendly\" communities, especially those that eliminate the disproportionate burden of asthma for people living in poverty and communities of color. This goal can be achieved through optimizing the diagnosis, treatment, and management of asthma by adherence to the current National Heart Lung and Blood Institute's asthma guidelines; expanding the reach of proven case management programs for serving persons with asthma; utilizing community health workers and trained professionals; improving air quality reducing diesel emissions in our communities, and improving housing conditions to meet the standards of a healthy home while holding those responsible for the conditions to a legal standard. REDUCING INEQUITIES IN HIV f27c9c23-4a21-4c7a-ae65-ac33e3bef173 There are currently an estimated 5,751 people living with AIDS/HIV (PLWHA) in the County with over 200 new cases reported per year. The impact of HIV on behavior risk groups and minority populations is significant. In Alameda County the HIV Epidemic disproportionately impacts African American and Latino men who have sex with men. HIV also affects marginalized communities such as Transgendered Females, Intravenous Drug Users, other substance users, especially crack cocaine, and sex workers. Cuts to prevention and testing programs from the California State Department of Health have resulted in devastating consequences for some of our most vulnerable populations. Decriminalize HIV : Review existing laws that create and enhance criminal penalties for HIV and revise to assure equitable implementation and subsequent prosecutions. Over the past 25 years, California has enacted laws that criminalized otherwise legal behaviors or added penalties to existing crimes for people living with HIV. These laws were largely based on irrational fears about people with HIV, with most of the prosecuted cases from these laws involving consensual sex or conduct such as spitting and biting that has very low or negligible possibility of HIV exposure. Of those who come into contact with the criminal justice system based on their HIV status, approximately 95% are sex workers and 67% are Black or Latino. Support needle exchange programs: Injection drug use is the second leading cause of HIV transmission and the leading cause of Hepatitis C infection in California. Studies of needle exchange programs have repeatedly shown that these efforts are successful in reducing the spread of HIV and Hepatitis C while showing no increase PAGE | 57 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countyin the use of injection drugs. The County therefore supports policy and legislative efforts to support these needle exchange programs. Facilitate and HIV testing in jails and prisons: Confidential, non-mandatory HIV testing should be supported in jails and prisons in order to prevent the spread of these diseases within the inmate population and among their partners in the community. Assist formerly incarcerated individuals : The County supports legislation that facilitates the rapid and effective transition of HIV care and supportive services for people going in or coming out of State prisons and County jails. Support HIV testing: Support policy and legislation that facilitates routine HIV testing in all medical settings to ensure that HIV testing is administered in the same manner as diabetes and tuberculosis screenings. The County supports the easing of restrictions on who can perform HIV Rapid Testing. Currently, only licensed medical practitioners and State-Trained HIV test counselors are allowed to administer the HIV Rapid Test in California-state funded programs. This restriction is not required by the manufacturer, or in most other states and severely limits state-wide HIV testing efforts. Maintain support for AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP): Maintain and increase funding for the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP), a part of Ryan White Program paying for prescription drugs for people who have limited or no coverage for HIV medications and can't otherwise afford them. The program is managed by states, and most of them also contribute to the funding. The benefits and eligibility requirements vary widely state by state. Increase comprehensive reproductive and sexual health programs for teens: Create a legislative process of funding comprehensive reproductive and sexual health programs for teens. The number of reported Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) in young women under the age of 20 is almost equivalent to the numbers reported for all other women over the age of 20. It is important to fund comprehensive programs to maintain reproductive health and educate young people about contraception, family communication, responsible negotiating and decision making skills. ALCOHOL PRINCIPLES 929441e8-b16e-4012-8a86-a53b4f8cdd8b Current law and regulation provide valuable tools that can be used to develop strategies for changing many high- risk environments in which alcohol and other drugs are used. This \"environmental\" approach to Alcohol and other drug prevention focuses on changes in laws, public policies and social norms to reduce and prevent problems related to the use of alcohol and other drugs. The principles noted below, when applied through actual legislative changes, will enhance the ability of concerned community and neighborhood groups to reduce and prevent alcohol and other drug related problems. Reduce the social availability of alcohol to youth: Currently underage youth can easily access alcohol through social sources, including parents, older siblings, or teen parties, which must be reduced or eliminated. Social host liability laws can hold adults, who served alcohol to underage youth, accountable for injuries that occur as a result of underage drinking. Stop targeting of youth for alcohol advertising: It is currently very difficult for parents and other adults to control a youth's exposure to alcohol advertising, marketing, and promotions, which frequently associate alcohol use with success, attractiveness, and popularity. Strategies for addressing this problem may include: Limiting the sponsorship of community events by the alcohol industry, tightening section 25664, the advertising to minors section of the Alcohol Beverage Control code, and supporting enforcement of existing local advertising regulations that control the placement and display of advertising. Reduce the availability of alcohol products targeted to youth market: Alcohol products such as flavored malt beverages (alcopops), with their colorful packaging and fruity sweet flavors, are targeted to underage youth, particularly young girls. Marketing the products as \"malt\" beverages (beer), despite their being primarily distilled spirits, has allowed them to be taxed at a significantly lower rate, advertised on TV, and sold in convenience stores, small markets and other \"beer and wine\" stores. PAGE | 58 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda County Renew efforts to deter alcohol-impaired driving : Nationally in 2012, more than 10,000 people died in drunk driving crashes - one every 51 minutes (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration FARS data, 2013). An average drunk driver has driven drunk 80 times before first arrest. (Centers for Disease Control . \"Vital Signs: Alcohol-Impaired Driving Among Adults \u2014 United States, 2010.\" Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. October 4, 2011.) During 2012, an estimated 4.2 million U.S. adults reported driving while impaired by alcohol at least once in the preceding 30 days, resulting in an estimated 121 million alcohol-impaired driving episodes annually, and a national rate of 505 episodes per 1,000 population.(Morbidity and Mortality Weekly, August 7, 2015) Strategies to deter alcohol-impaired driving include- lowering the legal blood-alcohol levels, prompt suspension of a driver's license for people arrested, expanded sobriety checkpoints, alcohol-ignition interlock programs, and sustained health education that includes efforts to reduce binge drinking. Reduce the overconcentration of alcohol sales establishments in neighborhoods . A high concentration of retail alcohol licenses in communities is considered a risk factor for youth growing up in that environment. Public health research has consistently linked high crime and violence rates to high concentrations of alcohol licenses. Although most regulation of the siting of new alcohol retailers is at the local level, there are state policies that can impact over-concentration.These policies, include increased resources for sustained enforcement of regulations and limiting the active status of alcohol permits to 10 years Support alcohol taxes to pay for public health and safety costs, reducing alcohol harms and underage drinking. Alcohol taxes have not been raised in California since 1992 when the tax was increased by a penny per drink. Since that time, the real value of alcohol taxes in California has decreased 45 percent due to rising inflation. Raising alcohol taxes has been shown to be a highly effective tool in reducing a wide range of harm and consequences among all age groups. Such harms include alcohol dependence, liver cirrhosis, risky sexual behaviors leading to STDs, traffic fatalities, and especially underage drinking. HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF WOMEN, CHILDREN, YOUTH AND FAMILIES ecdc112b-13ea-4c4b-9d38-2cdef3a19c92 Better access to quality medical care has likely contributed to improvement in some maternal and child health outcomes - infant mortality, for example, has been declining steadily over the last two decades - and yet women, children, youth and families in many of our communities still experience less than optimal health. The low birth weight rate, a key maternal and child health indicator, has not budged over the last ten years and remains above the Healthy People 2020 benchmark. Being born at low birthweight not only contributes to significant newborn and infant health problems, but can also result in long-term illness and disability, including chronic disease and developmental delays. And, there are deep inequities in maternal and child health by race: the infant mortality rate among African-Americans is two times higher than whites and African-American women are three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women. Mounting evidence suggests that these inequities are due to adverse neighborhood conditions, resulting from social inequality, that have a particularly deleterious effect during critical developmental periods such as pregnancy and early childhood. Additionally, women now face challenges to their reproductive freedom in a way that we have not seen since the initial debates that led to the passage of Roe v Wade in 1973. Ensure access to comprehensive, low-cost reproductive, prenatal and primary care - including case management services where appropriate. Support access to comprehensive, low cost and readily accessible reproductive health services, including family planning, emergency contraception and abortion services. Special attention should be paid to policies that 1) do not limit the range of options available and 2) ensure access to accurate, unbiased information about reproductive and sexual health for youth and adults. Support efforts to explore innovative state-level financing mechanisms for home visiting. Other states, such as Minnesota, have MOUs between Public Health Departments and Medicaid managed care organizations (MMCOs) stipulating that home visiting services be directly billed to the MMCO. In other states, partnerships between Public Health, Health Care Services and Social Services agencies at the state level have resulted in braided funding mechanisms that sustain local home visiting programs not supported by Maternal Infant Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV), Healthy Start or other federal funds. California should explore similar funding ideas that could result in evidence-based home visiting programs becoming a permanent part of the PAGE | 59 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countyearly childhood landscape of services for low income women, children, fathers and families. Support continued full implementation of the Comprehensive Perinatal Services Program (CPSP) for -all Medi-Cal eligible women , regardless of whether they are fee-for-service clients or are enrolled in Medi-Cal managed care, as well as for women who are newly eligible for coverage under the ACA. CPSP provides low- income Medi-Cal eligible women with comprehensive nutrition, psychosocial and health education assessments, interventions and support throughout the prenatal and post-partum period, in addition to high quality prenatal care. CPSP is a vital component of the effort to ensure that low-income women get the support and care they need during their pregnancies. Support policies and legislation that promote comprehensive sex education and HIV/AIDS prevention instruction in schools that is age-appropriate and emphasizes abstinence, in compliance with the California Comprehensive Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS Prevention Education Act and the No Child Left Behind Act. Ensure that California continues to emphasize abstinence within the context of HIV/AIDS prevention education (EC 51934 (3) of the Comprehensive Sexual Health Act) but reinforce that abstinence-only education is not permitted in California public schools. Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), unplanned pregnancies, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) all pose public health risks and youth have the right to know the different methods of transmission and protection and how they can protect themselves. Partnerships between public health departments and schools have been successful in educating and empowering youth on these subjects and should continue to be emphasized. Support efforts to ensure safe, stable and affordable housing for pregnant women and families with young children. Pregnancy, infancy and early childhood are critical periods where adverse social conditions can have a disproportionate affect on health and development. Living in substandard housing, experiencing neighborhood violence or being homeless for even short periods of time during the early stages of life can expose young children and their families to dangerous levels of toxic stress, resulting in potential damage to their long-term health, well-being and overall life trajectory. Support funding for the equitable inclusion of services for men in local family support systems of care . For decades publicly funded family support systems of care have provided services to ensure the health and well being of women and children. Federal and State funding is needed to address the health and wellbeing of men and assure their inclusion in family support programming so that they can successfully engage with their families and children. This funding should be directed towards programs, agencies, and organizations that are open to and inclusive of the needs of men and that provide father-specific services and activities that further the goal of increasing fathers' involvement in their children's lives. Additionally, the County supports legislation to ensure full access to physical and mental health services for men, particularly for men re-entering the community from the local criminal justice systems. EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES 75583670-44c9-4717-a383-0b457d76107a In 1980, the Legislature enacted the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Act, which empowers counties to establish Local EMS Agencies (LEMSAs) to develop and implement EMS systems. (Health & Safety Code, \u00a7 1797.200.) The formation of LEMSAs was and continues to be needed to oversee the varying special interests of both public and private providers, hospitals, and tertiary resources to ensure a coordinated systems approach to the delivery of emergency medical services for the people of California in their most vulnerable moments. As specified in the EMS Act LEMSAs are empowered to create an EMS system to provide for a \"specially organized arrangement\" involving \"personnel, facilities, and equipment for the effective and coordinated delivery\" of EMS in \"emergency conditions.\" (Id., \u00a7 1797.78.) Ensure funding for emergency medical services continuity. Ensure the continuation of County authority for planning, implementing and evaluating local EMS systems. Under current law, counties have an obligation to ensure public health, and access to emergency medical care, including ambulance services for its residents. EMS and ambulance services planned for and provided on a county-wide basis ensure system integrity and the delivery of optimal patient care. Our goal is to maintain and improve the EMS system that delivers optimal patient care and efficient system design for the County overall and avoid fragmentation. PAGE | 60 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda County Secure funding to support emergency medical services in hospitals. Over 50% of hospital emergency rooms operate at a net operating loss due to the significant volume of uncompensated care. Legislative efforts, including an initiative to provide new dedicated funding for uncompensated care in emergency rooms and specialty centers, are needed. Funding is necessary to support emergency medical services, specialty centers, trauma care, pediatric care, stroke centers and cardiac care centers. Hospitals throughout the State provide a significant volume of emergency care to patients who do not have third-party insurance coverage and the financial impact is often greater on hospitals located in urban areas. Increase revenue for ambulance transportation. Ambulance transportation reimbursements in Alameda County have significant gaps, particularly in relation to payments by Medi-Cal and Medicare. Medi-Cal reimbursement payments in particular fall drastically short, covering just over 1/5 of the actual cost of service delivery. Legislative efforts are needed for new dedicated funding or for increases in reimbursement from Medi-Cal and other insurers. Support legislation which promotes funding for the propagation of emergency medical community preparedness and resiliency training programs. Programs needed are cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and basic first aid including hemorrhage control. DISASTER PREPAREDNESS 624900f5-f24d-425f-ae08-10d93177aaa1 Natural and human-made disasters including the recent fires in California, earthquakes, acts of terrorism, projections of more frequent and severe extreme weather events and emerging communicable diseases demonstrate the need to ensure that Alameda County has a coordinated system in place to respond to any hazard. Building the response capacity of public health, emergency medical services and health care systems includes planning for a \"surge\" of patients. The Public Health Department and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) continue to work in collaboration with County, State and Federal agencies, local health care providers and other institutions to strengthen our collaboration, communications and responsiveness. The following will ensure that our State and local disaster response systems are adequately prepared to respond in an emergency, prepared to respond to long-term health issues from disaster, and prepared to maintain continuity of operations: Support funding for regional communications. Regional planning must take place to develop communication systems that are functional in a mutual aid response situation. Clear leadership provided by the State Department of Public Health and EMS Authority should promote improved communication with the public and private sector. Funding is needed to support robust and redundant systems and enhance existing communications and information management systems. Develop systems for vulnerable populations. Develop and fund systems to ensure that services are delivered in a timely and efficient manner to vulnerable populations with special consideration for children and adults with disabilities requiring functional or access support services, as well as low income populations, seniors, children, individuals with language barriers and other specific needs. Pre-planning for disaster response must be focused on those who are dependent on others such as caretakers in the event of a large-scale public health emergency. Secure funding for disaster preparedness, response and mitigation. Support legislation that promotes funding for medical and health disaster planning, coordination, response and mitigation including infrastructure and emergency response personnel. SYSTEMS OF CARE FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS WITH DISABILITIES 45c3878d-42c7-4d0b-bfb5-8ee72bfd6a0e Disability status is almost a guarantee of significant disparity in Alameda County: one in five people with a disability live in poverty versus one in ten people without a disability; the percentage of adults with less than a high school education is over twice as high among people with disabilities than those without disabilities; only 22% of people with disabilities are employed compared to 67% of those without disabilities, and people with disabilities are more likely to experience a high housing cost burden compared to those without disabilities based on a substantially lower median income. PAGE | 61 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda CountyAlameda County supports policies that result in better outcomes for children and adults with disabilities, and the development of services designed for all our residents. Restoration of funding, reinvestment in new services, and reform strategies are all essential to the stabilization of our compromised systems of care in order to provide a quality of life beyond institutionalized poverty for children and adults with disabilities. Mandate universal developmental screening with incentives . Require the use of a high quality developmental screening tool in well-child exams at 9, 18 and 24-30 months, and mandate a greater incentive, and higher relative value unit, in publicly funded insurance and service programs. Fewer than one in three young children in California receive timely developmental screenings. When pediatricians use developmental surveillance instead of a high quality screening tool, less than 30% of developmental delays are identified. This group of infants and toddlers can make significant developmental gains; 69% of at risk children who receive early intervention services require no special education services by the time they start kindergarten. Universal developmental screening greatly improves the rate of identification of developmental delays, boosts child success and reduces health and educational system costs. Create affordable and accessible housing. Support legislation and budget priorities that create affordable, accessible and integrated housing options and rental subsidy programs for people at the lowest income levels. The need for housing that accommodates a wide range of disabilities is increasing due to community living options replacing costly and unjust institutionalization, many veterans returning with disabilities, the high rate of homelessness among people with disabilities, and the aging of the population. The average rent for a studio apartment in Alameda County is $1,380, while the maximum SSI/SSP payment is $889; the immediate need is critical. Support State wide housing plans that lead to an increase in affordable and accessible housing options, especially for those on fixed incomes. Support policies and legislation that create an infrastructure of programs and services that assist individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and their families. Increase funding to local governments and school districts to meet the fiscal challenges of providing for a large population of individuals with ASD. ASD is the fastest growing serious developmental disability and has a national annual economic impact of $137 billion. In the County, the Department of Developmental Services (DDS) Autism cases have increased 1,573% since 1990 (representing just a portion of the overall clinically-defined population). The report, \"Autism Rising\", notes that based on current averages for cost of services for adults with autism, Regional Center annual costs will nearly triple over the next ten years, and do not include non-regional center costs such as parental expenses, In-Home Support Services, SSI or housing assistance, and do not address significant future factors such as aging parents, cost-of-living increases or the need for higher level of support as the DDS autism population ages. Increase funding and reform regional center funding structure . Regional Centers provide outreach, community education, intake and assessment, eligibility determination, resource development, and on-going case management services for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Support legislation that stabilizes community service providers and Regional Center operations in order to reform provider service rates and Regional Center operations to ensure funding levels are adequate and sustainable, and provide annual increases while further reform strategies are developed and implemented. Significant impending systemic changes, including the federal ruling to prohibit federal reimbursement for services provided in segregated settings, the closure of the Sonoma Developmental Center, and the need for the development of new programs and services for the rising population of individuals with autism will place additional pressure on a system characterized in the 2015 Association of Regional Center Agencies report as \"On the Brink of Collapse.\" Increase employment opportunities for youth and adults with disabilities . Support legislation and policies that fully fund supported employment services and alternate hiring processes that promote competitive, integrated job placements for individuals with disabilities and close significant gaps in employment rates among those with and without disabilities. Engage in State and Federal funding opportunities designed to increase training and employment opportunities for people with disabilities. PAGE | 62 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda County Reform Supplemental Security Income/State Supplemental Payment (SSI/SSP) Payment Structure. SSI/SSP payments are a critical source of income for people with disabilities, but current rates are tied to 1972 legislation and provide income below the poverty line. Support legislation that increases Supplemental Security Income payments, raises asset limits and updates the earned and general income disregard for individuals with disabilities. Financial constraints contained in the program discourage savings, work and financial security through restrictions on income and asset limits. Create policies that encourage wealth building and lead to financial security, and include cost of living increases. Reform Medi-Cal/Denti-Cal Program . Medi-Cal and Denti-Cal remain the primary source of medical and dental care for those who meet the low income eligibility for Medicaid services. Poor reimbursement rates, lack of coordination between the State and the provider community, and outdated administrative processes result in lack of access and quality care. Support legislation that increases reimbursement rates to a competitive level with commercial providers and create policies that build a comprehensive, coordinated system of preventative care. COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION 2ce61aed-fe77-4cd2-a19b-cf3fbccbce40 Communicable diseases are the fourth leading cause of death in the United States and the leading cause of death worldwide. Control of communicable disease is a core public safety function of government at the local, state, and federal levels. Fulfilling this function requires a sustained, adequately funded infrastructure that monitors, evaluates, and responds to communicable disease threats. Communicable diseases are kept in control only by continual vigilance and ongoing efforts, even when a threat may not be apparent. In addition, the threat of bioterrorism requires that health departments be prepared to recognize and respond to possible cases of intentional outbreaks of unusual diseases such as smallpox, plague, anthrax, or botulism. The three key activities of Communicable Disease Control and Prevention are epidemiology and surveillance, communicable disease response, and vaccine-preventable disease programs. Support for these critical areas will help to protect public health infrastructure and capacity to control and prevent communicable diseases in the County. Assure adequate resources are available to maintain staffing levels and provide for staff development activities. Adequate staff with training and expertise provides the foundation of communicable disease prevention and control. Prevention and control programs need staff with expertise in laboratory, epidemiology, data management and analysis, outbreak response, communications, health education, and case and contact investigation. Capacity must also be maintained to allow for a surge in activities associated with recognized outbreaks or other communicable disease emergencies, such as pandemic influenza, that necessitate substantial increases in surveillance and other public health interventions for weeks to months. Assure adequate resources for public health laboratory services. Public health laboratory services are vital for communicable disease diagnosis, assessment of potential environmental threats, follow-up of cases and carriers of disease, and monitoring the effectiveness of vaccines and other control measures. Recent budget cuts have crippled both local and state public health laboratory services and a major concern is the lack of availability of services previously available through the State public health laboratory system, which often takes as long as several weeks to produce bacterial identifications and important subtyping results needed to conduct timely and appropriate public health follow-up. Within the clinical health care sector there is concern that the trend toward decreasing numbers of laboratory diagnoses confirmation of a number of important communicable diseases is occurring to some extent due to the disincentives built into capitated or otherwise \"managed\" care payment systems which places the burden on public health laboratories to perform testing to compensate for decreased testing by the clinical providers. Additionally, public health laboratories face a significant crisis in the development of laboratory directors due to Federal and State regulations which specify the requirements for public health laboratory directors. Few qualified candidates currently exist, which means that several local California public health laboratories will be without appropriate leadership in the coming years since previous programs to foster the development of laboratory directors were cut due to budgetary PAGE | 63 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countyconsideration. Support secure electronic data exchange between health care systems, laboratories, health care providers and public health. Sustain funding at the state and local levels to fully implement and maintain electronic laboratory reporting and confidential morbidity reporting from providers. Increase funding to develop and implement direct electronic reporting of reportable communicable disease data from electronic health records (EHR) to public health surveillance systems. Support the development of internet-based immunization registries linked to electronic health records and support measures to increase registry usage by all providers of immunizations, including pharmacists and school-based clinics. Assure adequate local public health staff, including public health investigators, public health nurses trained in communicable diseases, epidemiologists, information systems specialists, public health veterinarians and public health laboratorians, dedicated to the surveillance and investigation of emerging infectious diseases and diseases causing outbreaks. This must include the rapid detection,monitoring, investigation, and control of outbreaks due to diseases not supported by categorical funding. Support Partner Services programs to prevent and control HIV and other Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs). Partner Services play a proven and effective role in the prevention and control of HIV and other STDs. All persons with newly diagnosed or reported HIV infection or early syphilis should receive partner services that include active health department involvement. Partner services programs should use surveillance and disease- reporting systems to assist in the identification of persons with newly diagnosed or reported HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, or high-priority chlamydia cases who are potential candidates for partner services. Full funding for partner services and restored funding for other HIV prevention activities must be a high priority. Preserve and support efforts to eliminate tuberculosis (TB) by identifying and treating persons with latent TB Infection, including the use of short-course regimens and technologies to facilitate remote observation. The increase in active TB cases in California and Alameda County in 2015 compared with 2014 reverses what had been a downward trend in case rates, and underscores the importance of testing and treating persons at high risk for latent TB infection to prevent their infection from progressing to active, infectious TB disease. Current funding of public health programs is focused on assuring that active TB patients complete their treatment and that their close contacts are tested and treated for TB infection. However, additional resources are needed to find and treat the much larger pool of persons who were infected in their countries of origin and who can develop active, infectious TB disease many years later when their immune systems weaken due to aging or chronic disease. Additionally, universal access to TB testing and treatment services without patient share of cost are critical priorities needed to reduce health disparities, prevent TB transmission in our communities, and achieve TB elimination in California. Support policies that assure access to vaccines for the population . Policies must address the appropriate development, production, and distribution of vaccines necessary to protect the public's health and assure adequate funding for vaccine purchase, delivery, outreach and education, especially for high-risk populations.Optimal immunization levels for all vaccine-preventable diseases must be aggressively pursued through immunization programs that are assured of continued adequate funding. Strategies should include universal infant immunization, required school entrance and advancement immunizations, innovative programs and mechanisms to improve vaccine delivery and uptake, and a continued focus on immunization of high-risk groups, including within specific settings or occupations with high risk of exposure and/or complications from vaccine-preventable diseases. Recommended immunizations for control of diseases in adults should be provided in all comprehensive immunization programs. Maintain and support ongoing funding for pandemic influenza, and administration of local preparedness programs. Ongoing financial support is needed to maintain critical services such as Public Health Emergency Preparedness, Health Care Preparedness, Cities Readiness Initiative, Urban Area Security Initiative, State Homeland Security Grant Program, and other crucial funding for emerging infectious diseases, natural disasters, and terrorism planning and response. Support policies and funding that provide resources to adapt and develop locally relevant and culturally competent public education and outreach regarding communicable diseases, immunizations, and public health emergency preparedness and response. The broad diversity of local communities requires the PAGE | 64 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countycapability to communicate in culturally relevant modes to ensure the education and safety of all residents. ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH a2c30a43-2019-4612-ae22-41b3c8dc05ad To ensure environmental quality and food safety in the community, Alameda County supports policies and legislation that would prioritize the following: Support product stewardship/extended producer responsibility legislation. Product Stewardship/Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is a strategy that shifts the responsibility for end of life/residual management to the producer who finances it by internalizing the cost in the price of the product. This includes but is not limited to existing and emerging waste streams such as Pharmaceuticals, Sharps, Household Batteries, Fluorescent lamps and Marine flares. Effective Product Stewardship/EPR legislation should apply to all manufacturers across a particular product spectrum, have minimum collection rates, and no local preemption clause Oppose any legislation that pre-empts or supersedes local control over Household Hazardous Waste ( HHW) programs, adds mandates without providing state or producer funding, or supersedes local Product Stewardship/EPR ordinances and limits the role of manufactures and producers in product stewardship programs. In the 2015-16 legislative session AB45 proposed statewide mandates for Household Hazardous waste programs to increase resident participation without providing a funding mechanism. AB45 also attempted to preempt local product stewardship ordinances and attempted to limit the role of manufacturers and producers as merely communicating with consumers rather than funding and operating product take-back programs. We expect these attempts to preempt local ordinances to resurface in the 17-18 legislative session. State legislation with the effect of weakening local ordinances and/or relieving manufacturers of responsibility for funding and operating take-back programs should be vigorously opposed. Support Invasive Species Program Funding. There are a number of significant invasive species being introduced and detected in California that threaten agriculture and the environment. Continued funding of Pest Exclusion, Pest Detection Trapping and Survey activities, Rapid Response, Pest Management and Eradication (if feasible), and Public Education Outreach Programs are critical to protect Alameda County's and California's resources. Oppose state legislation that restricts the use of rodenticides by county vector control agencies. Recent state attempts to ban the use of rodenticides throughout the state will have a serious impact on controlling sewer rats within urban areas. These rodenticides are absolutely critical to control serious rodent infestations and prevent the spread of plague, Hantavirus and other rodent borne diseases. Rodent control using single- dose rodenticides in urban sewer systems provides minimal threat to wildlife living outside the sewer system. Rodent control using multiple-dose rodenticides in tamper-resistance bait stations will provide a safety margin for wildlife. Oppose state legislation that overly restricts the use of Drone/Unmanned Aerial systems (UAS) by Environmental Health departments. Using UAS in rural settings to survey and control mosquito and other vectors in remote locations can reduce the environmental impact on sensitive lands. Retaining information collected via UAS allows agencies to measure the changes in landscapes over time. Privacy rights, UAS flight, and data retention policies need to be balanced against the use of UAS for the protection of public health. Support legislation which increases the authority of Environmental Health departments to deal with emerging Public and Environmental Health Issues: A number of emerging Environmental Health issues will require increased Environmental Health Department authority to monitor and regulate threats to community health. Alameda County supports Health and Safety Code changes that increase the Environmental Health Department's authority to regulate including but not limited to the following emerging issues: Fracking, Green Chemistry, Coal and Oil transport and transshipment, ensuring the safety of organized camps, bedbug infestations, Zika virus, and threats to food safety by climate change induced alterations in vector geographic distributions. Support legislation that provides regulators with more authority to oversee both existing and new onsite wastewater treatment system. On June 19, 2012, the California State Water Resources Control Board (State PAGE | 65 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda CountyWater Board) adopted the Water Quality Control Policy for Siting, Design, Operation, and Maintenance of Onsite Wastewater Treatment Systems (OWTS Policy). The state estimates that more than 1.2 million OWTS are installed and operating in California. As California's population continues to grow, and we see both increased rural housing densities and the building of residences and other structures in more varied terrain, the risks of causing environmental damage and creating public health risks from the use of OWTS increases. Regulatory oversight that may have been effective in the past may not continue to be as conditions and circumstances surrounding particular locations change. Supports legislation which provides funding assistance from the Clean Water State Revolving Fund, bond money from Proposition 1 (2014 Water Bond) and other sources to help private property owners and communities. There is a need for funding assistance to help private property owners and communities relying on OWTS with costs associated with complying with the State OWTS Policy. PUBLIC SAFETY 65053d83-46ce-4f54-9c93-b0ae72b07777 DISTRICT ATTORNEY 34214361-bbb2-42cc-ab71-b088fd73a8c2 The District Attorney's Office is responsible for the prosecution of crimes in the County of Alameda, California. The Office is dedicated to serving the community through the ethical prosecution of criminal offenses and the vigorous protection of victims' rights.

Watch to enhance services to victims of human trafficking and commercially sexually exploited minors. To combat human trafficking, this program requires funds to educate the community, provide effective community outreach and train law enforcement. Stronger legislation is needed to prosecute human traffickers, as well as expand services and resources for victims of sex trafficking and labor trafficking. DNA Backlog. DNA evidence can be used to eliminate or confirm suspects, and develop investigative leads to solve a number of unsolved cases. Funding to eliminate the current backlog of untested sexual assault kits, solidifying a partnership between our office, law enforcement agencies, and private entities to provide a streamlined model throughout the State to prevent future backlogs. Victims of Crime. Enhancement of the rights and protections of all victims of crime, and increased funding to expand services to all victims of crime, especially victims of violent crime including: homicide, child abuse, domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, human trafficking, and commercially exploited minors. Increase funding to aggressively collect restitution of behalf of all victims of crime. Strengthen the process for seeking and securing restitution for victims of crime. Mental Health. Advocate for strong funding streams for treating and assisting people with mental health issues. Realignment. Reduce recidivism by realigning lower level offenders to community corrections programs strengthened through community-based punishment, improved supervision strategies and evidence-based practices, and supervision practices demonstrated by research to reduce recidivism. This includes employing proven alternatives to incarceration for low-risk offenders. In addition, systemic reforms in the Alameda County court system are required to establish a centralized process to help in filing revocation petitions. Reducing Serious/Violent Crimes. Initiatives to reduce violent crimes by proposing the formation of the regional multi-agencies task force to combat violence. The task force would provide meaningful alternatives to individuals engaged in criminal behavior who are amenable to various treatment strategies. Enhancing Community-Based Support for Formerly Incarcerated. Support funding for community programs that aid incarcerated and formerly incarcerated individuals through their rehabilitation efforts and process. Funding can provide programs for individuals as an alternative to incarceration or through the expansion of District Attorney driven Diversion Programs wherein charges are dismissed after successful completion of the Program. Funding can provide programs and support for individuals under supervision of the Probation PAGE | 66 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda CountyDepartment following conviction as well as for individuals after they return from jail or prison. Community programs include access to health care, job training and education to provide tools to support themselves and reduce recidivism. Youth Empowerment and Juvenile Delinquency Prevention. More programs and funding for youth to provide work experience so that youth can gain real-world skills and experience to help them become self- sufficient in a positive way and prevent them from entering the juvenile and/or criminal justice systems. Stronger intervention and prevention programs for commercially exploited minors as well as funding for resources for minors and transitioning youth who have been victims of human trafficking and/or sexual exploitation. Youth Violence Prevention and Education Programs. Funding for violence prevention and education programs and/or counseling programs for youth who are at risk of or have been involved in crime to provide information about the juvenile justice system; teach about healthy relationships and decision-making, and assist youth to achieve their dreams. Also more partnerships with additional groups to provide counseling, mentorship, case management, life skills, employment and training. Alternative Programs to Incarceration. Advocate for continued funding for alternative programs to incarceration. Enhancing Public Safety. Evaluate and propose changes in the law that protect innocent bystanders and children from mutual gun combat. Consumer Protection, Environmental Protection, and Worker Protection. Increase efforts in Consumer Protection, Environmental Protection, and Worker Protection, particularly around labor trafficking. Collaboration. Advocate for and create a legislative platform to require county agencies to work with community agencies collaboratively to combat human trafficking, specifically the sex trafficking of minors and labor trafficking. PROBATION 09deab8a-3ddd-4b74-b606-064463aae56c Probation engages in department-wide efforts to initiate and maintain strong partnerships with all government and community agencies. We establish and maintain community and government partnerships in order to provide a cohesive system of support for our clients. This partnership includes cross-jurisdictional collaboration with State and County agencies, community and faith-based organizations, therapists, and social workers. The Probation Department supports policies and legislation on the following: Commitment to serving vulnerable youth and families and reducing the number of youth crossing over between the child welfare and juvenile justice systems: \u00b0 Continued support for foster youth in placement by improving aftercare planning and services for youth exiting foster care placement and support for alternatives to permanent placement such as Family Finding. \u00b0 Continued work with organizations that provide intensive youth-centered and family driven services. \u00b0 Maintaining partnerships with County agencies, law enforcement and community-based organizations in an effort to effectively serve the Commercially Sexually Exploited Children (CSEC) in the County's established program, utilizing a multidisciplinary approach for case management, service planning and the provision of services. \u00b0 Expanding AB12 resources to non-minor dependent Camp youth who are at-risk and in need of services and programs benefitting their health and well-being. Interventions funded under Title IV-E serve as evidence-based practice models that will enable Probation to carry out its goals to improve family reunification efforts and ultimately reduce out-of-home placements. Partnerships with stakeholders specializing in evidence-based practices, along with collaborative efforts to provide effective programs and services for Probation youth, will aid in achieving improved outcomes in the overall health and well-being of youth encountering various systems. Continue to provide leadership in public safety realignment efforts by maintaining public, private and community partnerships for referrals to services contributing to reduction in recidivism: PAGE | 67 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda County\u00b0 Connect clients to employment opportunities and community support. \u00b0 Communicate opportunities and access to community resources. \u00b0 Provide support services that maintain family connections. \u00b0 Train staff and organizations providing support services focusing on community and family cohesiveness. \u00b0 Increase client capacity for the Transition Day Reporting Center.

YOUTH AND JUVENILE JUSTICE 395db5eb-b920-4acb-885a-573ab5c5cea9 Alameda County Interagency Children's Policy Council: Support the maintenance of all Juvenile Justice funding streams which have greatly contributed to the reduction of juvenile delinquency, incarceration and recidivism, including indigent juvenile defense and other advocacy services. Support increased system reform and coordination with regard to \"cross-over\" youth and families involved or at risk of being involved in both the juvenile justice and foster care systems. Advocate for community-based alternatives to detention and incarceration and services for youth involved in the criminal justice system to reduce recidivism. Support programs that reduce truancy and positively support school attendance as there is a high correlation between truancy, dropping out of school and juvenile crime. PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE 07a9ff39-e709-45ce-afec-fd7b88ffeab5 The Public Defender's Office supports: Protecting and expanding the rights to liberty, privacy, and due process. Protecting all members of the community from unreasonable search, seizure, arrest, detention, and surveillance. Preserving and expanding the right to a fair trial. Strengthening Evidence Code requirements concerning the competency and trustworthiness of evidence to be introduced at trial. Diversion programs and other programs designed to prevent people from coming into the criminal justice system. The decriminalization of non-violent drug possession offenses and a shift of resources from incarceration and criminalization to treatment and harm-reduction practices.

HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY 82324d9b-2b9b-469f-91ab-cde77f741509 Alameda County supports the following : Decrease risk factors and increase resiliency factors for youth and families: Alameda County supports legislation and funding that supports resiliency building strategies , including expanding child and youth development programs that emphasize strong attachments and relationships and violence prevention skills, as well as provide an alternative to gang involvement. Legislation and programs focused on gang reduction should address the root causes and should not rely solely on suppression. Additionally, Alameda County supports actions that promote family well-being, including efforts that help families meet basic needs, as well as develop effective parenting and conflict resolution techniques that help prevent child abuse and domestic violence. Foster thriving neighborhoods: Alameda County supports legislation and funding that supports improving neighborhood conditions, including policies that decrease density of alcohol outlets and advertising and improve the physical appearance and economic vibrancy. Such policies could include efforts to ensure government subsidized capital investments and infrastructure projects benefit high-crime neighborhoods. Additionally, Alameda County should pursue legislation that ensures that public safety funds can be used flexibly and can support building community cohesiveness for collective problem solving. Alameda County supports policies that promote evidence-based trauma-informed care. Improve community-law enforcement relationships: Alameda County supports legislation and funding for strategies that strengthen community-law enforcement relationships such as community policing, and mandatory trainings like those offered by the California Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST). Training topics should include de-escalation skills, increased police awareness of conscious and unconscious bias and how to account for it in the line of duty, and appropriate police response to persons with mental illness or developmental disability, which will help to avoid additional violence and/or inappropriate admission into the criminal justice system. Alameda County supports the collection of data to determine the effectiveness of public safety methods and interventions for accountability to Alameda County residents. Eliminate the disproportionate representation of people of color and people with disabilities in the criminal justice system and as victims of violence: Alameda County supports administrative, legislative and budgetary actions with the explicit goal of eliminating the over-representation of people of color in the criminal justice system. Efforts include reviewing systems for their contributions toward issues of \"disproportionate minority contact,\" identifying and addressing issues related to sentencing bias, and acknowledging and mitigating unconscious bias within the criminal justice system overall. Support alternatives to incarceration including sentencing reform, and decriminalization of substance use disorders and other criminal justice reforms as a way to reduce recidivism and shrink the prison population: Remove barriers to successful reintegration of people into communities after incarceration, such as barriers to education, employment, housing, and health and social services: Alameda County encourages the State Attorney General and the State legislature to direct appropriate agencies and licensing bodies to review existing policies' impact on previously incarcerated people and to reform policies that prevent successful reentry and do not serve to protect public safety, with a focus on agencies and programs related to education, employment, housing, and public assistance.Furthermore, Alameda County supports legislation that provides incentives for hiring formerly incarcerated persons and efforts that provide amnesty to the more than 4 million PAGE | 69 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countypeople in California who have a suspended license, mostly for unpaid fines; living without a license is a significant barrier to employment and transportation. Driving with a suspended license is grounds for a misdemeanor charge in California, \"even if the sole reason for the suspension is an inability to pay a citation fine\". (Source: http://ebclc.org/backontheroad/problem/ ) Expand health and social services for the incarcerated and formerly incarcerated population: Alameda County supports legislation that funds expanded rehabilitation programs and mandates and funds comprehensive reentry planning in jails and prisons so as to support successful reentry. Alameda County also supports the expansion of funding for physical and mental health services, substance use treatment, housing, education, job training and employment services, including coordination of care both during incarceration and post release. Alameda County supports legislation that ensures that jail and prison conditions do not contribute to worsening mental health, including the elimination of solitary confinement as a punishment for both youth and adults and making maintaining family connections during incarceration a priority. Reduce the availability and usage of firearms : Between 2010 and 2012, the third greatest number of unintentional injuries was due to firearms. Alameda County supports continued statewide efforts to strengthen gun laws and expand gun buy-back programs, as well as encourages California to play a very active role in federal gun reforms, as California residents are at risk as long as high-power weapons with large magazines are sold in other states. Ensure State funding for local domestic violence services and increase federal support for domestic violence victims: Alameda County supports efforts to secure and expand domestic violence prevention dollars for emergency shelter and other essential victim services. Alameda County supports policies that support victims' ability to obtain a restraining order, navigate divorce and custody proceedings, have meaningful language access and interpretation services in civil court, provide free court reporters in domestic violence family law proceedings, and promote efforts to enforce restraining orders. The County supports system-change efforts encouraging schools to adopt and implement school policies to address adolescent dating abuse. The County supports efforts to address the needs of traditionally underserved or unserved communities, including populations underserved because of geographic location, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, race, ethnicity, and populations underserved because of special needs such as language barriers, disabilities, alienage status or age. Lastly, The County supports efforts to address the economic concerns that domestic violence survivors often face that lead them to return to abusive relationships: safe and affordable housing; the ability to work and earn a fair and livable wage; and access to public benefits that meet the basic needs of recipients. (From the CA Partnership to End Domestic Violence: http://www.cpedv.org/policy-priorities ) PLANNING LAND USE AND HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT 41a355fc-d69f-4c1b-944c-77c66f2b40ec LAND USE PLANNING 6848f896-0953-4c03-901a-61b290cceff7 To create healthy and vibrant communities, the County supports policies and legislation that would: Include health and equity in General Plans and Land Use Plans. Require a health and wellness element, health language, health analysis, or health standards in all General Plans, as well as in guidelines from the State Office of Planning and Research. The County also supports collaborative planning processes that give communities more power to influence land use plans and policies as well as associated capital infrastructure budget investments. Limit access to alcohol, tobacco, and other unhealthy goods. Certain neighborhoods and communities in the County are overburdened with a concentration of alcohol and tobacco outlets that are often in low-income communities of color. Fully fund and empower State agencies to enforce laws and regulations against alcohol and tobacco license holders in order to eliminate illegal activities in these communities and reduce the overconcentration of these outlets. Discourage consumption of unhealthy foods and sugary beverages that are linked to the obesity epidemic and chronic diseases. Promote healthy, livable, and resilient communities. Prevent, reduce, and mitigate toxic emissions and chemical exposure, as well as other environmental impacts that harm the public and workers health and quality PAGE | 70 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countyof life, particularly in low-income communities of color. The County supports policies that create opportunities for more healthy food access and access to affordable housing, develop sustainable built environments that reduce urban heat island effects, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and other climate impacts on health and prepare communities to adapt to climate change, specifically in low-income communities of color. In addition the County supports policies that prevent displacement of current residents when improving communities. Support mineral resource management. To further the County's efforts to reduce greenhouse gases, extraction of quarried materials in \"Regionally Significant Construction Aggregate Resource Areas\" should be encouraged. Aggregate from these resource areas is used for the construction industry, much of it occurring in the County, mostly in the urban centers and highly developed areas. To reduce emissions and discourage long hauls of aggregate material, quarries in Regionally Significant Construction Aggregate Resource Areas should continue to be recognized as a regional asset, and every effort should be made to promote compatibility between quarries and adjacent land uses. Limit or prohibit the extraction, handling and transportation of fossil fuels. Limit or prohibit hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and the handling and transportation of fossil fuels at Port facilities at the State level. Locally, the County has moved to limit oil and gas extraction, including a ban on enhanced recovery methods including hydraulic fracturing. HOMELESSNESS AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING ec7c7d06-46fc-4b1b-82cf-2af1635c8e51 The County's goal is to ensure adequate, affordable, safe, and high-quality housing for all of its residents. Without long-term resources dedicated to developing and maintaining affordable housing, this goal will be unreachable. The elimination of Redevelopment Agencies in 2012 significantly reduced funds available for the development of affordable housing, which have not yet been replaced. Creating a permanent source of funding for affordable housing is a top priority in maintaining the housing opportunities and infrastructure needed in the unincorporated areas of the County, the County as a whole, and Statewide. To this end, the County supports: Increased funding for affordable housing for extremely low- and low-income households. Affordable housing improves positive community impacts such as housing stability, employment, mental and physical health, and school attendance and reduces active substance use, criminal justice recidivism, and other negative community impacts. Housing is considered affordable when monthly housing costs, including utilities, are no more than 30% of total household income. Homelessness is inhumane and also increases costs to emergency and safety net systems. The County supports policies which increase the supply of access to affordable housing, particularly for low- and extremely-low-income residents, including policies such as mixed income housing, increased funding for affordable housing development and permanent rental assistance, promoting the development of new funding sources to replace those lost to federal budget reductions, the elimination of redevelopment agencies, and reductions in available State funding. Safe and healthy housing. The County supports \"green\", healthy, safe and high-quality housing, particularly for low-income people. Housing quality has a significant impact on people's health and well-being. Issues such as the existence of lead, water leaks, poor ventilation, mold, dirty carpets, pest infestations, and location near toxic sources can result in numerous health problems such as developmental delays in children, skin disease, headaches, asthma, and other respiratory conditions. Additionally, the County supports efforts to rehabilitate existing housing, without placing the financial burden on low-income tenants and homeowners, and develop new housing, located at a safe distance from polluting sources, such as freeways, ports and businesses with toxic emissions, particularly for low-income communities of color and vulnerable populations, and when not possible, ensuring appropriate indoor and outdoor mitigations are put in place. The County supports housing preservation/ rehabilitation through increased efforts to inspect rental properties through strategies such as proactive rental inspection programs. And the County supports efforts to assist low-income landlords and elderly property owners to maintain their properties. Preventing and ending homelessness, and assisting people currently homeless . Higher funding levels and PAGE | 71 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countyincreased coordination between funding for services and housing are needed to create and sustain supportive housing for the highest need individuals and families who are homeless. Support increases to funding and coordination to address the needs of people who are currently homeless, especially those most vulnerable and living on the streets and in places unfit for human habitation. Affordable and supportive housing are critical to preventing and ending homelessness and cost the same or less than shelter, incarceration, hospitalization and other crisis response interventions. Protecting homeowners from foreclosure and the rights of tenants living in foreclosed properties. Commu nities and neighborhoods in the County are still suffering the effects of high foreclosure rates and resident displacement. The County supports legislative efforts to increase funding and prevent foreclosures and ameliorate their impacts. Removing barriers to accessing housing. The County supports anti-discrimination policies that prevent landlords from discriminating against housing vouchers and that prevent adverse housing decisions based on a person's status as former incarcerated. Prevent displacement of community residents. Involuntary displacement of long-term residents is a continuing problem in the County's high-cost housing market. The County supports policy and funding efforts to limit and ameliorate resident displacement. COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT 23b9a225-158c-4f34-bac8-2170cbe136c9 To create more livable and economically vibrant communities for everyone, the County supports the following policies: Access to open space. An increase in funding for and access to safe and quality parks, trails, green and open space, urban agriculture/community gardens, and recreation centers. Policies should ensure that these opportunities are made available in all communities. A person's neighborhood shapes their opportunities to play, exercise, enjoy nature, and be healthy. Accessible communities. Promote the use of universal design to ensure accessibility of spaces for every one of all abilities. Communities that are designed to be accessible to seniors, children, and people with disabilities will be accessible for everyone. This includes street and sidewalk design, as well as wheelchair accessible public spaces such as parks and community centers, lighting, and other safety issues. Prioritizing reinvestment in low-income communities. Increased funding and the creation of funding tools, such as tax increment financing, developer incentives, and Greenhouse Gas Reduction Funds that local jurisdictions can use to increase affordable housing, and affordable and reliable transit and infrastructure in their communities. The elimination of redevelopment revenues greatly reduced sources of funding to invest in low-income and blighted communities. This funding should prioritize the needs and prevent displacement of existing residents. Regional planning efforts. Additional resources to promote the greenhouse gas reduction goals of the Sustainable Communities Strategy (SCS), including policies, investments and programs that promote transit, infill development, housing near transit without increasing the risk of exposure to pollution or displacement of current residents, particularly for low-income communities and vulnerable populations, increasing affordable housing production, urban greening networks throughout the County, and the conservation of irrigated agricultural land. Local jurisdictions throughout the State have been developing a regional SCS through their local council of governments. The SCS goals of compact, infill development should be supported at the State level with additional funding for housing, transit and public infrastructure. Incentives for smart growth development. Additional resources to promote smart growth as a corollary to regional and local planning efforts. The loss of Redevelopment funding has made it more difficult to attract development to Priority Development Areas (PDAs) - the community building blocks that make up the SCS. The County supports the creation of resources to create a PDA \"bank\" at the regional level and other resources to attract smart growth development, especially to areas that suffer from economic neglect. PAGE | 72 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda County SUSTAINABILITY 47d1131c-ccb5-4657-be51-0a30a1c7111e SUSTAINABILITY PRIORITIES 64842013-ad19-4ee8-8a77-bc9484106b60 Support policies, funding and incentives that reduce nonrenewable energy use, promote local sustainable solutions in the built environment and spur the green economy throughout Alameda County, particularly those benefitting low-income communities and vulnerable populations, including sustainable and equitable transportation, green building design, energy and water conservation, greenhouse gas reduction, home and commercial energy efficiency retrofits, renewable power generation, and adaptation and resiliency. Support policies that promote the green economy. Support innovative economic development policies and approaches that result in the expansion of and access to green jobs and provide livable wages, while reducing climate change impacts in Alameda County. Support policies that promote sustainable agriculture, water conservation, integrated pest management, worker health, and that promote local job generation. Support funding, encourage legislation, and California Public Utilities Commission and California Energy Commission initiatives that improve the efficiency of energy and water use, particularly at public facilities by providing stable funding sources, reduced transaction costs, and expanded use of flexible, efficient, public contracting methodologies. Support funding and encourage legislation that increases the generation of renewable energy and energy storage at public facilities and other government-owned infrastructure, through regional collaborative contracting mechanisms. Support efforts to enable use of State revenues for local government energy efficiency, water conservation, renewable energy and emerging green technology projects. Support increased funding and legislative authority for local government participation and leadership of Community Choice Aggregation and Regional Energy Networks, such as BayREN. Support policies that grow sustainable and equitable communities by creating new housing, including affordable housing, with transit-oriented and mixed-use development, while preventing and minimizing the impacts of displacement of low-income communities and vulnerable populations. Support the reduction of urban heat island effects, and other climate impacts on health and the environment. In conjunction with Regional Agencies leading the implementation of SB 375, support the development of a comprehensive urban greening (\"Planning Conservation Area\") network throughout the County with particular emphasis on connections to disadvantaged communities which will integrate with and complement the planned Priority Development Areas/ smart growth transit corridors. Support policies and increased funding for climate change mitigation, adaptation, and resilience programs and allocations that promote equity, participation and leadership in implementing solutions, including ensuring disadvantaged communities in the County receive State Greenhouse Gas Reduction Funds. Support policies and funding for programs that address the disproportionate environmental and health impacts of pollution and vehicular traffic through and within low-income communities, including commodities being transported such as coal and crude oil. Support policies and funding that promote sustainable transportation systems that expand, improve the availability, reliability, affordability and accessibility of, modernize public transit with dedicated traffic lanes, increase clean commute opportunities, reduce vehicle trips and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, support the development of \"Complete Streets\" or similar programs and support policies that increase walking and biking mobility and safety for all users, promote traffic calming, improve regional transportation demand management. Support the development and expansion of electric vehicle (EV) deployment, EV charging infrastructure, onsite renewable power generation, vehicle to grid technology, and stationary battery storage. PAGE | 73 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda CountyTRANSPORTATION b3f21b36-98cb-4c2a-a543-815e8d5f2563 TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING a5ccbbf3-69eb-444e-9967-a199df346a74 With increasing fuel efficiency and the introduction of hybrid and electric vehicles, revenues from the excise tax on gas, Alameda County's primary funding source for transportation infrastructure maintenance and project delivery, are expected to continue to decline. The current economic environment is also contributing to declines in various revenue sources, making it difficult to fund critical infrastructure projects. While the transportation funding continues to decline, the demand for infrastructure construction, maintenance, and operations continues to increase. Alameda County continues to seek and support increased infrastructure funding to operate, maintain, rehabilitate, and improve transportation infrastructure including local streets and roads, and bicycle and pedestrian facilities. The County supports policies and legislation that would: Invest in transportation infrastructure. Many of Alameda County's local streets and roads are in poor or very poor condition. This limited transportation funding results in continued deferred maintenance of needed roadway treatments. Without an immediate investment of new revenue, the County's local streets and roads infrastructure will continue to decline, which only increases the cost burden on future taxpayers. The County supports any solution that provides investment large enough to demonstrate tangible benefits to taxpayers and the traveling public. Raise revenues from a broad range of options. Research by the California Alliance for Jobs and Transportation California shows that voters strongly support increased funding for transportation improvements. Voters are much more open to a package that spreads potential tax or fee increases across a broad range of options, including fuel taxes, license fees, and registration fees, rather than just one source. Additionally, any proposal package should move California toward an all-users pay structure, in which everyone who benefits from the system contributes to maintaining it - including traditional gasoline-fueled vehicles, new hybrids or electric vehicles and/or commercial vehicles. Focus on maintaining and rehabilitating the current transportation system. Repairing the County's local streets and roads involves much more than fixing potholes. It requires major road pavement overlays, fixing unsafe bridges, providing safe access for bicyclists and pedestrians, improving rural road safety, replacing storm water culverts, as well as operational improvements that necessitate the construction of auxiliary lanes to relieve traffic congestion choke points and fixing design deficiencies. Efforts to supply funding for transit in addition to funding for roads should also focus on fixing the system first. Protect the Highway Users Tax Account. The County supports all efforts to protect funding in the Highway Users Tax Account (HUTA) or \"Gas Tax\" from being diverted to the State General Fund or for purposes other than County transportation. The County further supports all efforts to ensure repayment of all transportation loans and transfers. Increase transportation grant programs. The County supports efforts to preserve and protect State funding for local infrastructure improvements including the Highway User Tax Account (HUTA), State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP), State Highway Operation and Protection Program (SHOPP), Traffic Congestion Relief Program (TCRP), Active Transportation Program (ATP) and the Transit Assistance Program. Return fees to transportation. Weight fees have been used to backfill general fund debt service payments for general obligation bonds since the Tax Swap. Restoring weight fee revenues to transportation through a phased-in approach and/or securing another source of revenue to pay for transportation-related bond debt service will avoid imposing massive costs on the general fund at the expense of other county programs. The County supports efforts to return truck weight fee revenues as well as the revenues attributable to off-highway vehicle fuel sales back to counties for transportation purposes. The County opposes efforts to divert these PAGE | 74 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countyrevenues to backfill general fund debt fee service payments for general obligation bonds. Rural road safety. Alameda County is a primary destination for regional and inter-regional traffic for goods movement and workforce commute travel between San Joaquin County, Contra Costa County and Santa Clara County. Major transportation corridors in this region routinely experience extreme traffic congestion. In an effort to avoid these congested freeways, commuters continue to seek alternative routes along the rural roads. As a result, many of Alameda County's rural roadways are now being used by commuters attempting to bypass the heavily congested I-580 and I-680 corridors. On these rural roadways, traffic volumes during peak hour may be 100 times greater than the traffic volume during non-peak hour. The increased traffic congestion and aggressive behavior by many commuters (speeding, unsafe passing, etc.) results in safety issues, especially for the residents living along these rural roadways. The County supports legislation which increases funding for safety improvements and infrastructure projects on the existing transportation system, with emphasis on programs/projects focused on ensuring rural roads have a dedicated funding source to improve safety and reduce accidents and fatalities. Active transportation grant funding. The unincorporated areas of the County have over $400 million in needed sidewalk improvements to address community and pedestrian safety, especially near schools. Funding for the design and construction of the much-needed active pedestrian and bicycle facilities in unincorporated areas of the County is critical. The County supports legislation, policies and funding for pedestrian infrastructure, bicycle facilities and other infrastructure improvements which enable all pedestrian and bicyclists to commute safely and efficiently. SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION f1928c0c-7628-41d1-b914-c04370e6d1ff Throughout California, transportation agencies are taking innovative actions to combat climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and toxic air pollution from transportation. Some of the sustainable goals include improving the durability of construction materials, improving mobility with new traffic control devices, and supporting the transition towards zero-emission vehicles. Additional efforts are being made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and toxic air pollution by reducing traffic congestion, expanding active transportation (multi-modal trails, pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure), embracing new technology in construction materials and efficient roadway lighting. The County supports policies and legislation that would: Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions . Provide funding for innovative infrastructure, operations and programs to relieve congestion, improve air quality, reduce emissions, and support economic development throughout Alameda County. Create Funding Incentives. Identify funding and create incentives for the use of renewable resources in transportation infrastructure projects. Expand Partnerships . The County supports legislation, funding and policies that support collaboration and expand partnerships among local and regional partners to deliver sustainable transportation infrastructure resilience in the face of climate change. STREAMLINE TRANSPORTATION REGULATORY AND PROJECT DELIVERY PROCESS 8f9bbb16-def3-4fab-90ba-d97de462b3e5 The County takes its responsibility to protect our environment seriously. Likewise, the County recognizes its need to balance environmental protection and the need to maintain the transportation infrastructure through design, construction and delivery of new transportation projects. Unfortunately, regulatory inefficiencies continue to hamper the effective and timely delivery of transportation projects. To this end, the County continues to seek legislative remedies in streamlining regulatory burdens while advocating for any and all funding opportunities at all levels of government. The County supports policies and legislation that would: PAGE | 75 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda County Improve the Project Delivery Regulatory Process. Streamline the project delivery processes for the delivery, enhancement, or augmentation of transportation infrastructure projects and programs, including requiring specific timeframes for State and federal reviews and approvals, to expedite project delivery while ensuring appropriate environmental protection and mitigation. Create a Reciprocity Pilot Program . Create and approve a State-federal \"reciprocity\" pilot program which allows the State of California and the local transportation agencies to carry out the federal environmental review processes to streamline and expedite delivery of federally-funded projects. Approve the CEQA-NEPA Reciprocity Pilot Program. Approve the CEQA-NEPA reciprocity pilot program, which builds on California's successful implementation of the Surface Transportation Project Delivery Program, and allow for even greater project streamlining to enhance efficiency in flood control projects. Regulatory Exemptions. Categorically exempt road safety projects from CEQA and State and federal permitting requirements (i.e., 404 permits, 1601 permits) and exempt the maintenance of existing transportation facilities and infrastructure from permit requirements under the Endangered Species Act. Mandate Response Times. Improve the environmental review and regulatory approval processes by mandating specific response timeframes for the State review process to ensure already prescribed schedule and deadlines specified in the environmental review process, reduce overhead, and eliminate waste and redundant documentation. GOODS MOVEMENT fa4639e1-a12b-4e97-89d0-f6d7a4f09901 Alameda County is a gateway to the world for goods movement. Its airport, Oakland International, is one of three in the region. The Port of Oakland, the nation's 5th busiest container port, is one of three Pacific Coast gateways with maritime, rail and aviation freight activities. The Port of Oakland is a key economic asset for Alameda County, the greater San Francisco Bay Region and neighboring regions. It supports more than 73,000 jobs in the region and its activities are connected to 827,000 jobs across the United States. As an intermodal operation, port activities impact regional and inter-regional streets, rural roads and highway, rail corridors and waterways. Planning and implementation is underway for future expansion of the Port of Oakland to support its activities and for improvements to the transportation network system. The Alameda County Transportation Commission (ACTC) is developing the first Countywide Good Movement Plan. The Plan also outlines a long-range strategy for how to move goods efficiently, reliably and sustainably within, to, from and through Alameda County by roads, rail, bridge, air and water. Because a substantial amount of good movement occurs on local streets and roads throughout Alameda County, the plan also addresses impacts to transportation infrastructure. Challenges faced on the local streets and roads include lack of truck route connectivity across city boundaries, providing safe access by all local streets and road users (autos, pedestrians, bicyclists and public transit) and cut through traffic on rural roads to avoid congestion on major corridors. Additionally, truck traffic on local streets and rural roads designed to accommodate vehicles is resulting in pavement damage and impacting the livability and quality of life for the residents living adjacent to these goods movement corridors. The County supports policies and legislation that would: Expand Goods Movement Funding and Policy Development. Develop policies that preserve and strengthen an integrated and connected multimodal goods movement system, support freight mobility and access, and are coordinated with passenger transportation systems and local land use decisions. Improve Goods Movement Infrastructure. The County supports legislation, policies and funding to study, plan, fund and implement improvements for a safe, efficient, resilient and well-maintained goods movement facilities and corridors. The County also supports legislation, policies and funding to study, plan and design safety improvements along local streets and rural roads to accommodate the increasing goods movement PAGE | 76 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countytraffic, including driveway consolidation for truck access to wineries, left-turn pockets and truck deceleration lanes. Identify Goods Movement Funding Stream. Identifying a funding stream for goods movements to maintain and improve the goods movement infrastructure. Develop supports programs that reduce and mitigate impacts from goods movement operations to create a healthy and clean environment and support improved quality-of-life for people most impacted by goods movement. Prioritize of Bay Area Transportation Systems. The County supports legislation and policies that prioritize the Bay Area transportation systems in both State and federal planning and funding processes. PUBLIC TRANSIT d5ed9c26-693e-4b70-b083-3c1d7ea407b5 With the passage of AB 32 and SB 375 that require the reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG) and the integration of transportation, land use and housing planning, California is on the forefront of built environment policies. The implementation of these two bills at the regional and local level can have an impact on planning decisions in local communities to reduce GHG and improve health. Transportation funding should support all modes and all users and not promote highway expansions to ensure the long-term effectiveness in reducing GHG and improving overall health. In addition to reducing the number of vehicle miles driven, public transit also encourages more active transportation like walking and biking as people get to and from their bus or train, which helps to make an impact on the obesity epidemic. Access to affordable and reliable public transit is particularly vital to health for low- income communities, youth, seniors, and people with disabilities that rely on it to get to jobs, school, and medical appointments and to visit family members and other support systems. The opportunity for social interaction and access to jobs increases and the reliance on air polluting vehicles decreases when jobs and services are placed close to homes with accessible and affordable public transit options. The County supports the following policies to increase access to public transit: Prioritize Increased Funding for Public Transit . Dedicate a higher proportion of existing transportation funding streams to increase the availability, accessibility, reliability, and affordability of public transit options, particularly local buses, as well as connectivity to regional rail systems by walking and biking. The County also supports increased funds to upgrade unsafe infrastructure. Prioritize Funding for Low-Income and Transit-Dependent Populations . Direct public transit funds to uses which benefit low-income populations and transit dependent populations, such as seniors, youth and people with disabilities, including maintaining and improving local transit service levels, improving affordability through free and reduced fare programs, and the coordination of alternative transportation options as part of a mobility management strategy. Prioritize Transit-Oriented Development Over Urban Sprawl . Increase housing density in urban areas, rather than suburban and rural areas, increase housing and transit affordability for low-income communities with anti-displacement protections, reduce parking requirements and locate housing and jobs near rail and bus lines. In addition, the County supports the inclusion of anti-displacement provisions and protections in transit- oriented development projects, in order to support the ability of existing residents to stay and benefit from improvements in their neighborhoods. Prioritize Greenhouse Gas Reduction Goal-setting and Funds for Vulnerable Communities. Increasing greenhouse gas reduction goals and support policies and funding that benefit health and well-being for communities facing environmental hazards, health burdens, high levels of neighborhood poverty and other vulnerabilities. In addition, the County supports prioritizing transportation policies and projects that have greater benefits than burdens for vulnerable communities and which minimize unintended consequences, such as displacement. PAGE | 77 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda CountySUPPORT FOR REGIONAL AND INTER-REGIONAL PARTNERSHIPS AND PROJECTS 12c4d859-9657-4845-8c1a-a7f85b0a859a With 20% percent of the population, Alameda County experiences 40% of the traffic congestion within the nine- county San Francisco Bay Area region. Intersected by numerous inter-regional highway corridors which serve as gateways into the region, Alameda County has a robust transportation infrastructure including local streets and roads, freight corridors, express lane implementation and transit systems. Through regional coordination and funding partnerships at all levels of government, a significant investment to improve transportation infrastructure occurred county-wide in recent years. Alameda County supports and encourages continued cross-jurisdictional partnerships to deliver transportation projects and programs to its constituents. Since 1986, Alameda County and its 14 cities have been recipients of a county-wide, voter-approved sales tax measure dedicated to transportation investments throughout Alameda County. The County supports policies and legislation that would: Expand Partnerships. Encourage and promote regional and megaregional cooperation and coordination to develop, promote and fund solutions to transportation infrastructure improvement and support governmental efficiencies and cost savings in transportation. These are essential to complete planning and development of important regional transportation projects that benefit the State and local road system including rural roadways such as Crow Canyon Road, Vasco Road, Tesla Road and Patterson Pass Road in unincorporated Alameda County. The County also supports efforts that encourage and facilitate the establishment of public- private partnerships and low-cost financing strategies. Policy Development. Develop policies which collaboratively influence transportation planning, policy and funding at the county, regional, State and federal levels. Express/HOT (high-occupancy toll) Lane Expansion. The County supports Express/HOT Lane expansion in Alameda County and the Bay Area. EDUCATION d589dda8-facc-4d4e-bd62-252f3ebe4197 To promote equity and ensure a bright future for all children, the County supports State-level education policies that achieve the following across the life course: Increase funding in State Budget for primary and secondary education, and prioritize resources for low-income students of color. Create increased and more equitable funding for education to increase reading proficiency, particularly for third-grade students of color, increase transparency and promote family engagement, while ensuring fair taxation for residents and businesses. Elementary school investment should include increased funding for arts, music, physical education, college mentoring, parent engagement, academic tutoring and after-school enrichment programs. Secondary school investment should focus on the creation and expansion of programs and higher education partnerships with public and private employment sectors to increase internships, college and career preparedness and policies with special emphasis and support for adoption and funding of Linked Learning; more flexible adult education, particularly to support transitioning youth released from probation through support of Transition Center services, allowing youth to finish credits towards receiving high school diplomas and improving the connection with school districts within County; in addition to increasing educational opportunities for people formerly incarcerated. As the Local Control Funding Formula is implemented, ensure adequate funding to build data capacity in districts and stronger accountability measures that demonstrate supplemental funds for low-income students, English language learners, and foster youth are spent on programs and services that address their needs and improve educational outcomes. Support policies and increased funding to ensure all high school students graduate college and career ready. For those unable to graduate, support policies that assure the highest level of training that result in better employment outcomes, including obtaining a GED, alternative schools or programs or other pathways to receive high school PAGE | 78 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countydiploma credits, such as Civic Corps and on the job work experience. Prepare high school students for college and career while providing wraparound support, reduce disproportionate graduation and drop-out rates and expand Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education in low-income communities and communities of color. The County supports creating more opportunities for sustainable funding streams for Linked Learning, career pathways and career technical training, such as the California Career Pathway Trust Fund, particularly for low-income students of color, students with disabilities, foster youth, and boys of color. Increase funding, access and affordability of post-secondary education and provide debt management assistance. Support policies and funding that strengthen the community college system and remove barriers to educational opportunities, including policies that ensure affordable tuition and reduce the burden of student debt. The demand for higher education in California exceeds the capacity of State and community college systems gateways to higher education and economic opportunity are particularly critical for low-income communities and students of color. Student aid and family incomes have not risen at the same rates as tuition, and as a result the dream of education is becoming more elusive. Eliminate inequities in funding and access to quality teachers, particularly for teachers of early childhood, special education, and Dual Language Learners. Increase investments in recruitment, retention and support of teachers through competitive salaries, high-quality mentoring, and ongoing professional development, especially among special education teachers, those in low-income schools, and teachers of English Language Learners. Increase professional development of administrators and teachers including training on restorative justice, diversity, inclusion, and mental health. Protect, stabilize and increase funding for Early Care and Education (ECE) and ECE professional development, including dedicated paid training days for staff at Title V-contracted centers. Require basic teaching credentials for teachers of students learning English face, who like special education students, face unique challenges to school success. Eliminate inequities to quality early childhood education access. Increase funding for early childhood education; adequately fund inclusive early childhood education classrooms. Increase state and federal efforts to subsidize early childhood programs, and improve the link between reimbursement rates for State-contracted programs and those funded with vouchers, and continue to expand funds for a Quality Rating and Improvement System for all Early Childhood Education programs. Increase funding to promote full service community schools and ensure all students are healthy and ready to learn. Support adoption of full service community schools, resources for coordination of learning supports (i.e. community school coordinators), and promotion of partnerships between youth, families, schools, community- based organizations, businesses, and other entities. Support increased funding for full service community schools through the adoption of comprehensive and sustainable education revenues and a reform package that establishes an equitable, adequate finance system, ensures transparency, continues to enable greater local decision-making flexibility, and strengthens human capital and accountability. Support efforts that increase access to violence prevention programs and services, including programs that promote healthy inter-personal relationships. Support policies that prevent the school to prison pipeline that disproportionately affects low income students of color and students with disabilities. Provide funding for programs and services that reduce chronic student absenteeism and truancy, particularly in schools with low academic performance and low-income students of color, particularly African American and Latino males. Provide funded mandates requiring schools track attendance data to create an absenteeism and truancy early warning system that identifies frequently absent children and connects students and their families with comprehensive, wraparound interventions such as coordinated medical care, behavioral and mental health services, youth development programs, and parent, family, and community engagement programs. Increase funding for programs, such as male involvement programs and mentoring, that aim to reduce disparities for low-income students and students of color, particularly boys of color, in early literacy skills, graduation rates, and dropout rates. Ensure students with disabilities (including learning, emotional and physical) have equal access to educational PAGE | 79 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countyopportunities. Improve the identification rate of students with disabilities to promote equal access to education. Support policies to reinstate teaching credential requirements for special education teachers. Support policies and practices to eliminate and prevent the use of physical restraint, seclusion, and use of force and eliminate disproportionate suspension and expulsion rates among students of color and students with disabilities. Eliminate punitive and zero tolerance policies and preschool suspensions. The County supports legislation that promotes positive school climates and calls for funding three-tiered behavioral health supports (i.e., universal, targeted and individual supports), staff and teacher training and consultation for the creation of trauma/ healing-informed classrooms and schools to foster early intervention alternatives to expulsions, in-school and out- of-school suspensions, and reforms in suspension policies for defiance at all grade levels, particularly for African American students, and Latino and Pacific Islander males. The County supports policies that increase transparency, accountability and professional development of administrators and teachers including training on restorative justice, diversity, inclusion and mental health with a focus on trauma-informed care. Promote health and wellness among students to build healthy school environments. Increase access to safe, appropriate health, dental and mental health services within schools, including school-based health centers, particularly for students of color and students in families with mixed immigration status. The County supports policies that increase funding flexibility for County services and builds teacher and parental awareness on the issue of sexually exploited minors. The County supports comprehensive wellness policies that reduce chronic diseases (such as asthma and diabetes), communicable disease [such as sexually transmitted infections (STI's)], promotes programs aimed at decreasing teen pregnancy and STI's, particularly among youth of color who experience disproportionate rates of STI's, and policies that reduce childhood obesity and other physical activity and diet- related diseases. The County supports policies that create healthy school environments both on-campus and the surrounding neighborhoods, including policies that improve access to fresh and nutritious food in and around schools, prohibit unhealthy food vendors at or near schools, increase access to clean drinking water in schools, and prevent unnecessary exposure to environmental toxins. The County supports the inclusion of youth in decision- making processes, including former probation youth and foster youth. IMMIGRATION e48c9b65-a0ea-4171-b48d-9512c8ce7958 Alameda County supports state-level policies that achieve the following: Increase access to culturally and linguistically appropriate health and behavioral health care among immigrants, including unaccompanied immigrant youth. The County supports legislation that increases equitable access to quality, affordable health care coverage and services and includes undocumented immigrants not covered by the Affordable Care Act, and promotes culturally and linguistically appropriate care. The County supports policies and funding to reduce barriers to enrollment of undocumented immigrant adults and children in Medi-Cal. The County supports policies that provide a \"No Wrong Door\" fund for school and community-based Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) providers. Support policies and efforts to streamline, integrate and coordinate services and providers, such as a one-stop approach to services to increase access to care for immigrants. Eliminate harmful local impacts of federal immigration policy and increase access to legal services. The County supports policies that ensure a separation between local law enforcement and the federal deportation system which lacks due process to address the public safety, civil liberties, local resource burden and accountability and transparency issues related to the federal Secure Communities (S-Comm) and its reboot, Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), and other deportation programs, and support policies that limit transfers and holds in local jails and eliminate the fear of deportation such as in the Transparent Review of Unjust Transfers and Holds (TRUTH) Act of 2016 (AB 2792) and the TRUST Act of 2014 (AB 4).Support policies and programs that ensure the right to an attorney during immigration proceedings for immigrant adults, families and unaccompanied immigrant youth and funding to ensure the provision of free legal assistance. Increase access to education, including higher education and adult education. The County supports PAGE | 80 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countylegislation that increases primary and secondary school resources for students with Limited English Proficiency, as well as English as a Second Language for adults. The County also supports policies that increase access to post-secondary education through access to subsidized loans, such as a statewide version of the DREAM Act. Protect against racial profiling based on \"perceived\" immigration status, ethnicity, religion, or national origin. The County supports legislation, such as AB 524, signed into law on Oct. 5, 2013 that identifies and eliminates racial profiling in the public and private sectors. Such actions could include ensuring that the new license for immigrants without authorization (created through AB 60, signed Oct. 4, 2013) is honored by local government, including libraries and banks. Protect the health and welfare of children and children whose parents are being detained or deported by Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) or Border Patrol. The County supports policies that emphasize the needs and welfare of children by prioritizing family unity, providing resources for unaccompanied immigrant minors, and creating appropriate, humanitarian, transparent, and accountable training policies and protocols for interacting with and screening children. Increase access to critical safety net services for immigrants. The County supports policies and funding to expand California Food Assistance Program eligibility to include all immigrants who meet all other program requirements including Deferred Action and residents on the path to permanent residence. Promote public safety by ensuring that reporting crimes, including domestic violence, to local authorities, does not lead to deportation proceedings. Support funding for an evaluation of the new driver's license program established through AB 60 to ensure that it is not used by local law enforcement or other governmental agencies for racial profiling of people with the driver's license. Protect and promote the well-being of immigrant workers, including undocumented workers. The County supports legislation that protects immigrant workers, especially the vulnerable undocumented population, from wage theft, and extends important labor standards to jobs predominantly occupied by immigrants, such as migrant workers and domestic workers. State employment laws should protect all workers' labor and civil rights and restrict, rather than build on, a burdensome \"employer sanctions framework.\" Ensure nondiscriminatory, equal treatment under the law, and protect the confidentiality and privacy of individuals. The County supports actions that affirmatively extend access to public services and benefits for all residents, regardless of immigration status, and prohibits social services providers from reporting allegedly undocumented immigrants to authorities. This includes policies that prohibit landlords from threatening to report tenants to Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE). Due process should also be ensured for immigrants in federal and local detention facilities and those facing deportation. JOBS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 4318595c-d7ba-41cb-b27d-72dc7811781e CREATE A STRONG AND ROBUST JOB-DRIVEN SYSTEM 910eb5d5-e93d-4cdb-a8d6-0cbf366c7255 Invest in Systems and Policies that Support Workers and Employers Expand Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) Funding. WIOA is a federal law that reauthorized the nation's employment and training programs related to adult, youth, and dislocated workers, as well as adult education and vocational rehabilitation programs created under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA). Additional funding is needed to operationalize WIOA and achieve the goals of this legislation. Specifically, funding is needed to develop more coordinated training programs for job seekers that lead to industry recognized and valued credentials/certificates, enhance supportive services for job seekers, provide more stipends for youth participants in work-based learning programs, and enhance overall coordination between the Local Workforce Development Boards (LWDBs), California Community College Districts, Adult Schools/Adult Consortium, K-12 education, and Economic Development agencies. Invest in education that prepares individuals for the 21st century workforce. Alameda County supports the alignment of the education and workforce investment systems to meet the needs of the 21st century workforce PAGE | 81 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countyand promotes and develops a well-educated and highly-skilled workforce. A special effort should be made to support education in the Science, Technology, Education, and Math (STEM) areas and pathways to careers in high-growth sectors. Support fair and sustainable wages. Alameda County supports policies that aim to create livable wages, promote income mobility, and close the gender and racial wage gaps. Promote job creation and economic development. Alameda County supports policies and programs that create local jobs. Specifically, tax incentives, innovative funding mechanisms to support public/private partnerships, waivers, support for small businesses and entrepreneurs, and policies that promote/support locally-made products. Policies should increase resources for \"proactive\" business assistance programs that prevent closures and mitigate job loss. Support integrated employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities in alignment with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Alameda County supports policies and programs that provide integrated employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities and proper accommodations and supports in the workplace. Extend workplace rights, protections, and resources to all victims of crime. All victims should be treated with dignity and respect by their employer and should have access to reasonable time off to receive medical treatment and recover from the crime. Support resources and policies that promote workforce alignment activities articulated in the Alameda County Regional and Local Plan. Alameda County supports and reaffirms the Regional and Local Plan of the Alameda County Workforce Development Board (ACWDB), which acts as a strategic road map for the implementation of the WIOA program via collaborative partnerships that strengthen training outcomes and services to job seekers and increase employer engagement in Alameda County. Ensure the systematic inclusion of the Local Workforce Development Boards (LWDBs) in the implementation and planning for, the Strong Workforce Initiative. The Strong Workforce Initiative grew out of AB 1602 (Statues of 2015) and $200 million was included in the 2016-2017 budget. The Strong Workforce Program places emphasis on the expansion of quality Career Technical Education leading to the attainment of industry-valued middle skill credentials as a proven path to social and economic mobility and career advancement. This program aligns with WIOA and it is vital that LWDBs are included at the table with adult school, economic development, K-12, and industry leaders to inform course offerings, develop training programs, and align efforts to reduce duplication of service to students and job seekers. Support local hire policies . Alameda County supports expanding and promoting local hire policies, including precluding State agencies or departments from authorizing call-center contracts for public assistance or health benefit programs if they hire employees outside California to perform the work. Support small businesses in ramping up to fully implement the $15/hour minimum wage in California. Ala meda County supports working collaboratively with Economic Development agencies to provide technical assistance to small businesses, as the minimum wage hike may affect small businesses and the workers within those small businesses more profoundly. Supporting small businesses in this way may minimize the impact on workers who may otherwise be at risk for being laid off as a result of the minimum wage increases. Support Individuals with Barriers to Employment Support policies that create employment and educational opportunities for long-term unemployed workers, discouraged workers, individuals with disabilities, returning/re-entry populations, low-income adults, and at-risk youth. Alameda County supports subsidized employment, supportive services, summer and year-round employment opportunities for youth (including youth in foster care), and programs and supports to help low-income adults, CalWORKs clients, Limited English Proficient (LEP) clients, formerly incarcerated individuals, and discouraged workers obtain education and training leading to jobs, experience, and industry recognized and valued credentials. Support programs that develop and/or enhance employment and educational services to Limited English Proficient (LEP) and immigrants populations. Alameda County supports programs that create access to PAGE | 82 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countyemployment, training, and supportive services for LEP and immigrant populations, as well as legislation that promotes the alignment between WIOA and the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act programs, to support the educational attainment of immigrant and foreign-born individuals. Policies should support the partnership between the LWDBs and entities carrying out DREAM Act programs. Support and expand workforce development efforts that promote career pathways and address racial, cultural, and economic disparities in employment and achievement . Alameda County supports programs and policies that help prepare and integrate communities of color, individuals experiencing homelessness, low- income immigrant and migrant workers, older workers, individuals with disabilities, formerly incarcerated individuals, veterans, and other individuals with barriers to employment into the workforce. Expand support of Adult Schools and programs that offer basic and remedial skill attainment for individuals who need on-ramps into sustainable-wage careers. Alameda County supports programs and initiatives that aim to help individuals who need basic skills training in order to be successful. Increase employment opportunities for older adults and individuals with disabilities. Alameda County supports policies that help older adults and individuals with disabilities access training and employment opportunities that lead to competitive and integrated employment. Specifically, we support policies such as subsidized employment or tax incentives that encourage employers to hire older adults and individuals with disabilities. Remove the criminal background check requirement from initial job application requirements . Economic opportunity is greatly diminished for formerly incarcerated individuals (who are disproportionately people of color) because of employment discrimination against people with criminal records. California and the federal government should pass broad \"Ban the Box\" legislation that requires an employer to determine a job applicant's minimum qualifications before obtaining and considering information regarding the applicant's conviction history. Extend and expand tax credits for employers who hire and retain individuals with barriers to employment. Specifically, Alameda County supports the Workforce Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC), a federal tax credit available to employers who hire and retain veterans and individuals from other target groups with significant barriers to employment. Alameda County supports extending and expanding the WOTC and other similar tax incentives for employers. Align and leverage workforce programs and job opportunities for re-entry /formerly incarcerated populations. Alameda County supports the alignment with other agencies and existing programs, like AB 109 programs, to expand access and retention in work and employment-related activities, as well as supportive services using promising practices and models that work. Expand Opportunities for Youth Invest in intensive summer programs geared toward work readiness and STEM-related occupations. Work- readiness programs geared toward STEM-related occupations, and/or other in-demand occupations, combine work with learning and provides valuable opportunities for youth to stay engaged in summer learning. Additionally, when youth are engaged in the summer, they may gain exposure to a variety of industries and career paths, while also learning skills that can help them succeed during the academic school. Support and expand programs that serve young people. Alameda County supports investments in programs and services targeted at young people both in and out-of-school to assist them in their career and educational development. Specifically, programs should target young people who have left school, foster youth, homeless youth, juvenile justice involved youth, and other youth with barriers to employment. Support Career Technical Education programs and Career Pathway Program initiatives. Alameda County supports extensions to Career Technical Education programs and initiatives that strengthen the partnerships and linkages between regional workforce bodies and educational institutions to prepare students for college and employment, and to help students create career pathways. PAGE | 83 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda CountyIMPROVING HEALTH OUTCOMES BY ADDRESSING SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS af8a77b5-e71b-4417-9340-32e47ec21e28 The County supports the following policies in order to improve the economic and health outcomes of all its residents: Enact a higher state minimum wage. Increasing the income of low-wage workers is fundamental to positive health outcomes because it provides access to important health-enabling resources, including proper nutrition, good medical care, stable health insurance, and favorable housing \u2014 all of which can be leveraged to avoid risks and protect health. Create policy that closes loopholes and includes cost of living increases. State services that are dependent on fixed rates should be adequately funded to ensure continued service provision. Protect worker health and safety. Strengthen existing laws and enforcement for worker health and safety, including paid sick days and family leave. Support policies to ensure healthy and safe working conditions and to prevent unnecessary harmful exposures for all workers. Protect and expand workers' rights. Enact State legislation that protects and strengthens workers' right to organize and collectively bargain. This includes protecting the rights of temporary and contingent workers and support for policies that require fair and stable work schedules. Support efforts to educate workers, including youth and immigrants, about worker rights. Restore civil rights protections and reduce barriers for formerly incarcerated people in the workplace. Formerly incarcerated individuals often struggle to access quality employment because of barriers maintained by State policy. The County supports policies that enable formerly incarcerated individuals to access quality jobs and economic stability. Increase access to entrepreneurship opportunities. (1) Support microenterprise through policies that support community-based non-profit microenterprise and financial organizations that support entrepreneurs, expand access to private markets and sources of capital, and establish supportive tax environments; (2) Support co-operatives and create incentives for employee ownership through State policies that promote sound business conversion to cooperative business models, including but not limited to Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOPs), tax incentives and mandated assistance, as well as removing barriers to starting co-operative businesses; and (3) Support policies that expand access to capital among entrepreneurs of color and people with disabilities, such as working with the State to use its contracts with financial institutions to increase lending and extension of credit in low income communities and communities of color. Improve the quality of low-wage jobs and provide pathways to middle-wage jobs. Enforce labor laws, including enforcing against misclassification of workers and preventing wage theft. Undocumented workers have the highest rates of wage and hour violations and must be included in prevention efforts. Support strategies to coordinate sector-based training programs and pipelines from apprenticeships and credentialing programs to industries with job growth, including replacement jobs for retirees. Expand and reform Unemployment Insurance (UI). Outmoded eligibility rules mean that unemployment benefits are out of reach for many unemployed workers. In particular, State UI programs, which determine most of the rules that govern eligibility for benefits, have left low-wage workers, women and part-time workers struggling to qualify for the program. Other growing segments of the workforce also fall through the cracks, including temporary workers, older workers and immigrant workers. Support expansion and reform of the UI system. Ensure equitable taxation. Tax code benefits accrue to the wealthiest 5 percent of taxpayers and largely miss the asset-poor majority in this country. Meaningful incentives to save for residents of all income groups should be provided, and the tax system should benefit all residents equally. Successful tax credits, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) should be expanded to continue lifting California residents out of poverty. Use government purchasing and contracting to promote living wage work. Government spending can be used to shift more industries to provide better wages and benefits through approaches like living wage standards and \"best value\" bid evaluation systems that recognize the benefits to both taxpayers and working PAGE | 84 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countyfamilies. In addition, the County supports supplier diversity policies which require businesses to engage in proactive and measureable efforts to provide diverse suppliers equal access to contracting opportunities. Support asset and wealth-building efforts while regulating against unfair financial practices. Policies and practices that prevent predatory financial practices, increase access to quality financial services and products, and support financial literacy will help to build wealth. LOCAL GOVERNMENT 7f83036d-b7f9-4bf2-8a24-44beaa5b4b3b LOCAL JURISDICTION AND TAX SYSTEM 369961c6-cd8b-46f2-afec-e674adbb60c3 Support the guarantee of dependable, predictable, and equitable revenue streams to support programs needed by County residents. Support opportunities for increasing State revenues and expansion of the County's ability to generate local revenues. Support efforts to ensure local discretionary control over governance issues and the delivery of services. Support increased funding of the County's infrastructure needs to maintain and expand capital investments vital to economic development. Support the extension of Design-Build and Public Private Partnership authority for local governments and expand the existing public contract code definition of \"Project\" to allow more flexible use of these project delivery methodologies. Support legislation that maintains or increases levels of State funding for mandated programs and services to meet the increased costs of delivering programs and services. Support legislation to require the State to provide ongoing, guaranteed funding to counties and other local governments for the cost of providing services that were shifted in the 2011 Realignment from the State to local government. Support Marketplace Equity and Consumer Protection. Weights and Measure programs are important to businesses and consumers in Alameda County and throughout California. These programs ensure that there is a \"level playing field\" for business and industries. Likewise, these programs are critical in providing protection for consumers and a method for making value comparisons by safeguarding equity in the marketplace. Support equitable taxation, a tax system that benefits all residents equally and can serve to reduce poverty by expanding the State Earned Income Tax credit and reforming Proposition 13 by creating a Split Roll Property Tax that would require businesses to pay a higher share of property taxes. Support legislation that ensures cannabis, whether for recreational or medical use, remains a taxable commodity and the county retains its local taxing authority and receives tax revenue from this source. Support State and Federal funding for infrastructure investments that improve seismic safety of essential government facilities. Oppose State budget actions that result in a negative impact to Alameda County. Oppose the shift of any further property taxes. Oppose the transfer of programs from the State to counties unless program control and flexibility are also shifted and adequate State funding is guaranteed. FLOOD CONTROL AND WATER RESOURCES ba503b6d-46eb-4263-af42-3d8176dfebfe INCREASED FUNDING FOR FLOOD PROTECTION 46b84b2f-fe0d-4234-a486-f5652e2e5d77 Continued protection from flooding and protecting its natural resources in Alameda County requires legislative remedies including increased funding for flood protection, levee repairs and wetland restoration projects, and developing adaptive strategies to climate change and sea level rise. To address new requirements by the State Agencies, funding is needed for both planning and construction of capital improvement projects. PAGE | 85 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda CountyThe County supports policies and legislation that would: Ensure Consistency Between State and Federal Definitions. The State Water Resources Control Board's proposed Wetland and Riparian Protection Policy includes different terms and definitions of wetlands. The County supports legislation and policies that would ensure consistency between federal and State definitions of wetlands and result in a reasonable requirement that will have the least impact on the development, operation, and maintenance of essential public works projects and facilities. Ensure Levee Funding. Identify additional funding sources and opportunities to ensure levee maintenance in Alameda County, including repair and reconstruction after a flood event. Include Local Flood Control Projects in Voter-Approved Bonds. The State issues bonds to fund flood control projects throughout California, however, projects in Alameda County have not been included. The County supports legislative changes which allow for the inclusion of local flood control projects to be included for funding provided by from voter-approved bonds. Ensure Climate Change Resiliency. Identify State and federal funding to study, design and implement coastal flood protection solutions to protect Alameda County residents from effects of sea level rise, extreme tides due to climate change. Facilitate and establish partnerships among local, State and federal agencies to promote protection from floods and climate change adaptation and resiliency. STREAMLINE THE REGULATORY AND PROJECT DELIVERY PROCESS 50183cf9-13fd-4cc8-9126-3246e2b13ced Regulatory inefficiencies continue to hamper the effective and timely delivery of flood control projects. Delivery of flood control projects is bogged down by the multiple redundant and overlapping regulatory agency approval processes, long time frames, and required reports and mitigation that do not add significantly to improving the environment yet result in costly project delivery costs. To this end, Alameda County seeks legislative remedies to eliminate regulatory redundancies, streamline regulatory burdens and advocate for funding to support adequate staffing levels at the local, State, and federal regulatory agencies. The County supports policies and legislation that would streamline the regulatory and project delivery process by: Encourage Service Agreements. Allow and encourage State and federal regulatory agencies to offer service agreements public entity applicants and permittees to fund additional personnel or contractors needed for expeditious permit processing. Include Mandated Response Timelines in Review and Approval Process. Improve the State environmental review and regulatory approval processes by mandating specific timeframes for State reviews and approvals of permits to expedite project delivery while ensuring appropriate environmental protection and mitigation. Approve the CEQA-NEPA Reciprocity Pilot Program. Approve the CEQA-NEPA reciprocity pilot program builds on California's successful implementation of the Surface Transportation Project Delivery Program, and allow for even greater project streamlining to enhance efficiency in flood control projects. Eliminate Redundancy. Eliminate the redundant processes and required reviews between State agencies such as Fish and Wildlife Services, Water Quality Control Board, and the Bay Costal Development Commission which cause extensive delays in project delivery. Identify Review Process Enhancements. Provide expedited review for projects that are consistent with an adopted Sustainability Communities Strategy to dramatically reduce processing and approval timeframes. Exempt maintenance projects and activities on existing flood control facilities and infrastructure from permit requirements under the Endangered Species Act. Encourage Partnerships. Facilitate and establish local, State and federal agency partnerships among stakeholders focused on habitat restoration/resource protection including developing adaptive strategies to climate change and sea level rise. PAGE | 86 State Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda CountyFederal Legislative Priorities 4097e977-9907-4124-8dd8-87f4245cd0bd PAGE | 87HUMAN SERVICES 030931be-e16f-4402-ac57-f3eaf0c9fb8f CREATE A HUMAN SERVICES SYSTEM THAT IS RESPONSIVE TO COMMUNITY NEEDS 34ed1d33-b26c-4b9f-badf-57c99e26c0fb Low-income individuals and families need restoration of critical benefits, increased flexibility, expansion of programs that work, and the simplification/streamlining of processes and systems to ensure they are able to access all the benefits for which they are eligible. Alameda County supports public policies that strengthen the social safety net for the most vulnerable while also advancing economic prosperity and equity so that all individuals, children, and families have the opportunity to succeed. Better Facilitate Access to Benefits Streamline and integrate public assistance benefits enrollment. Support policies and systems that make it easier for individuals and families to have access to, apply for, utilize, retain, and recertify for benefits, including CalWORKs, CalFresh, General Assistance, and Medi-Cal. Maintain continuity of benefits . Enact policies that help individuals and families maintain coverage and benefits. Specifically, we support automatic renewals for families living on a fixed income or households who are highly unlikely to experience changes in income that could terminate eligibility. Whenever possible, benefit renewal dates should be aligned across different programs to make it easier for clients. Support technological advancements that promote access to services and administrative efficiencies. Promote and utilize technology to streamline benefits enrollment, such as auto-enrolling clients and encouraging the use of self-service tools. Expand and leverage data-sharing agreements. Improve policies and systems to make it easier for agencies to share data to better serve clients. Focus on Effective Implementation and Staff Training Reasonable timelines and funding for implementation of new policies/procedures. The State should work with stakeholders, including counties, when determining timelines and funding for rolling out new policies and procedures. Ensure there is a training region for computer systems. Staff trainers need the ability to create test cases to avoid breaching confidentiality when teaching workers. The State should make sure there is a dedicated training region for each of the systems used for human services programs. Include training funding as part of new laws/changes. Standardize all new laws or changes that impact the practice of human services programs to include training funding. Resources to train staff are vital to successful implementation of program changes. Create a statewide workgroup for trainers/staff development managers. This forum would allow for sharing across the State on best practices and facilitate better collaboration. Increase Access to Safe, Affordable Housing Increase supports for affordable housing and homelessness prevention. Alameda County supports a range of policies and programs that prevent and resolve homelessness and housing instability. We support evidence- based programs, including housing first, rapid re-housing, long-term housing subsidies, and models that include wrap-around transitional housing and housing support services. Additionally, we support polices to end housing discrimination. Increase supports and services for individuals and families experiencing homelessness. Alameda County supports funding and policies that ensure adequate emergency shelter. Investments in supportive housing result in the decreased use of homeless shelters, hospitals, emergency rooms, jails, and prisons. PAGE | 88 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda CountyFor additional homelessness and housing priorities, please see the Planning, Land Use, and Housing and Community Development Chapter. Better Serve Boys and Men of Color and Fathers Create and expand ladders of opportunity for boys and men of color. President Obama launched the My Brother's Keeper Initiative, which aims to address persistent opportunity gaps faced by boys and young men of color and to ensure that all young people can reach their full potential. Alameda County supports this Initiative and policies and partnerships that focus on addressing critical challenges, risk factors, and opportunities at key life stages to improve long-term outcomes and create ladders of opportunity for all young people. Promote fatherhood and father-friendly practices. Better serving fathers and men as partners in their families and communities results in significant benefits in terms of child development/well-being, public health, community cohesion, and economic development/prosperity. Alameda County supports President Obama's Fatherhood and Mentoring Initiative along with policies to develop demonstration programs to test father- friendly program designs that solicit and facilitate father engagement. Achieve Racial Equity and Advance Opportunities for All Support public policies and practices that eliminate racial disparities and ensure equitable opportunities and better futures for all Alameda County residents. Policies and practices should promote equity and reduce disparities based on race, ethnicity, sovereignty, national origin, immigration status, gender, sexual orientation/gender identity, age, disability status, and socioeconomic status. Policies should address all forms of racism, particularly institutional and structural racism, which have played a central role historically and currently in creating and perpetuating persistent social and health inequities. Promote Economic Stability and Wealth Building Asset building policies and programs include a range of opportunities including matched-saving accounts, homeownership assistance, financial education, free tax preparation, access to affordable financial services, and credit building products and services. Broadening savings and asset ownership opportunities will help move families and individuals from just breaking even to actually getting ahead. Remove asset limits for public assistance benefits. Asset limits create disincentives for low-income families to save money for emergencies. Policies should promote savings and ensure individuals and families do not have to spend down any cushion they have before qualifying for public assistance. Maintain and expand savings programs. Policies should help low-income individuals and families accumulate assets through increased savings and investments. Alameda County supports a variety of savings accounts and incentive programs that are designed to help low-income individuals build assets and opportunities (such as Individual Development Accounts (IDAs), Children's Savings Accounts, and retirement accounts). Restrict payday lending and other predatory financial products and services. Alameda County supports policies that protect consumers from predatory credit products, specifically by prohibiting, or capping rates on, payday loans and promoting low-cost, consumer friendly, alternatives. Expand the presence of mainstream financial institutions in underserved communities. Many neighborhoods lack access to mainstream financial institutions and instead rely on predatory lenders, such as check cashers, payday lenders, and pawn shops that drain millions of dollars from communities through high fees and usurious loans. Alameda County supports efforts to encourage safe, affordable financial products that protect income and assets. Expand access to credit and capital. Difficulty accessing financial services, affordable credit, and investment capital has long been a problem, especially in low-income and historically disinvested communities. Alameda PAGE | 89 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda CountyCounty supports efforts to help low-income individuals and communities gain access to low-cost financial products and services, high-return savings products, and investment capital that meet the specific needs of economically underserved communities. Protect assets and savings. Alameda County supports policies that preserve assets and protect individuals and families from predatory practices. Specifically, protections for student loan borrowers and policies that promote access to education, lessen student debt burdens, and make loan repayment more manageable. Defaulting on a student loan can ruin a borrower's credit and impact future opportunities. Promote retirement savings . Less than half of California's private sector workers have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan. Alameda County supports State and federal policies that promote retirement savings that make it easier to save. Expand federal tax credits for low-income and foster families. \u00b0 Expand the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Alameda County supports expanding this vital credit and ensuring low-income working families are able to keep more of their hard-earned money. \u00b0 Expand refundable tax credits. More federal tax credits (including the Child Tax Credit) should be fully refundable so that all low-income families, even those without a tax liability, can benefit from the credits. \u00b0 Implement a refundable tax credit for foster parents. This credit could help increase foster homes for children and youth. Reauthorize the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program and ensure adequate funding. The VITA program is a safe, effective, and free tax preparation service for low-and moderate-income individuals and families that helps them to keep more of their hard earned money and file accurate tax returns. Invest in Place-Based Initiatives Too many children in our communities are growing up in neighborhoods with no grocery stores, closed parks, and struggling schools. Recognizing that people and place are inextricably linked, place-based initiatives take a comprehensive approach to community development and aim to revitalize multiple aspects of neighborhood to create lasting change for its residents. Promote and expand place-based strategies that concentrate resources and investment in communities with the highest levels of need. Alameda County supports place-based economic investments that increase opportunity in low-income communities and communities of color. A place-based approach should include strategies to bring public benefits and services out into the community and to provide wealth building, wage subsidies, and job supports to residents. Support place-based initiatives. Alameda County supports increased place-based funding, specifically the Partnership for Sustainable Communities' Integrated Planning and Investment Grants Initiative, Promise Neighborhoods, Choice Neighborhoods, the Community Economic Development Program, the Healthy Food Financing Initiative, the Byrne Criminal Justice Innovation Grants, and the broader Promise Zones Initiative. Support neighborhood revitalization through the Promise Zone Initiative. This initiative aims to revitalize high-poverty communities by creating local jobs, spurring economic activity, improving educational opportunities, leveraging private investment, and reducing violent crime. Alameda County supports measures that create coordinated efforts to benefit designated Promise Zones, including: \u00b0 Priority for relevant federal funding opportunities from the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, Justice, Education, Agriculture, Labor, Commerce, and Transportation, Treasury, and others. \u00b0 Tax deductions for business property located within a community designated as a Promise Zone and employment tax credits for businesses that locate within Promise Zones and/or hire residents living in Promise Zones. PAGE | 90 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda CountyRESTORE AND ENHANCE SAFETY NET PROGRAMS 6750c545-53cf-4123-816a-4fcc8a1f1792 Strengthen Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Congress created the TANF block grant through the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, as part of a federal effort to \"end welfare as we know it.\" The TANF block grant provides funding to states that supports cash assistance programs and a wide range of other benefits and services for low-income families. Reauthorize TANF with a focus on alleviating poverty and preventing material hardship among children and families. TANF reauthorization should also focus on rebuilding partnership between the federal government, states, and counties to move forward with common goals. Specifically: \u00b0 Maintain and expand subsidized employment. Permanently authorize and appropriate funding for subsidized employment as enacted originally in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. \u00b0 Enhance employment and training services. Create effective pathways to economic opportunity including access to mainstream education, training, and individualized services for those with barriers to employment. \u00b0 Restore and enhance flexibility. State and county flexibility is vital to tailor work, training and family stabilization activities to families' individual needs. TANF reauthorization should measure states' performance in a fair and comprehensive manner that recognizes multiple potential positive outcomes for families. \u00b0 Eliminate asset limits and tests for TANF. The current asset limits create a disincentive for families to save and are contrary to the goals of TANF. Eliminating asset tests reduces administrative costs and promotes savings and self-sufficiency. \u00b0 Remove the lifetime ban for anyone convicted of a drug-related felony. Restoring access to these benefits will not only improve outcomes for very vulnerable families, but also improve public safety by increasing the opportunity for employment and financial stability and reducing the risks of reoffending. \u00b0 Restore benefits to immigrants . 1996 TANF legislation imposed a five-year ban on federal means-tested benefits for legal immigrants. Alameda County supports restoring those benefits and ensuring documented immigrants have access to basic assistance, including health care and nutrition supports. \u00b0 Increase funding for TANF. The TANF block grant has been set at $16.5 billion each year since 1996; as a result, its real value has fallen by one-third due to inflation. \u00b0 Eliminate the \"marriage penalty .\" Currently, two-parent households have a higher hourly participation requirement and states are required to achieve a 90 percent work participation rate for these families. Alameda County supports eliminating these additional requirements to allow for more flexibility in serving two-parent families. \u00b0 Maintain contingency funding for TANF. In times of economic downturn, contingency funds are essential for states to serve all families in need. \u00b0 Expand the time limit for TANF. The 60-month lifetime limit restricts the ability of those in the highest need to receive services and supports necessary to gain financial stability. Vulnerable families may need to return to aid due to economic downturns or new family hardships. Support Adults without Dependents Low-income childless adults are not eligible for most state or federal cash aid programs. A comprehensive approach is needed to strengthen the social safety net for all individuals, including those who are not caring for children. Increase State and federal supports for low-income adults without dependents . Alameda County supports policies that provide increased cash aid, employment assistance, and other supportive services for low-income PAGE | 91 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countyadults without dependents. Programs should recognize and address barriers to employment while also encouraging participation in the labor market to improve economic well-being. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) The SNAP/CalFresh program provides monthly benefits to eligible low-income individuals and families to purchase food. Alameda County supports strengthening SNAP and ensuring this vital program reaches families struggling with food insecurity. Specifically: Increase SNAP benefits and ensure access to critical nutrition support. Alameda County opposes any cuts to SNAP and supports benefit level increases. Ensure food access for adults without dependents. Under current federal law, certain unemployed individuals without dependents can face time limits of three months of SNAP benefits in any 36-month period. Alameda County opposes this rule. Until the rule is repealed, we support continued State and local waivers to ensure individuals are able to access critical food benefits. Identify opportunities to streamline and simplify. Alameda County supports efforts to streamline and simplify federal SNAP requirements to enhance enrollment and retention. Increase the minimum allotment . This is especially important for elderly and low-income households and should be increased. Maintain and provide additional flexibility. Allow states to align SNAP eligibility and processes with state TANF programs (and Medicaid).Alameda County supports program rules that allow state flexibility and streamlining, such as the expanded categorical eligibility and \"reverse express lane\" enrollment to automatically provide SNAP to Medicaid-eligible individuals. Remove existing bans for certain individuals. Alameda County supports restoring eligibility to all documented immigrants, dropping the lifetime ban on benefits for individuals with drug or violent crime felonies, and removing the time limits on receipt of SNAP for jobless adults. Increase outreach and nutrition education funding. Provide adequate resources to states and community partners for administration of SNAP outreach and nutrition education and the SNAP-Education program. Restore free Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) Point of Sale (POS) equipment for all retailers. As a result of cuts made in the 2014 Farm Bill, retailers are no longer offered free EBT equipment, supplies, and related services to participate in SNAP/CalFresh. Alameda County supports restoring access to EBT equipment to ensure SNAP recipients can access their benefits at a variety of retailers. Promote increased access to nutritious and affordable food in neighborhoods. Specifically, Alameda County supports the efforts to develop additional supermarkets and outlets in \"food deserts\" and to equip all farmers' markets with EBT capability. Improve timeliness of data. Specifically, data provided by the USDA Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) to states for use in administering SNAP. Support additional funding and flexibility for SNAP Employment and Training (E&T). Alameda County supports additional appropriations for SNAP E&T and policies and pilots that seek to improve employment outcomes for SNAP recipients. Child Nutrition Programs Expand access to summer meals. When school is not in session, many low-income children lose access to free and reduced-price school breakfasts, lunches, and afterschool snacks they rely on during the regular school year. Alameda County supports policies to coordinate and expand access to free meals during the summer months and connect kids to healthy nutrition assistance. Reauthorize and improve the Child Nutrition Act. This legislation oversees critical child nutrition programs, including school meals, summer meals, afterschool meal programs, and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Alameda County supports policies that make it easier for PAGE | 92 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countychildren and families to access nutrition programs and ensure adequate funding. Food Banks Support food banks. Alameda County supports efforts to help local food banks secure nutritious food. Specifically, expanding The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) bonus buys. Better Assist Immigrants, Refugees, and Asylees Currently a third of Alameda County residents are foreign-born. The existing system of services and providers who work with immigrants, refugees, and asylees is complicated and can be difficult to navigate and access. As one of eight Refugee-Impacted counties in California, Alameda County recognizes the unique needs of immigrant populations to access services, gain employment, and integrate into their new communities. Increase access to services for immigrants. Alameda County supports the expansion of benefits and services for immigrants, refugees, and asylees. In particular, immigrants need access to basic assistance, including health care and nutrition supports. Additional supports and services for refugees and asylees. Alameda County supports additional State and federal funding to expand services available to refugees and asylees. Specifically, we support increasing Refugee Cash Assistance payment levels, providing homelessness and housing supports, expanding employment and vocational training programs, and increasing other supportive services. For more information, please see the Immigration Chapter. ADVANCE FOSTER YOUTH WELL-BEING AND STRENGTHEN CHILD WELFARE SERVICES c1389cab-502c-4a11-a429-7d3326806278 The Alameda County Social Services Agency's Department of Children and Family Services serves children and youth who have experienced, or are at-risk of experiencing, abuse, or neglect. Enhance Services and Programs Alameda County supports a range of increases in child welfare funding and supportive services to improve the well-being of children Reform child welfare financing to focus on prevention activities. Alameda County supports changes to federal funding to provide states with the flexibility to make front-end investments in family services in order to reduce stays in foster care, rather than only funding services for children after they are placed in out-of- home care. Update Title IV-E eligibility requirements. Specifically, update the eligibility requirements associated with the so-called 1996 \"look-back\" provision of Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, so that more children are eligible for federal foster care assistance. Currently, children are only eligible for federal assistance if the family from which they are being removed would have been eligible for AFDC (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) under the program rules in 1996. Alameda County supports policy changes that update the requirements (perhaps through using an income limit that is based on the federal poverty level). Funding for services and income supports needed by parents seeking to reunify with their children who are in foster care. This could include: \u00b0 Funding for child care and housing \u00b0 Additional funding and policies to support the availability and quality of substance abuse programs for parents. Specifically, support of substance abuse family residential programs that allow for 1) an entire family, including both parents, to reside together, and 2) single fathers to reside in the program with their child(ren). Typically, residential programs do not allow the family to remain together, which causes additional trauma to children who must separate from one or both parents. Additional resources that could promote better outcomes for children . Examples include culturally relevant mental health services, educational supports, employment/linked learning opportunities, matched-savings PAGE | 93 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countyaccounts, developmental child care (including post-permanency), respite services for relative and foster caregivers, services and resources promoting father engagement, housing subsidies, and improved mental health service delivery to foster youth through the increased availability of licensed clinicians trained in empirically-based treatments for youth who have experienced trauma. The continued provision of flexible funding through the Title IV-E Waiver. The waivers have enabled counties to increase the use of community services to prevent child abuse and neglect and divert families away from formal child welfare services.This has increased permanence for children through strategies like family finding and engagement. Strengthen policies, services, and other resources to address the disproportionate presence of African American, Latino, and Native American children in foster care. Support leadership and funding to improve conditions in low-income communities of color that contain high levels of unemployment, crime, homelessness, substance abuse, and disproportionate experiences with the child welfare system. Increase funding to support counties in monitoring and providing services to foster youth who are authorized by the court to receive psychotropic medications. The children served by the foster care system have experienced severe trauma; for some, medication is appropriate when thoughtfully prescribed as part of an overall treatment plan that includes non-pharmacological interventions as well. Alameda County supports additional funding for behavioral health services for youth and to support counties in providing oversight and monitoring of psychotropic medications prescribed to foster youth. Expand child welfare funding and resources to populations with unique needs: \u00b0 Youth in foster care who are also parents. Parenting foster youth are in particular need of services that promote their educational attainment, parenting skills, and resources that support their transition to independence. \u00b0 Children of foster youth. Provide resources and supports for children of foster youth. In particular, Alameda County supports continuing to provide resources, including but not limited to an Infant Supplement, while the parent is temporarily away from placement but still caring for their child (for instance when they are living in a shelter). This change will help ensure food and other basic necessities to the infant until they both return to an eligible foster setting. \u00b0 Undocumented children of undocumented parents who are under child welfare supervision. Additional resources are needed to ensure that these families receive the necessary services to prevent the child from entering into or remaining in foster care. \u00b0 Families who speak a language other than English. Resources are needed to support counties in hiring additional bilingual staff to provide assistance to children and families in their preferred language. \u00b0 Support for children of incarcerated parents. Additional funding and programs that promote the health, safety, and well-being of the children of incarcerated parents and the efforts of parents to reunify with their children are needed. \u00b0 Parents and children with disabilities. Foster children with disabilities, their parents, and their caregivers need additional support to navigate systems and services that may meet their developmental, educational, and medical needs. Disabled parents also may need additional resources and support to access needed services. \u00b0 Commercially Sexually Exploited Children (see section below). Establish Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits for all eligible foster youth and allow those benefits to remain in suspense for the duration of their stay in foster care. Current law leads to situations where foster youth who are both disabled and from impoverished backgrounds risk being dropped from, or not able to access, SSI even though they meet other eligibility criteria. Alameda County supports policy changes that ensure all foster youth who are eligible can apply for SSI benefits and maintain their SSI eligibility throughout their involvement in foster care, without the need for an annual temporary suspension of the Title IV-E or federal payment. Support agreements with consulates and foreign governments for the protection of foster youth. Statewide agreements with foreign consulates and governments are needed to enhance the services PAGE | 94 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countyprovided to minors and their parents when the parent or child is a foreign national. These agreements should clarify the responsibilities between parties to protect the safety of minors during custody and dependency proceedings involving minors who have experienced abuse or neglect. Support Caregivers and Provide Permanency for Foster Youth Increase funding for foster and adoptive parent recruitment, training, and retention . Alameda County encourages additional support, funding, and other resources designed to increase the number of qualified caregivers available to provide stable and loving foster and adoptive homes. These changes will help to address what licensed foster parents and relative caregivers often cite as critical factors in deciding whether or not to serve as a foster parent: inadequate reimbursement rates, high costs of child care, and the lack of supportive services. Examples of potential supports and resources include: \u00b0 Increased funding for subsidized child care and respite care \u00b0 Funding for one-time expenses, such as a bed \u00b0 Specialized training and targeted support services, including those that offer in-home based services, for caregivers of foster youth with acute mental health needs or commercially sexually exploited children \u00b0 A statewide public education campaign to promote interest in foster parenting \u00b0 A refundable tax credit for foster parents Expand funding for post-placement services to support permanence for children who have left foster care through reunification, adoption, or guardianship. Policies should help maintain the child in their home and prevent reentry to foster care. For example, housing and child care assistance to help parents provide a safe and stable environment as well as supervision for their child(ren) while they are at work or school. There are limited housing and child care slots available through existing resources, and additional resources should be targeted specifically to these families. Other examples include substance abuse treatment and mental health services that are culturally responsive to the child and the adoptive parent or guardian. Provide Kin-GAP benefits to children whose relative guardianship was established in Probate Court . Although Probate Court guardianships with a non-relative can be eligible for Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) Foster Care payments, relative guardianships established in Probate Court do not qualify for Kin-GAP, even though many of these children have needs similar to youth who have a guardianship established in Juvenile Court. Providing Kin-GAP benefits to these probate guardianship youth will improve their transition to adulthood and may reduce their need for social services as an adult. Remove barriers to legal guardianship for youth. Current law doesn't allow for guardianships by Non- Relative Extended Family Members (NREFMs) and non-related foster parents for youth under age six. Alameda County supports providing statutory authorization for courts to establish guardianships when a NREFM is the caregiver to a child under age six or to a child within a sibling group with at least one sibling under age six, whenever the child is unable to return to their parent's or guardian's care. The intent of this change is not to divert children away from adoption but instead provide as many options available as possible to provide legal permanence for foster children. Continued support for policies and resources that meet the needs of LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning) foster youth. Alameda County encourages additional laws and policies, such as SB 731 (Statutes of 2015), that promote the protections of rights of foster youth who are LGBTQ. Resources are also needed to further the recruitment and retention of resource families that will provide effective care for LGBTQ youth. Support the enhancement and strengthening of connections between foster youth and persons in their support network. Additional resources and improved policies are needed that help maintain networks of service providers, family, and friends that serve the best interests of foster youth, even though they are not the parent or resource parent to the youth. These support networks are vital to the health and well-being of foster youth. Allow for continued benefits after age 18 for all former foster youth who exited from foster care to a PAGE | 95 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countyguardianship prior to their 18th birthday. Current law limits eligibility for these benefits based on the youth's age at the time the guardianship was established. These limits have created a disincentive for permanency for these children. Alameda County supports policies that extend Federal and State Kin-GAP (to relative guardians) and State AFDC-FC (to non-related guardians) benefits to age 21 for youth who otherwise meet eligibility criteria except for the age at which the guardianship was established. Improve Assistance and Services for Transition-Age Youth Additional supports and programs for transition-age foster youth (ages 14 - 21). In October 2010, California passed AB 12, also known as the California Fostering Connections to Success Act, in response to the federal Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act (Public Law 110-351). AB 12 changed foster care significantly by optionally extending foster care until age 21. Although some transition-age foster youth now have the benefit of extended foster care, these youth often remain in need of additional funding, policies, and programs that support their transition out of foster care and into independent adulthood. Specifically, Alameda County supports: \u00b0 Increased financial support for programs that assist foster youth in the transition to financial stability . Examples include post-emancipation assistance such as secondary education, job training, housing, and access to health care. \u00b0 Additional funding for safe and stable housing and supportive services such as substance abuse or mental health treatment. There is a specific need for financial support of a continuum of care of substance abuse programs for minors. \u00b0 Flexibility with placement requirements for non-minor dependents (NMDs) in Extended Foster Care who are in need of in-patient substance abuse treatment. If a NMD's temporary stay in an in-patient facility could be considered a Supervised Independent Living Placement, for example, this would allow the otherwise eligible youth to remain in Extended Foster Care and receive related services that support their transition to independence, rather than forcing their exit from care. Expand Independent Living Program (ILP) eligibility to include older youth in Family Maintenance . Youth who are nearing adulthood (age 16 - 18) and receiving in-home child welfare services, such as Family Maintenance, are in need of services supporting their transition to independence as healthy and responsible adults. An expansion of eligibility requirements for ILP funds could allow for the provision of services to these youth. Provide counties funding to fulfill credit report monitoring and assistance activities to foster youth. Identity theft is a major concern for youth in foster care and can destroy their credit. For foster children who \"age out\" of the system as young adults, the consequences of identity theft are particularly devastating and can make it difficult to rent an apartment or obtain educational loans. Alameda County supports additional funding for counties to assist with monitoring credit reports on behalf of foster youth and ensuring that youth receive assistance in interpreting their reports and clearing any inaccuracies, as required by State and federal law. Ensure the Safety and Well-Being of Commercially Sexually Exploited Children (CSEC) Additional funding and supports for Commercially Sexually Exploited Children (CSEC). Responding to CSEC requires a multi-pronged response that does not criminalize the youth for their actions and includes prevention, intervention, and after care. Alameda County supports additional funding and resources, beyond what is currently provided to counties, to expand training, tailor services, and support collaborative work with other systems. More funding is needed to address the immediate needs of victims, including clothing and safe shelter, and to provide long-term services to assist CSEC victims in achieving positive outcomes of permanency and well-being. Align Child Welfare Requirements with Local Best Practice Efforts Flexibility allowing for exemptions in existing requirements concerning social worker contacts with foster PAGE | 96 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countyyouth that unfairly penalize counties. Policy changes are needed to remove penalties when social workers are unable to make monthly face to face contact with a foster youth who has run away from placement and his or her current whereabouts are unknown. The existing requirements do not consider and give credit for the social worker's efforts to locate and make contact with the youth. SUPPORT ADULTS, SENIORS, AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES a004a3b0-84e6-4230-8376-d9151ee971ed It is projected that the Alameda County senior population will increase by over 40 percent in the next ten years and approximately 50 percent of all seniors in Alameda County do not have adequate financial resources to address their daily needs. In addition, approximately one in five people with disabilities in Alameda County live below the federal poverty line. Enhance Systems and Programs Increase funding available to develop and support affordable, accessible, and integrated housing options for seniors and persons with disabilities. Older adults and persons with disabilities often live on fixed incomes and appropriate housing options available are scarce and incomes are not increasing at the same rate as housing prices. Local affordable housing resources are severely limited, which is adversely impacting the health, care, and quality of life of seniors and people with disabilities. Specifically, Alameda County supports HUD's Supportive Housing for the Elderly, or Section 202 program. Support and expand programs for equitable access to advance care planning (ACP) and end-of-life services at any age. Advance care planning gives people a way to think about death and dying allowing them to confront dying directly instead of being a \"vague, unmanageable concept\" or leaving the end of life decisions up to others once the patient is unable to meaningfully participate in the process. Supporting programs that provide culturally relevant outreach and understanding of palliative care and hospice to our diverse populations will increase equitable access and utilization of end-of- life services. Fully support the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The ADA prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in employment, transportation, public accommodation, communications, and governmental activities. Alameda County opposes all efforts to erode the legislative mandate of the ADA.Specifically, we oppose ADA notification bills that seek to create barriers to filing a complaint, resulting in loss of access and civil rights. Increase employment opportunities for older adults and individuals with disabilities. Alameda County supports policies that help older adults and individuals with disabilities access training and employment opportunities that lead to competitive and integrated employment. Specifically, we support policies such as subsidized employment or tax incentives that encourage employers to hire older adults and individuals with disabilities. Support Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act implementation and improvements . Created in 2014, ABLE accounts are tax-advantaged savings accounts for individuals with disabilities and their families.Savings in ABLE accounts do not affect eligibility for SSI, Medicaid and other public benefits. Alameda County supports implementation of the California ABLE Act and policies that enhance and improve the current laws. Reform and improve Supplemental Security Income (SSI) . Alameda County supports restoring the original intent of the SSI program (protecting seniors and people with disabilities from the harms of living in poverty) by raising the asset limit, updating earned and unearned income disregard rules, and modernizing financial eligibility rules. Appropriate planning funds for CareerACCESS pilot projects. CareerACCESS is a community-driven proposal to reform SSI rules so that young adults with disabilities can work and achieve their full potential without risking losing their disability benefits. Under the pilot, youth would create a career plan supported by coaching, counseling and employment support services. The pilot would allow for increased earnings and remove asset limits. Coordinate the System of Care for Older Adults PAGE | 97 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda CountyAlameda County supports a coordinated service delivery system that protects, supports, and advocates for an aging population. Specifically, we support the integration and simplification of the complex system of senior services to ensure policies and programs are consumer-focused and that residents have access to and receive the services they need. Support and expand programs and policies that promote Healthy Aging/Aging in Place . Older adults often lack access to information and resources about social service and health issues, or are unaware of preventative measures they can take to remain healthier for longer. Alameda County supports policies that promote healthy aging, independence, and well-being of seniors who wish to age in place, or who wish to remain in their homes as they age. Increase funding for Area Agency on Aging (AAA) Programs. The services that the AAA provides to residents age 60 and older are often underfunded or restricted. Alameda County supports increased State and federal funding and flexibility. Reduce nutrition insecurity for seniors. According to the Alameda County Community Food Bank, residents over 50 years old now make up more than one-third of their clients. This need is only expected to increase as older adults are the fastest growing segment of the population in Alameda County; however, State and federal funding for senior nutrition is limited and restrictive. Alameda County supports increased funding and greater funding flexibility for senior nutrition programs and services. Support and funding for Elder Courts. Many seniors find the legal system complicated and difficult to navigate, which creates a barrier to remediation of legal issues such as elder abuse, housing disputes, and more. Elder Courts facilitate legal issues specifically for seniors, including coordinating, scheduling, and making referrals to providers. Expand and fund programs that support caregivers. Families are the major provider of long-term care for older adults, but research has shown that caregiving exacts a heavy emotional and financial toll. Almost half of all caregivers are over age 50, making them more vulnerable to a decline in their own health, and one-third describe their own health as fair to poor. Alameda County supports increased efforts to support caregivers through creation of a Blue-Ribbon Caregiver Council and restoration of funding to Caregiver Resource Centers. Promote retirement savings. Less than half of California's private sector workers have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan. Alameda County supports State and federal policies that promote retirement savings and make it easier to save. Increase funding for programs that support the integration of health care and social services focused on aging and advance care planning . Funding a whole person approach to care and reducing barriers to the integration of health and social service systems will increase the coordination of services and allow sharing of vital health information. The integration of advance care planning into a health and social services regimen allows time to put social supports in place before self-care and mobility are limited by the downward trajectory of a terminal illness. The ability to stay at home with integrated health care and social services may reduce hospital readmissions, futile treatments, and suffering from symptom burdens, while also improving the quality of care at the end of life. Restore and increase funding for community-based programs for seniors. Over the past few years, senior safety net funding for multiple programs under the Older Californians Act and Older Americans Act has been eliminated or severely reduced. Alameda County supports reinstating and increasing funding for these and other programs that support seniors. Increase funding to expand services specifically for older adults with mental health and co-occurring substance abuse issues. Behavioral health concerns are not a normal part of the aging process. Mental illness and substance use disorders are major impediments to living well in old age; they cause considerable personal suffering and make it difficult for older people to achieve their potential. Older adults who become disabled by mental illness deserve the same guarantee of care already extended to those who face other kinds of disabilities. \u00b0 For more information on these issues, please see the Behavioral Health section in the Health Chapter. Increase Older Americans Act (OAA) appropriations. OAA provides the federal mandate to fund Area PAGE | 98 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda CountyAgencies on Aging. Alameda County supports an increased appropriation to the OAA Titles and additional local flexibility in Title III funding. We support strengthening the Aging Network's role and capacity in the coordination and provision of long-term services and supports, expanding local evidence-based health promotion and disease prevention activities, improving community preparedness for an aging population, and setting adequate authorized funding levels. Increase funding and support for Aging & Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs). ADRCs serve as single points of access into the long-term supports and services system for older adults and people with disabilities. Alameda County supports increased appropriations to the ADRCs as well as any measures that can strengthen the structure and resources available to ADRCs. Support expansion of the Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) . SCSEP is the largest federally-funded program specifically targeting older adults seeking employment and training assistance. Protect Vulnerable Adults Alameda County Division of Adult Protection consists of Adult Protective Services (APS), Office of the Public Guardian-Conservator (PG/PC), and the Public Administrator's Office (PA). Together these programs provide a continuum of services that form a safety net for vulnerable adults. Increase ongoing funding for APS training. Training for APS workers and their partner agencies is severely underfunded and has not kept pace with rising cases. The 2016-17 State budget included a one-time training augmentation but additional ongoing funding is needed. APS workers receive a small fraction of the funding provided to child welfare workers who deal with similar situations. It is imperative that APS workers receive comprehensive training so that they may provide elder and dependent adult victims of abuse, neglect, and exploitation with the same types of essential services that child abuse victims receive. Alameda County supports increased federal and State funding for APS training. Funding and supports to preserve housing and prevent eviction for seniors and dependents adults who are victims of abuse or neglect. Senior and dependent adults who are the victims of abuse or neglect are among the most vulnerable to becoming homeless. Alameda County supports State and federal funding for services, case-management, and resources to help preserve stable housing for vulnerable elders and dependent adults. Increase services and supports for elderly or dependent adults who are victims of financial abuse. Financial abuse is estimated to account for 40 percent of all forms of reported abuse against seniors. Dependent adults also face similar challenges. Additional services and supports are needed for education, prevention, and investigation of financial abuse and exploitation of these populations. Raise awareness of elder and dependent adult abuse. Specifically, Alameda County supports State and federal efforts to better define elder and dependent abuse and ensure consistency in data tracking and reporting. Efforts should be made to lift up the issue and raise public awareness of this silent epidemic. Enhance coordination to respond to crimes against elders and dependent adults. Alameda County supports State and federal efforts to make it easier for agencies (including law enforcement, District Attorneys, Public Guardians, Victim/Witness Programs, and the Victims Compensation Board, etc.) that respond to crimes against elder and dependent adults to coordinate services. This should include support to identify, prevent, and remedy elder and dependent adult abuse. Improve data collection on elder and dependent adult abuse. There is a lack of good data on elder and dependent abuse. The most recent national numbers (from 2009) estimate that 11 percent of older Americans experience abuse, neglect, or exploitation in the community (this survey excluded individuals in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities). The actual prevalence is likely even higher. The National Council on Aging also estimates that only one in 14 cases of abuse come to the attention of officials. Additional State and federal support is needed to improve local data collection on the incidence of elder and dependent adult abuse. Increase services and supports for elderly or dependent adults who are victims of crimes. Individuals with disabilities and seniors have a disproportionately high victimization rate. According to the most recent Bureau of Justice Statistics report, the rate of serious violent crimes is three times higher for those with disabilities than those without. Additional services and supports are needed for education, prevention, and investigation PAGE | 99 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countyof abuse and exploitation of seniors and individuals with disabilities. Institute a federal mandate for Adult Protective Services (APS) that includes increased funding. Currently there is only a State mandate for APS. Alameda County supports a federal mandate for these services and increased funding to protect and serve our vulnerable adult population. Appropriate $100 million authorized under the Elder Justice Act. This funding would help provide vital adult protective services in states and counties. Restore and fully fund the Social Services Block Grant. In California this funding is used primarily to augment county and State funded services for seniors and adults and children with disabilities. Better Serve Veterans Alameda County supports policies that assist veterans with accessing benefits, housing, and stable employment. Increase employment opportunities for veterans. Alameda County supports policies that help veterans access employment in the public and private sectors. Specifically, Alameda County supports funding for prior- learning assessments that allow veterans to earn college credit for their military training and skills learned in service. Reduce veteran homelessness and provide supportive treatment and services. Alameda County supports a range of policies that address the root causes of veteran homelessness. Specifically, policies that improve employment opportunities, increase substance abuse prevention and treatment programs, establish affordable housing, and improve rehabilitation efforts for homeless veterans. Protect veterans funding. Alameda County supports efforts to ensure that Veterans Affairs services have timely, predictable funding in an era where continuing resolutions and threats of government shutdowns are all too frequent. Ensure veterans access the benefits for which they are eligible. Support the Department of Veterans Affairs in providing outreach services that educate veterans on the benefits for which they are eligible. Specifically, increased funding and support to assist veterans in need of compensation, medical, rehabilitative, educational, and employment services. EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION PLANNING COUNCIL 3c658b16-efaa-4a09-a4bd-8045fa3a875a The child care system is meant to fulfill the dual economic goals of supporting parental employment and laying the groundwork for children's lifelong success. The child care field has struggled to maintain capacity given multiple years of funding cuts at the State and federal levels. It strongly supports President Obama's ongoing efforts to improve early care and education funding, ensuring the availability of quality child care, increasing subsidies and expanding home visiting. Stabilize and increase federal funding, and attain new resources for Early Care and Education (ECE): The ECE Planning Council supports an array of federal funding streams that augment Alameda County ECE programs including Child and Adult Care Food Program, Early Head Start and Head Start, and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families. Take positions on federal initiatives and budget appropriations that positively impact ECE quality, access and affordability. Advocate for family centered, inclusive, developmentally and culturally appropriate practices for all children in care as well as those in transitional kindergarten. Support streamlining and efficiencies such as coordinated regulatory, contracting and reimbursement processes within the current federal and State programs: The Administration for Children and Families has recently issued Child Care and Development Block Grant regulations that are laudable and create significant resource needs. Increase ECE reinvestment: Adjusted for inflation federal ECE expenditures are much lower than the preceding decade. PAGE | 100 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda County Increase ECE professional development and wage supports. ALAMEDA COUNTY INTERAGENCY CHILDREN'S POLICY COUNCIL (ICPC) FEDERAL HUMAN SERVICES f80cf93c-44e4-4efc-82ef-39907bb92c3b The Alameda County Interagency Children's Policy Council (ICPC) engages in cross-system collaboration by improving interagency communication, developing child-friendly policies and practices, and initiating systems changes that result in healthy, safe, and thriving children and youth throughout Alameda County. Comprised of County department directors and leaders, ICPC provides advocacy and leadership to improve and enhance service delivery and outcomes for children and youth. Our priorities for legislative advocacy are guided by a set of overarching principles that emphasize equity, upstream investment, and interagency collaboration. ICPC supports legislative actions that: Address and change the policies, programs, and practices that perpetuate racial inequities; Recognize and mitigate systemic inequities in all public systems; Prioritize the health and well being of children, youth, and families; Support evidence-based policies and programs to ensure healthy, educated children, stable families, and safe and supportive communities. Bolster, enhance, and innovate safety net programs that serve our most vulnerable populations; Address income and wealth inequality by providing equitable access to economic opportunity and self- sufficiency for all Alameda County residents; Remove barriers to public and private interagency collaboration; and Preserve and increase funding streams dedicated to upstream and preventative investments in children and youth. Our vision for healthy, safe, and thriving children, youth, and families includes ensuring the following priorities are addressed. ICPC advocates for policy change and legislative action that increases equitable outcomes across the following domains: Healthy Ensure all children are born healthy; Give families and caregivers adequate support they need to care for young children; Support consistent access to quality medical, dental, and behavioral health care; Support prevention of childhood obesity and increase overall family health; Ensure access to safe spaces for physical activity within children's own communities; Ensure access to quality nutritious foods in schools and communities; and Guarantee access to safe drinking water in schools and communities. Safe Strengthen all families to ensure all children and youth live in safe and stable environments; Ensure safe, affordable housing for all families with children and youth, and unaccompanied transitional age youth; Prioritize prevention, diversion, and restorative justice practices that impede youth involvement in juvenile justice systems; Support children and youth who are victims of crime and sexual violence through provision of services and support and preempt criminalization of child and youth victims; Guarantee freedom from mistreatment, abuse, neglect, and violence; and Address and mitigate the impacts of trauma on children, youth, and families. Thriving Ensure all families have the ability to meet basic needs- nutritious food, shelter, clothing, health care, and accessible transportation; Enable all caregivers to participate fully in the workforce and contribute to the economic wellbeing of their PAGE | 101 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countyfamilies and Alameda County; Support the healthy social-emotional development of children and youth; Guarantee that all children\u2014beginning in early childhood\u2014have equitable access to a 21st century education that promotes success in life and future careers; Provide robust resources that enable county-involved youth to achieve self-sufficiency, academic success, and reach their professional goals; and Ensure children and youth have the right to a voice and representation in matters that impact them. HEALTH 78041719-1451-497b-9377-5c8c2ced911c HEALTH CARE ACCESS, QUALITY, AND AFFORDABILITY 7111fd9c-758c-43af-a6cd-f446daaa9baa All key provisions of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) are in place as of January 2014, and the legislation has been successful in reducing the rates of uninsured and in the nation. According to the US Census Bureau, the rate of U.S. residents who were uninsured fell from 13.3% in 2013 to 10.4% in 2014; in California, the rate of uninsured fell from 17.2% in 2013 to 12.4% in 2014, a decline of almost 5 percentage points. In the County, the rate of uninsured fell from 12.6% in 2013 to 8.2% in 2014. However, there were still approximately 65,000 people with incomes <200% FPL who were uninsured in the County. The County embraces the \"Triple Aim:\" improving patient experience, satisfaction and quality, the health of populations, and cost-effectiveness. For health care reform to further succeed, we must maximize eligibility, enrollment and retention in health insurance and access to appropriate and high quality health care. Special attention should be paid to policies that: Simplify the health insurance application process for all, especially hard-to-reach and underserved populations. Increase access to care. Provide lower cost and more accessible treatment alternatives in community settings; promote efficiency; incentivize physicians to go into primary care; incentivize expanded medical staffing, including use of advanced-practice nurses where there are physician shortages and use of a wider range of healthcare team members, such as community health workers. Expand dental care access and preventive services for low-income Californians. Dental health is a preventive disease, an integral part of overall health and can have impacts on children's growth, development, self-esteem, and learning. The County supports policies that would increase prevention services and new more efficient models of care, such as the virtual dental home and expanded dental teams. Promote federal payment reform that increases the ability to provide preventive services and establishes risk-sharing between hospitals and primary care. Support payment reform that incentivizes positive health outcomes, not just the ability to bill for more tests or visits. It should promote health education and allow same-day visits for better integrated care, and enable doctors to spend more time with patients at the initial visit to improve the quality of overall care. Ensure maintenance and enhancement of the safety net system. Increase provider rates; improve transitions of care (e.g. from acute or specialty care to primary care medical homes); and support policies that provide coverage to those with part-time or temporary employment. Use the opportunities provided by the 1115 Medi-Cal 2020 Waiver to enhance integration and effectiveness of the safety net healthcare system. Support adequate Per Member Per Month (PMPM) payments for health home services and the new Health Home Program under Affordable Care Act Section 2703. Support improved treatment of chronic pain while reducing inappropriate prescription of opioids and their unsafe storage and disposal. For example, support coverage for and access to acupuncture, physical therapy, and other non-pharmaceutical interventions to treat chronic pain and opioid addiction, and reduce barriers to opioid medication collection sites. PAGE | 102 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda County Support cannabis research to identify health benefits and effects of cannabis use. With the passage of Proposition 64, the Adult Use of Marijuana Act, in 2016, the need for sound scientific research on the potential benefits and effects of marijuana use is greater than ever. The County supports federal legislative efforts to fund and remove barriers to conducting this research. MEDICAID AND HEALTH CARE REFORM 758a1674-bc7f-40d0-9c64-49651d0cfda6 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) allowed states to expand Medicaid (Medi-Cal in California). Medi-Cal is California's health insurance program for eligible low-income individuals and families. Beginning in January 2014, Medi-Cal was expanded to include income-eligible childless, non-disabled, adults. Enrollment locally and across the State exceeded all predictions and one-third of California residents are currently receiving Medi-Cal. Alameda County supports efforts to leverage health care reform to enroll children, individuals and families in the full range of benefits for which they are eligible. For more information on public benefits (SNAP and TANF), please see the Human Services Chapter. Medicaid Medicaid provides free or low-cost health insurance for eligible low-income individuals and families. Alameda County supports the following policy recommendations: Support and improve ACA. Alameda County supports rules and requirements for Medicaid and Exchange enrollment under ACA that reduce program complexity, recognize the county role in eligibility and enrollment, and support Statewide Automated Welfare System (SAWS) consortia information technology modernization efforts. Protect Medicaid funding. Alameda County opposes efforts to reduce federal funding for Medicaid administration or benefits, including efforts to place a per-capita cap on funding, create Medicaid block grants for states, or limit the ability of states to leverage funds through assessments on providers. REDUCING INEQUITIES IN CHRONIC DISEASES fec7a97d-bc46-4ab3-b45a-a256ce6304d2 In Alameda County the 4 leading causes of death: cancer, heart disease, stroke, and chronic lower respiratory disease, are due to chronic diseases and account for 57% of all deaths. Diabetes and hypertension account for another 5.7% of deaths. Despite increased life expectancy among all racial/ethnic groups, there is a growing disparity in life expectancy. For example in 1960 African-Americans in Alameda County had a life expectancy 4.0 years less than Caucasians and in 2010 despite marked increases in both racial/ethnic groups the disparity had increased to 6.5 years. Support chronic disease screening, detection, education and care management system - Chronic diseases disproportionally affect people of color. Poor screening, limited access to care, and the challenges of chronic disease self-management lead to complications and premature death. The County supports both fostering and expanding a chronic disease system of care that includes the provision of accessible self-management education to people with chronic disease to assist them with self-management of their chronic condition and reimbursement to health care providers for these services. Support efforts to expand access to food assistance programs and increase benefits through Child Nutrition Reauthorization - Streamline systems to automatically refer Medi-Cal recipients to WIC or automatically qualify for WIC. Advocate for California to be able to use a separate income guideline aligned to the higher cost of living, as Hawaii and Alaska done.Increase the value of WIC food packets, extend infant certification to age 2, extend child eligibility to age 6, and extend benefits to non-breastfeeding mothers until the child turns 1. Promote the initiation and prolonged duration of breastfeeding - Breastfeeding has been proven to provide a broad range of health benefits to both baby and mother including reducing a child's chance of becoming overweight or obese. Encouraging and supporting breastfeeding, and enforcing laws that protect low-wage workers, allow family leave, foster child bonding, and create breastfeeding-friendly work places will lay the PAGE | 103 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countyfoundation for good health. Limit the marketing of junk food to children - The Institute of Medicine recently issued a comprehensive list of recommendations to combat the obesity crisis, including the creation of guidelines to limit the marketing of junk food to children. In recent years this marketing particularly concentrated in low income communities, has increased greatly, and contributes to, an increase in childhood obesity and its associated diseases. Expand the availability of healthful foods and beverages, and decrease the availability of unhealthful foods and beverages . Make healthful, nutritious foods and beverages more easily available in low-income neighborhoods while reducing the availablity of unhealthful foods and beverages. The State's pilot program to increase access to healthful foods should be expanded and greater financial incentives and/or assistance should be provided to retailers to implement the changes. Decrease the availability of unhealthful beverages through a sugar sweetened beverage \"soda\" tax or fee. In the County, approximately 60% of adolescents and 31% of children consume one or more sodas per day. Greater consumption of sugar sweetened beverages is associated with dental caries, diabetes, overweight, and obesity among adults and children. A soda tax or fee would gain broader support when funds raised are reinvested in the communities most disproportionately affected by the obesity epidemic. Improve utilization of food assistance programs - The complexity of applying for and maintaining eligibility for food assistance programs is frequently a barrier to low-income families. Streamlining the application for nutrition programs - CalFresh (formerly Food Stamps), Women, Infants and Children (WIC), and School Meals Program (Breakfast/Lunch) would greatly increase the numbers of children served. Increase the tobacco excise tax with 20% of any new tobacco tax designated for tobacco control programs with the goal of decreasing adult tobacco-use prevalence. Reduce smoking, limit secondhand smoke exposure, decrease youth access to tobacco products and marketing, and promote health equity among California's diverse populations: The County supports provisions that 1) protect individuals from secondhand smoke exposure, 2) strengthen laws to reduce youth access to tobacco products, 3) counter pro-tobacco influences including advertising and media images or content, 4) reduce or eliminate the retailing of new tobacco or nicotine products, 5) promote tobacco cessation, 6) incorporate health equity, language access, and cultural competency standards in all tobacco control agencies, programs, processes, and practices. 7) increase support to priority populations' advocacy and leadership alliances in tobacco control. 8)strengthen the capacity of agency and institution personnel to achieve tobacco-related health equity, and 9) conduct monitoring, surveillance, evaluation, and research; disseminate findings to reduce tobacco-related health disparities and measure progress toward achieving health equity and social justice. Create \"Asthma-Friendly\" communities: The County supports policies that create \"Asthma-Friendly\" communities, especially those that eliminate the disproportionate burden of asthma for people living in poverty and communities of color. This goal can be achieved by optimizing the diagnosis, treatment, and management of asthma through adherence to the current National Heart Lung and Blood Institute's asthma guidelines; expanding the reach of proven case management programs for serving persons with asthma; utilizing community health workers and trained professionals; improving air quality to reduce diesel emissions in our communities, and improving housing conditions to meet the standards of a healthy home while holding those responsible for the conditions to a legal standard. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES 7362ee6f-4b59-4fbb-bdac-264b4cf0b90d Behavioral health problems (mental health and/or substance use disorders) are significant public health problems impacting millions, and are associated with other chronic diseases that often result in morbidity and mortality. The effects of mental illness range from minor disruptions in daily functioning to incapacitating personal, social, and occupational impairments and premature death. Support for the following items will assist Alameda County in providing a fiscally sound, comprehensive continuum of behavioral health services ranging from prevention/early intervention, treatment and recovery/support that will PAGE | 104 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countyfoster increased access to services, a reduction in stigma and discrimination and improved health outcomes for Alameda County residents with behavioral health conditions: Develop a consolidated billing structure for Medicaid and Medicare: Medicaid and Medicare have separate reimbursement criteria and methodologies that have become increasingly problematic and costly as the number of individuals covered under both Medicaid and Medicare (dual eligible) has risen. Having two separate, distinct systems, with different reimbursement criteria, contributes to time-intensive billing processes that are cumbersome, confusing and increase the cost of care. Having one consolidated billing system would decrease costs as well as increase billing ease and efficiency. End the Medicaid lock out of reimbursable mental health and substance use disorder treatment services for youth and adults who are incarcerated. Research shows that 50% or more of state prisoners meet the criteria for a diagnosis of drug abuse or dependence, but only 10% receive medically based drug treatment. Similarly for youth, as many as four out of five teens in the juvenile justice system have drug or alcohol problems, yet fewer than 20% have access to substance abuse treatment programs. Additionally, more than 8 in 10 formally incarcerated individuals have chronic physical, mental, or substance abuse disorders that create significant and distinct reentry challenges and service needs; because of the link between substance abuse and crime, allowing for Medicaid reimbursable treatment services to incarcerated individuals in both the juvenile and adult prison systems have the potential to yield substantial health and economic benefits. REDUCING INEQUITIES IN HIV d4b0b90d-2cd5-427c-9877-6016db07133b There are currently an estimated 5,751 people living with AIDS/HIV (PLWHA) in the County with over 200 new cases reported per year. The impact of HIV on behavior risk groups and minority populations is significant. In Alameda County the HIV Epidemic disproportionate impacts African American and Latino men who have sex with men. HIV also affects marginalized communities such as Transgendered Females, Intravenous Drug Users, other substance users, especially crack cocaine, and sex workers. Cuts to prevention and testing programs from the California State Department of Health have resulted in devastating consequences for some of our most vulnerable populations. Decriminalize HIV : Review existing laws that create and enhance criminal penalties for HIV and revise to assure equitable implementation and subsequent prosecutions. Over the past 25 years, California has enacted laws that criminalized otherwise legal behaviors or added penalties to existing crimes for people living with HIV. These laws were largely based on irrational fears about people with HIV, with most of the prosecuted cases from these laws involving consensual sex or conduct such as spitting and biting that has very low or negligible possibility of HIV exposure. Of those who come into contact with the criminal justice system based on their HIV status, approximately 95% are sex workers and 67% are Black or Latino. Support Needle Exchange Programs: Injection drug use is the second leading cause of HIV transmission and the leading cause of Hepatitis C infection in California. Studies of needle exchange programs have repeatedly shown that these efforts are successful in reducing the spread of HIV and Hepatitis C while showing no increase in the use of injection drugs. the County therefore supports policy and legislative efforts to support these needle exchange programs. Facilitate and HIV Testing in Jails and Prisons: Confidential, non-mandatory HIV testing should be supported in jails and prisons in order to prevent the spread of these diseases within the inmate population and among their partners in the community. Assist Formerly Incarcerated Individuals : The County supports legislation that facilitates the rapid and effective transition of HIV care and supportive services for people going in or coming out of State prisons and County jails. Support HIV Testing: Support policy and legislation that facilitates routine HIV testing in all medical settings to ensure that HIV testing is administered in the same manner as diabetes and tuberculosis screenings. The County supports the easing of restrictions on who can perform HIV Rapid Testing. Currently, only licensed medical practitioners and State-Trained HIV test counselors are allowed to administer the HIV Rapid Test in PAGE | 105 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda CountyCalifornia-state funded programs. This restriction is not required by the manufacturer, or in most other states and severely limits state-wide HIV testing efforts. Maintain Support for AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP): Maintain and increase funding for the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP), a part of Ryan White Program paying for prescription drugs for people who have limited or no coverage for HIV medications and can't otherwise afford them. The program is managed by states, and most of them also contribute to the funding. The benefits and eligibility requirements vary widely state by state. Increase Comprehensive Reproductive and Sexual Health Programs for Teens: Create a legislative process of funding comprehensive reproductive and sexual health programs for teens. The number of reported Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) in young women under the age of 20 is almost equivalent to the numbers reported for all other women over the age of 20. It is important to fund comprehensive programs to maintain reproductive health and educate young people about contraception, family communication, responsible negotiating and decision making skills. Make HIV Care Funding More Responsive to the Actual Needs : With the advent of Affordable Care Act (ACA), The County support efforts to maintain federal funding for HIV supportive care services such as case management, food, housing and legal services that are not covered by ACA. These services assist and enable people to maintain their connection to medical treatment for HIV. We also support legislation and policies that provide care funding for HIV positive individuals not covered by the Affordable Care Act, such as undocumented people. SYSTEMS OF CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES b23b4872-93ad-410f-b159-6b4f80c195ff Children and adults with disabilities in California rely on systems of care that have been chronically underfunded, and severely compromised by cuts due to our recent State fiscal crisis. The California economy has recovered, leaving a State surplus, and it is imperative essential safety net services are restored and expanded. Disability status is almost a guarantee of significant disparity in Alameda County: one in five people with a disability live in poverty compared to one in ten people without a disability; the percentage of adults with less than a high school education is over twice as high among people with disabilities than those without disabilities; only 22% of people with disabilities are employed compared to 67% of those without disabilities, and people with disabilities are more likely to experience a high housing cost burden compared to those without disabilities based on a substantially lower median income. Alameda County supports policies that result in better outcomes for children and adults with disabilities, and the development services designed for all our residents. Restoration of funding, reinvestment in new services, and reform strategies are all essential to the stabilization of our compromised systems of care in order to provide a quality of life beyond institutionalized poverty for children and adults with disabilities. Reform Supplemental Security Income/State Supplemental Payment (SSI/SSP) Payment Structure. SSI/SSP payments are a critical source of income for people with disabilities, but current rates are tied to 1972 legislation and provide income below the poverty line. Support legislation that increases Supplemental Security Income payments, raises asset limits and updates the earned and general income disregard for individuals with disabilities. Financial constraints contained in the program discourage savings, work and financial security through restrictions on income and asset limits. Create policies that encourage wealth building and lead to financial security, and include cost of living increases. Support the development of national policies and legislation that create an infrastructure of programs and services that assist individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and their families. Increase funding to local governments and school districts to meet the fiscal challenges of providing for a large population of individuals with ASD. ASD is the fastest growing serious developmental disability and has a national annual economic impact of $137 billion. The Department of Developmental Services (DDS) Autism cases in Alameda County have increased 1,573% since 1990 (representing just a portion of the overall clinically-defined population). The report, \"Autism Rising\", notes that based on current averages for cost of services for adults with autism, Regional Center annual costs will nearly triple over the next ten years, and do not include non- regional center costs such as parental expenses, In-Home Support Services, SSI or housing assistance, and do PAGE | 106 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countynot address significant future factors such as aging parents, cost-of-living increases or the need for higher level of support as the DDS autism population ages. PAGE | 107 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda CountyHEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF WOMEN, CHILDREN, YOUTH AND FAMILIES 04b98db4-3ca4-4344-bb4b-eddaee6c62e1 Many more women, children, youth and families now have access to quality medical care, thanks to years of education efforts, provider outreach and advances in medical technology. The Affordable Care Act has also expanded access to care and preventive services for many Alameda County residents. Access to medical care is important and has likely contributed to improvement in some maternal and child health outcomes - infant mortality, for example, has been declining steadily over the last two decades - and yet women, children, youth and families in many of our communities still experience less than optimal health. The low birth weight rate for example, a key maternal and child health indicator, has remained constant over the last ten years. Being born at low birth weight not only contributes to significant newborn and infant health problems, but can also result in long-term illness and disability, including chronic disease and developmental delays. And there are deep inequities in maternal and child health by race: infant mortality rates among African-Americans are two times higher than whites and African-American women are three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women. Additionally women now face challenges to their reproductive freedom in a way that we have not seen since the initial debates that led to the passage of Roe v Wade in 1973. Ensuring access to comprehensive, low cost, reproductive, prenatal and primary care - including family planning and abortion services, and case management where appropriate - will continue to be important as will program and policy efforts that attempt to remedy the impact of neighborhood and social conditions on the health of women, their children, their partners and their families, thereby securing the health and wellbeing of current and future generations. Support access to comprehensive, low cost and readily accessible reproductive health services, including family planning, emergency contraception and abortion services. Special attention should be paid to policies that 1) do not limit the range of options available and 2) ensure access to accurate, unbiased information about reproductive and sexual health for youth and adults. Support level or increased funding for the Title V Maternal and Child Health Services block grant . For the last eighty years, Title V has provided a foundation for ensuring the health of the nation's mothers, women, children and youth, including children and youth with special health care needs. It is the only federal source of funds for population-based maternal and child health improvement efforts. In Alameda County, Title V supports the Black Infant Health program, the Fetal and Infant Mortality Review program, SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) Education, and other health education and promotion efforts. Support full funding of the Title X Family Planning Program. For more than 40 years, Title X family planning clinics have played a critical role in ensuring access to a broad range of family planning and related preventive health services for millions of low-income or uninsured individuals and others. Title X clinics are often the main source of primary care for low-income women between pregnancies who do not qualify for Medi-Cal, and have been a critical partner in ensuring the health of reproductive-aged women. Support the reauthorization of the Federal Healthy Start Act and continued implementation of the Healthy Start program. The Healthy Start program is an initiative mandated to reduce the rate of infant mortality, reduce disparities in perinatal health, and improve perinatal outcomes through grants to project areas with high rates of infant mortality. In Alameda County, the Healthy Start program has been in place since 1991. It provides case management, navigation and support services, health education and empowerment groups and neighborhood-based interventions for low income, multi-stressed African-American women, children and families in the zip codes with the highest infant mortality rates. Support legislation to ensure access to comprehensive contraceptive services and accurate information about reproductive health for both men and women. Oppose any efforts to restrict access to abortion and family planning services based on age, stage of pregnancy or any other criteria. When women have control over their reproductive health and rates of unplanned pregnancies are lower, their health and wellbeing is ensured, the health and life trajectory of their children is optimized and the social and economic conditions in which they are living are improved. Support continued funding for the Maternal, Infant, Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) program PAGE | 108 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countymade available through the Affordable Care Act. The MIECHV monies support the Nurse Family Partnership (NFP) program in Alameda County. NFP is an evidence-based home visitation model, which has been shown to lead to better pregnancy outcomes, improved child health and development, and increased economic self- sufficiency - outcomes that contribute to preventing child abuse, reducing juvenile crime, and increasing school readiness. NFP is an integral and expanding part of Alameda County's home visiting system of care. Support efforts to ensure safe, stable and affordable housing for pregnant women and families with young children. Pregnancy, infancy and early childhood are critical periods where adverse social conditions can have a disproportionate affect on health and development. Living in substandard housing, experiencing neighborhood violence or being homeless for even short periods of time during the early stages of life can expose young children and their families to dangerous levels of toxic stress, resulting in potential damage to their long-term health, well-being and overall life trajectory. Support funding for the equitable inclusion of services for men in local family support systems of care . For decades publicly funded family support systems of care have provided services to ensure the health and well being of women and children. Federal and state funding is needed to address the health and wellbeing of men and assure their inclusion in family support programming so that they can successfully engage with their families and children. This funding should be directed towards programs, agencies, and organizations that are open to and inclusive of the needs of men and that provide father-specific services and activities that further the goal of increasing fathers' involvement in their children's lives. Additionally, the County supports legislation to ensure full access to physical and mental health services for men, particularly for men re-entering the community from the local criminal justice systems. DISASTER PREPAREDNESS 4e961e3c-d7df-4c79-a00b-367c35b19172 Natural and human-made disasters including the recent fires in California, earthquakes, acts of terrorism, projections of more frequent and severe extreme weather events and emerging communicable diseases demonstrate the need to ensure that Alameda County has a coordinated system in place to respond to any hazard. Building the response capacity of public health, emergency medical services and health care systems includes planning for a \"surge\" of patients. The Public Health Department and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) continue to work in collaboration with County, State and Federal agencies, local health care providers and other institutions to strengthen our collaboration, communications and responsiveness. The following will ensure that our State and local disaster response systems are adequately prepared to respond in an emergency, prepared to respond to long-term health issues from disaster, and prepared to maintain continuity of operations: Support Funding for Regional Communications. Regional planning must take place to develop communication systems that are functional in a mutual aid response situation. Clear leadership provided by the State Department of Public Health and EMS Authority should promote improved communication with the public and private sector. Funding is needed to support robust and redundant systems and enhance existing communications and information management systems. Develop Systems for Vulnerable Populations. Develop and fund systems to ensure that services are delivered in a timely and efficient manner to vulnerable populations with special consideration for children and adults with disabilities requiring functional or access support services, as well as low income populations, seniors, children, individuals with language barriers and other specific needs. Pre-planning for disaster response must be focused on those who are dependent on others such as caretakers in the event of a large-scale public health emergency. Secure Funding for Disaster Preparedness, Response and Mitigation. Support legislation that promotes funding for medical and health disaster planning, coordination, response and mitigation including infrastructure and emergency response personnel. PAGE | 109 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda CountyCOMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION 9c12f236-b4f3-4b17-844f-b109ab1cfd8e Communicable diseases are the fourth leading cause of death in the United States and the leading cause of death worldwide. Control of communicable disease is a core public safety function of government at the local, State, and federal levels. Fulfilling this function requires a sustained, adequately funded infrastructure that monitors, evaluates, and responds to communicable disease threats. Communicable diseases are kept in control only through continual vigilance and ongoing efforts, even when a threat may not be apparent. In addition, the threat of bioterrorism requires Health Officers be prepared to recognize and respond to possible cases of intentional outbreaks of unusual diseases such as smallpox, plague, anthrax, or botulism. The three key activities of Communicable Disease Control and Prevention are epidemiology and surveillance, communicable disease response, and vaccine-preventable disease programs. Support for these key areas will help protect public health infrastructure and capacity to control and prevent communicable diseases in the County. Key federal priorities in 2017 are: Support and restore adequate funding for personnel capacity for communicable disease control and prevention. This includes adequate funding for epidemiology, investigation, laboratory detection for outbreak detection, emerging infectious diseases, and bioterrorism events. Support increased funding for prevention programs dealing with Sexually Transmitted Disease and HIV such as partner services, pre-exposure prophylaxis, early HIV testing, and education and outreach. Maintain Ryan White funding for HIV services not covered in the Affordable Care Act. Maintenance of funding is also critical for on-going local support and technical assistance. Support restoration and augmentation of funding for tuberculosis (TB) control and prevention . Adequate funding for tuberculosis control and prevention includes increased resources for treatment of costly and dangerous multi-drug resistant TB, treatment of latent tuberculosis infection as prevention of disease, adequate health care access and insurance coverage for all persons requiring tuberculosis assessment and treatment. Globally, TB is the leading cause of infectious death, killing more people than AIDS. In 2015, the US had the first national increase in TB cases since 1992. Despite these concerning trends, the Senate Labor-HHS appropriations subcommittee has proposed to cut CDC's domestic TB program by $5 million, which will lead to funding cuts for State and local public health programs, leaving our communities vulnerable. Support improved systems and funding for screening and treatment of TB prior to the arrival of new immigrants in the United States. These systems must include follow up as well, and accessible health care access for evaluation and treatment of new immigrants once they have arrived. Maintain and support ongoing funding for pandemic influenza, and administration of local preparedness programs. Ongoing financial support is needed to maintain critical services such as Public Health Emergency Preparedness, Health Care Preparedness, Cities Readiness Initiative, Urban Area Security Initiative, State Homeland Security Grant Program, and other crucial funding for emerging infectious diseases, natural disasters, and terrorism planning and response. Support policies that assure access to vaccines for the population . Policies must assure access to immunizations, public education and outreach regarding immunizations, and improve immunization rates or require immunizations in key settings such as schools and other settings with vulnerable populations and/or high risk of exposures. Support policies and funding that provide resources to adapt and develop locally relevant and culturally competent public education and outreach regarding communicable diseases, immunizations, and public health emergency preparedness and response. The broad diversity of local communities requires the capability to communicate in culturally relevant modes to ensure the education and safety of all residents. PAGE | 110 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda CountyENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH d43c9741-ec91-4780-b4ea-d1c0e9b57310 ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH 525f0acc-5429-49a4-a22f-139bac2e8694 To ensure environmental quality and food safety in the community, the County supports policies and legislation that would prioritize the following: Policies and funding that promotes environmental health and justice. People of color and low-income communities are disproportionately impacted by environmental pollution and climate change, particularly children and elderly. Environmental pollution, including conditions of blight and climate change degrades and poses added risks to the environment and public health, particularly to vulnerable populations. The County supports policies and funding that uses a \"precautionary approach,\" prevents and mitigates environmental pollution, increases monitoring and enforcement action, creates green jobs and spurs the green economy, and seeks to meaningfully involve community residents most impacted by pollution decision-making in order to address health disparities, cumulative health impacts and further environmental justice. Legislation that regulates the shipment and processing of fossil fuels for local use or export to reduce local impacts to health and safety. Changes in the fossil fuel industry have resulted in plans by producers to increase exports of coal and liquid petroleum products by rail to seaports. Rail incidents involving crude oil jumped nearly sixteen fold nationally between 2010 and 2014. Fossil fuels transported by rail to port facilities in Alameda County would disproportionately impact the health of low-income communities of color but provide little benefit to those communities. Greater federal oversight is needed to regulate shipments in order to ensure the safety and health of all County residents. Effective Product Stewardship/Extended Producer Responsibility legislation. ProductStewardship/Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is a strategy that shifts the responsibility for end of life/residual management to the producers by internalizing the cost of collection and disposal in the price of the product. This includes but is not limited to existing and emerging waste streams such as pharmaceuticals, sharps, household batteries, fluorescent lamps and marine flares. Effective product stewardship legislation should apply to all manufacturers across a particular product spectrum, have required minimum collection rates, increasing collection goals over the course of the program, no line item fee at the point of purchase or fee at the point of surrender and no local preemption clause. PUBLIC SAFETY 62825820-6a43-4acb-bed9-cc31db87bbd5 DISTRICT ATTORNEY 1f3e0087-64dd-4343-9cce-ad123c3df38a The Alameda County District Attorney's Office is responsible for the prosecution of crimes in the County of Alameda, California. The District Attorney's Office is dedicated to serving the community through the ethical prosecution of criminal offenses and the vigorous protection of victims' rights. The District Attorney's Office supports policies and legislation on the following: Human Exploitation and Trafficking (H.E.A.T.) Funding for the Human Exploitation and Trafficking (H.E.A.T.) Watch to enhance services to victims of human trafficking and commercially sexually exploited minors. To combat human trafficking, this program needs funds to educate the community, provide effective community outreach and train law enforcement. Stronger legislation is needed to prosecute human traffickers, as well as expand services and resources for victims of sex trafficking and labor trafficking. DNA Backlog. DNA evidence can be used to eliminate or confirm suspects, and develop investigative leads to solve a number of unsolved cases. Funding to eliminate the current backlog of untested sexual assault kits, PAGE | 111 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countysolidifying a partnership between our office, law enforcement agencies, and private entities to provide a streamlined model throughout the State to prevent future backlogs. Victims of Crime. Enhancement of the rights and protections of all victims of crime, and increased funding to expand services to all victims of crime, especially victims of violent crime including: homicide, child abuse, domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, human trafficking, and commercially exploited minors. Funding to aggressively collect restitution of behalf of all victims of crime. Strengthen the process for seeking and securing restitution for victims of crime. Mental Health. Advocate for strong funding streams for treating and assisting people with mental health issues. Realignment. Reduce recidivism by realigning lower level offenders to community corrections programs strengthened through community-based punishment, improved supervision strategies and evidence-based practices, and supervision practices demonstrated by research to reduce recidivism. This includes employing proven alternatives to incarceration for low-risk offenders. In addition, systemic reforms in the Alameda County court system to establish a centralized process to help in filing revocation petitions. Reducing Serious/Violent Crimes. Initiatives to reduce violent crimes by proposing the formation of the regional multi-agencies task force to combat violence. The task force would provide meaningful alternatives to individuals engaged in criminal behavior who are amenable to various treatment strategies. Enhancing Community-Based Support for Formerly Incarcerated. Support funding for community programs that aid incarcerated and formerly incarcerated individuals through their rehabilitation efforts and process. Funding can provide programs for individuals as an alternative to incarceration or through the expansion of District Attorney driven Diversion Programs wherein charges are dismissed after successful completion of the Program. Funding can provide programs and support for individuals under supervision of the Probation Department following conviction as well as for individuals after they return from jail or prison. Community programs include access to health care, job training and education to provide tools to support themselves and reduce recidivism. Youth Empowerment and Juvenile Delinquency Prevention. More programs and funding for youth to provide work experience so that youth can gain real-world skills and experience to help them become self- sufficient in a positive way and prevent them from entering the juvenile and/or criminal justice systems. Stronger intervention and prevention programs for commercially exploited minors as well as funding for resources for minors and transitioning youth who have been victims of human trafficking and/or sexual exploitation. Youth Violence Prevention and Education Programs. Funding for violence prevention and education programs and/or counseling programs for youth who are at risk for or who have been involved in crime to provide information about the juvenile justice system; teach about healthy relationships and decision-making, and assist youth to achieve their dreams. Also more partnerships with additional groups to provide counseling, mentorship, case management, life skills, employment and training. Alternative Programs to Incarceration. Advocate for continued funding for alternative programs to incarceration. Enhancing Public Safety. Evaluate and propose changes in the law that protect innocent bystanders and children from mutual gun combat. Consumer Protection, Environmental Protection, and Worker Protection. Increase efforts in Consumer Protection, Environmental Protection, and Worker Protection, particularly around labor trafficking. Collaboration. Advocate for and create a legislative platform to require county agencies to work with community agencies collaboratively to combat human trafficking, specifically the sex trafficking of minors and labor trafficking. PROBATION 9ef65587-3bae-4a60-9808-4d1dd9e60ce5 Probation engages in department-wide efforts to initiate and maintain strong partnerships with all government and community agencies. We establish and maintain community and government partnerships in order to provide PAGE | 112 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countya cohesive system of support for our clients. This partnership includes cross-jurisdictional collaboration with State and County agencies, community and faith-based organizations, therapists, and social workers. The Probation Department supports policies and legislation as follows: Eliminate Racial Disparities. Elimination of disparities among boys and men of color which lead to their disproportionate representation in the juvenile justice system. Commitment to Vulnerable Youth and Families. Commitment to serving vulnerable youth and families and reducing the number of youth crossing over between the child welfare and juvenile justice systems. Expand and Build Support Services and Improve Systems Change under Title IV-E. Expand and build support services aimed at improving system changes that meet the identified Title IV-E goals, which are to reduce the number of youth in out-of-home placements, provide the least restrictive level of placement when out-of- home placement is necessary and promote family preservation and family reunification. Improve Supervision Strategies. Continue to improve supervision strategies using Smart Supervision to better identify, supervise and treat high-risk/high-needs clients. Improve Probation Success Rates. Continue to improve probation success rates thereby increasing public safety, reducing admissions to prisons and jails, and saving taxpayer dollars. Support Public Safety Measures. Continue to support public safety measures such as adopting the use of body-worn cameras. PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE 4f596f33-7bbb-4929-b950-2644b5e044df The Public Defender's Office supports: Protecting and expanding the rights to liberty, privacy, and due process. Protecting all members of the community from unreasonable search, seizure, arrest, detention, and surveillance. Preserving and expanding the right to a fair trial. Strengthening Evidence Code requirements concerning the competency and trustworthiness of evidence to be introduced at trial. Diversion programs and other programs designed to prevent people from coming into the criminal justice system. The decriminalization of non-violent drug possession offenses and a shift of resources from incarceration and criminalization to treatment and harm-reduction practices. Sentencing reform aimed at reducing jail and prison populations, eliminating disproportional sentences, and promoting more just outcomes for those convicted of crimes. Removing barriers to successful reintegration of people into communities after incarceration, such as unnecessary barriers to education, employment, housing, and health and social services. Increasing funding for criminal defense investigation, the retention of experts, and the litigation of complex and/or particularly sensitive cases. Programs designed for rehabilitation, the restoration of rights, and the expungement of criminal records. Increasing the availability of rehabilitation services both for in-custody defendants and those who have been released from custody. Initiatives to promote effective, ethical, and accountable police and law enforcement agencies. Specifically, instituting non-suggestive policies regarding identification procedures, such as double-blind photo line-ups. Increasing treatment program funding for drug and alcohol abuse. Increasing the funding for mental health treatment programs. Promoting ways to divert those with mental illness out of the criminal justice system. Reducing the number of people under supervision by the courts, State, and/or County by agencies including parole and probation. PAGE | 113 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda County Providing effective health care services to all those incarcerated at either the state or county level. Providing social services to impoverished communities, particularly those aimed at preventing criminal behavior, including recidivism. Policies promoting the health and welfare of indigent clients. Principles of Restorative Justice and policies designed to implement those principles. Initiatives promoting racial justice at all levels of the criminal justice system. PLANNING LAND USE AND HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT 9c0cf9ac-c971-46b5-a7f9-75ba4eab3388 HOMELESSNESS AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING d2d9f157-7ce8-427a-acb4-2835f4fa235f The County, like many other Bay Area communities, is experiencing a severe housing crisis. To address this crisis, The County supports policies that: Increase federal funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Veterans Administration and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration (SAMSHA) for programs supporting stable and affordable housing for low-income and homeless populations and work to ensure that HUD uses a fair and equitable formula to determine Fair Market Rent levels that reflect the reality of the housing market in Alameda County. HUD programs that fund affordable housing development have been severely reduced in the last several budget years and continue to be threatened by additional funding reductions. Further decreases to HUD programs will impact local government's ability to respond to the current housing crisis, and an increase in homelessness is the likely result. Stable housing for the lowest-income population has a proven track record of benefits to the community, including: improvements in housing stability, employment, mental and physical health, school attendance, reduction in active substance use, and helps to build strong, healthy communities by improving the safety of neighborhoods, beautifying city blocks with new or rehabilitated properties, and increasing or stabilizing property values over time. Increase and coordinate funding to prevent and end homelessness. Higher funding levels and increased coordination between funding for services and housing is needed to create and sustain supportive housing for highest need and individuals and families who are disabled and homeless. Affordable and supportive housing are critical to preventing and ending homelessness and cost the same or less than shelter, incarceration, hospitalization and other crisis response interventions. Fund and establish policies to protect homeowners from foreclosure and protect the rights of tenants living in foreclosed properties: Communities and neighborhoods in the County are still suffering the effects of high foreclosure rates and resident displacement. The County supports legislative efforts to prevent foreclosures and ameliorate their impacts. PAGE | 114 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda CountyCOMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT 07180abe-e41f-4939-bbc8-97d067f65de4 To create more livable and economically vibrant communities for everyone, the County supports the following policies: Increase funding for the Community Development Block Grant Program and oppose any efforts to decrease the cap on administrative costs for the program. This program provides essential and flexible funding to support the improvement of lower-income communities and provide services and benefits to lower-income households. It has a long track record of success and is a flexible funding source which allows localities to target funds to the most needy communities and households and to address highest types of needs. Extension of the Federal Production Tax Credit. Extension of the federal Production Tax Credit for the expansion of repowering efforts for wind energy. Access to open space : An increase in funding for and access to safe and quality parks, trails, green and open space and recreation centers. Policies should ensure that these opportunities are made available in all communities. A person's neighborhood shapes their opportunities to play, exercise, enjoy nature, and be healthy. Accessible communities. Promote the use of universal design to ensure accessibility of spaces for every one of all abilities. Communities that are designed to be accessible to seniors, children, and people with disabilities will be accessible for everyone. This includes street and sidewalk design, as well as wheelchair accessible public spaces such as parks and community centers, lighting, and other safety issues. Prioritize reinvestment to improve low-income communities. Increased funding to develop community infrastructure such as community centers and day care centers, affordable housing, affordable, reliable transit and infrastructure in local communities. SUSTAINABILITY 1a134b34-e152-41ad-b1cb-bb3939e47a08 SUPPORT FUNDING THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY d6236789-5b01-49f4-a4c1-cf580a000cd1 Support funding through the Department of Energy that enables innovative regional initiatives that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, encourage local government development of renewable energy, support electric vehicle infrastructure, battery storage, energy and water efficiency, and green purchasing programs for government facilities. Support Federal tax incentives that promote the adoption and expedition of renewable fuels such as renewable diesel, bio-diesel, and compressed natural gas (CNG). Support an extension of these tax credits for at least a 5-year period, versus the current mid-year adoption. Incorporate broader incentives for electric vehicle alternatives and charging locations. Support the preservation of the Renewable Fuel Standard, recognizing the importance of increasing production volumes of renewable fuels to ensure diversity in clean alternatives. Support policies to improve the safety of rail transportation and commodities, including prohibiting the transport and handling of coal and crude oil. Move away from the import of foreign oils to allow for greater energy security and the creation of domestic jobs. Support the reauthorization of Federal transportation funds to increase available funds for public transit and pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure. TRANSPORTATION cc50ae94-bddc-4c41-8498-3d0ff1e9c3e9 TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING 8e7c7d0c-2ebc-4b88-8061-444c8378e431 The federal government is an important partner in delivering locally-developed transportation projects. At the local level, counties see the direct impact of federal dollars spent on transportation. In addition to moving goods PAGE | 115 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countyand people, federal transportation investments are major economic drivers for local communities. However, in order to plan and execute large and small-scale transportation projects that are critical to commerce and the American quality of life, counties need long-term funding certainty and a reliable federal partner. It is critical that the Congress provides long-term funding certainty by raising the federal gas tax or finding alternative sources of revenue to make the Highway Trust Fund solvent. The ability of local jurisdictions to effectively plan, maintain and deliver projects for the country's transportation infrastructure system requires the assurance of a reliable and robust Highway Trust Fund in the coming years. Alameda County also supports the thoughtful examination of opportunities for innovative financing structures for the future of the Highway Trust Fund. The County supports legislation and policies that would: Ensure Long-Term Funding Certainty. Alameda County's top transportation priority continues to be the long- term funding certainty and solvency of the Highway Trust Fund. To ensure continued adequate funding streams, the County supports raising the federal gas tax or by finding alternative sources of revenue. The County also supports legislation which protects local receipt of federal transportation and infrastructure funds and enhances revenues for investments in the national transportation infrastructure. Rural Road Safety. Alameda County is a primary destination for regional and inter-regional traffic for goods movement and workforce commute travel between San Joaquin County, Contra Costa County and Santa Clara County. Major transportation corridors in this region routinely experience extreme traffic congestion. In an effort to avoid these congested freeways, commuters continue to seek alternative routes along the rural roads. As a result, many of Alameda County's rural roadways are now being used by commuters attempting to bypass the heavily congested I-580 and I-680 corridors. On these rural roadways, traffic volumes during peak commute hour may be 100 times greater than the traffic volume during non-peak commute hours. The increased traffic congestion and aggressive behaviors by many commuters (speeding, unsafe passing, etc.) result in safety issues, especially for the residents living along these rural roadways. The County supports legislation which increases funding for safety improvements and infrastructure projects on the existing transportation system, with emphasis on programs/projects focused on ensuring rural roads have a dedicated funding source to improve safety and reduce accidents and fatalities.T Streamline Project Delivery. Regulatory inefficiencies continue to hamper the effective and timely delivery of local transportation projects. The County supports legislation that builds on reforms that strive to expedite project delivery, that continue and expand efforts to streamline and expedite project delivery by maintaining the categorical exclusion for projects receiving limited federal assistance ($5 million or less), and that simplify the process for pursuing categorical exclusions. The County also supports the approval of a state-federal \"reciprocity\" pilot program which allows the State of California and the local transportation agencies to carry out federal environmental review processes to streamline and expedite delivery of federally funded projects. Identify Innovative Funding and Financing Methods. Declining transportation revenues require innovating solutions to help local governments stretch federal, State and local investments farther. The County supports the approval of a state-federal environmental \"reciprocity\" pilot program which would allow the State of California and the local transportation agencies to carry out federal environmental provide regulatory streamlining and expedite project delivery of federally funded projects. The County also supports maximizing the use and flexibility of federal funds by not requiring minimum federal matches, eliminating the need to program multiple phases for small projects, and eliminating the need for TIP programming for air quality neutral projects. CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT FUNDING REQUESTS b056cf6e-edb5-44b5-860c-3953f82968ea A significant benefit of Alameda County's capital improvement projects is its contribution towards the area economy; specifically, its contribution to employment opportunities. The Public Works Agency implemented over $50 million of infrastructure improvements over the past two fiscal years. According to a publication titled \"Highway Infrastructure Investment and Job Creation,\" every $1 billion of investment in public infrastructure PAGE | 116 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countywould supports approximately 42,100 full-time jobs. Therefore, the $50 million of improvements implemented by Alameda County's Public Works Agency translates to approximately 2,105 private sector jobs created or saved in the area economy. To continue supporting regional economic and jobs development, Alameda County will continue to apply for available funding opportunities with the Department of Transportation, the Army Corps of Engineers, and others for the high-priority projects listed below. Rural Road Safety Studies (Estimated Total: $15.4M; Federal Funding Requested: $11.8M): Implementation of these safety improvement studies will save lives, prevent injuries and improve the livability along this major rural arterial roadway. Design and construction work will also contribute to improving the economic vitality of the Bay Area by providing employment opportunities in construction jobs and improving access and encouraging businesses to expand in the Bay Area. East Lewelling Boulevard Streetscape Improvement Project, Phase II (Estimated Total: $12.2M; Federal Funding Requested: $10.2M) Implementation of this phase of the project will continue the community transformation benefits achieved in the Phase I project. The improved sidewalks and bicycle lanes will connect the complete streets elements to other regional multi-modal facilities. Design and construction work will also contribute to improving the economic vitality of the Bay Area by providing employment opportunities in construction jobs and improving access for goods movement. The revitalized roadway and aesthetics encourage businesses to expand into the Lewelling Boulevard area. School Area Sidewalk and Safety Projects (Estimated Total/Federal Funding Requested: $14,100,000): Impl ementation of these projects will continue with our program to facilitate safe routes to schools in unincorporated Alameda County. Additional benefits include increased revenues and jobs for local businesses, reduced congestion, better air quality, safer travel routes, and improved health outcomes. The unincorporated areas of Alameda County have over $400 million in needed sidewalk improvements to address community and pedestrian safety, especially near schools. Funding for the design and construction of the much-needed active transportation sidewalks in unincorporated Alameda County is critical. Castro Valley Boulevard Pedestrian Enhancement Project (Estimated Total: $12M; Federal Funding Requested: $10M) The Castro Valley Downtown Area Strategic Plan identifies roadway, sidewalk, and streetscape improvements are necessary to transform the Castro Valley downtown area into a safe pedestrian- oriented retail area. This project is part of the Castro Valley Downtown Streetscape Master Plan and is a high priority for the Castro Valley community to revitalize the downtown commercial business district. Funding and implementation of this project will contribute to improving the economic vitality of Castro Valley by providing a variety of employment opportunities and encouraging businesses to expand in the area. Fruitvale Bridge Lifeline Seismic Retrofit Project (Estimated Total/Federal Funding Requested: $40M): As an island, the City of Alameda is dependent upon four estuary bridges (owned, operated and maintained by Alameda County) and two tubes (owned, operated and maintained by Caltrans) for access. In the event of a catastrophic seismic event, one Alameda County estuary bridge needs to be upgraded to a \"lifeline status\" so that supplies and services can be provided to the City of Alameda in case all other access to/from the city is significantly damaged. A feasibility study has been completed, and the Fruitvale Avenue Bridge was determined to be the most feasible bridge for lifeline seismic retrofitting. Alameda County seeks funding to proceed with the Design and Environmental clearance (estimate: $3M) so that this project is construction-ready when funds become available. Funding and implementation of this project will generate positive economic actions and growth including the creation of over 1,500 job opportunities from the design and environmental phases through project completion. Tesla Road Safety Improvement Projects (Estimated Total: $15.4M; Federal Funding Requested: $11.8M): During 2013-14, the Alameda County Public Works Agency conducted a safety study on Tesla Road to identify and prioritize safety needs along the roadway while also preserving the environment, natural waterways and land. Several safety improvement projects were identified, but there is no identified funding source. Implementation of these safety improvement projects will save lives, prevent injuries and improve the livability along this major rural arterial roadway. Design and construction work will also contribute to improving the PAGE | 117 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countyeconomic vitality of the Bay Area by providing employment in construction jobs, improving access, and encouraging businesses to expand in the Bay Area. GOODS MOVEMENT 6e104671-7c30-457d-b51d-6593994bb8e1 Alameda County is a gateway to the world for goods movement. Its airport, Oakland International, is one of three in the region. The Port of Oakland, the nation's 5th busiest container port, is one of three Pacific Coast gateways with maritime, rail and aviation freight activities. The Port of Oakland is a key economic asset for Alameda County, the greater San Francisco Bay Region and neighboring regions. It supports more than 73,000 jobs in the region and its activities are connected to 827,000 jobs across the United States. As an intermodal operation, port activities impact regional and inter-regional streets, rural roads and highway, rail corridors and waterways. Planning and implementation is underway for future expansion of the Port of Oakland to support its activities and for improvements to the transportation network system. The Alameda County Transportation Commission (ACTC) is developing the first Countywide Good Movement Plan. The Plan also outlines a long-range strategy for how to move goods efficiently, reliably and sustainably within, to, from and through Alameda County by roads, rail, air and water. Because a substantial amount of good movement occurs on local streets and roads throughout Alameda County, the plan also addresses impacts to transportation infrastructure. Challenges faced on the local streets and roads include lack of truck route connectivity across city boundaries, providing safe access by all local streets and road users (autos, pedestrians, bicyclists and public transit) and cut through traffic on rural roads to avoid congestion on major corridors. Additionally, truck traffic on local streets and rural roads designed to accommodate vehicles is resulting in pavement damage and impacting the livability and quality of life for the residents living adjacent to these goods movement corridors. The County supports policies and legislation that would: Expand Goods Movement Funding and Policy Development. Develop policies that preserve and strengthen an integrated and connected multimodal goods movement system, support freight mobility and access, and are coordinated with passenger transportation systems and local land use decisions. Improve Goods Movement Infrastructure. The County supports legislation, policies and funding to study, plan, fund and implement improvements for a safe, efficient, resilient and well-maintained goods movement facilities and corridors. The County also supports legislation, policies and funding to study, plan and design safety improvements along local streets and rural roads to accommodate the increasing goods movement traffic, including driveway consolidation for truck access to wineries, left-turn pockets and truck deceleration lanes. Identify Goods Movement Funding Stream. Identifying a funding stream for goods movements to maintain and improve the goods movement infrastructure. Develop supports programs that reduce and mitigate impacts from goods movement operations to create a healthy and clean environment and support improved quality-of-life for people most impacted by goods movement. Prioritize Bay Area Transportation Systems. The County supports legislation and policies that prioritize the Bay Area transportation systems in both State and federal planning and funding processes. PAGE | 118 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda CountyONGOING FUNDING FOR I-580 CORRIDOR IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS be0c3489-0043-4f69-aedb-1b1da8ecff6d The I-580 corridor in the Tri-Valley is one of the most traffic congested in the Bay Area region. It serves as a key inter-regional gateway between the Bay Area and the Central Valley for goods movement and workforce commute travel. This chronic condition has resulted in I-580's designation in the top five most congested Bay Area corridors identified in the annual report jointly published by Caltrans and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC). This congestion will worsen as traffic volumes in this corridor are projected to increase 90 percent by 2030. To respond to the existing and projected congestion, Alameda County Transportation Commission (Alameda CTC) has identified a series of planned improvements for this corridor. Over the years, a number of these improvements have been implemented, including construction of an eastbound High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes and a new interchange at Isabel/SR 84 in Livermore. Improvements currently underway include a westbound HOV lane, completion of the auxiliary lane system, the conversion of the HOV lanes to express/HOT(toll) lanes an eastbound truck climbing lane. Projects in the planning stage include the reconstruction of the existing I-580/I-680 interchange and a BART connection to the Altamont Commuter Express (ACE) inter-regional passenger rail, with a Phase 1 extension at I-580 and Isabel Avenue/SR 84 in Livermore. Alameda County continues its support of the ongoing funding for the I-580 Corridor improvement projects. SUPPORT FOR REGIONAL AND INTER-REGIONAL PARTNERSHIPS AND PROJECTS 37907c5a-effa-4f5d-a281-31a9117666b6 With 20% percent of the population, Alameda County experiences 40% of the traffic congestion within the nine- county San Francisco Bay Area region. Intersected by numerous inter-regional rail and highway corridors which serve as gateways into the region, Alameda County has a robust transportation infrastructure including local streets and roads, freight corridors, express lane implementation and transit systems. Through regional coordination and funding partnerships at all levels of government, a significant investment to improve transportation infrastructure occurred county-wide in recent years. Alameda County supports and encourages continued cross-jurisdictional partnerships to deliver transportation projects and programs to its constituents. Since 1986, Alameda County and its 14 cities have been recipients of a county-wide, voter-approved sales tax measure dedicated to transportation investments throughout Alameda County. The county supports policies and legislation that would: Expand Partnerships. The County supports efforts that encourage and promote regional and megaregional cooperation and coordination to develop, promote and fund solutions to transportation infrastructure improvement and support governmental efficiencies and cost savings in transportation. This is essential to complete planning and development of important regional transportation projects that benefit the State and local road system including Crow Canyon Road, Vasco Road, Tesla Road and Patterson Pass Road in unincorporated Alameda County. The County also supports efforts that encourage and facilitate the establishment of public-private partnerships and low-cost financing strategies. Policy Development. The County supports policy development to influence transportation planning, policy and funding at the county, regional, State and federal levels. Express/Hot Lane Expansion. The County supports Express/HOT (high-occupancy toll) Lane expansion in Alameda County and the Bay Area. PUBLIC TRANSIT 5aa0dcc3-ef27-46ac-abe6-537ebe1d28ef With the passage of AB 32 and SB 375 that require the reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG) and the integration of transportation, land use and housing planning, California is on the forefront of built environment policies. The implementation of these two bills at the regional and local level can have an impact on planning decisions in local PAGE | 119 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countycommunities to reduce GHG and improve health. Transportation funding should support all modes and all users and not promote highway expansions to ensure the long-term effectiveness in reducing GHG and improving overall health. In addition to reducing the number of vehicle miles driven, public transit also encourages more active transportation like walking and biking as people get to and from their bus or train, which helps to make an impact on the obesity epidemic. Access to affordable and reliable public transit is particularly vital to health for low- income communities, youth, seniors, and people with disabilities that rely on it to get to jobs, school, and medical appointments and to visit family members and other support systems. The opportunity for social interaction and access to jobs increases and the reliance on air-polluting vehicles decreases when jobs and services are placed close to homes with accessible and affordable public transit options. The County supports the following policies to increase access to public transit: Prioritize Increased Funding for Public Transit . Dedicate a higher proportion of existing transportation funding streams to increase the availability, accessibility, reliability, and affordability of public transit options, particularly local buses, as well as connectivity to regional rail systems by walking and biking. The County also supports increased funds to upgrade unsafe infrastructure. Prioritize Funding for Low-Income and Transit-Dependent Populations . Direct public transit funds to uses which benefit low-income populations and transit dependent populations, such as seniors, youth and people with disabilities, including maintaining and improving local transit service levels, improving affordability through free and reduced fare programs, and the coordination of alternative transportation options as part of a mobility management strategy. Prioritize Transit-Oriented Development Over Urban Sprawl . Increase housing density in urban areas, rather than suburban and rural areas, increase housing and transit affordability for low-income communities with anti-displacement protections, reduce parking requirements and locate housing and jobs near rail and bus lines. In addition, the County supports the inclusion of anti-displacement provisions and protections in transit- oriented development projects, in order to support the ability of existing residents to stay and benefit from improvements in their neighborhoods. Prioritize Greenhouse Gas Reduction Goal-setting and Funds for Vulnerable Communities. Increasing greenhouse gas reduction goals and support policies and funding that benefit health and well-being for communities facing environmental hazards, health burdens, high levels of neighborhood poverty and other vulnerabilities. In addition, the County supports prioritizing transportation policies and projects that have greater benefits than burdens for vulnerable communities and which minimize unintended consequences, such as displacement. EDUCATION a4991a0a-3baf-47bd-87c4-17abc389d97c To promote equity and ensure a bright future for all of our children, the County supports federal-level education policies that achieve the following across the life course: Increase Federal Budget funding for primary and secondary education, and prioritize resources for low-income students of color. The County supports policies that create increased and more equitable funding for education to increase reading proficiency, particularly for third-grade students of color, and increase transparency and promote family engagement, while ensuring fair taxation for residents and businesses. Elementary school investment should include increased funding for arts, music, physical education, college mentoring, parent engagement, academic tutoring and after-school enrichment programs. Secondary school investments should focus on creating and expanding programs and public and private employment sector partnerships with higher education to increase internships, college and career preparedness with special emphasis on policies that support funding and adoption of Linked Learning; more flexible adult education, particularly to support transitioning youth after being released by probation by supporting Transition Center services and allowing youth to finish credits towards receiving high school diplomas and improving the connection with school districts within County; and increasing educational PAGE | 120 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countyopportunities for people that are formerly incarcerated. The County supports increased funding for IDEA (special education), Common Core Standards Implementation and for SBAC (school testing method). Support policies and increased funding to ensure all high school students graduate and are college and career ready. For those unable to graduate, support policies to ensure the highest level of training that result in better employment outcomes, including obtaining a GED, alternative schools or programs to complete a high school diploma or other pathways to receive diploma credits, such as Civic Corps and on the job work experience. The County supports policies that prepare high school students for college and career while providing wraparound supports, reduction of disproportionate graduation and drop-out rates and expansion of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics education in low-income communities and communities of color. State and federal efforts, beginning in primary education environments to increase access to math, science, and technology education, are increasingly critical to prepare future job seekers for competition in the job market and to improve education and health outcomes, particularly for communities of color who are underrepresented in these fields. The County supports the creation of more opportunities for sustainable funding streams for Linked Learning, career pathways and career technical training, such as the California Career Pathway Trust Fund, particularly for low- income students of color, students with disabilities, foster youth, and boys of color. Increase funding, access and affordability to post-secondary education and provide debt management assistance. The County supports policies and funding to strengthen the community college system and remove barriers to educational opportunities, including policies that ensure affordable tuition and reduce the burden of student debt. The County supports solutions such as permanent instatement of the American Opportunity Tax Credit, expansion of the Pell Grant program, increased access to Income-Based Repayment for federal student loans, incentives for community colleges to participate in the federal loan program, expansion of loan forgiveness programs, and stronger consumer protections for private student loan borrowers. Additionally, the County supports policies such as the DREAM Act that protect undocumented youth who want to attend higher education from deportation and that secure funding for their education. The demand for higher education in California exceeds the capacity of State and community college systems that are a gateway to higher education and economic opportunity that are particularly critical for low income communities and students of color. Eliminate inequities in funding and access to quality teachers, particularly teachers of early childhood, special education, and Dual Language Learners. The County supports policies to increase investments in recruitment, retention and support of teachers through competitive salaries, high-quality mentoring, and ongoing professional development, especially among teachers of special education, those in low-income schools, and teachers of English Language Learners and special education. Support policies that increase professional development of administrators and teachers including training on restorative justice, diversity, inclusion, and mental health. The County supports efforts to protect, stabilize and increase funding for Early Care and Education (ECE) and ECE professional development, with a focus on dedicated paid training days for staff at Title V-contracted centers. Require basic teaching credentials for teachers of students learning English face, who like special education students, face unique challenges to school success. Eliminate inequities to quality early childhood education access. Increase funding for early childhood education; adequately fund inclusive early childhood education classrooms. Increase state and federal efforts to subsidize early childhood programs and improve the link between reimbursement rates for State-contracted programs and those funded with vouchers, and continue to expand funds for a Quality Rating and Improvement System for all Early Childhood Education programs. Increase funding to promote full service community schools and ensure all students are healthy and ready to learn. Support adoption of full service community schools, resources for coordination of learning supports (i.e. community school coordinators), and promotion of partnerships between youth, families, schools, community- based organizations, businesses, and other entities. Support increased funding for full service community schools through the adoption of comprehensive and sustainable education revenues and a reform package that establishes PAGE | 121 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countyan equitable, adequate finance system that ensures transparency, continues to enable greater local decision-making flexibility, and strengthens human capital and accountability. The County supports efforts that increase access to violence prevention programs and services, including programs that promote healthy inter-personal relationships. Support policies that prevent the school to prison pipeline that disproportionately affects low income students of color and students with disabilities. Provide funding for programs and services particularly in schools with low academic performance, low income students of color, and particularly for African American and Latino males that reduce chronic student absenteeism and truancy and ensure students attend school ready to learn,, including funded mandates for schools to track attendance data to create an absenteeism and truancy early warning system that identifies frequently absent children and connects them and their families with comprehensive, wraparound interventions, such as coordinated medical care, behavioral and mental health services, youth development programs, parent, family and community engagement programs. Increase funding for programs such as male involvement programs and mentoring that aim to reduce disparities in early literacy skills, graduation rates, and dropout rates, among low-income students and students of color, particularly boys of color. Ensure students with disabilities (including learning, emotional and physical disabilities) have equal access to educational opportunities. Improve the identification rate of students with disabilities to promote equal access to education. Support policies to reinstate teaching credential requirements for special education teachers. The County supports strengthening the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1974 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Support policies and practices that abolish and prevent the use of physical restraint, use of force and seclusion and eliminate the disproportionate suspension and expulsion rates among students of color and students with disabilities. Eliminate punitive and zero tolerance policies and preschool suspensions. The County supports legislation that builds positive school climates, funding three-tiered behavioral health supports (i.e., universal, targeted and individual supports), staff and teacher training and consultation for the creation of trauma/ healing- informed classrooms and schools to foster early intervention alternatives to expulsions, in and out-of-school suspensions, and reforms in suspension policies for defiance at all grade levels, particularly for African American students, and Latino and Pacific Islander males. The County also supports policies that increase transparency, accountability and professional development of administrators and teachers including training in restorative justice, diversity, inclusion and mental health with a focus on trauma-informed care. Promote health and wellness among students and healthy school environments. Increase access particularly for students of color and students in families with mixed immigration status to safe, appropriate health, dental and mental health services within schools, including school-based health centers. The County supports policies that increase funding flexibility for County services and builds teacher and parent awareness on the issue of sexually exploited minors. The County supports comprehensive wellness policies that reduce chronic diseases (such as asthma and diabetes), communicable disease (such as sexually transmitted infections (STI's)), promotes programs aimed at decreasing teen pregnancy and STI's, particularly among youth of color who experience disproportionate rates of STI's, and policies that reduce childhood obesity and other physical activity and diet-related diseases. The County supports policies that create healthy school environments both on-campus and in surrounding neighborhoods, including policies that improve access to fresh and nutritious food in and around schools; prohibit unhealthy food vendors at or near schools; increase access to clean drinking water in schools, and preventing unnecessary exposure to environmental toxins. The County supports the inclusion of youth in decision-making processes, including former probation youth and foster youth. IMMIGRATION 01390568-b784-4c9b-93fe-df9c31466630 The County supports federal-level policies that achieve the following: Pass comprehensive immigration reform with a clear path to citizenship. The County supports immigration reform that provides an expedited, common-sense route to citizenship for new Americans who aspire to become citizens, recognizes the contribution of immigrants, and keeps families together here in this country. PAGE | 122 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda CountyThe County was supportive of the spirit of the Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013, passed by the Senate (S.744), and is supportive of future legislation that addresses our concerns related to the affordability of the Registered Immigrant Status program for undocumented immigrants, as well as some of the other barriers in the current proposal that will narrow the number of people able to take advantage of the program. The County supports prioritizing the needs and welfare of children and families with children in Immigration Reform by including the following principles: prioritizing family unity, resources for unaccompanied immigrant youth, and appropriate, humanitarian and accountable training policies and protocols for interacting with and screening children. Support policies and programs that ensure the right to an attorney during immigration proceedings for immigrant adults, families and unaccompanied immigrant youth and funding to ensure the provision of free legal assistance. Support deferred action programs. Support policies and programs for deferred action, which is a form of administrative relief from deportation that enables eligible immigrants to register with the government, request a reprieve from removal, and apply for a temporary work permit. The Obama Administration's expanded Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) would provide work authorization so that immigrant populations can work and contribute more to their communities and allow millions of immigrant families to live without fear of separation. Protect the health and welfare of children and children whose parents are being detained or deported by Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) or Border Patrol. The County supports policies that protect children of parents detained or deported within the current system. Additionally, the County supports policies prioritizing the needs and welfare of children in Immigration Reform by including the following principles: prioritizing family unity, resources for unaccompanied immigrant youth, and creating appropriate, humanitarian, transparent and accountable training policies and protocols for interacting with and screening children. End Secure Communities and all detention and deportation programs, including Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), which contains the same flaws. The County supports reforms that will reduce the negative impacts of detention and deportation programs on public safety, civil liberties, public health, and the conditions of detainees. PEP, similar to the Secure Communities program before it, entangles local law enforcement with federal detention and deportation, damaging confidence in law enforcement, separating families, causing civil liberties violations including double-punishment and undermining our values of rehabilitation. Support policies to limit transfers and holds in local jails and eliminate the fear of deportation such as in California's Transparent Review of Unjust Transfers and Holds (TRUTH) Act of 2016 (AB 2792) and the TRUST Act of 2014 (AB 4). Increase access to education, particularly higher education. The County supports legislation that increases primary and secondary school resources for students with Limited English Proficiency. The County supports policies that increase access to post-secondary education through legislation such as the DREAM Act. Alameda County also supports legislation that extends and increases access to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals to more people. Protect against racial profiling based on \"perceived\" immigration status, ethnicity, religion, or national origin. The County supports legislation that identifies and eliminates racial profiling in the public and private sectors. Increase access to culturally and linguistically appropriate behavioral health and health care for immigrants. The County supports legislation that increases equitable access to quality, affordable health care coverage and services, and includes undocumented immigrants not covered by the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and promotes culturally and linguistically appropriate care. The County supports policies and funding to reduce the barriers to enrollment of undocumented immigrants in Medicare and policies to streamline, integrate and coordinate services and providers, such as a one-stop approach to services. Promote public safety by supporting policies to ensure that reporting crimes, including domestic violence, to local authorities, does not lead to deportation proceedings. Support funding for an evaluation of the new driver's license program established through California legislation, AB 60 (2013), to ensure that it is not used by PAGE | 123 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countylocal law enforcement for racial profiling of people with the driver's license. Protect and promote the well-being of immigrant workers, including undocumented workers. The County supports legislation that protects immigrant workers, especially vulnerable undocumented population, from wage theft, and extends important labor standards to jobs predominantly occupied by immigrants, such as migrant workers and domestic workers. Federal immigration laws should reflect our country's core values of fairness and respect for work and protect all workers' labor and civil rights. The County supports policies restricting, rather than building on, a burdensome \"employer sanctions framework.\" Immigration I-9 audits and the unjust E-Verify program are of major concern as they put workers at risk for being fired. Ensure nondiscriminatory, equal treatment under the law, and protect the confidentiality and privacy of individuals. The County supports actions that affirmatively extend access to public services and benefits to all residents, regardless of immigration status, and prohibits social services providers from reporting allegedly undocumented immigrants to authorities.Support policies that prohibit landlords from threatening to report tenants to Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) or Border Patrol. Due process should also be ensured for immigrants in federal and local detention facilities and those facing deportation. Restore benefits to legal immigrants that were lost in 1996 legislation that imposed a 5-year ban on federal means-tested benefits for documented immigrants. The County supports restoring benefits and ensuring legal immigrants have access to basic assistance, including but not limited to linguistically appropriate behavioral health, health care, and nutrition supports. JOBS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 89b78107-153c-46b8-836c-1483b9ede869 CREATE A STRONG AND ROBUST JOB-DRIVEN SYSTEM b91fd146-a391-483b-8bf1-3f18e92d6edf Invest in Systems and Policies that Support Workers and Employers Expand Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) Funding. WIOA is a federal law that reauthorized the nation's employment and training programs related to adult, youth, and dislocated workers, as well as adult education and vocational rehabilitation programs created under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA). Additional funding is needed to operationalize WIOA and achieve the goals of this legislation. Specifically, funding is needed to develop more coordinated training programs for job seekers that lead to industry recognized and valued credentials/certificates, enhance supportive services for job seekers, provide more stipends for youth participants in work-based learning programs, and enhance overall coordination between the Local Workforce Development Boards (LWDBs), California Community College Districts, Adult Schools/Adult Consortium, K-12 education, and Economic Development agencies. Invest in education that prepares individuals for the 21st century workforce. Alameda County supports the alignment of the education and workforce investment systems to meet the needs of the 21st century workforce and promotes and develops a well-educated and highly-skilled workforce. A special effort should be made to support education in the Science, Technology, Education, and Math (STEM) areas and pathways to careers in high-growth sectors. Support fair and sustainable wages. Alameda County supports policies that aim to create livable wages, promote income mobility, and close the gender and racial wage gaps. Promote job creation and economic development. Alameda County supports policies and programs that create local jobs. Specifically, tax incentives, innovative funding mechanisms to support public/private partnerships, waivers, support for small businesses and entrepreneurs, and policies that promote/support locally-made products. Policies should increase resources for \"proactive\" business assistance programs that prevent closures and mitigate job loss. Support integrated employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities in alignment with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Alameda County supports policies and programs that provide integrated employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities and proper accommodations and supports in the PAGE | 124 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countyworkplace. Extend workplace rights, protections, and resources to all victims of crime. All victims should be treated with dignity and respect by their employer and should have access to reasonable time off to receive medical treatment and recover from the crime. Support resources and policies that promote workforce alignment activities articulated in the Alameda County Regional and Local Plan. Alameda County supports and reaffirms the Regional and Local Plan of the Alameda County Workforce Development Board (ACWDB), which acts as a strategic road map for the implementation of the WIOA program via collaborative partnerships that strengthen training outcomes and services to job seekers and increase employer engagement in Alameda County. Reauthorize the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education (CTE) Act. Reauthorization of this Act is essential to support career technical education at the local level within the California Community College Districts, which can be leveraged by the ACWDB and its mandated partners in planning and operationalizing CTE programs. CTE programs and courses are aligned with industry needs and result in the attainment of industry recognized certificates and credentials that can offer quicker onramps to the labor market. Support Individuals with Barriers to Employment Support policies that create employment and educational opportunities for long-term unemployed workers, discouraged workers, individuals with disabilities, returning/re-entry populations, low-income adults, and at-risk youth. Alameda County supports subsidized employment, supportive services, summer and year-round employment opportunities for youth (including youth in foster care), and programs and supports to help low-income adults, CalWORKs clients, Limited English Proficient (LEP) clients, formerly incarcerated individuals, and discouraged workers obtain education and training leading to jobs, experience, and industry recognized and valued credentials. Support programs that develop and/or enhance employment and educational services to Limited English Proficient (LEP) and immigrants populations. Alameda County supports programs that create access to employment, training, and supportive services for LEP and immigrant populations, as well as legislation that promotes the alignment between WIOA and the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act programs, to support the educational attainment of immigrant and foreign-born individuals. Policies should support the partnership between the LWDBs and entities carrying out DREAM Act programs. Support and expand workforce development efforts that promote career pathways and address racial, cultural, and economic disparities in employment and achievement . Alameda County supports programs and policies that help prepare and integrate communities of color, individuals experiencing homelessness, low- income immigrant and migrant workers, older workers, individuals with disabilities, formerly incarcerated individuals, veterans, and other individuals with barriers to employment into the workforce. Expand support of Adult Schools and programs that offer basic and remedial skill attainment for individuals who need on-ramps into sustainable-wage careers. Alameda County supports programs and initiatives that aim to help individuals who need basic skills training in order to be successful. Increase employment opportunities for older adults and individuals with disabilities. Alameda County supports policies that help older adults and individuals with disabilities access training and employment opportunities that lead to competitive and integrated employment. Specifically, we support policies such as subsidized employment or tax incentives that encourage employers to hire older adults and individuals with disabilities. Remove the criminal background check requirement from initial job application requirements . Economic opportunity is greatly diminished for formerly incarcerated individuals (who are disproportionately people of color) because of employment discrimination against people with criminal records. California and the federal government should pass broad \"Ban the Box\" legislation that requires an employer to determine a job applicant's minimum qualifications before obtaining and considering information regarding the applicant's conviction history. Extend and expand tax credits for employers who hire and retain individuals with barriers to employment. PAGE | 125 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda CountySpecifically, Alameda County supports the Workforce Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC), a federal tax credit available to employers who hire and retain veterans and individuals from other target groups with significant barriers to employment. Alameda County supports extending and expanding the WOTC and other similar tax incentives for employers. Support access to federal financial aid for individuals with previous drug-related offenses. The opportunity to go to college and improve one's economic position is limited for those with previous drug offenses because they do not have access to federal student aid. Evidence shows that recidivism is greatest when individuals do not have access to employment and educational opportunities. Restrictions on financial aid should be removed so that all individuals can have the opportunity to continue their education. Expand Opportunities for Youth Invest in intensive summer programs geared toward work readiness and STEM-related occupations. Work- readiness programs geared toward STEM-related occupations, and/or other in-demand occupations, combine work with learning and provides valuable opportunities for youth to stay engaged in summer learning. Additionally, when youth are engaged in the summer, they may gain exposure to a variety of industries and career paths, while also learning skills that can help them succeed during the academic school. Support and expand programs that serve young people. Alameda County supports investments in programs and services targeted at young people both in and out-of-school to assist them in their career and educational development. Specifically, programs should target young people who have left school, foster youth, homeless youth, juvenile justice involved youth, and other youth with barriers to employment. Reinstate a federal summer youth employment program. Although many youth are eager to work and begin building their skills, few resources are available to initiate programs specifically focused on populations in low- income communities or distressed neighborhoods, where job opportunities are declining. Summer jobs programs traditionally strive to deliver the first work experience to young adults and prepare them for work as they learn soft skills, career awareness, and some basic skills. IMPROVING HEALTH OUTCOMES BY ADDRESSING SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS 28d21afa-1065-4bea-a0c8-b37b118a9639 The County supports the following policies in order to improve the economic and health outcomes of all its residents: Enact a higher federal minimum wage. Increasing the income of low-wage workers is fundamental to positive health outcomes because it provides access to important health-enabling resources, including proper nutrition, good medical care, stable health insurance, and favorable housing \u2014 all of which can be leveraged to avoid risks and protect health. Create policy that closes loopholes and includes cost of living increases. Federal services that are dependent on fixed rates should be adequately funded to ensure continued service provision. Protect worker health and safety. Strengthen existing laws and enforcement for worker health and safety. Strengthen existing laws and enforcement for worker health and safety, including paid sick days and family leave. Support policies to ensure healthy and safe working conditions and to prevent unnecessary harmful exposures for all workers. Protect and expand worker's rights. Enact federal legislation that protects and strengthens workers' right to organize and collectively bargain, such as labor peace agreements and card-check and neutrality agreements. This includes protecting the rights of temporary and contingent workers and supporting policies that require fair and stable work schedules. Support efforts to educate workers, including youth and immigrants, about worker rights. Restore civil rights protections and reduce barriers for formerly incarcerated people in the workplace. For merly incarcerated individuals often struggle to access quality employment because of barriers maintained by State policy. The County supports policies that enable formerly incarcerated individuals to access quality jobs and economic stability. Increase access to entrepreneurship opportunities. (1) Support microenterprise through policies that PAGE | 126 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countysupport community-based non-profit microenterprise and financial organizations that support entrepreneurs, expand access to private markets and sources of capital, establish supportive tax environments, and allow microenterprise to serve as an eligible activity for recipients for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and Social Security Disability Insurance; (2) Support co-operatives and create incentives for employee ownership through State policies that promote sound business conversion to cooperative business models, including but not limited to Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOPs), tax incentives and mandated assistance, as well as removing barriers to starting co-operative businesses; and (3) Support policies that expand access to capital among entrepreneurs of color and persons with disabilities, such as adapting the New Markets Tax Credit and the Small Business Administration loans program to targetthose businesses. Improve the quality of low-wage jobs and provide pathways to middle-wage jobs. Enforce labor laws, including enforcing against misclassification of workers and preventing wage theft Support strategies to coordinate sector-based training programs and pipelines from apprenticeships and credentialing programs to industries with job growth, including replacement jobs for retirees. Expand and reform Unemployment Insurance. In an increasingly volatile economy, working families need a strong unemployment insurance program. However, the unemployment insurance safety net has failed to keep pace with the changing labor force, especially the growth in women, part-time and low-wage workers, meaning that unemployment benefits are out of reach for many. Support expansion and reform of the UI system. Use government purchasing and contracting to promote living wage work. Government spending can be used to shift more industries towards providing better wages and benefits. Through approaches like living wage standards and \"best value\" bid evaluation systems that recognize the benefits to both taxpayers and working families. In addition, the County supports supplier diversity policies - which require businesses to engage in proactive and measureable efforts to provide diverse suppliers equal access to contracting opportunities. Ensure equitable taxation. Tax code benefits accrue to the wealthiest 5 percent of taxpayers and largely miss the asset-poor majority in this country. Meaningful incentives to save for residents of all income groups should be provided, and the tax system should benefit all residents equally. Successful tax credits, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) should be expanded to continue lifting people out of poverty across the nation. Support asset and wealth-building efforts while regulating against unfair financial practices. Policies and practices that prevent predatory financial practices, increase access to quality financial services and products, and support financial literacy will help to build wealth. Reform the financial sector. Support efforts to prevent financial institutions from becoming \"too big to fail\" and strengthen consumer financial protections and other regulations in the banking sector. LOCAL GOVERNMENT ae1c9606-d8ed-44c9-916b-254bbcc045e8 LOCAL REVENUE AND ECONOMIC INCENTIVES b64a3264-b453-4ab7-9fd5-e1c7681388b1 Support requiring federal agencies to create \"Economic Inclusion Plans\" which mandate agencies to create spending plans to create jobs in low-income communities and communities of color. Support equitable taxation, a tax system to benefit all residents equally, and reduce poverty by implementing the following approaches: (1) Expand the Earned Income Tax Credit, the country's most successful anti-poverty program, to increase access and create more work incentives and benefits for single fathers and childless adults, to build upon the successes of the program. (2) Reduce the tax burden on the lowest income earners by reforming tax codes rather than cutting services, specifically through measures such as those laid out as part of President Obama's proposed American Jobs Act of 2011. (3) Permanently raise taxes on high-income individuals, limit deductions for wealthier filers, target tax loopholes, and end certain corporate tax breaks and subsidies used by large corporations. PAGE | 127 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda County (4) Spare retirees from any changes in Social Security and direct most of the cuts in MediCare spending to health care providers instead of beneficiaries. Oppose the imposition of federal mandates for which funding is not fully provided and budget actions that result in a negative impact to Alameda County. FLOOD CONTROL AND WATER RESOURCES e30e5ef5-b464-4d3e-b274-1859dab82aa7 INCREASED FUNDING FOR FLOOD PROTECTION 5d6bd44e-fe9a-4d37-914c-c9c9131b07ef Continued protection from flooding and protecting its natural resources in Alameda County requires legislative remedies including increased funding for flood protection, levee repair and wetland restoration projects, and developing adaptive strategies to climate change and sea level rise. To address new requirements by the State Agencies, funding is needed for both planning and construction of capital improvement projects. The County supports policies and legislation that would: Ensure Consistency Between State and Federal Definitions. The State Water Resources Control Board's proposed Wetland and Riparian Protection Policy includes different terms and definitions of wetlands. The County supports legislation that would ensure consistency between federal and State definitions of wetlands and result in a reasonable requirement that will have the least impact on the development, operation, and maintenance of essential public works projects and facilities. Ensure Levee Funding. Identification of additional funding sources and opportunities are necessary to ensure levee maintenance in Alameda County, including repair and reconstruction after a flood event. Implement Service Agreements. Encourage State and federal regulatory agencies to offer service agreements public entity applicants and permittees to fund additional personnel or contractors needed for expeditious permit processing. Ensure Climate Change Resiliency. The County supports State and federal funding to study, design and implement coastal flood protection solutions to protect Alameda County residents from effects of sea level rise, extreme tides due to climate change. The County also supports the facilitation and establishment of partnerships among local, State and federal agencies to promote protection from floods and climate change adaptation and resiliency. STREAMLINE ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATORY AND PROJECT DELIVERY PROCESS 9bfc45c1-b289-4ddc-b229-6d89a0da1d42 Regulatory inefficiencies continue to hamper the effective and timely delivery of flood control projects. Delivery of flood control projects is bogged down by multiple redundant and overlapping regulatory agency approval processes, long time frames, and required reports and mitigation that do not add significantly to improving the environment yet result in costly project delivery costs. To this end, Alameda County seeks legislative remedies to eliminate regulatory redundancies, streamline regulatory burdens and advocate for funding support to adequate staffing levels at the local, state, and federal regulatory agencies. The County supports policies and legislation that would: Encourage Service Agreements. Allows and encourage State and federal regulatory agencies to offer service agreements to public entity applicants and permittees to fund additional personnel or contractors needed for expeditious permit processing. Include Mandated Response Timelines in Review and Approval Process. The County supports legislation and policies that improve the environmental review and regulatory approval processes by mandating specific time frames for the Federal review process to ensure already prescribed schedule and deadlines specified in the environmental review process, reduce overhead, and eliminate waste and redundant documentation. Approve the CEQA-NEPA Reciprocity Pilot Program. Approve the CEQA-NEPA reciprocity pilot program PAGE | 128 Federal Legislative Priorities 2017 Alameda Countybuilds on California's successful implementation of the Surface Transportation Project Delivery Program and allow for even greater project streamlining to enhance efficiency in flood control projects. Identify Review Process Enhancements. Review processing and approval timeframe could be dramatically reduced by providing expedited review for projects that are consistent with an adopted Sustainability Communities Strategy and exempting maintenance projects and activities of existing flood control facilities and infrastructure from permit requirements under the Endangered Species Act. Encourages Partnerships. Facilitate and establish local, State and federal agency partnerships in habitat restoration/resource protection including developing adaptive strategies to climate change and sea level rise. FLOOD CONTROL PROJECT FUNDING REQUEST - SAN LORENZO CREEK FLOOD a0a02e28-bb50-4c12-8e9f-de19b6761896 Alameda County Flood Control and Water Conservation District (District) will begin preliminary engineering for a project to implement improvements using Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) funding in the amount of $500,000 which will provide increased flood protection to contain the updated 100-year design flow within San Lorenzo Creek. This project will reduce the potential for future flooding, enable the District to apply to FEMA with a Letter of Map Revision to remove the 100-year floodplain designation and eliminate the mandatory requirement to purchase expensive flood insurance for affected residents.

Flood Control & Water Conservation District PAGE | 134 County Department Summaries 2017 Alameda CountyRoles and Responsibilities The Board of Supervisors sets policy for County government, subject to a variety of changing demands and expectations. Each Board member shares a responsibility to represent the County as a whole, while representing a specific district from which he or she is elected. Fiscal Responsibilities The Board of Supervisors is responsible for helping to develop, adopt, and oversee the County budget, balancing expenses against revenues and reflecting mandated obligations as well as locally-identified priorities. As a primary management tool, the budget serves as a reflection of values and is subject to adjustment as conditions warrant and collective policy decisions dictate. Management Responsibilities A fundamental responsibility of each Supervisor is participation in the development and, from time to time, modification of policy. While a myriad of factors and forces influence the legislative process, key resources for advice and counsel are available from the County Agency/Department Heads who possess professional knowledge and procedural skill in evaluating policy options. An extension of this key function is the oversight of County operations to assure that policy, once adopted, is fully and appropriately carried out by the Department Heads, in collaboration with the County Administrator. By working with Agency/Department Heads, both elected and appointed, the Supervisors can assure themselves and their constituents that policy intent is fulfilled Community The needs and interests of constituents represent a significant area of responsibility for a Board member.
