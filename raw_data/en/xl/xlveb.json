In an exclusive Q&A with BELatina News, AdonysX basked in the glory, expressing how much this win meant to him and his loved ones. Read on to see what he had to say about his victory. Interview Highlights The interview was slightly edited for clarity and brevity. Congratulations on your recent achievement, AdonysX! Can you share your thoughts about this moment? Thank you! It's truly amazing to see everything come together. I've expressed to my colleagues how much this means to me and to Venezuela. Right now, it's a mix of feelings, but it's all about joy and happiness. There's a bit of nostalgia because some loved ones I wish were here to celebrate with me aren't nearby, but I know they'll enjoy this news once they find out. That thought keeps me happy. Can you talk about these important people you mentioned? Of course. If I could talk to them right now, I'd be overwhelmed with emotions. My mother, my sister - they're in another country, which hits me hard. It's both exciting and emotional, but I'm sure they'll be thrilled about it too. Your performance was outstanding. How did you prepare for this achievement? Thank you for that! Well, beyond just training, which was crucial, it's all about concentration and focusing on what truly matters. I used to be a bit undisciplined in my approach to rap, but this time, I poured in discipline, attention, and love for what I do. Studying previous results inspired me to keep going, and reading played a big role. I dived into various things - general knowledge, news articles, even online books, like ones from Paulo Coelho. It's about nurturing yourself, you know? Tell us what you feel when you're on stage. When you're up there, it's different - we're raw, we're street-born, and sometimes words just slip out. But it's all because of the emotions. I'd love to maintain a clean rap, but that's not freestyle. It's a spontaneous expression. Your journey is so inspiring. What advice would you give to other Latinos aspiring to reach your level? I'd tell them that we're all equals. I'm just like them. It's about setting your goal and working towards it. If it doesn't work the first time, keep at it. Even if it takes several tries, don't stop fighting for it. Any last words for our audience at BELatina News? Absolutely. Stay active, stay happy. Keep an eye on the channel because exciting things are coming - racks and freestyles. The event is going to be incredible, and you should definitely enjoy every bit of it.
