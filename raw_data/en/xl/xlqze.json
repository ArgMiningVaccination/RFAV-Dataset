PROPERTY AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER 47 PUBLICATIONS 49 INVESTIGATOR-INITIATED EXTERNAL FUNDING 64 6 | Carolinas HealthCare SystemNEUROSCIENCES Department of Neurology In 2013, the research team within the Department of Neurology at Carolinas Medical Center (CMC) expanded its focus while continuing to offer innovative research options and new medications to patients with chronic neurological conditions. The research team includes 10 highly skilled and experienced principal investigators and 14 clinical research coordinators and analysts. Currently, over 40 Phase II - Phase IV active clinical research trials are managed across the following diagnoses: multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease (PD)/movement disorders, epilepsy, stroke, dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and muscular dystrophy. Additionally, the research team works closely with scientists in the CMC Neuromuscular/ALS laboratories to conduct translational research. Due to advancements in drug therapy development from clinical research trials, there are currently more than 10 disease-modifying therapies approved by the FDA for multiple sclerosis (MS) and the Department of Neurology's research team contributed to several of those studies. These treatments have significantly slowed disease progression and improved the quality of life for patients with relapsing-remitting MS. During 2013, the Neurology Research Team also initiated several clinical trials designed for patients with progressive types of MS. The Department of Neurology is involved in several collaborative research projects. In addition to the collaboration with the Behavioral Health Center detailed in the next section, the department collaborates with Carolinas Neurosurgery and Spine Associates (CNSA) and Johns Hopkins University Research Highlights 2013 | 7 to study patients admitted to the hospital with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). This clinical research trial is funded by National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. The Department of Neurology is expected to be one of the top enrolling sites based on the high volume of patients admitted to CMC for ICH. The department is also collaborating with CMC's Department of Orthopaedics on the Geriatric Falls Prevention Research Project. The goal of the project is to develop an inexpensive technology for use in preventing falls in the elderly. Parkinson's disease patients are especially prone to falls, and patients from the Department of Neurology are being recruited for this study; Danielle Englert, MD, is one of the study investigators. RENEW (Research and Education in Neuro-Wellness) is a joint effort by the Department of Neurology, the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation and the YMCA of Greater Charlotte to promote exercise and an active lifestyle for Parkinson's Disease patients. The FiTS study is conducted jointly by the Department of Neurology (Bruce Mayes, MD, and EEG team) and the Department of Emergency Medicine to develop a standardized approach to patients presenting to the Emergency Department with seizures. In addition to new collaborations in 2013, the research team of the Department of Neurology has broadened the scope of diseases in which it conducts clinical trials. While the majority of research trials had been focused on MS and ALS, during 2013, the department began clinical trials in epilepsy and stroke. Another indicator of success is that our site is increasingly approached for participation in trials for these diseases. Over the past five summers, the Department of Neurology has hosted several students from the Carolinas HealthCare System's Summer Research Scholar program. During the summer program, Scholars had the opportunity to assist with developing protocols for investigator-initiated trials, which were submitted to the IRB and then conducted by the students within the clinic. In 2013, one of the department's research scholars (Ashley Simpson) was awarded second place for \"best poster presentation\" for her research study which she helped develop and coordinate. Michael Kaufman, MD, retired at the end of 2013. Dr. Kaufman was the director of the Multiple Sclerosis Center at CMC from 1993 to 2012. He is a past-president of the Consortium of MS Centers (2010 to 2012), and was actively involved with this organization in promoting research in MS. Additionally, Dr. Kaufman also served as a research committee member for the US Department of Defense. Dr. Kaufman was an investigator on over 90 clinical trials, and has numerous publications and presentations. In honor of Dr. Kaufman, the Carolinas HealthCare Foundation established the Michael Kaufman Fund for Advancing MS Care. The Fund is dedicated to supporting advancements in patient care, education and research. Benjamin Brooks, MD, Director of both the Carolinas Neuromuscular/MDA-ALS Center and the Neuromuscular/ALS Research Laboratory received the prestigious Forbes Norris Award from the International Alliance of ALS/Motor Neuron Disease Associations. The award recognizes and encourages the clinical management of, and research on the topic, of ALS/MND and was presented to Dr. Brooks to honor his contributions to the field over a career that spans more than 40 years. 8 | Carolinas HealthCare SystemBehavioral Health and Neurosciences The Department of Neurology and the Behavioral Health Center began collaborating in 2013 on a multidisciplinary initiative on mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). This was the first collaboration of its kind for the Department of Neurology at CMC, as it recognizes that the aging of the baby boomer generation increases the need for research on Alzheimer's disease. They are delighted to offer a research study as a treatment option for patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. This initiative provides patients from all facilities within Carolinas HealthCare System access to novel and innovative care, while reducing the need for patients to travel to distant specialized centers. As the multidisciplinary team develops, ongoing studies including psychiatrists, neurologists, radiologists and primary care physicians will provide opportunities for further collaboration. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive decline in both cognitive function and ability to perform activities of daily living. Today, AD affects 44 million people worldwide and is projected to reach 135 million by 2050. More than five million individuals in the US have AD, and every minute another patient is diagnosed. With more than 100 attempts and failures to develop a treatment for AD since 1998, there is ever-growing pressure to fully understand the neurobiology and pathophysiology and to develop effective therapies. Physicians at Carolinas HealthCare System are engaged in cutting-edge AD research focused on the amyloid-\u00df (A\u00df) hypothesis, which brings renewed light to potential causes of AD. The hypothesis posits that production and deposition of A\u00df is an early and necessary event in the pathogenesis of AD, suggesting that treatments that slow the synthesis, slow the deposition or increase the clearance of A\u00df and may alter progression of AD. Research Highlights 2013 | 9 The multidisciplinary initiative is dedicated to improving treatment for AD and was developed and led by both Oleg Tcheremissine, MD, from Behavioral Health Center - CMC-Randolph and Sanjay Iyer, MD, from Carolinas Medical Center - Department of Neurology. They launched a clinical trial focused on passive immunization therapy for AD. The basis for the clinical trial utilizes the pathological hallmark of AD, specifically the presence of neuritic amyloid-\u00df plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and neuronal loss in specific brain regions, such as the hippocampus and temporal cortex. Solanezumab (LY2062430), a drug recently developed, is likely to modify the progression of AD. It works through increased clearance of A\u00df plaques from the brain via formation of high-affinity antibody-A\u00df peptide complexes in plasma, binding of antibody in the brain to A\u00df species, and binding to insoluble A\u00df deposits in plaque, therefore triggering Fc-dependent microglial-mediated phagocytosis and digestion. The primary objective of the trial is to test the hypothesis that Solanezumab (LY2062430), when administered as an intravenous infusion every four weeks for 76 weeks, will slow the cognitive decline in patients with mild AD. The protocol is designed to collect data on the long-term safety and efficacy of Solanezumab, including cognitive outcomes, functional outcomes, quality of life, resource utilization and biomarker measures. Also of significant value, Robert Mitchell, MD, of Carolinas Medical Center-NorthEast, initiated an Alzheimer's disease prevention trial called the TOMORROW Study. CMC-NorthEast is one of approximately 50 sites worldwide enrolling more than 5,000 subjects in the study, which utilizes the drug Pioglitazone for treatment of AD. The goals of this five-year, industry-sponsored study are to identify a genomic biomarker to predict the risk of developing AD and test Pioglitazone in AD prevention. The biomarker in development combines subject age, TOMM40 allele and APOE allele for determination of AD development. Subjects will be stratified into a high-risk and low-risk biomarker algorithm, with the high-risk group receiving either low-dose Pioglitazone or placebo, and then assessed for disease development. McColl-Lockwood Laboratory for Muscular Dystrophy Muscular dystrophy is a group of inherited disorders that involve muscle weakness and loss of muscle tissue, progressively worsening over time, for which there is no cure. Scientists in the McColl- Lockwood Laboratory for Muscular Dystrophy Research have one goal: to develop novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of muscular dystrophy. In pursuit of this goal, Qi-Long Lu, MD, PhD, Research Group Director, and his team celebrate substantial achievements in 2013. Achievements include completing initial drug screenings to identify drugs that enhance glycosylation of alpha- dystroglycan as a treatment for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2I (LGMD2I). The dense glycan coat that surrounds every cell is essential for cellular development and physiological function, but does not function normally in LGMD2I. It is becoming apparent through a growing number of studies that the composition of this glycan coat is highly dynamic in skeletal muscle function. In 2013, testing of steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammation drugs for LGMD2I was conducted and aimed at slowing progression of the disease. The Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy effort resulted in two new classes of polymers being developed in the laboratory and they have been shown to effectively enhance oligonucleotide and non-viral gene delivery in both cell culture and in vivo. One research emphasis of this laboratory group is to study adeno-associated virus serotype 9 vector (AAV9)-mediated gene therapy. The team has reported evidence in favor of the utility of AAV- mediated gene replacement therapy for FKRP-related muscular dystrophies. An ongoing collaborative 10 | Carolinas HealthCare System study evaluates the use of this method to deliver mini-agrin as a therapeutic for the treatment of FKRP deficient dystroglycanopathies to restore the disrupted basement membrane. Another study, conducted by the McColl-Lockwood Laboratory and published in Molecular Therapy , shows that AAV9-mediated gene therapy in the FKRP mutant mouse model with a proline to leucine missense mutation (P448L) resulted in systemic FKRP expression in all striated muscles examined, with the highest levels seen in cardiac muscle. These results prompt and support further development of the therapy to prepare for clinical trials. In April, The McColl-Lockwood Laboratory for Muscular Dystrophy Research hosted its third International Workshop for Glycosylation Defects in Muscular Dystrophy in Charlotte, NC. Fifty internationally renowned scientists and clinicians from around the world with expertise in the field of muscular dystrophy were invited to participate in this unique opportunity to present their research findings and future directions. The workshop is designed to encourage the exchange of ideas and ultimately reveal the pathways responsible for the functional glycosylation of alpha dystroglycan, the defect of the protein underlying dystroglycanopathies and the development of novel therapies to treat this devastating disease. The workshop is sponsored by the \"Jeans, Genes and Geniuses\" fundraiser which is hosted by the McColl and Lockwood families. Financial support for laboratory activities were primarily provided by the Carolinas HealthCare Foundation and the Muscular Dystrophy Association, USA, as well as generous support from the McColl and Lockwood families. The Laboratory was also awarded four grants from the National Institutes of Health and one from the LGMD2I Fund. Research Highlights 2013 | 11 PHYSICAL MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION Janet Niemeier, PhD, ABPP (RP), senior director of Research and professor in the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R), is conducting the final phases of her NIH-funded R01 study at Carolinas Rehabilitation's Brain Injury Program. The study is entitled \"An Acute Neurobehavioral and Cognitive Intervention Following Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).\" Her co-principal investigator is Michael Dulin, MD, PhD, from the Department of Family Medicine. Dr. Niemeier has been testing the effectiveness of a brief, 10-session, manualized intervention for improving functional status and injury-related knowledge of moderately and severely injured patients during their inpatient recovery. Her two pilot studies indicated that neurobehavioral symptoms were significantly reduced in severity for patients in the treatment group. The intervention also resulted in lasting recall of important injury-related, compensatory and coping information. Findings from the pilot studies and her current randomized controlled trial have been presented in six papers, 12 invited presentations and three symposia. Vishwa S. Raj, MD, is vice chair of Clinical Operations at Carolinas Rehabilitation, associate medical director of Carolinas Rehabilitation, and director of cancer rehabilitation. Dr. Raj has been studying spinal tumors and has published two papers on the topic. Charles Rhoads, MD, a fourth-year resident in the PM&R Resident Program, has been studying use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) by persons with neurological conditions. His review of the literature in this area found that according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nearly 40 percent of the US population utilizes CAM interventions, accounting for $33.9 billion out-of-pocket expenditures per year. This accounts for 10 percent of total out-of-pocket healthcare expenditures. Adults with neurological conditions are more likely (compared to those without) to 12 | Carolinas HealthCare Systemself-report even higher CAM use than the general population. Dr. Rhoads and his colleagues found that there is very little literature on clinical outcomes or methodological quality of biologically-based/ mind-body CAM interventions in TBI. Until methodological quality of CAM studies improves, CAM interventions should be applied with caution in TBI. More research on the effect of CAM intervention in TBI is warranted. Dr. Rhoads presented a poster of his findings and work at the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine (ACRM) in Orlando, Florida on November 16, 2013. ORTHOPAEDICS Carolinas Trauma Network Research Center of Excellence The Carolinas Trauma Network (CTN) Research Center of Excellence (COE) was funded through an internal competitive grant opportunity to unify Carolinas HealthCare System's trauma research efforts under one umbrella and establish a robust clinical platform that will attract external funding. Carolinas HealthCare System is uniquely poised to leverage the System's organization, the large population served and the trauma-related programs into a model trauma service delivery research platform. The Departments of Orthopaedic Surgery, Emergency Medicine, General Surgery-Trauma, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Dickson Advanced Analytics group, interested investigators from around the System, and members of Research Administration populate the COE Steering Committee. The COE's research efforts focus on mild to moderate TBI, geriatric trauma, patient safety and cost effectiveness, poisoning, and pediatric trauma. As we begin year three, 14 studies are IRB-approved and active. In support of the COE's mission to produce multidisciplinary research and foster development of junior investigators, each of the studies includes investigators from at least two academic departments within Carolinas HealthCare System, with seven of the studies led by junior faculty principal investigators. To date, six peer-reviewed abstracts have been presented at national conferences (an additional eight are currently under review), six grants have been submitted for external funding and several manuscripts have been submitted for publication. The CTN COE looks forward to a productive year three, focused on partnership with the Carolinas Trauma Network to evaluate the implementation of guidelines and programs. Its goal is to develop and conduct research projects, within the defined topic areas, using System-wide data to address critical issues in clinical care. Department of Orthopaedic Surgery The Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Carolinas Medical Center (CMC) is a founding member of the Major Extremity Trauma Research Consortium (METRC, www.metrc.org ), funded by the US Department of Defense (DOD). The Consortium was established to address some of the immediate research needs of the military in the acute management and long-term outcomes of severe limb injuries. Michael Bosse, MD, director of the Orthopaedic Trauma Service and the Orthopaedic Clinical Research program at CMC, is the METRC co-PI and clinical chair. CMC is currently enrolling patients in all eight active studies - focusing on infection prevention and treatment, bone defect reconstruction and recovery following major limb trauma. Dr. Bosse is the principal investigator on three of these studies. Research Highlights 2013 | 13 One of the current studies is testing the effectiveness and implementation of the Trauma Survivors' Network (TraumaSurvivorsNetwork.org ), a collaborative care, multi-modal intervention designed to improve acute and post-acute care following major orthopaedic trauma. This study builds on evidence that outcomes in complex medical conditions improve when \"informed, activated\" patients interact with \"prepared, proactive practice teams.\" CMC serves as an intervention site in the effort to examine the impact of this innovative psychosocial intervention. The overall goal of METRC is to produce the evidence needed to establish treatment guidelines for the optimal care of the wounded warrior and, ultimately, improve the clinical, functional and quality of life outcomes of both service members and civilians who sustain high energy trauma to the extremities. The Consortium consists of a network of clinical centers from across the US, with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health serving as the coordinating center. CMC is one of 22 core civilian trauma centers in addition to four military treatment centers and 30 associate Level I trauma centers that comprise the research group. To date, METRC has enrolled more than 1,000 patients in the prospective studies. CMC is the lead enrolling site. Dr. Bosse emphasized that \"the opportunity to work with the top trauma centers in the nation and to be associated with the lead military treatment facilities in a project of this magnitude really highlights the capacity and capabilities of CMC. The project is currently funded with more than $80 million from DOD and National Institutes of Health grants. The Consortium is of historic proportion in Orthopaedic Surgery in that this amount of funding has never before been allocated to one group in support of critical clinical research.\" 14 | Carolinas HealthCare SystemOrthopaedic Engineering Research Laboratory In 2013, the primary research and development focus of the Orthopaedic Engineering Research Laboratory (OERL) centered on patient activity monitoring and motion analysis efforts for the Carolinas Trauma Network Research Center of Excellence (CTN COE) Falls Prevention Technology Development Project. Along with Nigel Zheng, PhD, from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC), the project team from CMC includes Richard Peindl, PhD; James Kellam, MD; Rachel Seymour, PhD, and Mark Hirsch, PhD. Primary efforts have involved performing motion analysis studies on more than 140 individuals at UNCC, CMC and in the community under two IRB-approved protocols. More than 90 subjects were successfully tested at this year's Centralina Area Agency on Aging annual conference, with the help of staffs from OERL, Orthopaedic Clinical Research and students from UNCC. The state-of-the-art motion tracking technology and analysis software utilized in all tests was jointly developed by CMC and UNCC researchers. These development efforts have been disclosed as potential intellectual property and are being prepared to submit as a patent application. Under the supervision of Carolinas HealthCare System Information Services, a national software development company has been engaged to develop a cloud-based database and data analysis software platform for the project. This software application went live in early 2014, and is the first cloud-computing application developed for Carolinas Healthcare System. Orthopaedic Research Biology Laboratory and Osteoarthritis Orthopaedic Research Biology is part of the nationally and internationally recognized Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at CMC, a program of excellence in clinical care, resident education and translational research. The Orthopaedic Research Biology Laboratory is committed to uncovering the causes of diseases of joints and bones, and devising effective strategies for their treatment. Major research efforts in 2013 addressed intervertebral disc degeneration and low back pain, (directed by Helen Gruber, PhD, and Edward Hanley, MD, and carried out by research staff Jane Ingram, Gretchen Hoelscher, Synthia Bethea, Evan Menscher and Michael Cox, with the help of staff assistant Susan Forgrave) and osteoarthritis (directed by Yubo Sun, PhD, and David Mauerhan, MD; Edward Hanley, MD, and postdoctoral fellow Andrea Roberts, PhD). The lifetime prevalence of disc degeneration and its associated low back pain is approximately 80 percent with estimated healthcare costs exceeding $100 to 200 billion per year. Chronic low back pain takes a high socio-economic toll in terms of lost wages and reduced productivity. Chronic, long-term low back pain also takes a high personal toll, potentially leading to disability and job loss. Recently published findings from the disc research laboratory included: discoveries showing altered mitochondrial bioenergetics and morphology in the degenerating human disc; increased IL-17 expression in more degenerated human discs; and disc cells in vitro exposed to proinflammatory cytokines, regulation of PAPP-A and IGFBP-4 expression and insulin-like growth factor bioavailability in human annulus cells exposed to proinflammatory cytokines. Osteoarthritis, which is characterized by cartilage breakdown in joints of hands, feet, spine, hips and knees, is a common condition affecting more than 25 million people in the US. Current osteoarthritis research in this laboratory focuses on collagen and proteoglycan changes in the meniscus and the biological effects of phosphate on cells in the synovial fluid. Publications this year included findings on Research Highlights 2013 | 15 phosphocitrate, showing that this agent is a potential protective agent for the meniscus in the knee, and also a potential disease-modifying drug for non-crystal associated osteoarthritis. Other 2013 research publications described studies showing: how arthritis augments breast cancer metastasis (collaborative work of Helen Gruber, PhD, with L. Das Roy, PhD, from UNCC); molecular and biologic characterization of biomembrane formation adjacent to a methacrylate spacer in the rat femoral segmental defect Keith Gettys, MD; Montijo, MD; James Starman, MD Specialty Center); Kenneth Nelson, MD; Warren Ramp, MD; Michael Bosse, MD, and James Kellam, MD); and studies on how cell-based tissue engineering augments tendon-to-bone healing in a rat supraspinatus model (Bryan Loeffler, MD, and Patrick Connor, MD, from OrthoCarolina; with Brian Scannell; MD, Richard Peindl, PhD; H. James Norton, PhD; Edward Hanley, MD, and Helen Gruber, PhD, of Carolinas HealthCare System).16 | Carolinas HealthCare SystemEMERGENCY MEDICINE The research interests and activities within the Department of Emergency Medicine are as diverse as the patients we serve. Michael Runyon, MD, FAAEM, leads studies following sepsis patients in intensive care units and measures biomarkers of disease progression. One study specifically involves IV infusion of the nutrient L-carnitine, which is important for metabolism, but is depleted in sepsis. Stacy Reynolds, MD, leads the research focus on appropriate use of imaging in trauma. Eliminating unnecessary testing can lower cost and reduce radiation exposure. Dr. Reynolds is investigating the necessity of pelvic imaging in blunt abdominal trauma while Chad Scarboro, MD, is studying the adherence to clinical decision rules for head Computed Tomography (CT) in pediatric trauma. David Pearson, MD, MS, through collaborations with critical care and pre-hospital medicine, is standardizing the treatment for post-cardiac arrest resuscitation and optimizing therapeutic hypothermia throughout Carolinas HealthCare System. Michael Gibbs, MD, with grant support from the Carolinas Trauma Network Research Group, partnered with the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation to build a comprehensive registry for concussion that involves bedside evaluations, long-term follow- up and biobanking to better understand what can be done in the immediate post-injury period to optimize recovery. The patient samples are processed in the Emergency Medicine Research Laboratory in the James G. Cannon Research Center. Andrew Asimos, MD, FACEP , launched a multiphase research initiative in collaboration with the Department of Neurology and the Carolinas Epilepsy Network. The ultimate goal of the project is to transform the standard of care and decrease overall cost of the evaluation of First-Time Seizure (FiTS) patients in a way that is beneficial to both the System and patients. The Department of Emergency Medicine investigators hypothesize that electroencephalogram (EEG) studies performed in the Emergency Department (ED) on FiTS patients will identify a substantial number of patients who should have antiepileptic medication initiated prior to ED discharge. Based on promising results in the first 25 patients, the project will be expanding enrollment to CMC-Mercy, CMC-Pineville, CMC-University and CMC-Northeast in 2014. Research Highlights 2013 | 17 In 2014, the next project phase will begin in collaboration with an expert in health communication and focus group research methods from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte to identify important patient-centered outcomes related to first-time seizures and their evaluation. Finally, in partnership with industry, the team will evaluate the feasibility of utilizing EEG caps for FiTS patients presenting throughout Carolinas HealthCare System Carolinas Epilepsy Network EDs. FAMILY MEDICINE Conditions that put athletes at risk for sudden cardiac death are often silent, giving no warning signs or symptoms to the athletes themselves or to the physicians who are screening athletes to prevent such devastating events. Luke (not his real name), a 15-year-old local high school athlete, had been playing football for many years. He occasionally felt his heart racing, but didn't think anything of it. Fortunately for Luke, he attended Heart of a Champion Day, a collaborative program sponsored by Carolinas HealthCare System that provides free, comprehensive sports physicals to high school athletes. At Heart of a Champion Day, Luke had a screening electrocardiogram (ECG) performed and, subsequently, was diagnosed with a potentially life-threatening heart arrhythmia called Wolff- Parkinson-White. After having an ablation procedure performed at Sanger Heart & Vascular Institute, Luke is now safely back on the playing field. Despite stories like Luke's, ECGs are currently not part of routine sports physicals, partially due to a lack of evidence proving their value. As part of Heart of a Champion Day, researchers from the Department of Family Medicine Research and Department of Sports Medicine and Special Events conducted a study examining the effectiveness of incorporating ECGs into routine sports physicals. The study results were published in the December issue of Heart Rhythm and will help guide discussions around this important national issue. Carolinas HealthCare System Family Medicine Research focuses on studies that expand access to care, improve patient-oriented outcomes and drive System-wide change. In 2013, the group's research was presented or published in more than 20 local, national and international settings (for more information please visit CarolinasHealthCare.org/Outcomes-Research ). Family Medicine Research continues to be recognized as a national leader in implementation science research, most recently by receiving a more than $2 million grant from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute. The project is led by Hazel Tapp, PhD, and examines best practices for dissemination of complex interventions to clinics across North Carolina. Additionally, our health information technology achievements gained regional recognition with the nomination of our electronic asthma action plan for the Intel North Carolina Healthcare Information and Communications Alliance Award. This asthma action plan generator and our Asthma Shared Decision Making tools have been disseminated statewide and can be found at Asthma.CarolinasHealthCare.org . The Department of Family Medicine continues to actively engage the local Hispanic community through a large National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities-funded study, exploring ways to improve access to care and decrease disparities by understanding the social determinants of health. This year, Carolinas HealthCare System researchers and providers partnered with a community and an elementary school in East Charlotte to pilot the concept of a neighborhood-based, patient- centered medical home care delivery model in the form of community wellness fairs. Finally, our research collaborations have continued to expand with institutions including: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Duke University, East Carolina University, Virginia Commonwealth University, Johns Hopkins University and University of Oxford. 18 | Carolinas HealthCare SystemIn 2014, the group will continue to build on successful work in the areas of asthma care improvement, dissemination research and improving access for the underserved. Additionally, they will expand their research portfolio though pilot projects in the areas of sports medicine, geriatrics, health information technology and population health. CAROLINAS SIMULATION CENTER Simulation is playing an increasingly important role in medical education. The distinguishing characteristic that simulation-based education (SBE) offers compared to traditional teaching methods is that it allows learning by doing. Learning by doing is known to have superior results for skill acquisition and retention compared to learning by reading, listening or observing alone. In addition to training, several of the available simulators offer performance metrics to deliver a more objective assessment of performance. With the advantages of SBE, it is not surprising that Carolinas Simulation Center (CSC) has seen tremendous growth in the number of its learners since opening its doors in 2007. It is the only educational institute in our region to be accredited by both the American College of Surgeons and the Society for Simulation in Healthcare. Like any new field, there are numerous research opportunities. 2013 was a very productive year for research at CSC under the leadership of Dimitrios Stefanidis, MD, PhD, FACS, FASMBS, who serves as the Director of Simulation Research. CSC researchers presented at 13 national and international meetings (including two awards), published in numerous peer-reviewed journals, received prestigious Research Highlights 2013 | 19 grants and awards, and collaborated with investigators of local (UNCC), national (Old Dominion University and others) and international institutions (Imperial College of London, UK). During 2013, a 15-month contract with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for the amount of $4.6 million began, aimed at enhancing and improving patient safety and outcomes. One of five focus areas of the proposal, procedural harm, is led by Dr. Stefanidis in collaboration with Robert V. Higgins, MD, FACOG, FACS, the Carolinas HealthCare System Quality Division and CSC. The project proposes an innovative strategy to detect and remediate skill-based deficiencies among practicing general surgeons and gynecologists by analyzing outcomes of several procedures. Technical and nontechnical surgical performance in the operating room will be video recorded and rated by experts to see how it correlates to patient outcomes. Training is offered to surgeons and impact on patient outcomes is being assessed. Additionally, Dr. Stefanidis was awarded a $785,000 grant from the Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality (AHRQ) to conduct cutting-edge innovative research that includes the development and validation of a novel, self-contained mental skills curriculum that aims to provide surgical trainees with key performance-enhancement and stress-coping strategies needed to enhance surgical performance during challenging situations in the operating room. This team includes: Lisa Howley, PhD, an expert in curriculum development; Charles Brown, PhD, a psychologist with expertise in performance enhancement; Manuel Pimentel, the study coordinator; Cameron Davis, MS, instructional designer; Nicholas Anton, a mental skills trainer; and Nick Sevdalis, PhD, and Sonal Arora, MD, PhD, from the Imperial College of London (UK), experts in performance assessment. The three-year study launched in September 2013 and will document effectiveness of the curriculum by differences in performance between learner groups that receive mental skills training and groups that do not. Performance will be measured by how quickly, accurately and safely they can perform the assigned tasks in the simulation and operating rooms under normal and stressful conditions. Stress levels will be determined by observation of heart rates and a workload assessment questionnaire. The study also aims to examine the impact of this training on patient outcomes. Mark Scerbo, PhD, is a human factors expert from Old Dominion University, collaborating with Dr. Stefanidis on an AHRQ-funded project \"A Secondary Task for Measuring Laparoscopic Skill\" to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of a novel visuo-spatial secondary task in assessing laparoscopic surgery expertise. Several presentations and publications have been generated from this ongoing study. JoAnna Leuck, MD, under the mentorship of Jeffrey Kline, MD, and Dr. Stefanidis, leads the project to assess the impact of fatigue on diagnostic errors of emergency medicine residents after being on call. Dr. Leuck uses simulated scenarios of unstable dysrhythmias to assess resident performance after being on call overnight. The project is funded by a prestigious two-year grant from the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM). Trey Bradley, MD, a fellow in the division of minimally invasive and gastrointestinal surgery of the Department of Surgery, is using the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) model and competitive funds from the Society of Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) to investigate the impact of fatigue on surgical performance. Under the mentorship of Dr. Stefanidis, Dr. 20 | Carolinas HealthCare System Bradley's proposal aims to examine whether resident performance is inferior after a week of night float compared with traditional 24-hour call. Dr. Stefanidis is also collaborating with Jing Xiao, PhD, a computing engineer professor at UNCC on a project that aims to develop a haptic guidance simulator for training. Dr. Xiao leads the National Science Foundation-sponsored Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) in Charlotte. In 2013, researchers of CSC also provided research mentorship to medical students and nurses. Two Carolinas HealthCare System Research summer scholars were supervised by Dr. Stefanidis and Mark Bullard, MD, for 10 weeks. Additionally, Dr. Stefanidis mentored Michele A. Pfaff who is pursuing her doctoral degree in nursing. Pfaff examined the communication skills of nursing students during interprofessional simulations with surgery residents and will be defending her work in Spring 2014. Research Highlights 2013 | 21 GENERAL SURGERY The 2013 research accomplishments in General Surgery were numerous and varied, spanning traditional bench, translational and clinical research. Researchers within General Surgery remain committed to developing independent and clinically-relevant projects. Many physicians and scientists are recognized by both national and international audiences for their expertise. General Surgery is also committed to the education of surgical residents, fellows, undergraduate and graduate students. Gastrointestinal and Minimally Invasive Surgery The Division of Gastrointestinal and Minimally Invasive Surgery research impacts multiple fronts: from mobile technology to investments in green initiatives, from practice-changing medicine to award- winning research, both nationally and globally. In the last year, the department won more than a dozen first-place awards, nationally and internationally, for its research. Expanding on their knowledge of hernia surgery, trauma, pediatric surgery, and resident education and training, the Division demonstrated its impact on both the field of medicine and the greater population, and continues as a leader in medical research and innovation. Leadership was exemplified in 2013 in the 55 presentations by faculty and fellows at national and international conferences. Early in 2013, the Carolinas Equation for Quality of Life (CeQOL) mobile application, previously recognized in The Wall Street Journal, earned distinction as the first alternate winner for Hospital & Health Network (HHN) Most Wired Innovation Award. The CeQOL app continues to provide surgeons and patients in the US and around the world with a powerful educational tool that can predict individualized quality of life outcomes after inguinal hernia surgery and offer patients extensive educational materials concerning hernias and their treatment. Additionally, \"The Green OR: Simple Changes to Reduce Cost and Our Carbon Footprint\" project won first place at the annual Southeastern Surgical Congress Gold Medal Paper Forum, and a bronze Touchstone Award recognized at the Carolinas Healthcare System 2013 Quality & Service Sharing Day. This project highlights the role of a surgeon-led Green Operating Room (OR) Committee to promote simple changes that lead to a sustainable, environmentally-conscious workplace and capture the impressive downstream effect on OR cost reduction. Most recently, our Division's American College of Surgeons Clinical Congress presentation, \"Colon Polyps in Elderly Patients Are More Likely to Develop in Areas Seen Only with Colonoscopy,\" was selected by Bloomberg Businessweek , the Associated Press and Reuters, and subsequently reported by 70 news organizations, highlighting the continued evolution of evidence-based medicine. The study's results support the reassessment of the current standard use of sigmoidoscopy to screen for colon cancer in patients over age 60 and may lead to revisions in national colon cancer screening guidelines. These accomplishments demonstrate past and embody future opportunities to positively impact patient care and global health. While they energize and motivate the researchers within the Division of Gastrointestinal and Minimally Invasive Surgery to continue in healthcare innovation, more importantly they are reminders that work is far from complete. Looking to the future, the team remains dedicated to serving and improving the lives of the patients cared for each day. It is in these investments that we find our greatest rewards. 22 | Carolinas HealthCare SystemIntegrative Medicine At CMC-NorthEast, the Integrative Medicine's research team led by Bridget Bongaard, MD, recently initiated their first investigator-initiated pilot study \"Effects of Abdominal and Foot Massage on Post-Operative Ileus and Pain after abdominal Surgery.\" The study goal is to evaluate the efficacy of abdominal and foot massage on post-operative ileus and pain in patients after abdominal surgery. This study combines Western medicine and integrative therapies to relieve pain and prevent or resolve post-operative ileus. The nurse offers her hands as an instrument of healing and creates a special moment in care between nurse and patient. This study is funded by a William T. Morris Grant award. Trauma Research The faculty at the F.H. \"Sammy\" Ross Jr. Trauma Center has been active in both clinical and translational research during 2013. After joining the Trauma Center, Peter Fischer, MD, MS, NREMT-P , began his collaborative research career with colleagues, including faculty from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC). His interests include pre-hospital care, regional trauma system and care of geriatric trauma patients. His effort has resulted in several publications and presentations at regional and national meetings. A. Britton Christmas, MD, FACS, continues his research focus in trauma care related outcomes, from triage and transfer criteria to factors contributing to length of hospital stay after injuries. Dr. Christmas presented his research at national scientific meetings and also serves as chairman of the Injury Prevention Committee for the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma. Susan Evans, MD, FACS, focuses her research on examining post-traumatic stress disorders. She is currently conducting a prospective trial with colleagues from UNCC to gain insights into the psychological impact after trauma. Under the direction of Toan Huynh, MD, FACS, FCCM, the Trauma Center participated in several clinical trials in 2013, one of which being the largest multi-national study examining the efficacy of progesterone in the management of severe traumatic brain injury. Results from this study are currently under analysis. Dr. Huynh also participated in a multi-center trial with Canadian critical care physicians to assess the effectiveness of an intensive care delirium screening tool for critically ill patients. Another interest of Trauma Research is led by John Green, MD, FACS, who serves as site principal investigator for a study aimed at reducing adhesions after laparotomy. Ron Sing, DO, FACS, FCCM, completed his role as site principal investigator for a new retrievable inferior vena caval filter trial, where the Trauma Center recruited the largest volume of patients. In collaboration with researchers from the Department of Computer Science and Informatics at UNCC led by Richard Souvenir, ScD, Dr. Huynh and his colleagues investigate computerized algorithms to automate the real-time interpretation of echocardiography in critically ill patients. In collaboration with the General Surgery Research Laboratory within the James G. Cannon Research Center, the Trauma Center faculty also conducted translational research examining the metabolic responses to hemorrhagic shock. Drs. Evans and Huynh (physician scientists at the F.H. \"Sammy\" Ross Jr. Trauma Center), have combined efforts with Iain McKillop, PhD, and Rebecca Powell, PhD (from the General Surgery Research Laboratory), to study the impact of mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants on the systemic inflammatory response (SIR) after hemorrhagic shock. Their project, entitled \"Mitochondrial-Targeted Antioxidants Prevent Cell Death and Organ Dysfunction and Improve Survival Following Severe Hemorrhage,\" has earned funding this year from the Carolinas Healthcare Foundation and the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST). This translational work examines the mechanisms of hypoxia and oxidative stress following ischemia-reperfusion injury Research Highlights 2013 | 23 (hemorrhage), which leads to cellular damage and multiple organ dysfunction, a common problem in severely injured trauma patients. This research has been presented on the podium at the Shock Society and American Association for the Surgery of Trauma scientific meetings. Other research projects, which have received financial support from the Carolinas Healthcare Foundation, aim to determine neutrophil activity and survival in patients who develop renal failure after thoraco- abdominal operations. These collaborative research efforts have provided further insights as to how cellular stress and changes in the immune system after trauma combine to initiate a \"protective response;\" which, when exaggerated, can paradoxically lead to systemic inflammation and results in multiple organ failure and death. The long-term aim of understanding these pathways at the cellular and molecular level is to target and develop novel therapeutic interventions. Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Surgery The Hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) Surgery division, under the direction of David A. Iannitti, MD, continued research through 2013 on the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the liver, pancreas and biliary tract. The team is actively involved in clinical, translational and bench science research and in addition to Dr. Iannitti is comprised of HPB Surgeons, John Martinie, MD, and Ryan Swan, MD, as well as HPB Fellows, Kerri Simo, MD, David Niemeyer, MD, MD. Through industry-sponsored and investigator-initiated projects, HPB Surgery Research focuses on clinical outcomes research and cutting-edge technological advancements in surgical devices with aims to continuously improve patient care and define Carolinas HealthCare System as a world leader in new 24 | Carolinas HealthCare Systemand innovative treatment. Clinical outcomes research is at the forefront of HPB Surgery Research with the goal of immediately improving patient care. The HPB Surgery group at Carolinas HealthCare System treats a large number of patients and leverages clinical data to improve outcomes. Conference presentations and journal publications on necrotizing pancreatitis and long-term outcomes for hepatocellular carcinoma patients are a few examples of accomplishments during 2013. Additionally, HPB Surgery Research applied for and was granted access to data from the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) administered jointly by the American College of Surgeons and the American Cancer Society. The data set contains more than 300,000 patient records and forms the basis of numerous abstracts accepted at national and international research meetings. In addition, HPB Surgery Research was involved in several multi-site clinical trials and registries. In collaboration with industry partners, these projects will advance diagnostic tools and treatments for patients. Of particular interest, is a registry with Caris Life Sciences intended to help develop personalized treatment plans for cancer patients based on the molecular characteristics of tumors. Another ongoing project is an outcomes registry of patients receiving Sir-Spheres microspheres. These particles are impregnated with a radiation emitting isotope that can provide targeted treatment for patients with otherwise difficult to treat cancers. In 2013, HPB Surgery conducted numerous research studies on new to market and next generation surgical devices and tools in both clinical and laboratory settings. Throughout the year, HPB Surgery collaborated with InnerOptic Technology, Medtronic, Davol/Bard, Angiodynamics and Edwards Lifesciences among others to advance surgical technology and contribute to the literature supporting new treatments. Research Highlights 2013 | 25 A primary area of focus is the development and improvement of microwave ablation (MWA) technology. MWA technology uses focused energy to destroy cancer cells and locally treat liver and soft tissue cancers. The HPB Surgery team at Carolinas HealthCare System is recognized as a global leader in MWA surgery, and treatments and techniques developed and tested at Carolinas HealthCare System will impact surgical methods worldwide. Also of note is collaboration with InnerOptic Technology on an NIH-funded grant that aims to fuse real time intraoperative ultrasound with a patient's preoperative CT scans. Advancement in this area will enable surgeons to more accurately place ablation antennae in liver surgeries and better target tumors while avoiding damage to surrounding tissues. A third research focus in 2013 was the investigation of irreversible electroporation (IRE) for the treatment of locally advanced pancreas cancer. IRE uses microsecond electrical pulses to open cell membranes in tumors, which kills the cancer cells while minimizing damage to surrounding anatomy. This new technology provides an additional treatment option for patients with difficult to treat cancers. These treatments, among others, represent the cutting-edge technology available to HPB Surgery patients at Carolinas HealthCare System and the research underway to further advance novel treatment of diseases of the liver and pancreas. General Surgery Research Laboratory In 2013, under the direction of Iain McKillop, PhD, the researchers from General Surgery continued their collaboration with the hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) surgery group to better understand hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Studies are aimed not only at understanding how normal hepatocytes undergo transformation to a cancerous state, but particularly in understanding how (and why) HCC progresses at different rates within different underlying conditions. These studies are specifically focused on the role of chronic excessive alcohol consumption and/or obesity as both causative factors during initial development and promotors during tumor progression. To achieve these goals, laboratory faculty and staff focus their efforts on two specific areas of interest: lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signaling pathways and the impact of obesity on liver disease and HCC development-progression. LPAs are common fatty acids derived from the membranes of cells that can regulate a wide range of functions, depending on the specific LPA receptor (LPAR) that is activated. Studying the role of LPA-signaling has proven difficult in the liver because it expresses LPARs weakly, if at all. The group was the first to report the expression of a newly identified LPAR in the liver; LPAR-6, and current studies are underway to determine the role of this receptor during normal liver growth and development, as well as changes in expression and function during the progression of liver diseases toward hepatic cirrhosis and tumor development. These studies are led by Eugene Sokolov, PhD, and Valentina Zuckerman, PhD, who work in close collaboration with David Iannitti, MD, and the HPB- Surgery team. Obesity has recently been identified as an independent risk factor for developing HCC, particularly in men. Few studies have addressed the effect of obesity and alcohol intake as comorbid risk factors in liver disease and HCC risk. This is particularly concerning given that more than 160 million Americans consume alcohol and more than a third of the US population is obese. These studies, led by Kyle 26 | Carolinas HealthCare SystemThompson, PhD, and David Sindram, MD, PhD, along with Shayan Nazari (a graduate student from UNCC), focus on potential mechanisms by which alcohol and obesity may act to amplify the rate of progression of HCC. In addition to seeking better understanding of the mechanisms that drive HCC development and progression, faculty and staff under the direction of Dr. McKillop have also engaged in studies to develop localized drug delivery systems to treat HCC. Unlike many other cancers, no effective new drugs have been developed to treat HCC. An important reason for this is the role of the liver in metabolizing drugs, such that achieving sufficient drug levels in the tumor is commonly associated with severe local and systemic toxicity. To overcome this, Dr. McKillop and colleagues at UNCC (led by Ahmed El-Ghannam, PhD) are exploring the potential of bioceramic nanoscaffolds as drug delivery systems. This work, sponsored by the North Carolina Biotechnology Center, yielded promising results suggesting bioceramics may be developed as \"drug depots\" where high tumoral drug doses are achieved without local or systemic toxicity. In addition to peer-reviewed publications, members of the research team made several presentations at national and international meetings including the Americas Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association (Miami, FL), The Research Society on Alcoholism (RSoA; Orlando, FL) and the European Society for the Biochemical Research on Alcoholism (Warsaw, Poland). These meetings provided the opportunity to present several oral and oral-posters, posters, and an invitation to present in the Charles Lieber Memorial Lecture Series at the RSoA meeting. In addition, Dr. McKillop was a co-mentor for two PhD doctoral candidates who successfully defended their dissertations in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at UNCC in 2013. Surgical Oncology David Foureau, PhD, and Kendall Carpenter, CCRP , as part of the General Surgery Research Laboratory, work with Richard White, Jr., MD, FACS; Asim Amin, MD, PhD, and Jonathan Salo, MD, FACS, from the Levine Cancer Institute. In 2013, they continued their work studying immunotherapy for melanoma. Immunotherapeutic protocols such as cytokine therapy or immune checkpoint blockade represent the most effective therapeutic approach currently available to treat late stage melanoma. Previous work from this group combined basic and translational research approaches to uncover novel cellular and molecular immune imbalance mechanisms associated with differential responses to immunotherapy. This work aims to identify early biomarkers that can predict patient responsiveness to immunotherapy, as well as develop new immunotherapeutic strategies that will restore immune potency against the cancer cells. These studies are sponsored in part by the Purple Promise Foundation to End Melanoma and were presented at 66th Annual Cancer Symposium of the Society of Surgical Oncology. In addition, this group collaborates with Gloria Elliott, PhD, from UNCC to develop a targeted drug delivery system (nanoparticles) that can directly deliver immunotherapeutic drugs to immune effector cells to improve treatment efficiency and reduce side effects. This work is funded in part by UNCC's Center for Biomedical Engineering and Sciences and was presented at the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.Research Highlights 2013 | 27 INTERNAL MEDICINE Rheumatology A new clinical research study was initiated in 2013 at CMC-NorthEast Rheumatology. The primary aims of clinical research at NorthEast Rheumatology are to advance knowledge in specific diagnostic and therapeutic areas of clinical science. Through basic and clinical research insights, NorthEast Rheumatology, led by Gordon Lam, MD, frequently offers its patients early access to novel diagnostic and therapeutic advances in important areas of contemporary rheumatologic science. In addition, they have actively pursued studies of promising diagnostic modalities and of new pharmaceutical and biological agents in the treatment of major arthritic and immunologic diseases. Liver Pathobiology Laboratory The Liver Pathobiology Laboratory, directed by Laura Schrum, PhD, is dedicated to investigating the intricate cellular and molecular mechanisms of hepatic fibrosis. The laboratory team includes Ting Li, PhD; Cathy Elizabeth is an exacerbation of the generic wound-healing response resulting in excess deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins by activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis is the 12th leading cause of death in the US, and total costs in the US have been estimated at $10 billion per year (direct and indirect costs). Fibrosis/ 28 | Carolinas HealthCare Systemcirrhosis can arise from many factors including chronic alcoholism and exposure to Hepatitis B and C viruses. Furthermore, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a consequence of obesity, is currently the leading cause of chronic liver disease affecting approximately 30 percent of the US population. NAFLD can progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis with further advancement to fibrosis, cirrhosis and ultimately, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. As HSC activation is a pivotal event in initiation and progression of fibrosis/cirrhosis, the Liver Pathobiology laboratory is focused on identifying ways to interfere with HSC activation as a therapeutic target to impede liver disease advancement, as no established US Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for fibrosis/cirrhosis exists. In 2013, the research group identified specific microRNAs (miRs), small non-coding RNAs, as important mediators for hepatic fibrosis development that may also serve as non-invasive biomarkers for liver disease. Studies are currently in progress to test miR19b as a therapy for fibrosis in animal models. The research group is targeting miR19b overexpression to activated HSCs using an adeno-associated virus construct. Overall, these studies propose that miR19b may serve as both a therapy and non-invasive diagnostic biomarker for liver fibrosis. For fibrosis to initiate, HSCs undergo an activation/transdifferentiation process, and the laboratory identified a nuclear receptor, Rev-erb, as a key regulator in this process. Recently, they tested a Rev- erb ligand in a fibrotic animal model, and studies showed diminished fibrosis and liver injury. This suggests that this Rev-erb ligand can serve as a treatment or inhibitor for hepatic fibrosis and related pathologies. Although cirrhosis is currently the greatest risk factor in the development of HCC, obesity is also an independent risk factor. As stated previously, modulation of HSC activation is an attractive therapeutic target to prevent liver disease advancement to HCC. The use of a Rev-erb ligand decreased fibrosis as shown by a reduction in expression of ECM proteins in activated HSCs (i.e. tenascin-C, TnC), while endogenous activator of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling which promotes transformation of normal liver cells (hepatocytes) to cancer cells and the development of HCC. In liver injury, activated HSCs are the primary cellular source of TnC which can be blocked by Rev-erb agonists. Therefore, we are testing that upon liver injury activated HSCs increase secretion of TnC, an event regulated by Rev-erb, which signals through TLR4, promoting hepatocyte transformation and development of obesity-induced HCC (Figure 1). Overall, the Liver Pathobiology Laboratory will continue their efforts to bring bench research to the bedside and unfold cellular and molecular mechanisms of several liver diseases with the expectation of identifying biomarkers and developing novel therapeutic strategies. These research endeavors are aimed at providing improved and high-quality patient care and superior personalized medicine.Liver axis in promoting obesity-induced HCC.Research Highlights 2013 | 29 THE CAROLINAS HEALTHCARE SYSTEM LIVER CENTER/LIVER TRANSPLANTATION The mission of the multidisciplinary Carolinas HealthCare System Liver Center/Transplantation Center is three-fold to optimally evaluate and manage patients with liver and biliary disorders, to train the next generation of clinician-investigators and research scientists, and to carry out cutting-edge innovation and research to develop better treatments and devices that improve health and quality of life for patients. The Center includes physicians, clinical investigators, research scientists, and staffs with a passion for helping patients with liver and biliary tract diseases, including viral hepatitis; chronic liver diseases and their major complications; liver cancer, both primary and metastatic to the liver; drug- induced liver injury; and disorders of intermediary metabolism that are expressed in the liver and that may cause liver disease, such as the porphyrias, hemochromatosis and Wilson disease. They carried out several investigator-initiated clinical studies in 2013. For example, Mark Russo, MD, MPH, is a steering committee member of the ACRIN Trial, a national trial designed to improve MRI evaluation and characterization of liver lesions which may be cancers. Dr. Russo also spearheaded a pilot study, funded by the American College of Gastroenterology, on treatment of chronic hepatitis C with interferon alpha during liver transplantation. This work was presented at a national meeting and published in Digestive Diseases and Sciences. Other studies active and productive in 2013 include two major national clinical studies: the Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI) Network and the Porphyrias Consortium, both funded mainly by the NIH/NIDDK. Many Liver Center faculty are active collaborators in these important studies, for which Herbert Bonkovsky, MD, serves as principal investigator. These continue to improve understanding 30 | Carolinas HealthCare Systemof DILI and the porphyrias, including possible sequelae, long-term outcomes, new approaches to therapy, and new biomarkers that have diagnostic and prognostic importance. The laboratory has been a national leader describing the rising toll that liver injury from herbal remedies and dietary supplements is having in the US and found that the incidence of such injury increased three-fold during the past 10 years. These results were recently featured in a front-page article in the NY Times (Sunday, December 22, 2013), and in the Charlotte Observer . Another study of the DILI Network funded by the NIH/NIDDK, conducted by Drs. Bonkovsky, David Foureau, PhD; H. James Norton, PhD, and Nury Steuerwald, PhD, studied subjects with acute DILI and found that serum levels of cytokines and other immune analytes were often decreased, especially in more severe disease. The group developed an algorithm that, early in the course of disease and with a high degree of accuracy (96 percent), predicts who will recover and who will not (unless they receive life-saving liver transplantation). These findings were presented at a national meeting and have been accepted for publication in a prestigious open-access scientific journal ( PLOS ONE ). Additionally, Drs. Bonkovsky and Foureau have, for the first time, characterized and enumerated leukocytes that infiltrate the liver biopsies of subjects with DILI due to several drugs that cause immuno-allergic or auto-immune type disease. They have identified diagnostically useful differences in the profiles of these leukocytes, which distinguish the features of hepatitis due to DILI from hepatitis of other etiologies. Carolinas HealthCare System is a member of the US Porphyrias Consortium and during 2013, 45 subjects were enrolled into a longitudinal study of these rare diseases. They also performed a pivotal phase III clinical study of afamelanotide (an analogue of melanocyte stimulating hormone) to improve the severe photosensitivity experienced by persons with erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP), who develop intense burning, redness and pain of sun-exposed skin after only a few minutes of exposure. Most subjects who received afamelanotide reported much improved sunlight tolerance and quality of life. They also played an active role in describing the genetic defects in subjects with EPP in the USA, the results of which were presented at international meetings and published in Molecular Medicine . Paul Schmeltzer, MD, is a member of the Porphyria Consortium and was awarded a highly competitive clinical research grant from the American College of Gastroenterology to study iron and hepcidin homeostasis in subjects with EPP . They continued to enroll subjects into the Carolinas HealthCare System Liver-HPB Repository designed to provide a growing body of information and samples for further special research studies. Through December 2013, nearly 1,500 subjects have been enrolled and have provided more than 10,000 biological samples. A total of nine studies already have been approved and performed. The Liver Center/Transplantation Center continues, as well, to be active in conducting phase II-IV industry-sponsored clinical trials. These are focused mainly on new therapies for chronic hepatitis C and complications of chronic liver disease, such as hepato-renal syndrome and hepatic encephalopathy. Dr. Russo and Philippe Zamor, MD, have been especially active in developing and performing these trials. During 2013, we initiated 12 new trials and continued 16 trials of this type. These are managed expertly by our clinical research team, comprised of two certified clinical research coordinators, Gale Groseclose, RN, and Regina McFadden, RN, Balasco, MLT, and Krista Bossi, MS.Research Highlights 2013 | 31 Liver, Digestive and Metabolic Disorders Laboratory The Laboratory for Liver, Digestive and Metabolic Disorders is a group clinician-investigators and research scientists with several areas of expertise and interest. Our principal focus, under the direction of Herbert L. Bonkovsky, MD, is the liver in health and disease, but we also have interests in other digestive and metabolic disorders. In 2013, they have carried out original bench research especially in the areas of disorders of porphyrin, and heme metabolism and viral hepatitis. The porphyrias are a group of eight diseases, mainly inherited, in which there are defects in the normal process of heme synthesis. Dr. Bonkovsky was the first to show that heme is able to down-regulate the overproduction of these potentially toxic intermediates and to ameliorate or prevent all of the symptoms and signs of the porphyrias. In fact, heme was the first \"orphan drug\" to be approved for use by the US Food and Drug Administration, and it has stood the test of time, so that, today, more than 40 years after Dr. Bonkovsky first developed heme as a therapeutic agent, it continues to be a life-saving and life-changing drug for patients with porphyrias. Dr. Bonkovsky led both bench and translational research on the porphyrias and effects of heme on the liver. He is one of the principal investigators of the national Porphyrias Consortium, a research program supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and the Office of Rare Diseases. His original work showed that heme affects the expression of several key genes in hepatocytes and that it increases oxidative stress and calls forth a variety of mechanisms designed to protect cells from stress, including oxidative stress. This work led both to an original paper and served as the basis of a new grant application for investigator-initiated research that has been 32 | Carolinas HealthCare Systemfunded by the NIH-National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI). They also carried out original, investigator-initiated clinical research on circadian rhythms and their abnormalities in subjects with acute intermittent porphyria, the most severe form of acute porphyria (Larion et al. European Journal of Clinical Investigation , 2013; 43:727-39). In their studies on viral hepatitis, they concentrated on the roles of selected non-coding Ribonucleic Acids (RNAs) on the development and progression of hepatitis C infections. Weihong Hou, PhD, established that one particular micro-RNA (miRNA or miR), namely, miR-196 and other non-coding RNAs play roles in the regulation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication and infection in HCV replicon and infectious cell culture systems. These exciting findings suggest that non-coding RNAs may hold promise as a potential novel strategy to ameliorate or prevent hepatitis C infection and HCV-induced other liver diseases. Hossein Sendi, MD, PhD, also worked primarily on the problem of hepatitis C infection. His major PhD dissertation work, which he completed successfully and defended in 2013 (UNCC), was on effects of miRNAs on HCV infection. Dr. Sendi found that interaction of miR-122 with 3'-UTR of the occluding (OCLN) gene mRNA results in a decrease in HCV entry through down- regulation of OCLN; one of the main HCV receptors. His results suggest that miR-122 mimics may be more beneficial than miR-122 inhibitors in the earlier stages of infection. In a recent preliminary study, Dr. Sendi found that levels of miR-29b are associated with response to treatment and stage of fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C. With the addition in 2013 of Guqi Wang, PhD, and Andrew deLemos, MD, to the laboratory group, so also came their special interests in hepatic fatty acid/lipid metabolism and the growing clinical problems of fatty liver disease. The group also developed additional research studies on fatty liver diseases, especially the role of liver fatty acid binding protein, which has been a research interest of Dr. Wang for more than 20 years. OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY The Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology has research projects in numerous subspecialties of women's health and represent a range of studies from basic science to translational research and multi- center clinical trials. The Department also has a very robust resident research program marked by the fact that in the 2012-13 academic year, residents were accepted for 18 national research presentations. The Division of Gynecologic Oncology Our Gynecologic Oncology Division has continued to participate in numerous studies in 2013 in both basic science research and clinical trials. In 2013, the Division had 45 active clinical trials as well as a newly renovated laboratory conducting basic science ovarian cancer research. Genetic and Proteomic Analysis of Ovarian Cancer Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death in women with approximately 21,500 new cases and 15,000 deaths per year. Seventy-five percent of these new cases are diagnosed in an advanced stage. Genetic analysis enhances understanding of oncogenesis and much current research involves biomarkers. David Tait, MD, directs the activities within the newly renovated Sonja Wyatt Ovarian Cancer Research Laboratory in the James G. Cannon Research Center. The research is collaborative, with partnerships between the Gynecologic Oncology Division and the University of Research Highlights 2013 | 33 North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC) Departments of Computer Science and Biology, and between the Gynecologic Oncology Division and Medical Oncologists at Levine Cancer Institute. In 2013, these partnerships resulted in the submission of nine abstracts, two manuscripts, five grant submissions and one Intellectual Property submission. One major area of research is the HOX6 gene and its role in ovarian cancer. This year, investigators specifically evaluated HOXC6 expression in normal and malignant human ovarian tissue to characterize expression of HOXC6 in serous ovarian cancer. Microarray analysis demonstrated significant down-regulation of the HOXC6 gene in malignant serous ovarian tumor samples compared to normal ovarian epithelial cells from control samples. A 115-fold difference in malignant and normal primary tissue samples and cell lines was seen in the RT-PCR analysis. By immunohistochemistry, nuclear staining of HOXC6 protein was seen in the nuclei of normal ovarian surface epithelial tissues, but significantly reduced or absent in malignant ovarian samples. James B. Hall, MD, and his collaborators Eleanor Rogan, PhD, and researchers at the University of Nebraska have completed their work titled \"Unbalanced Estrogen Metabolism in Ovarian Cancer\" that was funded by the United States Department of Defense. This work is published in the International Journal of Cancer . Clinical Trials R. Wendel Naumann, MD, FACOG, FACS, was principal investigator for a multinational clinical trial entitled \"PRECEDENT: A Randomized Phase II Trial Comparing Vintafolide Liposomal Doxorubicin (PLD) in Alone in Patients with Platinum-Resistant Ovarian Cancer.\" The primary objective was to compare progression-free survival (PFS) between the groups. Nearly 150 women with recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer who underwent two prior cytotoxic regimens were randomly assigned at a 2:1 ratio to be treated with or without vintafolide. Vintafolide plus PLD is the first combination to demonstrate an improvement over standard therapy in a randomized trial of patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. The Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility The Reproductive Endocrinology Division is currently completing its first grant cycle of a National Institutes of Health Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NIH-NICHD) Reproductive Medicine Network (RMN) subaward which involved three studies of assisted reproduction in women with polycystic ovary syndrome while minimizing multiple births from assisted reproduction. The group recently received a second cycle award. The group also has a number of other ongoing projects including intellectual property development and investigations of innovative assisted reproductive techniques. Rebecca Usadi, MD, served as primary investigator (PI) for two NIH/NICHD-sponsored trials through the RMN. Reproductive Endocrinology at Carolinas Medical Center became an ancillary study site for RMN in 2010. In October 2013, the baseline characteristics and effects of obesity were published in Fertility and Sterility, which were results from the first RMN study: Pregnancy in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PPCOS) II, a multicenter randomized clinical trial. Preliminary results were presented at the 2013 Annual Meeting of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, awarded Scientific Program Prize Paper, and submitted for publication. The second RMN trial, Assessment of Multiple Intrauterine Gestations from Ovarian Stimulation (AMIGOS), evaluates three treatments of unexplained infertility to 34 | Carolinas HealthCare Systemcompare livebirth rates and risk of multiple gestations. The AMIGOS trial closed enrollment in 2013. After serving as PI for one of the thirteen RMN sites, Dr. Usadi was granted a subaward set to begin in late 2014. This Division initiated a novel study of Human Growth Hormone to determine its effects on embryos in poor prognosis patients undergoing IVF, as well its effects on molecular, metabolic and structural alterations in the endometrium. The Division also collaborated with Janet Niemeier, PhD, ABPP (RP), in the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation in 2013 for a project entitled \"Trauma Diva.\" The purpose of this project was to determine if severity of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in women is related to the phase of the menstrual cycle by evaluating phase of the menstrual cycle and reproductive hormone levels near the time of brain injury. Two dozen patients with TBI were matched with controls with no brain injury. Intellectual Property In 2013, Brad Hurst, MD, also reached the final stages of development of a patented disposable myolysis needle that will be a non-invasive intervention for the treatment of uterine fibroids. The patent was received in 2005 and the device is registered in the US and several countries. 1.3 million hysterectomies are performed in the US annually for uterine fibroids, and an estimated 13,000 to 14,000 uterine artery embolization procedures are performed annually in the US. According to the NIH, by age 50, 80 percent of African-American women and 70 percent of white women have fibroids. Once commercially available, this device will serve as a more cost-effective non-invasive therapeutic option for patients. Paul Marshburn, MD, MS, recently received two provisional patents for hysteroscopic surgical devices. One is a fluid collection drape that will improve monitoring of fluid during this surgery to improve patient safety and the second device is a special cannula to enhance the ease, safety and surgical time spent for placement of intrauterine balloon stents. The Division of Maternal Fetal Medicine Novel Therapies for Twins In Utero The Maternal-Fetal Medicine Division in 2013 investigated outcomes of novel fetal surgery techniques. Courtney Stephenson, DO, FACOG, and Albert Franco, MD, described a groundbreaking treatment for twin-reversed arterial perfusion (TRAP) sequence. TRAP sequence is a complication of monochorionic twin pregnancies in which an acardiac twin is perfused via placental arterial anastomoses by a pump twin. They recently reported the first and second successful treatment of TRAP sequence using microwave ablation (MWA) for vessel coagulation. The cases involved twins at 23 weeks and 18 weeks gestation. Both sets presented with increasing acardiac mass and Doppler changes in the pump twin. Both were treated with MWA with successful coagulation of intra-TRAP vessels and cessation of blood flow through the TRAP . The Division also evaluated the learning curve and outcomes of its training program for surgical proficiency in fetoscopic laser coagulation. The Charlotte Fetal Care Center program combines the benefits of ongoing education and supervision with hands-on training. A retrospective chart review of the first 103 consults for Twin-Twin Transfusion syndrome (TTTS) was performed. A learning curve-Research Highlights 2013 | 35 cumulative summation test (LC-CUSUM) for survival rates at 24 hours post-op and at birth were plotted to quantitatively assess surgical competency in FLC. Survival outcomes were shown to be similar to published outcomes at well-established fetal care centers globally. Cord Blood CMC-NorthEast is one of seven hospitals in North Carolina participating in public cord blood collection and the only hospital in the greater Charlotte metro area to provide this service at delivery. CMC-NorthEast, under the direction of Ryan Brown, MD, is pioneering this initiative and is leading an effort to increase cord blood collections from CMC-NorthEast and build a reputation as a leader in this field. ORAL MEDICINE Each year, 40,000 Americans develop head and neck cancer, and many require high-dose radiation therapy, often in combination with surgery and/or chemotherapy. An unavoidable side effect of radiation therapy is damage to the oral and maxillofacial tissues; some of this damage persists for the lifetime of the patient. These side effects include a permanent decrease in saliva production (hyposalivation), as the major salivary glands are often included in the areas treated with radiation therapy. Hyposalivation has a major impact on patients' overall quality of life and it significantly increases the risk of caries (tooth decay) and subsequent tooth loss. Radiation can also impair bone healing, leading to a life-long risk of infection of the bone surrounding the teeth, referred to as osteoradionecrosis (ORN). ORN can lead to an increased risk of fracture of the jaw and severe pain that requires extensive medical and surgical therapy. It is felt that approximately 50 percent of all ORN cases are associated with dental extractions following radiation therapy, and these patients are often caught in a vicious cycle as they are at a high risk of needing dental extractions. Michael Brennan, DDS, MHS, professor and chair, was awarded an $8.15 million grant in 2012 from the NIH-National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research to study dental and oral medicine outcomes of patients who have received high-dose radiation therapy to the head and neck region (OraRad). The results of this five-year, multi-center study will lead to a better understanding of the oral and dental sequelae experienced by head and neck cancer patients, which in turn will guide decision- making and standard of care protocols for the dental management of patients in the pre- and post- radiation period. Dr. Brennan is also co-principal investigator of a multi-center study (OraStem) that will assess the burden of illness of oral complications in adult patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). He also serves as the faculty advisor of a similar study (Peds OraStem) in children undergoing HSCT. These two prospective HSCT studies have partial funding through Sweden and Singapore, respectively. A major achievement in 2013 for the Department of Oral Medicine was the establishment and launch of a new research laboratory within the James G. Cannon Research Center directed by Farah Mougeot, PhD. The major focus of the Oral Medicine (OM) Research Laboratory revolves around the identification and characterization of microbial biomarkers associated with oral complications following cancer therapy. The studies previously described (OraRad, OraStem and Peds OraStem) will provide samples for the OM research lab for microbiome and biomarker discovery. In addition, the laboratory will investigate microbial profiles of the oral cavity in salivary disorders with a strong linkage 36 | Carolinas HealthCare Systemwith Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome and Salivary Disorders Center at Carolinas HealthCare System. Another focus of the laboratory is to identify oral bacterial species involved in cardiovascular diseases, in collaboration with Sanger Heart & Vascular Institute. The laboratory also focuses on the identification of oral cavity microbial determinants of respiratory infections in geriatric population. In addition to the characterization of oral microbial profiles in relation with the development of various diseases, the research in the department explores the role of host genomic factors involved. NURSING RESEARCH The nursing department at Carolinas Medical Center (CMC) received Magnet-designation in 2013 from the American Nurses Credentialing Center, which provides a framework for excellence in nursing practice and a focus on outcomes research. The \"New Knowledge, Innovations & Improvements\" component includes new models of care, application of existing evidence and new contributions to the science of nursing. These resources facilitated a continued increase in the establishment and implementation of evidence-based best practices for nursing care at CMC and throughout Carolinas HealthCare System. The Nursing Scientific Advisory Committee (NSAC) was formed at the system-level to review all nurse-led research and evidence-based practice proposals prior to submission to the Institutional Review Board. With the assistance of the Office of Clinical and Translational Research, protocols are reviewed by Carolinas HealthCare System teammates with doctoral degrees and applicants are given feedback on scientific credibility, study design, subject protection and analysis methods. As evidence of the increased research activity by CMC nurses in 2013, a record total 229 literature searches were conducted by nurses and 24 protocols were approved by the NSAC, submitted to the Institutional Review Board; and initiated. Areas of research include diabetes; the inpatient experience including Research Highlights 2013 | 37 falls reduction and communication among clinical teammates; nursing training and retention; pediatrics; and labor and delivery. Also, the CMC Nursing Research and Evidence-based Practice Council sponsored monthly, System- wide videoconference presentations in addition to the second annual Nursing Research Symposium at CMC's Suzanne Hill Freeman Auditorium on September 27, 2013. There were more than 100 nurses in attendance. Linda Ryan, PhD, RN, from Chicago, IL was the keynote speaker and invited podium presentations included \"Reducing CAUTI Rates\" (Tammy Richardson, BSN, RN, \"Baby \"Alcohol Impregnated Caps\" (Morgan Miskill, (Peggy MacKay, MN, RN, CPN). Additionally, 13 poster presentations highlighted the research done in the areas of reducing readmissions, reducing infection, improving outcomes for surgical patients, nurse training, labor and delivery, efficiency, patient self-management, and communication among clinical teammates. PEDIATRICS The Center for Pediatric Research (CPR) at Levine Children's Hospital is committed to providing pediatric patients access to innovative diagnostic methodologies and therapeutic interventions. The Center expanded in 2013 through collaboration with Sanger Heart & Vascular Institute to establish a pediatric-specific research program. Further collaboration between CPR and the Department of Orthopaedics allowed for involvement in a therapeutic trial with a new antimicrobial for osteomyelitis. The Pediatric Research Fund, established by Carolinas HealthCare Foundation in 2012, will launch funding cycles in 2014 to provide support for investigator-initiated research endeavors conducted by the Department of Pediatrics. Sanger Heart & Vascular Institute Pediatric Research Program In 2013, CPR collaborated with Sanger Heart & Vascular Institute to establish a program for retrospective and prospective investigation of interventions and outcomes in pediatric cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery. Jennifer Lamothe, an experienced program coordinator, worked with Anitha Jayakumar, MD, MBBS, MRCP , and Benjamin Peeler, MD, FACS, to develop the program. The program will allow assessment of ongoing interventions as investigators develop innovative approaches to the care of pediatric cardiology and cardiothoracic patients to further improve outcomes. Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition The Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology continues to evaluate novel agents for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders such as gastroesophageal reflux and hepatitis B. Historically, enrollment of children in novel drug trials has been limited, and the availability of new medications has consequently been restricted. With the study of these agents specifically in children, pediatric patients will ultimately be afforded the same benefits of newer therapeutics as adults. 38 | Carolinas HealthCare SystemDivision of Pediatric Infectious Disease and Immunology The Division of Pediatric Infectious Disease and Immunology enrolled more than 200 patients into the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study of the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Because children with LTBI are at the highest risk of progression to severe tuberculosis disease, it is imperative to be able to diagnose and treat this infection to prevent future tuberculosis cases and ultimately eliminate the disease globally. Enrollment in two NIH-funded antiviral studies is anticipated in 2014. The evaluation of these agents will benefit neonates, infants and children with herpesvirus infections by offering novel therapeutics and establishment of appropriate dosages of antiviral therapies for premature infants. Niraj Patel, MD, completed a multicenter evaluation of the safety and efficacy of a new subcutaneous immunoglobulin product for the treatment of primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDD). He is also participating in a national registry to enhance early diagnosis and treatment strategies for children with PIDD. Division of Pediatric Nephrology The Division of Pediatric Nephrology was recently selected to participate in the Clinical Phenotyping and Resource Biobank Core (C-PROBE). C-PROBE is a national collaboration between major institutions in the US, aimed at developing an infrastructure to serve as an interface between patients in the clinical care settings and biomedical investigators conducting translational research in kidney disease. The division continues to be involved in several multicenter clinical trials through the Midwest Pediatric Nephrology Consortium, evaluating the therapeutic management of nephrotic syndrome, cardiovascular complications in renal transplant recipients and genetic markers of nephrotic syndrome. Division of Pediatric Rheumatology The Division of Pediatric Rheumatology is launching two clinical trials investigating the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The subcutaneous administration of the agent will allow for more convenient dosing to benefit patients with chronic disease. The division continues to be involved in a nationwide pediatric rheumatology registry supported by the Childhood Arthritis & Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA), and participation in an industry-sponsored trial of a novel anti-TNF biologic response modifier, coordinated by the national Pediatric Rheumatology Collaborative Study Group (PRCSG). Affiliation of the Division with CARRA and PRCSG will provide future opportunities to participate in additional studies benefitting children with rheumatic disease. Pediatric Muscular Dystrophy Research within the Division of Clinical Genetics Susan Sparks, MD, PhD, is part of the Division of Clinical Genetics and leads the clinical research program which includes 16 active clinical research trials in muscular dystrophy and genetic disorders. Jacqueline Sykes, RN, joined the CPR in April of 2013 as Dr. Sparks' primary research coordinator and nurse. The Pediatric Muscular Dystrophy Research Laboratory, under Dr. Sparks' direction, focuses on translational research for muscular dystrophy, with a strong interest in dystroglycanopathies (congenital Research Highlights 2013 | 39 muscular dystrophy and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy), dystrophinopathies (Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies) and genetically identifying unknown muscular dystrophies. With funding from National Institutes of Health, the Pediatric Muscular Dystrophy Laboratory serves as Core C: Molecular Diagnostics and Cell Banking Core for the \"Center of Research Translation: Systemic Exon-skipping in Muscular Dystrophy,\" a multi-center project with Children's National Medical Center and the University of Pittsburgh. The laboratory processes blood and tissue samples from patients with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies evaluated at multiple clinical sites. These samples are used to better understand exon-skipping therapy for the disease. With funding from the Muscular Dystrophy Association, the laboratory is identifying new genetic etiology of muscular dystrophy. Patients with clinical features of muscular dystrophy are evaluated clinically in addition to undergoing a thorough review of medical history and testing. The patient's muscular dystrophy etiology is identified utilizing specific gene and whole-exome sequencing. SANGER HEART & VASCULAR INSTITUTE Clinical Research Program: Adult Cardiology, Pediatric Cardiology, Adult and Pediatric Cardiothoracic Surgery, and Vascular Surgery and Medicine Sanger Heart & Vascular Institute clinical research continues to grow and advance its larger clinical and academic mission to create and operate a comprehensive system to provide healthcare and related services, including education and research opportunities, for the benefit of the people we serve. Sanger Research manages more than 60 clinical trials that include more than 2,500 patients. More than 100 publications, abstracts and international presentations were contributed by all of the departments during the last year. Multi-campus clinical investigation has evolved with more than 50 Sanger faculty members across four campuses involved in research endeavors. External grants exceeded $1.1 million in funding during 2013. Sanger Research continues to facilitate the development of new technology and expertise and bring advanced therapies to our community. Multidisciplinary collaboration remains a critical ingredient to our success. Structural Heart Disease The Sanger Valve Center is a leader in percutaneous valve therapy, contributing to a national database on Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) and currently investigating the role of TAVR in the treatment of moderate risk patients in the SURTAVI trial. Sanger continues to be a national leader in percutaneous mitral valve repair and is evaluating an investigational device and technology for functional mitral insufficiency in the Clinical Outcomes Assessment of the MitraClip Percutaneous Therapy for Extremely High-Surgical-Risk Patients (COAPT) Trial. Ischemic Heart Disease Sanger has not only been actively investigating new treatments for patients with coronary artery disease and participating in the ABSORB trial studying completely bioabsorbable stents, but also conducts comparative effectiveness research through the EXCEL trial on the role of stents and surgery in left main disease. For patients with advanced disease, Sanger has also been involved in the study of 40 | Carolinas HealthCare Systemautologous stem cell therapy for refractory angina. The Bridges Molecular Cardiac Surgery Research Laboratory continues its NIH-funded translational research in techniques to deliver gene therapy for cardiac regenerative medicine (further detail follows). Sanger has been a world leader in systems of care for heart attack care with numerous presentations over the last year at national meetings including the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics conference. Hadley Wilson, MD, FACC, is now a faculty member for the American Heart Association's Mission Lifeline Project STEMI Systems Accelerator to bring these rapid transport heart attack models to 20 other cities in the US serving more than 20 million people. Vascular Disease Frank Arko, MD, performed the first ever in-human implantation of a branched thoracic endograft for the treatment of thoracic aortic aneurysm and Markus Scherer, MD, provided core lab 4D reconstructed computed tomography angiography (CTA) images to guide therapy. Dr. Arko and colleagues presented at numerous meetings on advanced techniques for the treatment of aortic aneurysm and dissection. Heart Failure The number of patients living with heart failure continues to grow and is an area of active investigation for Sanger. Through collaboration between the heart failure and electrophysiology departments, novel technologies for the treatment of patients with advanced heart failure have been investigated through the LAPTOP HF, IDENTIFY HF and ECHO CRT studies. In 2013, Matthew Levinsky, MD, was a leading investigator in the study of a novel quadripolar defibrillator lead in the ATTAIN study and was the first investigator at Carolinas HealthCare System to lead a study enrolling subjects at all four tertiary campuses. Arrhythmia Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is a growing public health burden and an area of active study for Sanger both through the NIH-sponsored CABANA trial, evaluating AF ablation, and through percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion with an investigational device for stroke prevention. Hypertension Sanger is a leading center for the investigation of catheter-based therapy for the management of refractory hypertension through the HTN study of catheter-directed renal nerve denervation. Imaging The FOCUS initiative led by Tom Johnson, MD, involved the institution of a System-wide quality improvement program, which led to marked improvement in appropriate utilization of echocardiography and stress testing. The initiative led to abstracts, papers and national recognition. Research Highlights 2013 | 41 Sanger is now being represented on the ACC national committee for promoting appropriate use of cardiovascular imaging. Markus Scherer, MD, a nationally recognized leader in CTA, investigated the role of coronary CTA in the evaluation of chronic angina. Geoffrey Rose, MD, FACC, FASE, serves in several national imaging leadership positions, serving as a board member and chairperson for the Intersocietal Accreditation Commission for echocardiography and as a committee member for the American Society of Echocardiography. Pediatric Cardiology and Surgery Joseph Paolillo, MD, is the national lead enroller in the HELEX study for the percutaneous closure of atrial septal defects. He also implanted the first percutaneous pulmonary valve for failed pulmonary conduit at Sanger as part of an ongoing registry. Benjamin Peeler, MD, FACS, and Thomas Maxey, MD, continue to perform pediatric left ventricular assist implantation and pediatric mitral valve replacements as part of compassionate use registries. Dr. Peeler was elected to membership in the prestigious Center for Health Services Study research consortium. James Ren \u00e9 Herlong, MD, serves as core laboratory member for several national studies. Through participation in some of the most important clinical trials active in the US and through active original research from bench to bedside Sanger Clinical Research continues to advance the greater Sanger Heart & Vascular and Carolinas HealthCare System mission. 42 | Carolinas HealthCare SystemBridges Molecular Cardiac Surgery Research Laboratory The Bridges Molecular Cardiac Surgery Research Laboratory team includes Michael G. Katz, MD, PhD, and Anthony S. Fargnoli and is under the direction of Charles Bridges, MD, Sc.D. The laboratory continues its pioneering work in the field of surgical mediated delivery of viral vector gene therapies for ischemic heart disease. 2013 was a record year in terms of scientific productivity, as the laboratory's work was featured in six original publications, a prestigious chapter contribution in Gene Transfer to the Heart: Emerging Strategies for the Selection of Vectors, Delivery Techniques, and Therapeutic Targets and eight conference proceedings. Of these proceedings, the most notable was a featured presentation at the Society of Thoracic Surgery Meeting in Los Angeles in the Top Abstract Forum for Translational Research, where only four abstracts were selected from more than 1,200 submissions. Here, the Molecular Cardiac Surgery with Recirculating Delivery (MCARD) mediated SERCA2a gene therapy results in the ovine model of ischemic cardiomyopathy were presented for the first time to an international surgeon scientist audience. In addition to the invited speaking opportunities at both the American Society of Cell and Gene Therapy and American Heart Association, the laboratory has prepared a Pre Investigational New Drug application for submission to the US Food and Drug Administration with the goal of advancing toward a phase I trial with the MCARD-SERCA2a gene therapy treatment. If successful, this would usher in a new era of cardiac surgery, whereby patients undergoing routine procedures at Carolinas HealthCare System could benefit from an effective gene therapy to treat heart failure at the myocyte level. Separate from the clinically inspired MCARD- SERCA2a thrust, the laboratory has also diversified its research program in three new areas. First, a novel needleless liquid jet injection device system that would offer a new direct approach to deliver various cell and gene therapies is being developed. The preliminary work resulted in an award abstract at the Heart Failure Society of America and subsequent provisional patent application filing. Second, the laboratory has partnered with Sanjay Kaushal, MD, PhD, from the University of Maryland Medical Center, who has an approved phase I trial for harvesting and transplanting stem cells to treat pediatric patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The laboratory was the first in the world to successfully evaluate the potential of recirculating stem cells in a large animal model. Third, in an effort to complement its gene therapy expertise, the laboratory has also partnered with Mauro Giacca, MD, PhD, from the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology. He is an expert in the emerging field of microRNA induced regeneration of myocytes post myocardial infarction. In addition to these scientific achievements, the laboratory also published and presented key animal care guidelines and best practices for post-operative care management. Kim Mihalko, DVM, received first place distinction for best poster when she presented the laboratory's effective care guidelines at the 2013 AALAS meeting. Research Highlights 2013 | 43 THE DICKSON ADVANCED ANALYTICS GROUP (DA2) In 2013, 815 patients at Carolinas Medical Center (CMC) underwent a drug-eluting stent procedure. Oftentimes, angioplasty is needed to re-open the blocked artery post-DES stent procedure. The Assessment of Dual Anti-platelet Therapy with Drug-Eluting Stents (ADAPT-DES) investigators want to know why. Michael (not his real name) and his wife began a new exercise plan. During the warm up, Michael felt sick to his stomach but dismissed it as reflux. That evening while Michael was mowing the lawn, he began to sweat more than usual and felt pressure in his chest and left elbow, but his discomfort subsided after a short rest. Nonetheless, he and his wife headed to the CMC Emergency Department. Michael was admitted to rule out any cardiac concerns. He awoke the following morning with crushing chest pain. He was found to have 85 percent stenosis and a moderate amount of thrombosis in his mid-LAD artery area. An angioplasty was performed and a drug eluting stent was deployed. Michael continued to experience chest pain, so an intravascular ultrasound was performed and revealed need for further post-dilatation which alleviated the pain. The following morning, Michael was told about the ADAPT-DES study and he decided to enroll. He signed the study consent and labs were drawn. One year later, Michael experienced a similar series of events and returned to the hospital. The intensivist found blocking within the stent itself, which, as previously stated, is not uncommon. ADAPT-DES was a five-year, prospective, multi-center, FDA-regulated study of 8,665 patients treated with one or more drug-eluting stents and given an anticoagulant at 10 sites in the US and Germany. Platelet reactivity was tested in patients after successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using VerifyNow point-of-care assays, and assigned different cutoffs to define high platelet reactivity. The primary endpoint was definite or probable and secondary endpoints were all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction and clinically relevant bleeding. The Dickson Advanced Analytics Group (DA2) provides study coordination, data management and analytics across Carolinas HealthCare System. DA\u00b2 was the Data Coordinating and Analytics Center on the ADAPT-DES study, whose co-principal investigator is Michael Rinaldi, MD, FACC, FSCAI. Acting as the Contract Research Organization for the study, DA\u00b2 performed the following study functions: ADAPT-DES database build, maintenance and change control, preparation of the Standard Operating Procedures manual, Case Report Form design, site evaluations, monitoring, auditing and closeout, site and Investigator training, regulatory document and process review, project management report writing, statistical analysis plan creation and analyses, data management, and data management plan creation. One-year results were published in Lancet and presented at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics conference in San Francisco in November 2013. Results showed platelet hyporesponsiveness is a powerful predictor of both stent thrombosis and bleeding. These results may allow more selective use of powerful anti-platelet agents to higher-risk cohorts. It also showed, for the first time, that routine use of intravascular imaging can reduce stent thrombosis. Through cutting-edge research and a strong partnership with DA\u00b2, physicians are better able to manage care for coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. The ADAPT-DES study results will be used to drive improvement of patients with CAD at Carolinas HealthCare System.44 | Carolinas HealthCare SystemCORE LABORATORIES Imaging Core Facility The Carolinas HealthCare System Imaging Core Facility was established in 2013 under the direction of Laura W.
