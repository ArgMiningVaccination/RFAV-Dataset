Agnonread by Catherine Byers\"When Israeli Nobel Laureate S. Y . Agnon published the novel Only Yesterday in 1945, it quickly became recognized as a major work of world literature, not only for its vivid histor-ical reconstruction of Israel's founding society. The book tells a seemingly simple tale about a man who immi-grates to Palestine with the Second Aliya\u2014the several hundred idealists who returned between 1904 and 1914 to work the Hebrew soil as in Biblical times and revive Hebrew culture. This epic novel also engages the reader in a fascinating network of meanings, con-tradictions, and paradoxes all leading to the question, what, if anything, controls human existence? Seduced by Zionist slogans, young Isaac Kumer imagines the Land of Israel filled with the finan - cial, social, and erotic opportunities that were denied him, the son of an impover-ished shopkeeper, in Poland. Once there, he cannot find the agricultural work he anticipated. Instead Isaac happens upon house-painting jobs as he moves from secular, Zionist Jaffa, where the ideolog-ical fervor and sexual freedom are alien to him, to ultra-orthodox, anti-Zionist Jerusalem. While some of his Zionist 10Adult Fiction\u2014Historical Fiction friends turn capitalist, becoming suc- cessful merchants, his own life remains adrift and impoverished in a land torn between idealism and practicality, a place that is at once homeland and dias-pora. Eventually he marries a religious woman in Jerusalem, after his worldly girlfriend in Jaf fa rejects him. Led astray by circumstances, Isaac always ends up in the place opposite of where he wants to be, but why? The text soars to Surrealist-Kafkaesque dimensions when, in a playful mode, Isaac drips paint on a stray dog, writing Crazy Dog on his back. Causing panic wherever he roams, the dog takes over the story, until, after enduring persecution for so long without understanding why, he really does go mad and bites Isaac. The dog has been interpreted as everything from the embodiment of Exile to a daemonic force, and becomes an unforgettable character in a book about the death of God, the deception of discourse, the power of suppressed eroticism, and the destiny of a people depicted in all its darkness and promise.\" \u2014 Provided by publisher.

Weaving together a broad base of existing scholarship with his own insights, Klinger appends Lovecraft's uncanny oeuvre and Kafkaesque life story in a way that provides context and unlocks many of the secrets of his often cryptic body of work. Over the course of his career, Lovecraft made a marked departure from the gothic style of his pre - decessors that focused mostly on ghosts, ghouls, and witches, instead crafting a vast mythos in which humanity is but a blissfully unaware speck in a cosmos shared by vast and ancient alien beings.

Arts Hitchcock and the Censors DB108613 14 hours 45 minutesby John Billheimerread by George Holmes\"Throughout his career, Alfred Hitchcock had to contend with a wide variety of censors attuned to the slightest sugges-tion of sexual innuendo, undue violence, toilet humor, religious disrespect, and all forms of indecency, real or imagined. From 1934 to 1968, the Motion Picture Production Code Office controlled the content and final cut on all films made and distributed in the United States. During their review of Hitchcock's films, the censors demanded an average of 22.5 changes, ranging from the mun-dane to the mind-boggling, on each of his American films. In his award-win - ning Hitchcock and the Censors, author John Billheimer traces the forces that led to the Production Code and describes Hitchcock's interactions with code offi - cials on a film-by-film basis as he fought to protect his creations, bargaining with code reviewers and sidestepping cen-sorship to produce a lifetime of memo-rable films. Despite the often-arbitrary decisions of the code board, Hitchcock still managed to push the boundaries of sex and violence permitted in films by charming\u2014and occasionally tricking\u2014the censors, and by swapping off bits of dialogue, plot points, and individual shots (some of which had been deliber-ately inserted as trading chips) to protect cherished scenes and images. By exam-ining Hitchcock's priorities in dealing with the censors, this work highlights the director's theories of suspense as well as his magician-like touch when negotiating with code officials.\" \u2014 Provided by publisher.

In the late 1980s, the AIDS pandemic was annihilating queer people, intravenous drug users, and communities of color in America, and disinformation about the disease ran rampant.

She also grew up in a Persian-Jewish household, the American-born daughter of parents who had fled Mashhad, Iran. In Concealed she tells the story of being caught between these two worlds: the dutiful daughter of tradition-bound par-ents who hungers for more self-determi-nation than tradition allows. Exploring the roots of her father's deep silences and explosive temper, her mother's flam-boyance and flights from home, and her own sense of indebtedness to her two Iranian-born brothers, Amini uncovers the story of her parents' early years in Mashhad, Iran's holiest Muslim city; the little known history and persecu-tion of Mashhad's underground Jews; the incident that steeled her mother's resolve to leave; and her parents' arduous journey to the United States, where they found themselves facing a new threat to their traditions: the threat of freedom. Determined to protect his only daughter from corruption, Amini's father prohibits talk, books, higher education, and tries to push her into an early Persian marriage. Can she resist? Should she? Focused intently on what she stands to gain, Amini eventually comes to see what she also stands to lose: a family and com-munity bound together by food, celebra-tions, sibling escapades, and unexpected acts of devotion by parents to whom she feels invisible.

Fifty Sounds: A Memoir of Language, Learning, and Longing DB108587 12 hours 27 minutesby Polly Bartonread by Mary March\"The language learning I want to talk about is sensory bombardment. It is a possession, a bedevilment, a physical takeover,\" writes Polly Barton in her eloquent treatise on this profoundly hum-bling and gratifying act. Shortly before graduating with a degree in philosophy from the University of Cambridge, Barton on a whim accepted an English-teaching position in Japan. With the characteristic ambivalence of a twenty-one-year-old whose summer\u2014and life\u2014stretched out almost infinitely before her, she moved to a remote island in the Sea of Japan, unaware that this journey would come to define not only her career but her very understanding of her own identity. Divided into fifty onomatopoeic Japanese phrases, Fifty Sounds recounts Barton's path to becoming a literary translator fluent in an incredibly diffi - cult vernacular. From \"min-min,\" the sound of air screaming, to \"jin-jin,\" the sound of being touched for the first time, Barton analyzes these and countless 60Adult Nonfiction\u2014Biography other foreign sounds and phrases as a means of reflecting on various cultural attitudes, including the nuances of con-formity and the challenges of being an outsider in what many consider a hermet - ically sealed society. In a tour-de-force of lyrical, playful prose, Barton recalls the stifling humidity that first greeted her on the island along with the incessant hum of peculiar new noises. As Barton taught English to inquisitive middle school chil-dren, she studied the basics of Japanese in an inverse way, beginning with simple nouns and phrases, such as \"cat,\" \"dog,\" and \"Hello, my name is.\" But when it came to surrounding herself in the cul-ture, simply mastering the basics wasn't enough. Japanese, Barton learned, has three scripts: the phonetic katakana and hiragana (collectively known as kana) and kanji (characters of Chinese origin). Despite her months-long immersion in the language, a word would occasionally produce a sinking feeling and send her sifting through her dictionaries to find the exact meaning. But this is precisely how Barton has come to define language learning: \"It is the always-bruised but ever-renewing desire to draw close: to a person, a territory, a culture, an idea, an indefinable feeling.\" Engaging and penetrating, Fifty Sounds chronicles everything from Barton's most hilarious misinterpretations to her new friends and lovers in Tokyo\u2014and even the influence of Ludwig Wittgenstein's transformative philosophy. A classic in the making in the tradition of Anne Carson and Rachel Cusk, Fifty Sounds is a celebration of the empowering act of learning to communi-cate in any new language.\" \u2014 Provided by publisher. 2022.A Sacred Oath: Memoirs of a Secretary of Defense during Extraordinary Times DB109683 20 hours 59 minutesby Mark T.

The child of Salvadoran immigrants, Roberto Lovato grew up in 1970s and 80s San Francisco as MS-13 and other notorious Salvadoran gangs were forming in California. In his teens, he lost friends to the escalating violence, and survived acts of brutality himself. He eventually traded the vio-lence of the streets for human rights advocacy in wartime El Salvador where he joined the guerilla movement against the U.S.-backed, fascist military govern-ment responsible for some of the most barbaric massacres and crimes against humanity in recent history. Roberto returned from war-torn El Salvador to find the United States on the verge of unprecedented crises of its own. There, he channeled his own pain into activism and journalism, focusing his attention on how trauma affects individual lives and societies, and began the difficult journey of confronting the roots of his own trauma. As a child, Roberto endured a tumultuous relationship with his father Ram\u00a2n. Raised in extreme poverty in the countryside of El Salvador during one of the most violent periods of its history, Ram\u00a2n learned to survive by straddling intersecting underworlds of family secrets, traumatic silences, and dealing in black-market goods and guns. The repression of the violence in his life took its toll, however. Ram\u00a2n was plagued with silences and fits of anger that had a profound impact on his youngest son, and which Roberto attributes as a source of constant reckoning with the violence and rebellion in his own life. In Unforgetting, Roberto interweaves his father's complicated history and his own with first-hand reportage on gang life, state violence, and the heart of the immi-gration crisis in both El Salvador and the United States. In doing so he makes the political personal, revealing the cyclical ways violence operates in our homes and 62Adult Nonfiction\u2014Biography our societies, as well as the ways hope and tenderness can rise up out of the darkness if we are courageous enough to unforget.\" \u2014 Provided by publisher .

In 1831, at the age of twenty-five, Alexis de Tocqueville made his fateful journey to America, where he observed the thrilling reality of a func - tioning democracy. From that moment onward, the French aristocrat would dedicate his life as a writer and politician to ending despotism in his country and bringing it into a new age. In this author - itative and groundbreaking biography, leading Tocqueville expert Olivier Zunz tells the story of a radical thinker who, uniquely charged by the events of his time, both in America and France, used the world as a laboratory for his political ideas. Placing Tocqueville's dedication to achieving a new kind of democracy at the center of his life and work, Zunz traces Tocqueville's evolution into a pas - sionate student and practitioner of liberal politics across a trove of correspondence with intellectuals, politicians, constitu - ents, family members, and friends. While taking seriously Tocqueville's attempts to apply the lessons of Democracy in America to French politics, Zunz shows that the United States, and not only France, remained central to Tocqueville's thought and actions throughout his life. In his final years, with France gripped 64Adult Nonfiction\u2014Biography, Blindness and Disabilities, Business and Economics by an authoritarian regime and America divided by slavery , Tocqueville feared that the democratic experiment might be failing.

After Steve: How Apple Became a Trillion-Dollar Company and Lost Its Soul DB108934 14 hours 47 minutesby Tripp Mickleread by Will Damron 65Adult Nonfiction Business and Cooking \"Steve Jobs called Jony Ive his \"spiri- tual partner at Apple.\" The London-born genius was the second-most powerful person at Apple and the creative force who most embodies Jobs' s spirit, the man who designed the products adopted by hundreds of millions the world over: the iPod, iPad, MacBook Air, the iMac G3, and the iPhone. In the wake of his close collaborator's death, the chief designer wrestled with grief and initially threw himself into his work designing the new Apple headquarters and the Watch before losing his motivation in a company increasingly devoted more to margins than to inspiration. In many ways, Cook was Ive's opposite. The product of a small Alabama town, he had risen through the ranks from the supply side of the company. His gift was not the creation of new products. Instead, he had invented countless ways to maximize a margin, squeezing some suppliers, persuading others to build factories the size of cities to churn out more units. He considered inventory evil. He knew how to make subordinates sweat with withering questions. Jobs selected Cook as his successor, and Cook oversaw a period of tremendous revenue growth that has lifted Apple's valuation to $2 trillion. He built a commanding busi-ness in China and rapidly distinguished himself as a master politician who could forge global alliances and send the world's stock market into freefall with a single sentence. Author Tripp Mickle spoke with more than 200 current and former Apple executives, as well as fig - ures key to this period of Apple's history, including Trump administration officials and fashion luminaries such as Anna Wintour while writing After Steve. His research shows the company's success came at a cost. Apple lost its innovative spirit and has not designed a new cate-gory of device in years. Ive's departure in 2019 marked a culmination in Apple's shift from a company of innovation to one of operational excellence, and the price is a company that has lost its soul.\" \u2014 Provided by publisher.

Government and Politics Silent Invasion: The Untold Story of the Trump Administration, Covid-19, and Preventing the Next Pandemic Before It's Too Late DB108920 22 hours 10 minutesby Deborah Birxread by Kathe Mazur\"In late February 2020, Dr. Deborah Birx\u2014a lifelong federal health offi - cial who had worked at the CDC, the State Department, and the US Army across multiple presidential adminis - trations\u2014was asked to join the Trump White House Coronavirus Task Force and assist the already faltering federal response to the Covid-19 pandemic. For weeks, she'd been raising the alarm behind the scenes about what she saw happening in public\u2014from the apparent lack of urgency at the White House to the routine downplaying of the risks to Americans. Once in the White House, she was tasked with helping fix the broken federal approach and making President Trump see the danger this virus posed to all of us. Silent Invasion is the story of what she witnessed and lived for the next year\u2014an eye-opening, inside account, detailed here for the first time, of the Trump Administration's response to the greatest public health crisis in modern times. Regarded with suspicion in the West Wing from day one, Dr. Birx goes beyond the media speculation and polit - ical maneuvering to show what she was really up against in the Trump White House. Digging into the hard-fought victories, the costly mistakes, and the human drama surrounding the adminis - tration's efforts, she examines the forces that crippled efforts to control the virus and explores why these blunders con - tinue to haunt us today. And yet amid the agonizing missteps were bright spots that point the way forward\u2014the fastest vaccine creation in history, governors that put their citizens' health first, and Tribal Nations that demonstrated the powerful role of community in curbing spread, despite their criminally under - funded healthcare systems. Collectively these successes reveal the valiant work of many who were committed to saving lives, as well as highlighting the dire need to reform our public health institutions, so they are nimble and resilient enough 77Adult Nonfiction Government and Politics to confront the next pandemic. With the pandemic now moving into its third year confounding two presidential adminis - trations, Dr. Birx presents a story at once urgent and frustratingly unfinished, as Covid-19 continues to put thousands of American lives at risk. The end result is the most comprehensive and exten - sive accounting to date of the Trump Administration's struggle to control the biggest health crisis in generations\u2014a revelatory look at how we can learn from our mistakes and prevent this from hap - pening again.\" \u2014 Provided by publisher.

Here's the Deal: A Memoir 20 hours 1 minutesby Kellyanne Conwayread by Kellyanne Conway\"As a highly respected pollster for corporate and Republican clients and a frequent television talk show guest, Kellyanne Conway had already estab-lished herself as one of the brightest lights on the national political scene when Donald Trump asked her to run his presidential campaign. She agreed, deliv-ering him to the White House, becoming the first woman in American history to manage a winning presidential cam-paign, and changing the American land-scape forever. Who she is, how she did it, and who tried to stop her is a fascinating story of personal triumph and political intrigue that has never been told...until now. In Here' s The Deal, Kellyanne takes you on a journey all the way to the White House and beyond with her trademark sharp wit, raw honesty, and level eye. It's all here: what it's like to be dissected on national television. How to outsmart the media mob. How to outclass the crazy critics. How to survive and suc-ceed male-dominated industries.

And yet, from our founding, strong political forces were determined to limit that right. The Supreme Court, Alexander Hamilton wrote, would protect the weak against this very sort of tyranny . Still, as On Account of Race forcefully demonstrates, through the better part of American history the Court has instead been a protector of white rule. And com-plex threats against the right to vote persist even today. Beginning in 1876, the Supreme Court systematically dis-mantled both the equal protection guar-antees of the Fourteenth Amendment and what seemed to be the right to vote in the Fifteenth. And so a half million African Americans across the South who had risked their lives and property to be allowed to cast ballots were stricken from voting rolls by white suprema-cists. This vacuum allowed for the rise of Jim Crow. None of this was done in the shadows\u2014those determined to wrest the vote from black Americans could not have been more boastful in either intent or execution. On Account of Race tells the story of an American tragedy, the only occasion in United States his-tory in which a group of citizens who had been granted the right to vote then had it stripped away. It is a warning that the right to vote is fragile and must be carefully guarded and actively preserved lest American democracy perish.\" \u2014 Provided by publisher. Unrated.

The Great Experiment: Why Diverse Democracies Fall Apart and How They Can Endure DB109458 8 hours 32 minutesby Yascha Mounkread by JD Jackson\"Some democracies are highly homo-geneous. Others have long maintained a brutal racial or religious hierarchy, with some groups dominating and exploiting others. Never in history has a democ-racy succeeded in being both diverse and equal, treating members of many different ethnic or religious groups fairly. And yet achieving that goal is now central to the democratic project in countries around the world. It is, Yascha Mounk argues, the greatest experiment of our time. Drawing on history, social psychology, and comparative politics, Mounk examines how diverse societies have long suffered from the ills of dom-ination, fragmentation, or structured anarchy. So it is hardly surprising that most people are now deeply pessimistic that different groups might be able to integrate in harmony, celebrating their differences without essentializing them. But Mounk shows us that the past can offer crucial insights for how to do better in the future. There is real reason for hope. It is up to us and the institutions we build whether different groups will come to see each other as enemies or friends, as strangers or compatriots. To make diverse democracies endure, and even thrive, we need to create a world in which our ascriptive identities come 79Adult Nonfiction Government and Politics, Hobbies and Crafts, Humor to matter less\u2014not because we ignore the injustices that still characterize the United States and so many other coun-tries around the world, but because we have succeeded in addressing them. The Great Experiment is that rare book that offers both a profound understanding of an urgent problem and genuine hope for our human capacity to solve it. As Mounk contends, giving up on the pros-pects of building fair and thriving diverse democracies is simply not an option\u2014and that is why we must strive to realize a more ambitious vision for the future of our societies.\" \u2014 Provided by publisher.

The Edge of Memory: Ancient Stories, Oral Tradition, and the Post-Glacial World DB109062 11 hours 6 minutesby Patrick Nunnread by Kerry Dukin\"In today's society it is generally the written word that holds the authority. We are more likely to trust the words found in a history textbook over the version of history retold by a friend\u2014after all, human memory is unreliable, and how can you be sure your friend hasn't embel - lished the facts? But before humans were writing down their knowledge, they were telling it to each other in the form of sto-ries. The Edge of Memory celebrates the predecessor of written information\u2014the spoken word, tales from our ancestors that have been passed down, transmit-ting knowledge from one generation to the next. Among the most extensive and best-analysed of these stories are from native Australian cultures. These stories conveyed both practical informa-tion and recorded history, describing a lost landscape, often featuring tales of flooding and submergence. These folk traditions are increasingly supported by hard science. Geologists are starting to corroborate the tales through study of climatic data, sediments and land forms; the evidence was there in the stories, but until recently, nobody was listening. In this book, Patrick Nunn unravels the importance of these tales, exploring the science behind folk history from various places\u2014including northwest Europe and India\u2014and what it can tell us about environmental phenomena, from coastal drowning to volcanic erup-tions. These stories of real events were passed across the generations, and over thousands of years, and they have broad implications for our understanding of how human societies have developed through the millennia, and ultimately how we respond collectively to changes in climate, our surroundings and the environment we live in. \u2014 Provided by publisher. 2018.

Mad at the World: A Life of John Steinbeck DB108719 15 hours 46 minutesby William Souderread by David Colacci\"The first full-length biography of the Nobel laureate to appear in a quarter cen-tury, Mad at the World illuminates what has made the work of John Steinbeck an enduring part of the literary canon: his capacity for empathy. Angered by the plight of the Dust Bowl migrants who were starving even as they toiled to harvest California's limitless bounty and appalled by the country's refusal to recognize the humanity common to all of its citizens, Steinbeck took a stand against social injustice-paradoxically given his inherent misanthropy. A man by turns quick-tempered, compassionate, and ultimately brilliant, Steinbeck could be a difficult person to like. Obsessed with privacy, he was mistrustful of people. Next to writing, his favorite things were drinking and womanizing and getting married, which he did three times. And while he claimed indifference about success, his mid-career books and movie deals made him a lot of money. And yet Steinbeck also took aim at the corrosiveness of power, the perils of income inequality, and the urgency of ecological collapse. Steinbeck remains our great social realist novelist, the writer who gave the dispossessed and the disenfranchised a voice in American life and letters. Eloquent, nuanced, and deeply researched, Mad at the World captures the full measure of the man and his work.\" \u2014 Provided by publisher. Unrated. Commercial audiobook. 2020. Medicine and Health The Facemaker: A Visionary Surgeon's Battle to Mend the Disfigured Soldiers of World War I DB108939 8 hours 18 minutesby Lindsey Fitzharrisread by Daniel Gillies\"From the moment the first machine gun rang out over the Western Front, one thing was clear: mankind's military technology had wildly surpassed its med - ical capabilities. Bodies were battered, gouged, hacked, and gassed. The First World War claimed millions of lives and left millions more wounded and disfig - ured. In the midst of this brutality, how - ever, there were also those who strove to 83Adult Nonfiction Medicine and Health alleviate suffering. The Facemaker tells the extraordinary story of such an indi - vidual: the pioneering plastic surgeon Harold Gillies, who dedicated himself to reconstructing the burned and broken faces of the injured soldiers under his care. Gillies, a Cambridge-educated New Zealander, became interested in the nascent field of plastic surgery after encountering the human wreckage on the front. Returning to Britain, he established one of the world's first hospitals dedicated entirely to facial reconstruction. There, Gillies assembled a unique group of prac - titioners whose task was to rebuild what had been torn apart, to re-create what had been destroyed. At a time when losing a limb made a soldier a hero, but losing a face made him a monster to a society largely intolerant of disfigurement, Gillies restored not just the faces of the wounded but also their spirits. The Facemaker places Gillies's ingenious surgical inno - vations alongside the dramatic stories of soldiers whose lives were wrecked and repaired. The result is a vivid account of how medicine can be an art, and of what courage and imagination can accomplish in the presence of relentless horror.\" \u2014 Provided by publisher. Unrated.

Hundreds of studies had previously established a link between racial discrimination and the health of Black Americans, with little progress toward solutions. But Villarosa' s article exposing that a Black woman with a college education is as likely to die or nearly die in childbirth as a white woman with an eighth grade education made racial disparities in health care impos-sible to ignore. Now, in Under the Skin, Linda Villarosa lays bare the forces in the American health-care system and in American society that cause Black people to \"live sicker and die quicker\" compared to their white counterparts. Today's medical texts and instruments still carry fallacious slavery-era assump-tions that Black bodies are fundamen-tally different from white bodies. Study after study of medical settings show worse treatment and outcomes for Black patients. Black people live in dirtier, more polluted communities due to envi-ronmental racism and neglect from all levels of government.

Kooninread by Jay Aaseng\"You've heard all this presented as fact. But according to science, all of these statements are profoundly misleading. When it comes to climate change, the media, politicians, and other prominent voices have declared that \"the science is settled.\" In reality, the long game of telephone from research to reports to the popular media is corrupted by misun - derstanding and misinformation. Core questions\u2014about the way the climate is responding to our influence, and what the impacts will be\u2014remain largely unan - swered. The climate is changing, but the why and how aren't as clear as you've probably been led to believe. Now, one of America's most distinguished scien - tists is clearing away the fog to explain what science really says (and doesn't say) about our changing climate. In Unsettled: What Climate Science Tells Us, What It Doesn't, and Why It Matters, Steven Koonin draws upon his decades of experience\u2014including as a top science advisor to the Obama administration\u2014to provide up-to-date insights and expert perspective free from political agendas. Fascinating, clear-headed, and full of sur - prises, this book gives readers the tools to both understand the climate issue and be savvier consumers of science media in general. Koonin takes readers behind the headlines to the more nuanced sci - ence itself, showing us where it comes from and guiding us through the implica - tions of the evidence. He dispels popular myths and unveils little-known truths: despite a dramatic rise in greenhouse gas emissions, global temperatures actually decreased from 1940 to 1970. What's more, the models we use to predict the 86Adult Nonfiction\u2014Nature and the Environment, Science future aren't able to accurately describe the climate of the past, suggesting they are deeply flawed.

Unsettled is a reality check buoyed by hope, offering the truth about climate science that you aren't getting elsewhere\u2014what we know, what we don't, and what it all means for our future.\" \u2014 Provided by publisher.

A Natural History of North American Trees DB108971 17 hours 24 minutesby Donald Culross Peattieread by Mark Ashby\"\"A volume for a lifetime\" is how The New Yorker described the first of Donald Culross Peatie's two books about American trees published in the 1950s. In this one-volume edition, modern readers are introduced to one of the best nature writers of the last century. As we read Peattie's eloquent and entertaining accounts of American trees, we catch glimpses of our country's history and past daily life that no textbook could ever illuminate so vividly. Here you'll learn about everything from how a spe-cies was discovered to the part it played in our country's history. Pioneers often stabled an animal in the hollow heart of an old sycamore, and the whole family might live there until they could build a log cabin. The tuliptree, the tallest native hardwood, is easier to work than most softwood trees; Daniel Boone carved a sixty-foot canoe from one tree to carry his family from Kentucky into Spanish territory. In the days before the Revolution, the British and the colonists waged an undeclared war over New England's white pines, which made the best tall masts for fighting ships. It's fas-cinating to learn about the commercial uses of various woods \u2014 for paper, fine furniture, fence posts, matchsticks, house framing, airplane wings, and dozens of other preplastic uses. But we cannot read this book without the occasional lump in our throats. The American elm was still alive when Peattie wrote, but as we read his account today we can see what caused its demise. Audubon's portrait of a pair of loving passenger pigeons in an American beech is considered by many to be his greatest painting. It certainly touched the poet in Donald Culross Peattie as he depicted the extinc-tion of the passenger pigeon when the beech forest was destroyed. A Natural History of North American Trees gives us a picture of life in America from its earliest days to the middle of the last century. The information is always interesting, though often heartbreaking. While Peattie looks for the better side of man's nature, he reports sorrowfully on the greed and waste that have doomed so much of America's virgin forest.\" \u2014 Provided by publisher. 2007.

Nearly a hundred years after its publication, Kurt G\u00f6del's famous proof that every mathematical system must contain propositions that are true-yet never provable-continues to unsettle mathematics, philosophy, and computer science. Yet unlike Einstein, with whom he formed a warm and abiding friendship, G\u00f6del has long escaped all but the most casual scrutiny of his life. An intimate portrait of the scientific and intellectual circles in prewar Vienna and a vivid re-creation of the early days of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study, Journey to the Edge of Reason is the first biography to fully draw upon G\u00f6del's voluminous letters and writings-including a never-be - fore-transcribed shorthand diary of his most intimate thoughts-to explore his pro - found intellectual friendships, his moving relationship with his mother, his troubled yet devoted marriage, and the debilitating bouts of paranoia that ultimately took his life. It illuminates the mind-bending implications of G\u00f6del's revolutionary ideas for philosophy, mathematics, arti - ficial intelligence, and man's place in the cosmos.\" \u2014 Provided by publisher.

Two Wheels Good: The History and Mystery of the Bicycle DB109033 12 hours 54 minutesby Jody Rosenread by Amanda Carlin\"The bicycle is a vestige of the Victorian era, seemingly at odds with our age of smartphones and ride-sharing apps and driverless cars. Yet we live on a bicycle planet. Across the world, more people travel by bicycle than any other form of transportation. Almost anyone can learn to ride a bike\u2014and nearly everyone does. In Two Wheels Good, journalist and critic Jody Rosen reshapes our understanding of this ubiq-uitous machine, an ever-present force in humanity's life and dream life\u2014and a flash point in culture wars\u2014for more than two hundred years. Combining his-tory, reportage, travelogue, and memoir, Rosen's book sweeps across centuries and around the globe, unfolding the bicy-cle's saga from its invention in 1817 to its present-day renaissance as a \"green machine,\" an emblem of sustainability in a world afflicted by pandemic and cli - mate change. Readers meet unforgettable characters: feminist rebels who steered bikes to the barricades in the 1890s, a prospector who pedaled across the frozen Yukon to join the Klondike gold rush, a Bhutanese king who races mountain bikes in the Himalayas, a cycle-rickshaw driver who navigates the seething streets of the world's fastest-growing megacity, astronauts who ride a floating bicycle in zero gravity aboard the International Space Station. Two Wheels Good exam-ines the bicycle's past and peers into its future, challenging myths and clich\u00e9s while uncovering cycling's connection to colonial conquest and the gentrifica - tion of cities. But the book is also a love letter: a reflection on the sensual and spiritual pleasures of bike riding and an ode to an engineering marvel\u2014a won-drous vehicle whose passenger is also its engine.\" \u2014 Provided by publisher.

Public Faces, Secret Lives: A Queer History of the Women's Suffrage Movement DB109215 10 hours 37 minutesby Wendy L. Rouseread by Mary March\"The women's suffrage movement, much like many other civil rights movements, has an important and often unrecog-nized queer history. In Public Faces, Secret Lives Wendy L. Rouse reveals that, contrary to popular belief, the suf-frage movement included a variety of individuals who represented a range of genders and sexualities. However, owing to the constant pressure to present a \"respectable\" public image, suffrage leaders publicly conformed to gendered views of ideal womanhood in order to make women's suffrage more palatable to the public. Rouse argues that queer suffragists did take meaningful action to assert their identities and legacies by challenging traditional concepts of domesticity, family, space, and death in both subtly subversive and radically transformative ways. Queer suffragists also built lasting alliances and developed innovative strategies in order to protect their most intimate relationships, ones that were ultimately crucial to the suc-cess of the suffrage movement. Public Faces, Secret Lives is the first work to truly recenter queer figures in the wom - en's suffrage movement, highlighting their immense contributions as well as their numerous sacrifices..\" \u2014 Provided by publisher. 2022.

Actors, actresses, and even child stars were so at ease under his direction that they were able to deliver inspired and powerful perfor-mances. Academy Award-nominated director Clarence Brown (1890-1987) worked with some of Hollywood's greatest stars, such as Clark Gable, Joan Crawford, Mickey Rooney, Katharine Hepburn, and Spencer Tracy. Known as the \"star maker,\" he helped guide the acting career of child sensation Elizabeth Taylor (of whom he once said, \"she has a face that is an act of God\") and discovered Academy Award-winning child star Claude Jarman Jr. for The Yearling (1946). He directed more than fifty films, including Possessed (1931), Anna Karenina (1935), National Velvet (1944), and Intruder in the Dust (1949), winning his audiences over with glam-orous star vehicles, tales of families, communities, and slices of Americana, as well as hard-hitting dramas. Although Brown was admired by peers like Jean Renoir, Frank Capra, and John Ford, his illuminating work and contribu-tions to classic cinema are rarely men-tioned in the same breath as those of Hollywood's great directors. In this first full-length account of the life and career of the pioneering filmmaker, Gwenda Young discusses Brown's background to show how his hardworking parents and resilient grandparents inspired his entrepreneurial spirit. She reveals how the one-time engineer and World War I aviator established a thriving car deal-ership, the Brown Motor Car Company, in Alabama\u2014only to give it all up to follow his dream of making movies. He would not only become a brilliant director but also a craftsman who was known for his innovative use of lighting and composition. In a career spanning five decades, Brown was nominated for five Academy Awards and directed ten different actors in Oscar-nominated per-formances. Despite his achievements and influence, however, Brown has been largely overlooked by film scholars.

It was a mild May morning in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1862, the second year of the Civil War, when a twen-ty-three-year-old slave named Robert Smalls did the unthinkable and boldly seized a Confederate steamer. With his wife and two young children hidden on board, Smalls and a small crew ran a gauntlet of heavily armed fortifications in Charleston Harbor and delivered the valuable vessel and the massive guns it carried to nearby Union forces. To be unsuccessful was a death sentence for all. Smalls' courageous and ingenious act freed him and his family from slavery and immediately made him a Union hero while simultaneously challenging much of the country's view of what African Americans were willing to do to gain their freedom. After his escape, Smalls served in numerous naval campaigns off Charleston as a civilian boat pilot and eventually became the first black captain of an Army ship.

Afghanistan: A Military History from the Ancient Empires to the Great Game DB109203 20 hours 19 minutesby Ali Ahmad Jalaliread by Jared Zak\"Afghanistan: A Military History from the Ancient Empires to the Great Game covers the military history of a region encompassing Afghanistan, Central and South Asia, and West Asia, over some 2,500 years. This is the first comprehen - sive study in any language published on the millennia-long competition for dom-ination and influence in one of the key regions of the Eurasian continent. Jalali's work covers some of the most important events and figures in world military his - tory, including the armies commanded by Cyrus the Great, Alexander the Great, the Muslim conquerors, Chinggis Khan, Tamerlane, and Babur. Afghanistan was the site of their campaigns and the numerous military conquests that facilitated exchange of military culture and technology that influenced military developments far beyond the region. An enduring theme throughout Afghanistan is the strong influence of the geography and the often extreme nature of the local terrain. Invaders mostly failed because the locals outmaneuvered them in an unforgiving environment. Important segments include Alexander the Great, remembered to this day as a great victor, though not a grand builder; the rise of Islam in the early seventh century in the Arabian Peninsula and the monumental and enduring shift in the social and political map of the world brought by its conquering armies; the medieval Islamic era, when the constant rise and fall of ruling dynasties and the prevalence of an unstable security environment reinforced localism in political, social, and military life; the centuries-long impact of the destruction caused by Chinggis Khan's thirteenth century; early eighteenth century, when the Afghans achieved a remarkable military victory with extremely limited means leading to the downfall of the Persian Safavid dynasty; and the Battle of Panipat (1761), where Afghan Emperor Ahmad Shah Abdali decisively routed the Hindu confederacy under Maratha leadership, widely con-sidered as one of the decisive battles of the world. It was in this period when the Afghans founded their modern state and a vast empire under Ahmad Shah Durrani, which shaped the environment for the arrival of the European powers and the Great Game.\" \u2014 Provided by publisher. 2021. 92Adult Nonfiction\u2014World History River Kings: A New History of the Vikings From Scandinavia to the Silk Roads DB108193 9 hours 54 minutes by Cat Jarmanread by Kerry Dukin\"Follow an epic story of the Viking Age that traces the historical trail of an ancient piece of jewelry found in a Viking grave in England to its origins thousands of miles east in India.
