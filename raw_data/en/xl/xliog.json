NATURAL HISTORY OF VACCINATION ACTIVITIES A. Relation between disease incidence, vaccine coverage, and adverse reactions II. EFFICACY VERSUS EFFECTIVENESS A. Vaccine efficacy 1. The extent to which a vaccine prevents disease among vaccinated persons under ideal conditions a. Influenced by... (1) ability of vaccine to induce an immunologic response in the host(2) persistence of immunity in the host 2. Determination is ideally based on a randomized vaccine trial a. Random allocation to vaccine and \"placebo\" groups b. Double blind (1) Neither the investigator nor the vaccine recipient knows if he or she is receiving the vaccine or placebo c. Both groups should have the same inherent risk of disease, independent of vaccination status(1) Probability of contact with infectiv e cases should be equal for vaccinated and unvaccinated groups Figure 1 . Evolution of typical immunization program over time (see Chen and Orenstein, 1996, p. 102)-2-d. Example (UNETHICAL) B. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) 1. The extent to which a vaccine prevents disease among vaccinated persons in community 2. Most studies of vaccine efficacy are really measuring vaccine effectiveness 3. Usually not based on randomized trials a. Not ethical to inject persons with a known harmful agent b. Not ethical to withhold vaccines of proven benefit from the placebo group 4. Assessment most often based on non-experimental (or observational) studies a. Example One (historical cohort study) Figure 2 . Randomized clinical trial of vaccine efficacy.-3-b. Example Two (prospective and historical cohort study) C. Community effectiveness (CE) 1. The extent to which a vaccine prevents disease among all persons (i.e., both vaccinated and unvaccinated) at the community level 2. Influenced by... a. coverage (prop. of community that has been vaccinated) b. proper administration of vaccine (cold chain)c. ability of the vaccine to induce an immunologic response in the host Figure 3 . Historical cohort study of vaccine effectiveness. Figure 4 . Flow diagram of vaccine efficacy study (see Chen and Orenstein, 1996, p. 111)-4-d. persistence of immunity in the host e. ability of the investigator to accurately measure disease and immunization status 3. Often measured using a pretest-posttest-control type of evaluation design a. Change in disease incidence before and after a vaccination program in an intervention area as compared to a neighboring area with no vaccinationprogram b. Design Before Program After Vaccination area O1 XO2 Control area O3 O4 where O1-4 are observations (or surveys) made in the community with the vaccination program (O1 and O2) and in a non-vaccinated control area (O3 and O4), both before (O1 and O3) and after (O2 and O4) the vaccination program (X) was offered c. Measurement Before After Vaccination area O1 minus O2 = Ip,1 - Ip,2 Control O4 = Ip,3 - Ip,4 where Ip,1-4 is the incidence in the total population in each area before and after the vaccination program has taken place (1) If there is no change in disease incidence in the control area... Thus, the effectiveness of a vaccine program may be measured as...or more appropriately, the decline in the incidence rate relative to the \"before\" incidence. Thus the effectiv eness at the community level is often measured as...-5-d. Design assumes persons in both areas had the same probability of coming in contact with the disease agent (1) Since the disease is less likely to spread in the vaccinated area, the probability of contacting the agent is reduced (a) As a result, CE is biases in an upward direction (b) The lower probability of disease contact among susceptibles in a group with many immunes is termed \"herd immunity\" III. QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF VACCINE EFFECTIVENESS A. Incidence rates among vaccinated and unvaccinated 1. Onset of new cases of the disease of interest during a specified period of time among individuals identified by vaccination status a. May be referred to as \"attack rates\" (1) Another form of incidence rate(2) Term used when time period of interest is limited to the duration of an epidemic rather than some fixed period such as a year 2. Manner of identification of disease and vaccination status a. Interview (self-reported) (1) Most common approach b. Examination of subjects (1) Requires a knowledgeable field staff c. Examination of clinical records (1) Not always readily available d. Laboratory tests (1) May be too expensive for routine vaccine effectiveness assessment e. Immunological studies (1) Immuno-prevalence (a) Observe prevalence of disease antibody levels in population i) Serum (invasive) ii) Saliva (non-invasive) -6-(b) Provides historical view of past disease contact and proportion of the population that responded immunologically to the disease agent (2) Immuno-conversion (a) Observe the change in antibody levels over time i) Due to vaccinationii) Due to the disease of interestiii) Due to some other related diseaseiv) Due to time (i.e., waning of immunity with time) (b) Incident cases are identified as persons with a multiplicative rise in antibody titer over some specified period of timei) Based on serum, since not yet an option with salivaii) Often use four-fold increase as the criteriaiii) Change based on paired (i.e., two) sera (3) Requires laboratory support (a) May be too expensive for routine vaccine effectiveness assessment 3. Graphic relationship 4. Formula for Vaccine Effectiveness (VE) a. Measures the \"Prevented Fraction among the Vaccinated\" (PF v) (1) Proportion of the disease inciden ce among vaccinated persons which was prevented by vaccination Figure 5 . Prevented and preventable risk.-7-b. Measures the \"Preventable Fraction among the Unvaccinated\" (PFuv) (1) Proportion of the disease incidence among unvaccinated persons which is theoretically preventable by vaccination c. If study findings are reported as a \"risk ratio\" (i.e., Iv/Iuv)... (1) Formula for VE, PFv or PFuv is often reported as... Note: RR must be less than 1.0 (vaccination is \"preventive\") (2) Remember, these formulas only ap ply if the probability of coming in contact with the disease is identical in the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups B. Measure based on the Total Population Figure 6 . Graph of prevented risk in vaccinated. Figure 7 . Graph of preventable risk in unvaccinated. -8-1.Community Effectiveness (CE) of a Vaccination Program a. Incidence rates among vaccinated persons (Iv) or unvaccinated (Iuv) compared to the total population (Ip) b. Two measures of CE (fraction and cases) (1) Prevented fraction in population (PFp,v) (a) Graphic relationship (b) Indicates what proportion of new disease cases in the total population have theoretically been prevented by vaccination (c) Formula (d) Relationship to Vaccine Effectiveness where PPV = proportion of the population vaccinated (coverage) Figure 8 .

Graphic relationship b. Indicates what proportion of new dis ease cases in the total population are theoretically preventable if everyone in the population was vaccinated (1) Assumes everyone would have the same incidence of disease as those who were vaccinated c. Formula d. Relationship to Vaccine Effectiveness (VE) where PPV = proportion of the population which is vaccinated (i.e., coverage) Figure 9 . Graph of preventable risk in total population.-10-C. Relationship between PCV, PPV, and VE 1.Proportion of cases vaccinated (PCV) a. Formula (see Chen and Orenstein, 1996, p. 110) where, PPV and VE are as defined previously b. While this formula describes the rela tionships shown in the graph on p. 110 of the Chen and Orenstein article (1996), it is not useful in its present form (1) Knowing that some proportion of disease cases has not been vaccinated is of little relevance to policy- or decision-makers c. Note: the relationships in the above formula and those following in this section will hold true only if susceptible persons have had the same probability ofdisease contact as immune persons 2.Vaccine effectiveness (VE) a. Formula where PCV = proportion of the case s vaccinated and PPV is as defined above b. Very useful formula since it shows how two parameter estimates (i.e., PCV and PPV) can be combined to permit th e indirect assessment of vaccine effectiveness as actually occurred in a field setting (1) Not essential to measure Iv , Iuv , or Ip in the population (2)Proportion of population vaccinated (i.e., PPV) is derived in immunization surveys using the EPI \"30 x 7\" cluster sampling procedure(a) Procedure presented in EPI 418 Rapid Epidemiological Surveys in Developing Countries , Spring Quarter (3) Proportion of the Cases Vaccinated (i .e., PCV) is derived from a detailed interview of a sample of disease cases 3.Proportion of population vaccinated (PPV) a. Formula-11-where PCV and VE are as previously defined b. This formula is presented so that all three parameters (i.e., PCV, PPV, and VE) can be estimated by knowing the values of any two c. Should be used to estimate propor tion of the population which has been vaccinated with data from a disease monitoring program (see below) D. Example of Calculations 1. Nomogram Measles No measles Total Vaccinated Ratio = RR = Iv/Iuv= 0.0468 Vaccine Effectiveness = VE = 0.9532 Prevented Fraction in Population = PFp,v = 0.6196 Preventable Fraction in Population = PFp,uv = 0.8769 E. Do calculations using MS Excel and VE program Figure 10 . Relation between PPV and PCV (see Chen and Orenstein, 1996, p. 110) -12-1. Use both for calculations and sensitivity analysis a.

The operator must enter any two parameters (i.e., PCV, PPV, or VE) and the third parameter will be calculated by the program b. Most likely, PCV and PPV will be deri ved in a field survey and VE will be estimated using the above table 3. Formulas for table entries a.

Logic for PCV equation If the entry in cell B6 is greater than 0 (the operator has entered a number), then accept the value in cell B6, otherwise compute for cell B6 the value us ing the formula (B9-(B 9*B11))/(1-(B9*B11))-13-c. Graph (text included only for this example) IV. GENERAL PRINCIPLES FOR ASSESSMENT OF VACCINE EFFECTIVENESS A. Case definition 1. Use uniform definition for all cases B. Case ascertainment 1. Must be independent of vaccination status a. Equal effort is made to detect cases among vaccinated and unvaccinated persons C. Vaccination status ascertainment 1. Need to classify vaccination status prior to onset of disease or an outbreak D. Comparability of exposure 1. Vaccinated persons should have the same pr obability of contact with cases or other sources of the disease as persons not vaccinated V. SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT METHODS A. Establish a surveillance system for target diseases 1. This should always be done Figure 11 . Graph for program VE.xls (annotated text not included)-14-2. Require health workers to report all cases of the target diseases a. Teach primary health workers the signs and symptoms of the diseases of interest(1) Need to make sure that sensitivity a nd specificity of the diagnostic process is relatively high b. Require that the medical care staff in hospitals and clinics provide complete reporting 3. Determine Proportion of Cases Vaccinated (PCV) a. Interview cases (or other respondent) and determine vaccination history (1) Assume respondent has either a good memory or a home record of vaccinations b. Review clinic or hospital records of local cases seen in institutional settings (1) Assume vaccination record is included in the patient's folder 4. Determine Proportion of Population Vaccinated (PPV) a. Based on existing information from a vaccination team or the health center staff b. Conduct occasional Rapid Surveys (Spring Quarter, EPI 418, Rapid Epidemiological Surveys in Developing Countries ) 5. Derive Vaccine Effectiveness (VE) a. Use formula described previously ( VE.xls program) B. Create monitoring graph 1. This should always be done, but is much easier if a microcomputer and Excel are available 2. Components a. Measured variables (1) Monthly or quarterly (a) Proportion of disease cases that have been vaccinated (PCV) (2) Once or twice a year (a) Proportion of population that has been vaccinated (PPV) b. Estimated variable (1) Monthly or quarterly (a) Vaccine effectiveness (VE)-15-3. Graph a. By month or quarter for the administrative region of interest 4. Interpretation a. High vaccine effectiveness (VE) (1) If measurement error (a) Surveillance system underreports the vaccination status of disease casesi) PCV is artificially low, resulting in VE being artificially high (2) If lack of social mixing (a) Disease cases are very uncommon in the vaccinated group due to lack of social interaction between vaccinated and unvaccinatedpersonsi) PCV is artificially low, resulting in VE being artificially high (3) If accurate measurement (a) Desired outcome(b) Focus on improving vaccination coverage i) Supervision ii) Transportationiii) Supplies and equipment b. Low vaccine effectiveness (VE) (1) If measurement error (a) Cases report having been vaccinated when in truth they were not i) PCV is artificially high, resulting in VE being artificially low (b) Vaccination coverage is reported as being lower than it really is Figure 12 . Vaccination monitoring graph by quarter of year, XX state.-16-i) PPV is artificially low resulting in VE being artificially low (2) If accurate measurement (a) Undesirable outcome(b) Focus on improving vaccine effectiveness before trying to improve vaccination coveragei) Break in cold chainii) Poor administration of vaccineiii) Fault in production quality of vaccine C. Conduct a field investigation 1. This should occasionally be done, since it is costly and time consuming 2. Criteria to determine if an investigation can be successfully done a. Disease was at a minimal level in the area prior to the present outbreak (1) Few in the population of interest had developed natural, active immunity due to prior contact with the disease agent b. Vaccination records are available to help determine who was and was not vaccinated(1) Home immunization records (a) Held by mother or head of household (2) Clinic or hospital immunization records (a) Use to evaluate accuracy of respondents memory(b) May require considerable work if records are not easily accessible c. Both vaccinated and unvaccinated persons are present in adequate number in the population and are mixing so that the disease could spread(1) Otherwise cannot adequately assess the underlying disease rate in the two groups d. Cases of the disease were relatively common in the population (1) Both vaccinated and unvaccinated persons had similar opportunities for contact with infective cases 3. Define the eligible (i.e., \"target\") population a. Persons who, according to their age, should theoretically have been vaccinated b. Persons who, according to their age, should theoretically be susceptible to the disease if they had not been vaccinated and if they have not had the disease(1) No maternal immunity 4. Types of field investigations a. Acute outbreak (1) An excess number of cases during a short period of time in one setting such as a community or school (2) Study population = total eligible population b. Large-scale epidemic or endemic disease (1) An excess number of cases over time in larger populations-17-(2) Study population = cluster sample of eligible population (a) EPI \"30 x 7\" Cluster Sample (presented in EPI 418) (3) Determine both history of vaccina tion and post-vaccination disease status (a) If cases are common in the samp led population, can derive VE from the results of the survey (b) If cases are not common in the sampled population, extend the analysis to other cases in the to tal eligible population (derived via the surveillance system) and do a \"case-base\" analysis (seeAPPENDIX ) c. Secondary Attack Rate Studies (1) Criteria (a) Disease is epidemic or endemic and is transmitted person-to-person(b) Disease clusters in households or geographic clusters(c) Index case can be identified in households or clusters i) First case with the disease (d) Households or clusters have more than one child in the eligible population (e) Secondary cases can be identified in households or clusters i) New cases arising one incubation period after the index case brought the disease into the household or geographic cluster (2) Analysis (a) For all eligible persons in household or clusters other than the index case... i) Determine historical vaccination statusii) Determine recent target disease status (b) Derive I v and Iuv in the usual manner for all vaccinated and unvaccinated eligible people in the combined households orcombined clustersi) Exclude the index cases from each household in the analysis a) The index case brings the disease into the household d. Case-control Studies (1) The approach of choice when resources for conducting investigations are scarce(a) Since disease is relatively uncommon, community-based investigations of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons may requirea large sample population to derive stable estimates of theunderlying disease rates (b) Fewer persons need to be interv iewed or examined when using the case-control study design (2) Cases (a) Persons who recently became ill with the disease i) signs and symptomsii) laboratory confirmation-18-(b) Selected either during or at the end of the time period under consideration (3) Controls (a) Free of the disease and selected at the same time as cases i) Incidence-density type of case-control studyii) Not often feasible since the epidemic has already occurred by the time the investigation is started (b) Free of the disease and selected at the end of the time period under considerationi) Cumulative incidence type of case-control studyii) The usual method for selecting controls in studies of vaccine effectiveness (c) A sample of the source population of the cases selected at the end of the time period under considerationi) Case-base type of case-control study (see APPENDIX ) ii) The same persons may show up in both the case series and the control series iii) Not often done but preferable since the odds ratio (OR) is an unbiased estimator of the risk ratio (RR)a) Uncommon disease assumption is not required iv) Formulas for calculating variance estimates and confidence intervals are presented in EPI 200A-C (for epidemiology majors)-19-APPENDIX The case-base study is a form of case-control study, w ith controls being a sample of the total sources population of the cases rather than a sample of non-cases. Thus both cases and non-cases may appear in the control series. The statistical anal ysis is complicated by the lack of independence of cases and controls. This issue is addresses in EPI 200A-C.
