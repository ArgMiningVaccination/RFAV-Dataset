It is the responsibility of each student to support these values through maturity of thought, expression and action. Members of the faculty, staff and administration are av ailable to assist students in this process. THE ACADEMIC HONOR CODE AND CODE OF CONDUCT Academic life at Hood is guided by an honor system. The basic aims of the honor system are: to encourage and promote a trustful relationship among all members of the College community, to offer students the opportunity to exercise responsibilitie s and shared governance on campus and to make students more aware of their personal principles of honor. The academic Honor Code is shared between the faculty, administration and the students.

Furthe rmore, I pledge that I will read and make every effo rt to understand the concepts of the honor system.\" Social behavior is governed by the Code of Conduct. Violations of the Code of Conduct are adjudicated through the Office of Residence Life, the Dean of Student's Office, Depa rtment of Campus Safety and/or student review boards as appropriate to the violation. Academic integrity violations are adjudicated by the Academic Judicial Council (AJC), a board chaired by the dean of academic services and comprised of faculty, staff, and students.

Smaller language housing options attract students who are interested in a French, Germ an or Spanish living experience. A native speaking student liv es in the residence hall full time. Upper-class Honors Program students are also eligib le to reside in the Honors Housing community. Traditional-aged first-year students and sophomore students are required to live on campus and have roommates unless they are commuting from their parents' home within a 30-mile drive from campus.

These students begin taki ng Honors courses at the time of their entry into the program and exempt earlier Honors courses. Honors students may begin taking thei r upper-level Honors electives in the sophomore year. Because Honors electives are offered on a variable schedule, students who are particularly interested in a course are urged to take it the first time it is offered dur ing their eligible years. Students who take an upper-level Honors elective in their sophomore year are still required to take HON 201 and HON 202 during their sophomore year. Honors Experience in Junior and Senior Years Students in the Honors program will complete at least three Honors courses (or approved replacements) at the 300-level or above. At least one of those upper-level HON courses must be HON 470 Seminar. HON 470 may be repeated once under a different topic. Approved Replacements for Upper- Level Honors Elective Courses Students who study abroad for at l east one semester may count that experience as one of their upper-lev el Honors electives.

Our office understands financing higher education is an im portant part of the college experience. We offer personalized assistance to students and families to complete the necessary steps to apply for financial aid. Hood College offers the following ty pes of assistance: scholarships, grants, loans, and part-time employment (work-study). Scholarships are gift aid and no repayment is required Grants are gift aid and typically no repayment is required Loans are funds that are borrowed and must be repaid Work-study is a paycheck based on hours worked The Office of Financial Aid determ ines the types and amount of aid students may receive by evaluating the student's financial need and availability of funds. Awards may be made on a first-come, first-served basis to eligible students. Our o ffice highly recommends filing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (F AFSA) as it is required for most types of aid. By not filing the FAFSA , students are ineligible for need- based aid, federal loans, federal work-s tudy, and most types of state aid. Financial Award Package The Office of Financial Aid creates financial aid award packages for eligible students. Each student's fina ncial situation is different, so each package is unique. An award package will include one or more types of financial aid. The most common type s include scholarships, grants, loans and work-study. Students who qualify for fi nancial aid will be sent an award notification by mail or email. New students are sent an award notification after acceptance to the college. Continuing students will receive their award notifications by email beginning in May prior to the fall semester. To prevent delays in awarding of fi nancial aid, submit all required documentation as requested by the O ffice of Financial Aid in a timely manner. Check Self-Service for any requested information from our office. All financial aid forms are loca ted on the Financial Aid page of the Hood College website as well as in the office. Financial Need All need-based awards require the student to be degree-seeking, demonstrate financial need and main tain satisfactory academic progress (SAP). The number of credit hours enrolled also affects the types and amount of need-based aid awarded. To determine a student's financial need, the student must complete the FAFSA. Need for financial aid is determined by the following calculation: COA - EFC = Need COA (Cost of Attendance) is the to tal price of attending college. The COA consists of direct and indirect costs. Direct costs are what is paid directly to the college (such as tuiti on and fees; as well as room and meals if living on-campus). Indirect costs ar e expenses not paid directly to the college (such as books and supplie s, transportation, and personal expenses). The EFC (Expected Family Contribution) is a formula calculated by the U.S. Department of Education upo n completion of the FAFSA. Factors taken into consideration include, but are not limited to family size, number of students in college, income , and assets. For more information visit https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/. Students may begin filing the FA FSA October 1 for the following academic year, (this may be completed online or through the myStudentAid app). The FAFSA shoul d be submitted to Hood College (school code 002076) by our priority da te of March 1 to be considered for fall types of need-based aid. Institutional Aid Institutional aid (scholarships, grants , and awards) helps bridge the gap between a student's (family) resource s and the direct costs assessed by Hood College. Institutional funds are av ailable due to the generosity of alumni, foundations, individuals a nd other organizations. There are limited resources and Hood College reserves the right to make adjustments at any time. Institutional aid is only awarded to students pursuing their first baccalaureate degree. Students must be enrolled full-time (12 or more credit hours), unless specified by the donor that funds may be awarded to a part-time student(s). Institutional aid may not be used for summer courses. The maximum time-frame for institutional aid is eight semesters for first-time freshman and determined on a case-by-case basis for transfer students. To receive fina ncial assistance beyond the maximum time-frame, an appeal must be appr oved by the Office of Financial Aid. Merit Scholarships Hood College has developed an extens ive merit scholarship program that recognizes the achievement, talent an d potential of students. Awards are based upon the student's achievement in the classroom, ability to think analytically, talent and creativity with in areas of interest and the potential to be successful at Hood College.

Satisfactory Academic Progress Requirements for Financial Aid (SAP) Process Overview and Responsibilities In accordance with the U. S. Department of Education, the Office of Financial Aid at Hood College mon itors undergraduate and graduate students after the spring semester each academic year for successful completion of satisfactory academic progress (SAP) standards. For financial aid eligibility, terms are defi ned as fall, spring and summer. All students are measured on qualitative (g rade-based) and quantitative (time- based) standards. Student s who fail to meet SAP standards are not eligible for any financial aid unless an appeal is granted. Students who fail to meet SAP standards can only appeal one time and change their major one time. Programs affected by the SAP sta ndards include: Federal Pell Grant, Federal Direct Loans (Subsidized and Unsubsidized), Federal Plus Loans, Federal SEOG, Federal Work Study, st ate grants and scholarships, and institutional scholarships. Qualitative Standards (Grade-based) Qualitative standards measure a student 's quality of performance in terms of GPA, including basic skills course s (reading, writing, mathematics). Each semester a student must meet the following cumulative GPA standard: Total Hours Attempted Minimum GPA Requirement 1-25 1.50 GPA 26-38 1.60 GPA 39-50 1.70 GPA 51-63 1.90 GPA 64-124 2.00 GPA In order to graduate, a student must have a minimum GPA of 2.0. If a student fails to meet the above GPA requirements, he/she will be suspended from financial aid but will have the opportunity to submit an appeal. Quantitative Standards (time-based also referred to as PACE) In order to maintain financial aid eligibility, the U.S. Department of Education requires a student to successfully complete 67 percent of the credits for which he/she attempted as shown in the example below: Hood College Office of Financial Ai d calculates the pace at which you are progressing in your SAP academic plan by dividing the cumulative number of credits you have successfully completed by the cumulative number of credits you have attempte d. All periods of enrollment count when assessing quantitative standards, even periods in which the student did not receive financial aid. Pace= Cumulative number of credits that you have successfully completed Cumulative number of credits that you have attempted Unsatisfactory grades of F, INC, AU, F, S and U do not count as completed courses but will count as attempted credits. In addition, repeated coursework is counted as attempted hours for financial aid eligibility. Students can only receive fi nancial aid for a passed course one additional time. If the student register s for a previously passed course the third time, the course is ineligible fo r financial aid. Students are eligible up to 30 attempted hours for basic skills courses (reading, writing, mathematics) which are not counted in the quantitative standards. If a student exceeds 30 attempted hours w ithout successful completion, the student becomes ineligible for fina ncial aid and must pay for those courses prior to continuing at Hood College. Transfer credits that count toward the student's current program count as attempted and completed for financial aid eligibility. UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES| 33 Quantitative Standards (maximum timeframe) Students must be making progress towa rd a degree. To quantify academic progress, Hood College must set a maximum timeframe in which you are expected to finish a program. A student must complete his/her program of study within 150% of the length of the program. If a student needs additional time to complete the degr ee, the student may submit an appeal for financial aid. Students at Hood Co llege are expected to complete 124 credit hours to earn an undergraduate degree. Students are eligible to receive financial aid up to 186 atte mpted hours at Hood College (not including 30 credit hours for basic skills courses). If additional time is needed, students can submit an appeal to the Director of Financial Aid. Financial Aid Suspension Students are placed on financial aid susp ension if they do not meet one or both of the SAP standards. Hood Colle ge monitors SAP annually at the end of spring semester and students are notified accordingly. Students are not given a warning period since the process is monitored once per academic year. Students have the option to appeal for financial aid once they are on suspension. Appeals Process Students on financial aid suspension may appeal in writing to the Director of Financial Aid. Appeals must be su bmitted by July 1 in order to review for the upcoming fall semester. Stude nts must provide in writing the extenuating circumstance(s) why SAP was not made and submit any supporting documentation. The student must state how the situation has changed and what action will be taken in order to meet SAP standards at the next evaluation period (end of spri ng semester). If the appeal is for maximum timeframe, the Director of Financial Aid may request the student to submit an academic plan signed by his/her advisor. The Director of Financial Aid will notify the student if such documentation is needed for the appeal. The Director of Financial Aid will review the appeal and notify the student in writing within ten business days of the decision. All decisions made by the Director of Financial Aid are final. If the appeal is granted, students will be placed on financial aid probation for one semester and are expected to improve their SAP status by the end of the semester probation is granted. If, at that time, the student does not meet SAP standards, the student will be suspended from financial aid with no opportunity to appeal. If the stude nt is successful, the student will be removed from probation and placed in good standing for financial aid eligibility. In order to be successful , the student must meet cumulative GPA standards and maintain a 67% cumu lative passing rate. If the student is placed on academic plan and is fo llowing the plan, the student shall remain on probation until program comp letion and will be eligible for financial aid.

Endowed Undergraduate Scholarships The Office of Financial Aid evaluate s students on an annual basis for these scholarships.

MILITARY SCIENCE /ROTC Hood College offers the U.S. Army Reserve Officers' Training Program (ROTC) in association with the Milit ary Science Department of McDaniel College. See Course Offerings (p. 105) for more information. STUDY ABROAD PROGRAMS Hood students may study abroad in a pproved programs in virtually every part of the world. All students in tending overseas study should make application at least one year in a dvance of the proposed study. Students should consult with the Hood College Study Abroad Coordinator located in the Catherine Filene Shouse Ce nter for Career Development and Experiential Education as soon as they determine they wish to study abroad. The College encourages students to study abroad during the junior year. Some sophomores study abroad because of compelling program or personal reasons, and in rare instan ces the College permits seniors to study abroad in the fall semester. The College requires language majors to study abroad unless they reside for two years in one of the language houses. Language students ordinarily enroll in programs abroad that offer instruction in the local language. Hood has formal associations with se veral established overseas programs, including those offered by Junior Year France (Paris), Dickinson College (Toulouse), University of Seville, Seoul Women's University and the University of Mainz, among others. Students may also study abroad in short-term summer programs, such as the Bahrom International Program in Seoul, Korea. Grades received through Hood-affiliated semester or year abroad programs are calculated in the Hood GPA. Students participating in non-Hood affiliated semester or year abroad programs will earn transfer credit only for all courses completed with a grade of C- or above. THE HOOD COLLEGE HONORS PROGRAM A limited number of academically exceptional students are accepted into the Hood College Honors Program. Comb ining classroom instruction and co-curricular activities, the H onors Program offers a challenging academic experience and encourages both independent and collaborative learning. The program requirements are discussed in Majors and Courses of Study (p. 17). OFF-CAMPUS PROGRAMS AND COURSES PLEN Hood College encourages our female st udents to participate in the Public Leadership Education Network. P LEN offers exciting programs that allow Hood students to gain firsthan d experience shaping public policy in communities, the nation and the world. Students who enroll in PLEN's Women and Public Policy Internship Pr ogram learn about policy, research or social advocacy by working alongs ide women leaders in the Congress, courts, executive agencies and nongovernmental advocacy groups. Students may earn from 3 to 15 Hood Co llege credits for participation in PLEN's internship programs. Those who wish to complete a PLEN UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES| 39 internship must also meet Hood's re quirements for rnship eligibility. PLEN also offers three-day to thre e-week seminars on topics such as Women and Congress; Women in Sc ience and Technology; Women and International Policy; and Women, Law and Public Policy. For more information about any of PLEN's programs, contact the Center for Career Development and Experiential Education. The Washington Center Hood College partners with The Wa shington Center, which is an independent, nonprofit organizati on serving hundreds of colleges and universities in the United States and ot her countries by providing selected students challenging opport unities to work and lear n in Washington, D.C. for academic credit. The Washington Center offers two types of programs: Internships and academic se minars. Internships are semester- or summer-long integrated academic and work experiences in government, corporate and nonprofit orga nizations. Each internship is tailored to provide meaningful work experiences that will enhance students' resumes and help launch their careers. This is a \"study away\" opportunity where students may live in The Washington Center residence apartments. Additionally, students take academic courses and attend special programming during their time at The Washington Center. Academic seminars serve as intensive learning experiences with focus on specific topics, such as National Secu rity, the Presidency, and the Middle East Peace Process. Past seminars ha ve included visits to such locations as Capitol Hill, CNN, the Newseum, embassies and many others. Seminar events have featured such respect ed speakers as Ted Koppel, Andrea Mitchell, Howard Dean, and othe rs. Students pay Hood tuition and receive Hood financial aid for The Wa shington Center Program. Credits and grades earned are calculated in the Hood GPA. For more information and to begin th e application process, contact the Center for Career Developmen t and Experiential Education. Washington Semester Program Hood College cooperates with American University's Washington Semester Program, an arrangement th at provides priority access to Hood students who join 300 to 400 other students from across the country. Students may enroll in any of the units of the program: American National Politics Semester, Foreign Policy Semester, Justice Semester, Public Law Semester, Economic Policy Semester, Peace and Conflict Resolution Semester, Journalism Semest er, Museum Studies and the Arts Semester, International Business and Trade Semester and International Environment and Development Semester. The director and academic advisors of each unit help students plan their programs, including a seminar, an independent research proj ect and either an internship or a course at American University. Entrance requirements include a Grade Point Average of 2.5, second-semester sophomore status, a recommendation from the Hood faculty advisor to the program and selection by the director at American University. Credits (but not quality points) are transferable to Hood. Because financial arrangements for room, board and tuition differ from t hose at Hood, students are urged to consult with the Hood financial aid o fficer well in advance. Hood students need not file a petition with the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies to participate in the Washington Semester. Community College Exchange Full-time Hood students may take one course each semester at Carroll Community College (CCC) or Hage rstown Community College (HCC) without charge, provided that the cour se chosen is not offered at Hood during the academic year. See Academic Policies (p. 41) for more information on this program.

Hood graduates a pply for reinstatement as degree candidates through the Registrar's Office. THE HOOD COLLEGE CORE CURRICULUM The Core Curriculum is required of a ll students. All students admitted as a first-year student must fulfill th e Foundation and Methods of Inquiry areas of the core. Transfer students with an A.A., AAT or A.S. degree from an accredited institution in the State of Maryland are exempt from the Foundation and Methods of Inquiry areas of the Core with the exception of the Global Perspectives requirement which may be fulfilled with appropriate transfer courses. Students without the associate degrees mentioned, but transferring with at least 56 credits, and transfer students pursuing the B.S. in Computer Science or B.S. in Computational Science should refer to the core requirements information listed at the end of this section. Students pursuing the B.S. in Nursing, admitted with the A.S. are exempt from the Foundations and Methods of Inquiry areas, but must complete the Global Perspectives area of the Core. The purpose of the Core Curriculum is to provide students with the basic skills needed to pursue a liberal arts education, to expose them to a variety of modes of inquiry in different disciplines, and to promote critical reflection about global perspectives. Two parts comprise the Core Curriculum: Foundation (p. 40)and Methods of Inquiry (p. 41). FOUNDATION (19-22 CREDITS ) The Foundation section of the core presents the fundamental skills necessary to pursue a liberal arts education. Upon satisfactory completion of this requirement, students will be able to write with clarity in English; solve basic mathematical problems and demonstrate some ability to interpret and present numerical data; realize the relationship between physical activity and wellness, and be able to design at least one physical activity program for improving wellness; function successfully using the four skills (listening, speaking, read ing and writing) of a foreign language and develop awareness of a foreign culture. First-Year Seminar (3 credits) The ability to communicate well on a colle ge level is crucial to success at Hood. With that in mind, the First-Year Seminar program offers students an opportunity to sharpen academic reading and writing skills in small classroom settings. All first-year seminars are reading and writing intensive and will help students refine their abilities in these areas as well as in critical thinking, informa tion literacy and class discussion. Each seminar is limited to 15 students, which will allow class members to work closely with their professor and peers. The seminar topics have broad appeal while reflecting the varied interests and expertise of the faculty who teach them. All incoming first-year students are re quired to take a first-year seminar course during their first fall semester at Hood as a Core requirement. Students admitted to Hood prior to Fall 2015 and students admitted as transfers are exempt from the First Year Seminar core requirement. Students who withdraw or receive an F in a first-year seminar during the fall semester must take the first-year seminar in the spring in order to satisfy the Core requirement. Stud ents who fail or withdraw a second time will repeat the course again each spring until they pass the course. FYS 101 First-Year Seminar 3.0 English Composition (3-4 credits): English composition courses at Hood College give students a strong foundation in the writing skills they w ill need for future success. In these courses, students respond to a variety of reading and wr iting assignments, all designed to expand their critical reading skills and their ability to communicate ideas in clear, cohe rent, and persuasive writing. Composition courses emphasize freque nt writing and rewriting; courses may include classroom discussions, writing laboratories, and small group and individual conferences between students and instructors. Students will explore various writing contexts , purposes, and audiences. Students will learn grammar, sentence structure, and effective paragraph and essay development. Students will demonstrat e fluency in language, style, and source conventions. ENGL 100 Elements of Composition 4.0 ENGL 110- 139 Writing About Literature 3.0 A grade of C- or above is required to fulfill the Composition requirement. Quantitative Literacy (3-4 credits) (QL) is a habit of mind. It involves using elementary mathematical tools to interpret and manipulate quantitati ve data arising in a variety of contexts. It is marked by computa tional fluency, and by competence and comfort in working with numerical data. Those who are quantitatively literate can create arguments supported by data and can communicate those arguments in many ways - us ing tables, graphs, mathematical expressions, and words. A course that satisfies the QL section of the Core Curriculum should have as its main focus the use of mathema tics to solve real-world problems. In those courses, using data and a ppropriate technology, students will collaborate to solve multi-step pr oblems and effectively communicate their reasoning to others ECMG 212 Statistics for Economics & Management 3.0 ENSP 103 Intro to Geographic Information Systems 4.0 MATH 111 Mathematics Everywhere 3.0 MATH 112 Applied Statistics 3.0 MATH 112W Workshop Statistics 3.0 MATH 201 Calculus I 4.0 MATH 213 Statistical Concepts and Methods 4.0 PSY 211 Elementary Statistics 3.0 SOC 261 Quantitative Methods for the Social Sciences 3.0 Foreign Language (8 credits): Completion of an elementary (101 and 102) Arabic, French, German or Spanish course sequence or exemp tion through a placement test.

A \u00bd credit of exemption will be granted for completing each of the following courses: MSCI 101, MSCI 102, MSCI 201, MSCI 202. METHODS OF INQUIRY (25-28 CREDITS ) There are seven areas within Methods of Inquiry. These include: Literary Analysis, Visual and Performing Ar ts, Scientific Thought, Historical Analysis, Social and Behavioral Analysis, Philosophical Inquiry and Global Perspectives. Courses designated as GP fulfill both Global Perspectives and the Methods of Inquiry area under which they are listed. The seven Methods of Inquiry categories are: Global Perspectives (3 credits) Students will take one 3- or 4-credit course designated as GP and these courses may fulfill other core or major requirements.

Petition forms are available in the Office of the Registrar and online. ACADEMIC HONOR CODE All Hood undergraduates affirm on each class assignment that they \"have neither given nor received any unauthorized aid.\" Cheating or plagiarism\u2014any unacknowledged use of another person's language or ideas\u2014is thus both an affront to the general standards of conduct on which an intellectual community depe nds and a specific violation of the Honor Code. As such, these offenses are treated seriously and may lead to severe disciplinary action, including di smissal from the College. For a full description of the policies and proce dures of the Honor Code, contact the dean of Academic Services. Students wishing advice on the pr oper use and acknowledgement of scholarly materials should consult th eir individual instructors, Writing Center, the library staff and any of th e several reliable guides to scholarly writing that these sources may recommend. Copyright Statement Hood College affirms the obligation of its faculty, staff, and students to comply with all Federal copyright laws (Title 17, United States Code). Copyright law gives copyright holders (writers, publishers, artists, etc.) exclusive rights to distribute, copy, perform, or publicly display, their own original works. The College recognizes its obligation to promote the rights and responsibilities granted under this law. Hood College assumes that any questions regarding copyright , as they apply to materials for instructional or other College use, wi ll be resolved pr ior to the use of those materials on College-owned e quipment or in College-sanctioned activities. As members of an institution with an established Honor System emphasizing intellectual integrity, the Hood College community should recognize their responsibility to follow the law and to model it for others. All members of the College community are responsible for complying with College guidelines regarding the legal use of copyrighted materials, regardless of their format or the purpo se for which they are used, and for complying with the requirements of copyright law, including obtaining required permissions to use copyrighted materials. Members of the Hood community who willfully disregard copy right law do so at their own risk and assume any liability, which may include criminal, and/or civil penalties. In addition, disciplinary act ion may be taken as outlined a) for students, in the Bylaws of the Stude nt Government Association (Judicial System), b) for faculty, in the Faculty Code (Termination or Sanctions for Cause), and c) for staff, in the Staff Handbook (Section 405.3). Peer-to-Peer File Sharing Uploading or downloading works prot ected by copyright without the permission of the copyright owner is an infringement of the copyright owner's exclusive rights of reproduc tion and/or distribution. Anyone found to have infringed a copyrighted work may be liable for statutory damages up to $30,000 for each work infringed and, if willful infringement is proven, liability ma y be increased up to $150,000 for each work infringed. An infringer of a work may also be liable for the attorney's fees incurred by the copyright owner to enforce his or her rights. The files distributed over p eer-to-peer networks are primarily copyrighted works, and there is a risk of liability for downloading material from these networks. Ther e are currently many \"authorized\" services on the Internet that allo w consumers to purchase copyrighted works online, whether they be music, e-books, or motion pictures. By purchasing works through authorized services, consumers can avoid the risks of infringement liability. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act The DMCA is a response to concerns regarding the pirating and distribution of digital materials, a nd it helps to clarify how copyright relates to those materials. The DMCA criminalizes the development of technologies intended to circumvent devices (such as passwords or encryption) that limit access to copyrighted material, and it also criminalizes the act of circumven tion itself. Institutions of higher education that act as Internet Serv ice Providers (such as Hood College) are granted limited liability for copyr ight infringement involving the use of their networks if they take steps to designate a local agent to receive notices regarding instances of infri ngement over the local network and for effecting a \"take-down\" of the infringing material. The Library Director will provide contact informati on for Hood's Take-Down Officer. ACADEMIC HONORS Commencement Honors Commencement Honors are awarded to graduating seniors who have achieved the following composite average at the time of graduation (see The Hood College Grade Point Average and The Composite Average located under Grades (p. 47)): Summa Dean's List recognizes degree- seeking students who completed at least 6 semester hours of Hood work (or who have received permission to study abroad or away for a semester) and achieved a 3.5 or above semester GPA Students who have ou tstanding incomplete grades for the semester are not eligible. ACADEMIC STANDING AND CLASSIFICATION Classification Freshman: fewer than 25 credits earned. Sophomore: 25-55 credits earned. Junior: 56-86 credits earned. Senior: 87 or more credits earned. Academic Standing Students are in good academic standing when both the semester and cumulative Grade Point Averages (G PAs) are at least 2.0. Hood makes every effort to assist students to main tain this academic standard. It is the student's responsibility to take advantage of the College's academic, health and psychological counseling se rvices as a means of overcoming problems impeding progress. UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES| 45 At the end of each semester the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies examines the records of those students who have earned a semester or cumulative average below 2.00, and examines the records of students previously placed on academic warning or probation. Academic action by the Committee is based not only on the academic record, but includes input from the offices of Re sidence Life, Accessibility Services, Student Life, the Center for Acad emic Achievement and Retention (CAAR) and students' instructors and a dvisors, regarding issues such as attendance and completion of assign ed coursework, and matters from outside the classroom that may have affected students' academic success. Based on all the information, students will be placed on academic warning, academic probation, or be dismissed from the College. ( Note: While the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies examines students' semester and cumulative grade point averages, individual academic departments also review the grade point averages of students in their majors at the end of each semester. Based on their review, departments may take action concerni ng students' standing within their majors if students do not meet the academic standards set for each major. Departmental reviews of students' standing in their majors operate independently from the end-of-semes ter records reviews conducted by the Committee of Academic Standards and Policies.) Academic Warning Students will be placed on academic warning if their semester Grade Point Average (GPA) falls below 2.00 and/or the end-of-semester review of students' records by the Comm ittee on Academic Standards and Policies raises concern about st udents' overall academic progress. Students placed on warning will be informed of their status in a letter copied to their academic advisor. If they are placed on academic warning, students are encouraged to meet w ith their advisors immediately to consider how best to improve their future academic performance. Possible steps to take may include, but are not limited to, adjusting students' future schedules to ensure a manageable workload, contacting the Center for Academic Achievement and Reten tion (CAAR) to identify helpful resources, developing better time-m anagement and study strategies, and/or speaking with individual instructors about ways to succeed. Students whose Grade Point Average remains below 2.00 for more than one semester may be required to co mplete the Academic Success Program through the office of student success lo cated in CAAR and/or enroll in GNST 101 as determined by the Comm ittee on Academic Standards and Policies. Students will be informed of such additional requirements in a letter copied to their academic advisor. At the end of each semester, the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies will review the records of students on academic warning. On the basis of this review, the commi ttee may recommend an end to the warning period, continued warn ing, or academic probation. Academic Probation Students will be placed on academic probation if their cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA) falls below 2.00 and/or the end-of-semester review of students' records by the Comm ittee on Academic Standards and Policies raises concerns about st udents' overall academic progress. Academic probation means that a student is in danger of being dismissed from the College for academic reasons. Students placed on academic probation must make satisfactory prog ress, as defined in the probation letter sent to students, during the following semester or risk being dismissed from the College. Students on academic probation will be required to demonstrate significant academic improvement and to earn a semester Grade Point Average high enough to allow for a cumulative G.P.A. above a 2.00 within two semesters. Progress toward this goal will be reviewed by the committee at the end of each probationary semester. Students must also complete the Academic Success Program through the office of student success located in CAAR and enroll in GNST 101 (if they have not already completed this course). Additionally, student s on probation may not register for more than 14 credits, including GNST 101, without permission from the Committee on A cademic Standards and Policies. (Note: If students on probation are not enrolled in GNST 101, they may not take more than 12 credits in a given semester.) Students who are placed on Academic Probation will be required to sign a copy of the probation letter, indica ting that they understand the probation terms and that they agree to assu me responsibility for their academic status by attending classes regular ly, completing assignments on time, using course, mathematics and compos ition tutoring services and/or doing whatever is appropriate to resolv e their specific academic problems. At the end of each semester, the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies will review the records of st udents on probation to determine if students have met the proba tionary requirements and, on the basis of this review, may recommend an end to th e probationary period, continued probation, or dismissal from the College. Academic Dismissal Upon recommendation of the Commi ttee on Academic Standards and Policies, the College may at any time dismiss a student who is not making satisfactory academic progress as define d below. This policy applies to all students. In addition to the above-sta ted information considered by the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies in its academic reviews of students' records, the Committee will also use the following guidelines when considering whether to dismiss students from the College: 1. Students whose cumulative Grade Point Averages (G PA) fall below the following levels will be dismissed: Total Semester Hours Attempted* Minimum Cumulative Hood GPA Less than 30 credits 1.75 30 or more credits 2.00 *Credits attempted include all tr ansfer credits accepted by Hood. However, grade point averages listed in this table are based on Hood work only. 2. The College reserves the right to dismiss at any time any students who fail to meet minimal standards requi red to make satisfactory academic progress. Examples of failure to meet these standards may include, but are not limited to, ceasing to attend cla sses, disrupting the life and work of the College community or completing any semester with a term grade point average below 1.00. This polic y applies to all students, including first-semester first-year students. All students dismissed from the College will receive a dismissal letter which includes a description of th e appeals process and deadlines. 3. Students who are dismissed from th e College may not enroll in classes as a non-degree-seeking student. Dismissal Appeals Appeals for exemption from dismissa l may be granted by the provost and dean of the faculty in unusual circ umstances and following consultation 46| HOOD COLLEGE 2019-2020 CATALOG with the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies, the student's instructors and advisor and othe r relevant offices. Appeals for reinstatement following dismissal must be received within one week of electronic notification of dismissal. Ty pical grounds for an appeal are: 1) That an error has been made in the calculation of a student's grade; 2) That at the time of considering a student's record the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies di d not have knowledge of significant information bearing on a student's academic performance, such as a family or medical issue. The Committee will not question professors' judgment as to the quality of stude nts' work or the standards that professors set for academic performance. All appeals must include discussion of specific steps that students will take to achieve academic success in the future. Hood College is committed to the success of all students; the challenges of extenuating personal circumstances will be factored into every decision on dismissal and appeal. Students whose appeals are granted w ill be readmitted to the College for one semester on a probationary basi s. Failure to comply with the conditions specified in the letter allowi ng students to return to the College will result in their dismissal at the end of the probationary semester. Dismissal and Reinstatement Students who are dismissed from the Co llege may not enroll in classes as a non-degree-seeking student. Student s who are dismissed for academic reasons may petition for reinstatement after completing a minimum of one full-time semester at another accre dited institution and receiving no grade below a C. The following is the procedure for possible reinstatement: 1) The student writes to the registra r to request permission to return to Hood. 2) The student provides transcripts of work attempted elsewhere or other pertinent information. 3) The Committee on Academic St andards and Policies reviews the request and makes a decision regarding reinstatement. 4) A student who is reinstated w ill be placed on academic probation. Reinstatement does not automatically reinstate financial aid. The student must notify the Office of Financial Aid. If a student is dismissed for nonacademic reasons, the student must request in writing to the dean of stude nts' permission to return to Hood. The dean of students decides if the student may be reinstated. Financial Aid Implications Financial aid recipients are require d to be in good academic standing and maintain satisfactory academic progress toward degree requirements. Please refer to the financial aid section of the catalog for financial implications. ATTENDANCE AND ABSENCE The College does not set a maximum number of absences permissible in any course. Individual faculty members have the prerogative to establish a maximum number of absences at the beginning of the semester and are encouraged to include a written stat ement of their attendance policy on the course syllabus. Students accept full responsibility for seeing that work does not suffer from excessive absence. The College recognizes that there ar e other justifiable reasons for class absence: observance of religious holidays or participation as a representative of the College in athletic contests or cultural performances. Such absences are acceptable only if pr evious absences are not excessive and if the student has made arrangement s with the instruct or, prior to the day of the absence, for the work missed. Limits/Restrictions: Students must attend the first-cla ss meeting of each of their courses or notify the instructor or the Regi strar's Office of their absence, or risk being withdrawn from the class with a grade of WX. Enrollment in a course constitute s an informal contract with the instructor, and a student who viol ates an instructor's attendance policy risks dismissal from the course. Instructors may have a student withdrawn from a class and a gr ade of WX recorded up until the deadline for course withdrawal. Afte r the course withdrawal deadline has passed, the student receives a grade of F. A student who is dismissed from a course for excessive absences or who is withdrawn from the class for failing to appear at the first-class meeting may be reinstated only by the joint consent of the course instructor and the registrar. Classes are held up to the date and hour preceding vacations and they resume promptly after the recess in accordance w ith the academic calendar. Students are expected to at tend classes meeting just prior to and immediately following holiday periods. Students are fully responsible for making up work missed due to class absence. When students are absent, they are responsible for obtaining lecture notes from re liable sources. Assignments and projects are to be delivered to th e instructor on the assigned date, even when the student does not atte nd class. All exams are to be taken at the scheduled time. Havi ng another exam scheduled on the same day is not considered suffic ient justification for rescheduling the exam. The College requires instructors to in form the director of The Josephine Steiner Center for Academic Achiev ement and Retention of students who demonstrate erratic attendance patterns. This is not done to penalize the student but rather to ensure that Co llege officials can assist students in making consistent progress toward the degree. AUDIT With instructor permission, a student may enroll in most lecture courses as an auditor. As the term implies, auditors listen rather than engage in class discussions and projects. Audito rs attend class regularly but do not write papers or take exams or quizzes. Limits/Restrictions: The student receives neither credit, grade nor grade points for an audit; however, the audit does appear on the transcript. There is no limit on the number of courses that a student may audit during a semester. If the audited cour se or courses cause a student to exceed 18.5 credits, the excess credits will be billed by the undergraduate per-credit-hour fee. It is not possible to audit courses such as creative writing, painting, drawing, labs and other courses where the nature of the activity requires the participation of the student. Students may enroll on a noncredit basis in such courses by paying the current per-credit-hour fee. No changes to or from the audit option may be made after the end of drop/add period. A student may take for credit, at a later time, a course that was previously audited. UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES| 47 Part-time students pay a reduced audit fee to audit a course. See Tuition, Fees and Other Charges (p. 29) CREDITS Following the guidelines of the United States Department of Education and using the Carnegie unit of measure for assigning credits to its undergraduate and graduate course s, Hood defines a credit hour as representing one 50-minute hour of class work and at least two to three hours of student preparation in a given subject per week throughout the semester. Credits Faculty instruction Class Minutes/Hours per Semester Student Preparation 1 50 minutes 750 minutes (12.5 hours) 120 minutes 2 100 minutes 1,500 minutes (25 hours) 240 minutes 3 150 minutes 2,250 minutes (37.50 hours) 360 minutes 4 200 minutes 3,000 minutes (50 hours) 480 minutes One credit of supervised laboratory or studio classes require a minimum of 30 hours, of 50 minutes each. DOUBLE -NUMBERED COURSES AND UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT IN GRADUATE COURSES Certain courses have been designate d as appropriate for both graduate students and undergraduates . These \"double-numbered courses\" are identified by numbers in both the 400 and 500 range. Undergraduate students enroll in the 400-level course and receive undergraduate credit. Graduate students enroll in the 500-le vel course and receive graduate credit. Syllabi for such courses will clearly outline different expectations for graduate and undergraduate st udents. Students who took a double- numbered class at the 400-level as an undergraduate student may not take the same class at the 500-level as a graduate student for credit. Undergraduate students must meet di fferent performance standards from the graduate students. These differen ces may relate to the quality and/or quantity of work required and may al so involve measures of grading. To be eligible to take a 400/500-level course, undergraduate students must have a cumulative Grade Point Average of 2.0 or better and have earned at least 56 credits, including 12 credits or more at the 200 level or above in the course discipline. To be eligible to take a 500-level graduate course and receive undergraduate credit, Hood undergraduate stude nts must have earned senior status (87 credits) including 12 credits or more at the 200 level or above in the course discipline; have a cumulative Grade Point Average of 3.0 or better; have a Grade Point Average of 3.0 or better in the major area of study; and complete a petiti on, verified and approved by the registrar, the advisor, and the instru ctor. Credit will count only toward the undergraduate degree. To be eligible to take a 500-level graduate course and receive graduate credit, Hood undergraduate student s must have earned a minimum of 109 credits and meet the requirements indicated above. Credit will not apply toward th e 124 credits required for the undergraduate degree unless approved for a designated Dual Degree program. FINAL EXAMINATIONS Instructors give final examinations in all courses except those in which special assignments are more appropria te. Instructors inform students of final examination policy at the beginning of the term. Final exam dates are listed in the official Academic Calendar, and students' travel plans must take the dates of scheduled exams into account. No student may reschedule a final examination in or der to leave or travel early. In accordance with the Hood College Honor Code, the student may not discuss any final examination in an y way with anyone during the final examination period. Final examinations may not be given prior to the start of the designated examination period. No student will be required to complete three exams in one day. Students will be directed to the department in which the third exam is scheduled to arrange for an alternate day and time . Arrangements must be made prior to the beginning of exam week. FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS Grades, transcripts, future registrations and diplomas will be withheld until the student has paid all tuition, fees and other bills incurred at the College, and has returned all library books. GRADES Grading Criteria Hood's faculty uses the following genera l criteria in determining grades. Demonstration of the ability to write and speak standard English is included in the grade evaluation of every course. The criteria upon which students will be evaluated is in cluded on every course syllabus. A, A- (90-100) indicates general excellence; the student displays initiative, independence and ofte n originality in the course. B+, B, B- (80-89) indicates an unquestioned grasp of the subject's fundamental facts and principles, an understanding of their significance and an ability to use them effectivel y; work is logically organized and technically correct; the student of ten shows initiative and independent work. C+, C, C- (70-79) indicates the student has a fairly accurate knowledge of the subject's fundamental facts and pr inciples and is able to apply them reasonably well; work is fairly logical in organization and technique but it is incomplete; there is evidence of growth in handling the coursework. D+, D, D- (60-69) indicates work is of infe rior quality yet deserving of credit; there is some acquaintance wi th basic facts and principles, but work is poorly organized and technica lly faulty; the student frequently fails to complete assignments. F (0-59) indicates work shows no grasp of basic facts and principles and is not deserving of credit; it is poorly organized and technically faulty; the student frequently fails to complete assignments. S indicates satisfactory completion of work done on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory basis; perfor mance is at a C- level or better. U indicates unsatisfactory completion of work done on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory basis and not deserving of credit; performance is at a D+ level or lower. 48| HOOD COLLEGE 2019-2020 CATALOG INC indicates incomplete work in a c ourse because of illness or serious emergency beyond the student's contro l; students must arrange to finish assignments in accordance with the College's incomplete grade policy. Grade Appeal Grade appeals of the final course grade must be filed in a timely manner. Students must contact the faculty me mber involved no later than the end of the first week of the semester follo wing the filing of the disputed grade. If the issue is not satisfactorily reso lved, the department chair must be contacted within 30 days of the begi nning of the semester. Appeals to the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies must be initiated by the last day prior to midsemester recess of the semester following the filing of the disputed grade. A Final Grade A ppeal, available in the registrar's office and online, must be comple ted and submitted with all required documents before the Committee cons iders the petition. A delay in the filing of a grade appeal constitutes su fficient reason for denial of the appeal by the Committee. The Committee on Academic Standards and Policies will screen out frivolous or unsubst antiated appeals and will consider legitimate appeals that fall into the following categories: Miscalculation of a grade; or, Assignment of a grade to a particul ar student by application of more exacting requirements than were app lied to other students in the same course. Assignment of a grade on some ba sis other than performance in the course. All parties to the grade appeal (student , instructor, chairperson, registrar, committee members) are to maintain strict confidentiality until the matter is resolved. Grade Changes Instructors have the right to change a grade if they have made an error in computing or recording a student's grade. Instructors must notify the Registrar's Office in writing of the error within thre e weeks after the grades have been issued. Grade ch anges due to a computational or recording error discovered after the deadline, and requests for grade changes for any other reasons, must be submitted by the instructor in writing to the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies. Final and Midterm Grades Hood releases final and midterm grades electronically to the student and the student's advisor through Self-Ser vice. Final and midterm grades will be forwarded to parents/guardians of first-year student s who have signed a release form sent to them the summer before they enter Hood. Satisfactory/Unsatis factory Grade Plan Hood provides an alternate grade pl an as a means of encouraging intellectual curiosity. Under the satisfactory/unsatisfactory option, students receive a grade of \"S\" and credit for work of \"C-\" caliber or better or a grade of \"U\" and no credit for work of \"D+\" or lower quality. Neither grade is computed in th e cumulative grade point average. Limits/Restrictions: Students may not choose the S/U option for any course used to satisfy the Core, in the major field, the minor field or an independent study. If a course is only offered for S/U credit, this policy does not apply. Students may choose the S/U option for a maximum of 12 satisfactory/unsatisfactory credits within the total 124 credits Hood requires for graduation. Students spending three years at Hood may choose the S/U option for only 9 satisfactory/unsatisfactory credits to meet graduation requirements; tw o years, 6 credits; one year, 3 credits. Courses only offered for S/U credit are not counted in these totals. At registration, students indicate th eir intent to take a course on the satisfactory/unsatisfactory plan on the course and schedule card. Change from one grading plan to another must have the advisor's approval and must occur before the end of the drop/add period. No changes to or from the satisfactory/unsatisfactory grading system may be made after the drop/add period. Students are cautioned that some graduate and professional schools and employers look negatively at satisfactory/unsatisfactory on transcripts because actual performance or mastery of the subject has not been demonstrated. GRADE POINT AVERAGES (GPA) The average that appears on all tran scripts and grade reports is the average of all grades earned at H ood or through Hood affiliated semester or year abroad programs. Accepted transfer credit is included in the earned credit total and is applied toward the 124-credit degree requirement, but the quality hours a nd quality points earned at another institution are not calculated in the Hood average. Students participating in a non-Hood affiliated semester or year abroad/away will earn transfer credit for all courses completed with a grade of C- or above. Each grade received at Hood on the A-F grading scale has no quality points include: AU, S, U, INC, Z, TR, W By computing the quality points recei ved for each letter grade, students can ascertain their averag e or grade point average. For example, a grade of \"C\" in a 3-credit course earns 6 qual-ity points. Add the number of quality points earned in each course to learn the quality point total. Divide the quality point total by the total number of credits (in courses which have letter grades) and the result is the Grade Point Average (GPA). The Composite Grade Point Average The composite Grade Point Average is the average of all college work attempted. All grades earned at Ho od and those completed at other institutions are calculated, regardless of whether the course credit was accepted for transfer. The composite average is used to determine eligibility for various honor societies as well as determining Commencement honors. The Major Average An academic department may refuse to accept as a major a student whose GPA falls under 2.0 in the discipline. The department may require a student who has declared a major to drop the major if the student's G.P.A. falls below 2.0. Note: GPA requirements may vary by major. UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES| 49 GRADUATION AND COMMENCEMENT PARTICIPATION GRADUATION Students must take ultimate responsibility for academic planning\u2014of each semester, of each academic year and of degree completion. The Self- Service Degree Progress Report provides all students and advisors with an accurate list of core and major requirements required for the degree. The Registrar's Office begins monitoring degree progress in the spring of the student's junior year. Students must me et with their faculty advisors on a regular basis to review degree re quirements and plan senior year registrations. Seniors must complete the Application for Graduation in the fall of the senior year. Bachelor de grees are awarded in January, May and September. COMMENCEMENT PARTICIPATION Students who have completed all degr ee requirements by the date grades are due for the second semester may participate in the May commencement. Students graduating in January part icipate in the May commencement ceremony. Students completing de gree requirements in September participate in the May ceremony the following year. Students may not participate in commencement unless all degree requirements and all financial obligati ons to the College have been met. INCOMPLETE GRADE POLICY When serious illness or emergency prevents a student from completing the work for a course, instructors may allow additional time to finish assignments. Incompletes are not substitutes for failure to attend classes or to complete assigned work. Forms can be found in the Office of the Registrar or online. Limits/Restrictions: 1. The student must file an applica tion for an incomplete grade with the registrar's office no later than the last day of classes. 2. An incomplete may not be grante d unless a student has completed at least half the work of the course. 3. The student's progress in the cour se must be passing (D- or above) at the time the incomplete is requested. 4. The registrar must approve a notation of incomplete and record an INC on the student's permanent record. After the instructor assigns a grade, an \"I\" remains permanently on the record with the final grade earned beside it. 5. The date agreed upon for completi on of all assignments may not be later than March 15 for fall seme ster and October 15 for spring or summer semester. Any request for ex tension of an incomplete grade must be submitted by the student to the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies. 6. Work not completed by the deadlines stated above will convert to a grade of zero unless an extension is approved by the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies. 7. Students who register for a subseque nt semester with more than three credits of incomplete outstanding will have their schedules reviewed and their enrollment registration potentially restricted by the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies. As a result of this review, the Committee may limit the course load that a student is permitted to undertake in the subsequent semester. INDEPENDENT STUDY AND X-C REDIT Independent study includes directed readings; conferences with a supervising instructor; and papers, re ports and/or exams. Two kinds of independent study are available at Hood: regular (designated by the course number 375) and X-credit. Regular independent study consists of a project designed by a student and approved by a faculty advisor with whom the student will work closely during the semester. The number of credits may vary from 1 to 3 according to departmental policies and the design of the independent study. The subject chosen may not dup licate any course offered during the period of the student's enrollment at Hood. Registration procedures and deadlines for regular independent study are the same as for all departmental courses. X-credit independent study also is designed by the student and approved by a faculty advisor. However, the s ubject matter must be related to a class in which the student is enro lled. X-credit independent study is, therefore, added to the student's schedule after the beginning of the semester (but no later than the sixth week) and is limited to one credit. The grade for the X-credit is independe nt of the grade for the course to which it is related. Before registering for regular or X-credit independent study, students should refer to the statement on credit limits for self-directed study in Self-directed Study and Teaching Assistantships. One credit of independent study re quires approximately two hours of work per week plus periodic conf erences with the advising faculty. INTERNSHIP PROGRAM Requirements for 3- to 9-credit Internship Enrollment at Hood as a degree candidate (non-degree or non- matriculated students are ine ligible for in ternships). A minimum 2.0 cumulative GPA and 2.5 GPA in the internship discipline. Completion of a minimum of 45 co llege-level credits prior to the beginning of the internship. Completion of at least 9 credits or three courses at the 200 level or above at Hood in the internsh ip discipline. (See additional department requirements.) Requirements for 12- to 15-credit Internship Enrollment at Hood as a degree candidate (non-degree or non- matriculated students are ine ligible for in ternships). A minimum 2.0 cumulative GPA and 2.5 GPA in the internship discipline. Completion of 75 college-level cred its prior to the beginning of the internship. Students may enroll for 15 credits during the spring or fall only. Students may enroll for a maximum of 12 credits of internship during the summer term. The number of credits available also varies by department. Note: Students may take a maximum of 15 internship credits throughout their academic career. 50| HOOD COLLEGE 2019-2020 CATALOG Applying for an Internship Students considering an internship should visit the Center for Career Development and Experiential Educati on to explore internship options and pick up appropriate paperwork, including an Application, Learning Agreement, and Student Wavier Form. Each of these documents will need appropriate signatures which incl udes a Career Development staff member, faculty advisor and internsh ip site supervisor. Upon completion of the paperwork, the student must turn in all documents to the Center for Career Development and attend an or ientation meeting with a Career Development staff member. Internship Responsibilities All parties have specific responsib ilities for ensuring the integrity and success of the internship experience. Please refer to the Internship Handbook available on the Center for Career Development and Experiential Education website (www.hood.edu/careercenter) for additional details. Supplemental Expenses and Time In fulfilling the expectations of th e internship, the intern may incur expenses in addition to the usual tu ition and fees. Students who enroll in an internship must plan to provide their own transportation or use public transportation. Due to the time requirements of an in ternship, students may need to work during breaks and holidays. Campus housing is available when the College is not in session. Placement is not Guaranteed Interns are not placed in sites and it is the student's responsibility to find a site. The Center for Career Development and Experiential Education and departmental offices provide many res ources to the student to assist in locating a suitable internship. Termination of Internship Under unusual circumstances, any party involved in the internship may terminate the agreement. Because the internship is essentially a professional commitment, Hood str ongly encourages students to fulfill their obligations to complete the full term of service at the site. Unfortunately, on rare occasions, the intern or the f aculty internship advisor may determine that the intern ship site is not an appropriate learning experience, or the internship s ite may determine that the intern is not a good fit for their internship. In either case, any of the parties may decide to terminate the internship. If th is occurs, notify the Center for Career Development and Experi ential Education immediately. Please note: If an internship is terminat ed for any reason, the student is responsible for following all procedures regarding adding/dropping credits and is responsible for all tuition, fees and penalties associated with credit coursework. Please refer to the Internship Handbook available on the Center for Career Development and Experiential Education website (www.hood.edu/careercente r) for additional details. Time Requirements A student must work a minimum of 40 hours at the internship site for each credit earned. LEAVE OF ABSENCE Students who need to be away from the College for one or two semesters (excluding summer) but wish to maintain ties to the College and resume their studies at a later time, may ta ke a leave of absence instead of withdrawing from the College. If your return is uncertain, or if you will be away for more than two consecu tive semesters, you should submit a Withdrawal from the College form. Students who do not return from a leave of absence after two semester s will be withdrawn. Students who wish to request a leave of absence for the remainder of the currently enrolled term must receive written permission from the dean of students prior to the withdrawal deadline as set forth by the academic calendar. Note: A leave of absence may affect loans. Students that are on an institutionally approved leave of absen ce are reported as withdrawn to the National Student Clearinghouse as of th e date the leave began to signify they are not currently enrolled in cl asses. Please contact the Office of Financial Aid at finaid@hood.e du or 301-696-3411 for additional information. Students do not file a leave of absence fo rm in order to study abroad or at another institution in the United States . Instead, they must file a petition with the Office of the Registrar for approval to study elsewhere. Leave of Absence Petition and Petiti on to Study Away or Abroad are available online and in the Office of the Registrar. REGISTRATION , DROP/ADD AND COURSE WITHDRAWAL Advising and registration fo r degree candidates occurs in April for the fall semester and November for the spring semester. Matriculated students are required to meet with their advisors to select courses and review degree progress. The advisor authorizes the student for registration and, on the day indicated on the Academic Calendar, the student registers for classes via Self-Service. Cancellation of Courses A fall or spring semester course is su bject to cancellation when fewer than eight students are enrolled. Summer term classes are subject to cancellation when fewer than five students are enrolled. The College reserves the right to cancel the course as late as the first day of classes each semester. Every effort will be made to work with students regarding program planning and placemen t in alternate courses that would be compatible with the cancelled course. Course Schedules A credit hour usually represents one hour of class work and at least two to three hours of preparation in a given subject per week throughout the semester. Classes usually meet on a Monday- Wednesday-Friday, Monday-Friday afternoon or a Tuesday-Thursday schedule. Except for lab sessions, 3- credit Monday-Wednesday-Friday cl asses generally convene for 50 minutes and Tuesday-Thursday classes for 75 minutes. Four-credit classes meet for a total of 200 minutes per week. Most evening classes meet once a week for 2-1/2 hours or twice a week for 75-minute periods. Hood also has blocked courses, whic h are courses that meet for double periods during a portion of the semester. Blocked courses are primarily studio art and education courses in the teaching internship semester. Course Repeat Policy A student may repeat a course under the following circumstances: UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES| 51 Failure (F, U) in the course previously. Enrollment in a course on a credit basis after previously auditing the course. Course description states that a c ourse may be repeated (e.g., MATH 335). Grade of \"C-\" or below has been initially earned in a 100- or 200- level course. Course may be repeated once. Failure to meet minimum grade re quired in a prerequisite course. All grades earned for a given course will remain on the academic record and, effective Fall 2017, the highest grade earned at Hood will be computed in the Grade Poin t Average. Credit will be awarded only once. Students may not repeat a course at Hood for which transfer credit has been awarded. Course Load Full-time and Part-time Status Full-time status requires 12 credit hour s or more per semester. A typical semester program consists of 15 or 16 credits except in th e first year when it may be 12-15 credits. Part-time status is accorded student s taking 11.5 credit hours or fewer per semester. Students are normally limited to 12 credits completed during the summer. Exceptions to this credit limit re quire permission of the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies. Limits/Restrictions: Enrollment in more than 18.5 credits in one semester requires a 3.0 cumulative average and permission from the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies. Enrollment in credits beyond 18.5 requires additional tuition for each hour or fraction above that number. A student may not enroll in two cour ses which meet at the same hour. Drop/Add Period Students may drop or add courses without academic penalty from the time of registration through the end of the drop/add period. See the Academic Calendar (p. 4) for dates. During this period students may also change to or from the SU (Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory) grading option, change to or from enrollment on an audit basis, or alte r the number of credits in courses carrying variable credit. Course Withdrawal After Drop/Add If a student withdraws from a course after the end of the drop/add period and before the end of the eleventh week of the semester a W (indicating withdrawal) will be noted on the tran script. This notation will not be computed in a student's grade point average. A student may not withdraw from a class during the last four weeks of classes. SELF-DIRECTED STUDY AND TEACHING ASSISTANTSHIPS Hood defines self-directed study as: 1) regular and X-credit independent study; and 2) internships, field wo rk and other courses similar to internships in that they do not have a classroom component. Students may take a maximum of 27 credits (excluding an honors paper) in self-directed study in the total 124-credit program. A combination of internships and i ndependent study must not exceed 15 credits of internship or 12 credits of independent study. Students may take a maximum of 18 credits (excluding an honors paper) in self-directed study in the major program. A combination of internships and independent study must not exceed 15 credits of internship, 12 credits of independent study or more than 1/4 of the major program (whichever is less). Students may not add independent stud y credits to inte rnships to fill a complete semester program. An excep tion to this rule is independent study that students take at th e Washington Center for Learning Alternatives or through a similarly structured program. Independent study topi cs may not duplicate any course offered during the period of the student's enrollment at Hood. Independent studies are grante d to non-degree students under only exceptional circumstances. Teaching Assistantships Many departments offer students the opportunity to serve as teaching assistants, for which academic credit is awarded. Serving as a teaching assistant affords a student the opport unity to understand the materials of a course or of a laboratory from the pe rspective of the teacher. The course number 335 designates this type of study. Limits/Restrictions: A total of 4 credits of Teaching A ssistantship may be counted toward the degree. The course may be taken for 1-3 credits and may be repeated at the discretion of the department. Departments have the right to limit the number of credits granted per semester and may or may not allow students to repeat the course. As a general guideline, a student should work at least three hours per week for each credit granted in th e assistantship. Grading is on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory basis. STUDENT INFORMATION , RECORDS AND TRANSCRIPTS Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act The Family Educational Rights and Pr ivacy Act (FERPA) affords eligible students certain rights with respect to their education records. (An \"eligible student\" under FERPA is a student who is 18 years of age or older or who attends a postsecondary institution at any age.) These rights include: 1. The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days after the day the Hood College receives a request for access. A student should submit to the Registrar a written request that identifies the record(s) the student wishes to inspect. The Registrar will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. 2. The right to request the amendment of the student's education records that the student believe s is inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student's privacy rights under FERPA. A student who wishes to ask the school to amend a record should write the Registrar, clearly identify the part of the record the student wants changed, and specify why it should be changed. If Hood College decides not to amend the record as requested, the College will notify the student in writing of the decision and the student's right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. 52| HOOD COLLEGE 2019-2020 CATALOG Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notif ied of the right to a hearing. 3. The right to provide written consent before Hood discloses personally identifiable information (P II) from the student's education records, except to the extent th at FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. Hood College disc loses education records without a student's prior written consent under the FERPA exception for disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official typically includes a person employed by the College in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person serving on the board of trus tees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee. A school official also may include a volunteer or contractor outside of the College who performs an ins titutional service of function for which the school would otherwise us e its own employees and who is under the direct control of the school with respect to the use and maintenance of PII from education records, such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent or a st udent volunteering to assist another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official typically has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in orde r to fulfill his or her professional responsibilities for the College. 4. The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by th e College to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the office that administers FERPA is: Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Ma ryland Avenue, SW, Washington, DC 20202. As of January 3, 2012, the U.S. Department of Education's FERPA regulations expand the circumstances under which your education records and personally identifiable information (PII) contained in such records - including your Social Security Number, grades, or other private information - may be accessed without your consent. First, the U.S. Comptroller General, the U.S. Attorney General, the U.S. Secretary of Education, or state and local edu cation authorities (\"Federal and State Authorities\") may allow access to your records and PII without your consent to any third party designated by a Federal or State Authority to evaluate a federal- or state-suppor ted education program. The evaluation may relate to any program that is \"p rincipally engaged in the provision of education,\" such as early childhood edu cation and job training, as well as any program that is administered by an education agency or institution. Second, Federal and State Authorities may allow access to your education records and PII without your consent to researchers performing certain types of studies, in certain cases even when we object to or do not request such research. Federal and State Authorities must obtain certain use- restriction and data security promises from the entities that they authorize to receive your PII, but the Authoritie s need not maintain direct control over such entities. In addition, in c onnection with Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems, State Authorities may collect, compile, permanently retain, and share without your consent PII from your education records, and they may track your participation in edu cation and other programs by linking such PII to other personal informatio n about you that they obtain from other Federal or State data sources, including workforce development, unemployment insurance, ch ild welfare, juvenile ju stice, military service, and migrant student records systems. Disclosure of Directory Information Hood College may disclose any in formation deemed as Directory Information without prior consent unless notified in writing to the contrary. The following items are considered Directory Information and will be released in response to any inquiry, unless the student notifies the Registrar in writing that she/he does not wish this information released: Name Class level Enrollment status Date of birth Major Dates of attendance Name and dates of attendance at other institutions Degrees and dates awarded Honors and awards received Students should carefully consider the consequences of withholding Directory Information as this hold would prevent the verification of attendance or degree awarded to all inquiries, including potential employers. Transcripts Please note we are unable to pro cess requests for students with a financial aid, library, and/or accoun ting hold placed on the transcript. Please resolve the hold with the applicable department before placing a transcript order. Hood College has authorized the National Student Clearinghouse to provide transcript ordering. This service provides 24/7 access to ordering site; secure transactions; secure elect ronic transcript delivery worldwide; automatic order updates via mobile text alerts and email; and online order tracking. All transcript orders may be placed via Self-Service (no log-in necessary) or www.getmytranscript.com. TRANSFER POLICY AND ATTENDING OTHER INSTITUTIONS Transfer Policy The registrar evaluates prior college coursework and credit earned through alternative methods for applicability to degree requirements at Hood College. Credit is generally awar ded for courses that are clearly applicable to a baccalaureate degr ee and for which the student earned a grade of C- or above. Courses that are clearly vocational or occupational in nature will not be accepted as cred it towards the baccalaureate degree. A maximum of 62 credits may be awarded for freshman/sophomore (100- 200 level) work completed elsewher e. Although there is no limit for junior/senior (300-400 le vel) coursework, students will be awarded no more than a total of 94 credits for all college-level work completed. Courses taken on a quarter credit system will be converted to semester hours of credit by multiplying the num ber of quarter hours by 0.67 to determine the semester hour equivalent. The transferability of credits from an institution that is not accredited by a regional accreditation agency may be considered upon receipt of documentation that demonstrates equivalency regarding course information, equivalencies and lear ning outcomes. It is the student's responsibility to provide this documentation. UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES| 53 The final 30 hours of the degree must be taken on the Hood campus (see Undergraduate Degree Requirements). In addition, the College requires transfer students to take a minimum of 12 credits of classroom instruction in the major discipline at Hood, re gardless of the number accepted in transfer. Transfer students should submit their tran scripts to the Office of Admission or Office of the Registrar prior to enrollment. Timely submission of these documents will ensure accuracy of degree progression and remaining requirements for the Hood degree. All grades earned at Hood and those completed at other institutions, including repeated courses, are calcu lated in the composite grade point average, regardless of whether the co urse credit was accepted for transfer. The composite average is used to determine eligibility for various honor societies as well as determining Commencement honors. Frederick County Public Schools High School Articulation Agreement Hood College has agreed to grant college credits to students completing certain courses at a Frederick County high school. To be eligible, students must be admitted to Hood, have ear ned a grade of \"B\" or higher in the course, and have submitted an official high school transcript. The student must initiate the request for credit wi thin two years of graduation from high school. Transfer Articulation Agreements Hood participates in the ARTSYS articulation program, which allows students and advisors to determine the transferability of each community college course. The ARTSYS program also outlines the recommended transfer courses for specific programs of study. In addition, Hood recognizes the associate of arts, associat e of arts in teaching, and associate of science degrees of every communi ty college in Maryland. Hood has established enrollment agreements w ith specific community and junior colleges, identifying particular benef its offered to students who transfer from those institutions. Degree Students Attending Other Institutions Students may receive credit for coursewo rk completed with a grade of C- or above at another accredited institu tion during the academic year or the summer with prior approval of the de partment and the registrar. Students must petition to take a course from a nother college during any semester or session. The course may not be offered at Hood during that semester/session. The maximum number of credits that can be taken during the summer is one credit more than the number of weeks in the session for a maximum of 12 credits. Transfer Course Permission forms are available in the Office of the Registrar and online. Community College Exchange Full-time Hood students may take one course each semester at Carroll Community College (CCC) or Hage rstown Community College (HCC) without charge, provided that the cour se chosen is not offered at Hood during the academic year. CCC also offe rs the exchange to Hood students during their summer sessions. To regist er, students obtain the consent of their advisors and the Hood registrar. The registrar will provide a statement of enrollment for registration at CCC or HCC. Transfer Course Permission forms are available in the Office of the Registrar and online. Transfer of Non-Traditional Credit Hood awards up to 30 credits for prior learning through Advanced Placement exams (AP), College-Level Examination Program exams (CLEP), Defense Activity for N ontraditional Education Support (DANTES) exams, departmental ch allenge exams, International Baccalaureate, GCE/General Certificate of Education A-Level and AS exams, and military training and non- collegiate programs approved by the American Council on Education. These alternative modes of learning are evaluated separately from transcript s of traditional transfer credit from other accredited schools. Limits/Restrictions: Credit for prior learning is awarded only to students admitted as degree candidates. A maximum of 30 hours of credit may be earned through any combination of prior learning credits and Hood courses elected on the Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory basis. Students may not receive credit by examination for any course that they have previously audited, fa iled, received credit or from which they have withdrawn. Credit through examination may not be attempted during the final 15 hours of credit. Credit through examination may not count in the minimum of 30 Hood credits required for the degree. The requirement of 12 credits of coursework at Hood in the major cannot be fulfilled through cr edit by examination.

Declaration of major is made during the spring of the sophomore year. An academic department may refuse to accept as a major, or may drop as a major, a student whose Grade Point Av erage in the discipline falls below 2.0. The Double Major As a double major, the student specializes in two of the fields Hood offers. At least one of these fields must be declared during the spring of the sophomore year. Students must identify the second major in the same manner during the spring of the junior year. Students should consult the appropriate department chairperson fo r assignment to a second advisor in the second major. Double majors must meet the major requirements of both departments. The courses may count for requirements in both majors, but the credits can only count toward one major. Students must confer with both adviso rs prior to each registration. In programs where there is great overlapping of requirements, a student may not double major. Students who double major in different degree areas (e.g., Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science) must confer with their advisors and the registrar's office to determine whic h degree will be awarded. Unlike the double degree, which requires a minimum of 154 credits, students complete a minimum of 124 credits for the double major and earn one degree. The Interdepartmental Major The purpose of the major is to allow students with superior achievement to use the existing courses, curriculums and programs to structure an individualized program of studies wi th the guidance and assistance of a program advisory committee. Working with the Program Advisory Committee, consisting of faculty members from the represented disciplines, the student submits a petition of interdepartmental major requireme nts no later than March 15 of the sophomore year to the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies for consideration. Transfer students with first-semester junior status must submit petitions no later than October 15 or March 15 of the first semester on campus. To graduate as an interdepartmenta l major with an individually designed program, a student must have at least 15 credits in one of the areas represented in the major and at least 12 credits in another field for a total of at least 30 credits, 15 of which must be at the 300- or 400-level. A 300- or 400-level capstone course is require d. Approval is necessary before the student implements the program. The i ndividualized program is a contract and, as such, is binding. Students may count toward the major only those courses which are included in the program outline. (Course s within the disciplines contained in the interdepartmental major, but not included in the program outline, are considered electives.) If a student wishes to revise the approved program, the primary advisor will assist and the Program Advi sory Committee must approve the amended outline by majority vote. An y amendments must be submitted to the Committee on Academic Standa rds and Policies for approval. However, no significant changes will be permitted if the student is within 36 semester hours of graduation.

Secondary and art education are not majors. Rather, students seeking secondary certification major in an academic field and concurrently complete the secondary program requirements leading to certification eligibility. Multidisciplinar y breadth for all students is demonstrated through completion of additional ge neral education courses beyond Hood's Core Curriculum. Hood's Department of Education offers teacher certification programs for holders of a baccalaureate degree. They may become certified to teach in early childhood education, elementary/special education or secondary education in the subject areas of art (preK-12), biology, chemistry, English, French (preK-12), history, mathematics and Spanish (preK-12). Students who select this option mu st meet certification requirements through satisfactory completion of th eir program's required content and professional education courses. The Education Department is recognized by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE). Certification Upon successful completion of one of the teacher education programs and attainment of the minimum scores on all Maryland State Department of Education required exams, students are eligible for certification to teach in Maryland with reciprocal certificati on to teach in nearly all other states. It is the student's responsibility to contact individual states other than Maryland for information regarding ce rtification requirements for specific programs. Teacher candida tes should also be aware that local school systems may impose additional require ments beyond state certification. As with most colleges and universities, there is an additional fee required for the teaching internship, formerly known as \"student teaching.\" Interns are responsible for their own transpor tation to and from field experiences. Variation from Hood's holiday and v acation schedules may be required to accommodate local school district calendars. It is strongly advised that interns not have outside employment during Phases II and III. Teaching interns have one year from the comp letion of the teaching internship to pass the Praxis II tests and to comple te all other program requirements in order to be designated an official program completer. It is the responsibility of the intern to in form the Education Department upon completion of all requirements. e-Portfolio All education programs require the ca ndidates to use the Chalk and Wire e-Portfolio system to create a pr ogram e-Portfolio with specified performance assessments and activiti es. Candidates enrolling in EDUC 204 will begin to post their coursework electronically and will use the e-Portfolio for the remainder of their coursework in education. Transfer students will begin using the e-Portfolio system upon entering the education program at Hood. EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION MAJOR , B.A. The early childhood education program is designed to prepare and certify teacher candidates to teach young child ren in preschool, kindergarten and grades 1-3. The yearlong internship during the final two semesters takes place in two settings: one in prekinderg arten or kindergarten and one in a primary classroom. Beginning in the pr erequisite phase, students have the unique opportunity to observe in th e Georgetown Hill at Hood College Lab School on campus, which offers preschool for children ages 3-4. The ECE program includes many field experiences and is based conceptually on the InTASC Standards and the Nati onal Association of Educators of Young Children (NAEYC) Standards as well as on the Maryland State Department's \"Redesign of Teacher Education\". The early childhood education major is divided into sequential steps consisting of Prerequisite, Phase I, Phase II and Phase III. The departmental unit assessment plan features a checkpoint at each step through which students must pass befo re advancing to the next phase. The minimum requirement for a major in early childhood education is the successful completion of Phase II coursework and field experiences. Completion of the certification program is contingent upon completion of Phase III and upon meeting Maryland's minimum passing score on the Praxis II tests specific to early childhood education and attaining a rating of \"Proficient\" or higher on the Exit Folio. COURSE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PROGRAM The ECE certification program re quires students to demonstrate multidisciplinary breadth by completing: 9 credits in English 12 credits in science (at least one course in biological science and at least one course in physical science) 12 credits in mathematics (to include MATH 106; MATH 107; MATH 108; and MATH 112 or PSY 211) 9 credits in social sciences to include U.S. History and Introduction to Psychology Some Core Curriculum courses may satisfy the requirements for multidisciplin ary breadth. Prerequisite Phase: The courses in the prerequisite portion of the early childhood education program prepare students for the professional sequences in Phases I, II and III.

BA/MS DUAL DEGREE IN PSYCHOLOGY /COUNSELING The Psychology and Counseling Department offers a dual degree (B.A./M.S.) for motivated, academically-talented students. Students will complete the undergraduate Bachelor of Arts major in Psychology (p. 85) and the Master of Science in Counse ling (p. 208) with a specialization in either Clinical Mental Health Counseling or in School Counseling. Due to the condensed nature of the dual de gree program, interested students will be expected to take electives over the summer to be able to complete their undergraduate degree within three years, with a 3.25 GPA in the Psychology major and a 3.00 cumulative GPA. Students will plan their coursework with a faculty advisor during their first semester at the College (undergraduate students who transfer to Hood may be admitted into the accelerated program, but may n eed to add extra time to complete both degrees). Admission to the M.S. in Counseling program is not automatic; upon completion of the undergraduate degree, accelerated students will still need to apply to the program. RELIGION MAJOR , B.A. The religion major acquaints students with the world's major religious traditions and helps students develop a critical understanding of the issues involved in the academic study of religion. The Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies recognizes that the fields of philosophy and religious studies, although distinct, nonetheless share many concerns and approaches , and they often address the same issues. Consequently, departmental faculty strongly recommend that students with religion majors and minors avail themselves of opportunities to enroll in philosophy courses. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR The major requires a minimum of 30 credits in religion at the 200 level or above, as well as a minimum of 15 cr edits at the 300-level or above, and must include courses within the following categories: Religious Traditions (two courses): PLRL 301 Indian Thought 3.0 PLRL 306 Chinese Thought 3.0 REL 304 Islam 3.0 REL 314 Western Spirituality:Contemporary Issues 3.0 Religious Practices: REL 200 What is Religion?

Electives may also include: PHIL 307 History of Philosophy: The Ancient World to the Renaissance 3.0 SOCIAL WORK MAJOR , B.A. Director: Michelle Gricus The social work program is accred ited for undergraduate social work education by the Council on Social Work Education. The social work major, based on a foundation in the liberal arts, provides professional preparation for employment in social work, social services and other fields of human service. Graduates ar e prepared for generalist social work practice, useful in a variety of practice settings, including child welfare, corrections, services to older adu lts, community organization, mental health, family services and health services. Beyond the liberal arts core, students majoring in social work must complete courses in human behavior and the social environment, social research, social policy and social se rvice institutions and social work methods. Particularly important is th e field practicum during senior year, where students apply social work theori es of practice and research in one of a variety of settings. Specific practice settings vary each year, but may include child welfare or adult care in county departments of social service, corrections settings, school-b ased services for middle school and high school age youth, long term care facilities, assisted living centers and mental health services. The choice of field setting is tailored to interests and learning needs of individual students. Many social work majors choose to minor in criminology and delinquency or in gerontology, and field and volunteer experiences in related settings allow students to explore their individual interests. Often the field experience leads to employment upon graduation. In add ition, successful completion of the undergraduate degree may result in advan ced standing for graduate social work studies.

Stude nts are expected to spend at least as much time in preparation and training as is normally required for resident courses; each course has an assigned instructor; and interaction between instructor and student is regularly scheduled. The planned program of activities is controlled by the school, not by officials of the external agency. Independent Study (375) and Te aching Assistantships (335) Independent study (375) and teaching assistantships (335) are not conventional classroom or laboratory e xperiences but are an integral part of Hood's programs. A Hood faculty member is required to supervise and schedule regular interaction with students involved in these learning experiences. Course Numbering System 100-499 Courses numbered in this way designate undergraduate courses. 299 Special topics courses are offered in many departments or on an interdepartmental basis. The content and methods of such courses vary with the interest of students and f aculty members, emerging knowledge or issues and opportunities for field expe rience. A special topics course may or may not count toward the major. 397 An upper-level special topics course offered at the discretion of the department. The content and methods va ry with the interest of students and faculty members. 498 Special Topics (Reserved for double-numbered courses.) See individual departmental listings in current class schedule. 499 Designates departmental honors pape r, a two-semester senior-year program designed for students who wish to pursue intensive research or special projects in close coordination with faculty advisors. Departmental honors students are known as the Christine P. Tischer Scholars and receive 6 credits for this work. Departments identify potential Tischer Sc holars from junior majors with a 3.0 overall grade point average and a 3.5 in the major, and invite students from that list to participate in De partmental Honors. Students who accept then choose topics in consultation with a depart-mental honors advisor. Students, in consultation with their ad visors, select an advisory committee of two additional faculty members\u2014one of whom must be outside the student's major department\u2014who will a dvise the student as needed and serve as readers. During the senior year, The Tischer Scholars are expected to work closely with thei r departmental honors advisors and, where needed, their other readers. They are also required to maintain a B average in the major and present a comp leted paper or project by the date set by the Honors Committee in order to qualify for departmental honors at Commencement. Tischer Scholars receive 6 credits, which may be applied to the major or considered as electives. A grade of B- or below for the departmental honors project results in conversion of the project to 6 credits of independent study.

FINANCIAL AID Information regarding student loans is available from the Office of Financial Aid, located on the thir d floor of the Joseph Henry Apple Academic Resource Center . Financial aid represen tatives can be reached by phone at 301-696-3411 or by email at finaid@hood.edu. In order to be eligible for federal loans, a student must be accepted for enrollment in a degree program, take a minimum of 3 credits each semester and be making normal progress toward a degree from Hood as described below. To apply for a federal loan, a student must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). International students, although not elig ible for federal loans, may apply for loan assistance from private educa tional loan programs if they have a credit-worthy cosigner who is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. Additional information can be obtai ned by contacting the Office of Financial Aid. Some programs offer Graduate Assi stant positions to support graduate students. Students can also inquire about this possibility with the appropriate program director and/ or through the Graduate School at gofurther@hood.edu. Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) Students are expected to maintain a record of academic achievement that will enable them to graduate in a reasonable time period. Graduate students receiving financial aid of any type (federal, state, institutional and outside scholarships and grants ) must demonstrate both qualitatively and quantitatively the ability to do sa tisfactory academic work and to progress measurably toward a degree. This is in addition to any renewal criteria required for specific state, in stitutional or other outside awards. Federal regulations require the O ffice of Financial Aid to monitor students' academic progress at the end of each academic year. This is to ensure that students receiving funds are successfully progressing through their program of study. At the end of the spring semester of each academic year, the Office of Financial Aid evaluates the academic progress of each student receiving fina ncial aid according to the standards set forth below by the College. This evaluation determines a student's eligibility to receive financial assistance in the next academic year. Graduate programs range from 30 to 60 credits with most programs at the 36-credit level, and a 3.00 cumulative av erage is required to complete the degree. Students are considered to be making satisfactory progress toward degree completion for financial aid pu rposes by adhering to the schedule outlined below. 190| HOOD COLLEGE 2019-2020 CATALOG SEMESTER COMPLETED CREDITS EARNED CUMULATIVE GPA First/Second 12 2.75 Third/Fourth 24 3.00 Fifth/Sixth 36 3.00 The Office of Financial Aid determines the year of standing according to the number of credits earned. (Note: this is separate from the time-to- completion Graduate School policy wh ich allows up to seven years to complete a degree program.) The Office of Financial Aid uses the above schedule for its financial aid purposes. The maximum time frame in which a graduate student is expected to complete their degree is 150 percent of the published length of the program measured in academic credits. Students will become ineligible for any type of financial aid if th e maximum timeframe for completion is not met. For example, if a published length of a graduate academic program is 36 credit hours; the maxi mum period must not exceed 54 (36 \u00d7 150%) attempted credit hours. Additional Degree / Dual Degree The maximum time frame in which a stude nt is expected to complete their degree is 150 percent of the published length of the program measured in academic credits for a student pursuing an additional degree or enrolled in a dual degree program. Transfer Credits Transfer credits and/or credits for prior learning given at the time of enrollment will be counted in the total number of credits attempted. During the course of enrollment, a stude nt may transfer credits earned at outside institutions, however, the credits will apply only for meeting the maximum timeframe standard. Treatment of W, INC, AU, F, S and U Grades and Repeated Coursework Course withdrawals (W) after the drop/add period are not included in the GPA calculation, but are considered a noncompletion of attempted coursework. Incomplete (INC) grades are not included in the GPA calculation but are considered a noncompletion of attempted coursework until the incomplete grade is replaced with a permanent grade and academic progress can be reevaluated. An audit (AU) grade is not considered attempted coursework. It is not included in the GPA calculation or completion rate determination. A satisfactory (S) grade is treated as attempted credits earned, but it is not included in the GPA calculation. An unsatisfactory (U) grade is treated as attempted credits that are not earned, but it is not included in the GPA calculation. A failing grade (F) is treated as attempted credits not earned; it will be included in the calculation of the GPA and the minimum completion rate. All grades earned for a repeated course will be recorded on the transcript and the highest grade r eceived will be included in the GPA calculation; however, every repeated attempt will be included in the completion rate determination. Financial Aid Suspension Students are placed on financial aid susp ension if they do not meet one or both of the SAP standards. Students th at are failing to make satisfactory academic progress and who successf ully appeals will be placed on financial aid probation. Students placed in this status may continue to receive financial aid for one semester but are expected to improve their academic standing (CGPA) and/or maximum timeframe progress so that the standards of SAP are met by th e end of the following semester. Financial Aid Probation If at the end of the probationary peri od the student still does not meet the standards set forth in this policy, elig ibility to receive financial aid of any type will be suspended. Student s who fail to meet the maximum timeframe towards completion of thei r degree within 150 percent of their attempted credits will have their financial aid canceled. Reinstatement of Aid after Probation Appeal is Approved Reinstatement of financial aid afte r a student is placed on probation is achieved as follows: The student submits a written lette r of appeal in accordance with the appeals process and the Financial Aid Appeals Committee grants the appeal. The student is placed on financial aid probation for one semester and is allowed to maintain their aid eligibility. SAP will be reviewed at the end of that semester; or The student attends Hood College during the suspension semester, pays for tuition and fees without th e help of student aid and does well enough in the coursework to satis fy all the satisfactory academic progress standards. The student mu st notify the Office of Financial Aid if they are planning to attend Hood College without the assistance of financial aid; or The student may enroll in summer courses to eliminate the deficiency in credits or GPA The student must notify the Office of Financial Aid if they are planning to take classes during the summer to eliminate the deficiency. Students can only take classes at Hood College and cannot take classes at another institution to resolve a GPA deficiency. A student whose eligibility has been suspended may regain eligibility at the end of any term after which they meet the above criteria. Students who have been placed on susp ension cannot skip a semester and regain eligibility. No financial aid will be disbursed during subsequent semesters for students on suspension. Appeals Process Appeals of financial aid suspension mu st be made in writing to the Office of Financial Aid by the date specifi ed in the Financial Aid Suspension notification letter. The appeal letter must address the extenuating circumstance(s) why satisfactory academic progress was not made, why the extenuating circumstance(s) has changed, as well as an outlined pl an of corrective action for future academic success. The appeal must explain why the student failed to meet satisfactor y academic progress and what has changed in the situation that will a llow him to make satisfactory progress at the next evaluation. Extenuating ci rcumstances can include, but is not limited to, illness or injury; death of a family member; family difficulties; interpersonal problems with friends , roommates, partners; difficulty balancing work, and family respons ibility; or financial difficulties. GRADUATE STUDIES| 191 The Office of Financial Aid will revi ew the appeal and notify the student in writing within 10 working days wh ether the appeal has been accepted or denied. If the appeal has been accepted, the letter to the student will detail the academic plan of corrective action as well as require the approval of the student's academic ad visor. All decisions made by the director of financial aid are final and will not be subject to further review.

GRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIES Policies and procedures for graduate studies at Hood College are intended to safeguard the integrity of the degree granted, to facilitate the student's progress toward the degree and to pr event delays and misunderstandings. All students, whether enrolled in online or face-to-face programs are responsible for being thoroughly familia r with all policies and procedures as well as the requirements of the degree program. This catalog should be consulted regularly. Students who have questions about requirements or procedures should consult their adviso r or the Office of the Registrar. ACADEMIC STANDARDS Academic Conduct The Graduate School strives to mainta in and enforce the highest standards of academic integrity. Accordingly, plagiarism and other forms of academic dishonesty are unacceptable and will result in disciplinary action. By accepting admission to the Gr aduate School, a student has also accepted to be governed by the stated regulations of academic conduct, and indicates a willingness to accept di sciplinary action, if behavior is deemed to be in violation of those rules or in some way unacceptable or detrimental to Hood College. Profe ssed ignorance of what constitutes academic dishonesty does not excuse violations of these regulations. All Hood College graduate students are expected to comply with the following rules of academic conduct. Examinations, Tests and Quizzes During examinations, tests, quizzes, comprehensive examinations or other classroom work, no student shall give or receive aid in any way or form not authorized by the instructor. All actions prohibited in the Hood Co llege Honor Code apply. Cheating entails: copying another's work or allowing your work to be copied, bringing unauthorized materials into an exam, using electronic devices in an unauthorized manner to give or receive aid, using unauthorized materials to complete an exam or assignment, communicating (via any means) during an exam without approval, failing to turn in exam materials at the conclusion of an exam, taking an exam in an unauthorized location, leaving the exam environment (excep t in an emergency or with the approval of the proctor), giving or receiving unauthorized peer aid on assignments and/or completing indivi dual assignments in a group setting, without the approval of the instructor, such that each student is not solely responsible for his or her own work. Papers, Essays, Oral Presentations and Theses Presenting oral or written work that is not the student's own (except as the instructor specifically approves) is dishonest. Any direct statement taken from other sources must be documente d. Sources of information and of ideas or opinions not the student's own must be clearly indicated. Instructors may prescribe limitations on the sources to be used. The Hood College Honor Code and its prohibitions on plagiarism apply. Plagiarism entails: any unacknowledged use of another person's language or ideas, whether intentional or uni ntentional. Students wishing advice on the proper use and acknowledgement of scholarly materials should consult with their individual instruct ors, the library staff and any of the several reliable guides to scholarly writing that these sources recommend. Projects and Reports Unless otherwise directed, each student must do her or his own work, experiments, drawings and so forth, from her or his own observations. Students may work together provide d that each member of the group understands the work being done, and provided that the instructor does not prohibit group work. Similarly, the Hood College Honor Code prohibitions on re-submission apply. Re-submission entails: submission and/or duplication of work completed for one course in another course, without the approval of all instructors involved. Note that this prohibition on re-submission applies to 192| HOOD COLLEGE 2019-2020 CATALOG all coursework (e.g. examinations, tests, quizzes, homework, projects, reports, thesis, notes, journals, and any and all creative work produced during any courses at Hood.) Violations of academic standards a nd policy at Hood in the graduate program are taken very seriously, a nd infractions (whether explicitly listed in this document or not) may be grounds for dismissal from the college. Student are expected to fami liarize themselves with the academic standards of the College, and lack of knowledge of these provisions will not be construed as extenuating circ umstances. Hood expects all of its students, at both the undergraduate and graduate level, to conduct themselves with honesty and integrity in their work and scholarship. Violations of Academic Conduct When an instructor ha s evidence that a graduate student is not in compliance with these expectations, it is the obligation of the instructor to bring it to the attention of the student and to evaluate the specific work as a zero. That zero is to be calculated in to the final course grade. Instructors also reserve the right to assign a final course grade of \"F\" to a student for cases of academic dishonesty. Additionally, when a graduate student is found to have violated the academic standards and policies set forth in the catalog, the instructor will file a report with the office of the d ean of the Graduate School and with the director of the program in which the student is enrolled. This report should detail the nature of the viola tion and what penalty was assessed. The program director may suggest wh at action be taken for any future incidents. Any major violation of academic standards of conduct will trigger a review of the student's en rollment in graduate study at Hood. Students may appeal the action of the instructor by written petition to the Graduate Council through the dean of the Graduate School. The Graduate Council will investigate the appeal and render a decision, though the student may appeal this decision to the dean of the Graduate School. In perceived cases of extreme academ ic dishonesty, an instructor or program director may request a revi ew by the Graduate Council. The Graduate Council will hear statements from the instructor and/or program director, and then from the student under review. If, after hearing both sides of the case, the Graduate Council finds the student to be in extreme violation of the Academic Conduct c ode, they will recommend dismissal from the program. The final decision w ill rest with the Graduate Council, though the student may appeal the deci sion to the dean of the Graduate School. Academic Standing and Warning A student whose cumulative grade point average (G.P.A.) is 3.0 or higher is in good academic standing, which is required for graduation. If a student's G.P.A. drops below 3.0, he or she will be placed on academic warning. The G.P.A. must be restored to 3.0 within 9 credits completed from the term in which the G.P.A. fell below 3.0. The 3.0 average may be restored by repeating c ourses or by taking additio nal courses. There are no limitations to the number of times a student can fall below 3.0 and restore his or her G.P.A. However, no more than 3 courses (9 credits) beyond those required for the degree can be used to raise the G.P.A. and all requirements for the program must be completed within the time limitation policy. If a student is at risk of being academically dismissed, they can request to transfer to another degree program more suitable to their academic background and needs (see Changing from One Degree Program to Another (p. 192) section) . Any credits earned in the original program that will apply to the new program will be calculated in the cumulative G.P.A. As part of Hood's Fresh Start policy, grades from the original program that are not app lied to the new program, will not be calculated in the cumulative G.P.A. , though they will remain on the transcript for historical purposes. Academic Dismissal Dismissal due to Academic Integrity and Student Conduct Violations A student who has been found to be in violation of the Graduate School's regulations of academic and/or student conduct will be dismissed from the program and from the College (see Graduate Student Conduct (p. 201) and Violations of Academic Conduct (p. 191) sections). A student may appeal academic dismissal as outlin ed in Exceptions to Academic Policies, Regulations or Require ments (p. 201). Students who are dismissed from the College for academic and/or student conduct violations may not enroll in another graduate program or as a non-degree seeking student. Dismissal due to Inferior Academic Performance and Fresh Start Policy A student on academic warning who does not restore the G.P.A. to 3.0 as required will be dismissed from the College. A student may appeal academic dismissal as outlined in Exceptions to Academic Policies, Regulations or Requirements (p. 201) . Students who are dismissed from the College for poor academic perfor mance in a particular program may apply to a different program for possi ble reinstatement to the College. In such cases, students will be required to submit a new application via the online software at www.hood.edu/grada pply. Original transcripts will have to be re-submitted as these documents are shredded after admission into a previous program. However, if accepted, only 6 credits of relevant, previous graduate coursework within th e last five years (with grades of B or better) can be transf erred into the new program with approval from the new program director. In addition, th e seven-year time limit for degree completion starts anew with enrollment in the new program. As part of Hood's Fresh Start policy, grades from the program in which the student was dismissed and not applied to the new program, will not be calculated in the cumulative G.P.A., though they will remain on the transcript for historical purposes. A cumulative G.P.A. of 3.0 is required for graduation. CHANGING FROM NON-DEGREE TO DEGREE STATUS A student who wishes to change from non-degree status to a degree program must apply for admission through the Graduate School. The student must submit any additional documents required of the specific program of interest and have his or her file reviewed by the program director. Admission as a non-degree student does not guarantee admission to a degree program. A maximum of 12 credits taken by a non-degree student may apply to a degree program. CHANGING FROM ONE DEGREE PROGRAM TO ANOTHER A student who wishes to transfer from one degree program to another must submit a Degree Change request form to the Office of the Registrar, which will consult with the appropria te department(s) before rendering any decisions. Credits earned in the original program may apply to the new program if, in the opinion of the Registrar and the Program Director, they are appropriate to the new degr ee. Academic performance in any and GRADUATE STUDIES| 193 all graduate coursework will be consid ered in appeals to transfer between degree programs. Students who have failed to earn a degree after attempting a comprehensive examination twice\u2014or after failing to complete satisfactorily a field work project, capstone, software project or thesis\u2014may not transfer credits earned in that program to another degree program. SECOND MASTER 'S DEGREE A student who has earned one master 's degree from Hood College may earn a second master's degree upon satisfactory completion of the program requirements in a second gr aduate degree program. Up to 6 credits may be applied from the first master's degree program to the second one, with approval from th e program director. Students who earned Hood certificates or comple ted coursework required for Hood certificates may apply those courses to related master's degrees at the discretion of the program director. Cour ses eligible for transfer must have been completed no earlier than five years from the start of the Hood graduate program. The seven-year time limit will begin with enrollment in the first new course of the second graduate pr ogram. All other academic requirements will apply to the second program except that the second concentration must be diffe rent from the first major or concentration. Students planning to pursue a second degree must apply through the Graduate School. ENROLLMENT IN TWO MASTER 'S DEGREE PROGRAMS Graduate students may enroll in and pursue two master's degree programs simultaneously. In order to apply to a second degree program, the student must submit the Dual Enrollment re quest form to the Office of the Registrar, which will then consult w ith the student's current advisor and director of the second degree program . After consultation and review of the student's transcripts a decision will be rendered. The final decision of acceptance or denial resides with the program directors. The following guidelines apply to students pursuing two master's degree programs simultaneously: The student must maintain a cumula tive graduate G.P.A. of 3.0 in each degree program. Dismissal fr om one degree program does not necessarily result in dismissal from the second degree program. The student must successfully comple te a minimum of 9 credits in his or her first degree program before requesting acceptance into a second master's degree program. Up to six hours of graduate credit may be applied from the first master's degree program to the second one. If programs share additional course requirements, th e student may be waived from completing the course in the sec ond degree program but will have to replace the course with an appropria te course subject to the approval of the student's advisor and program director. Degree completion will be calculated and handled separately for each degree program. All processes must be addressed separately for each program. This includes time limits and petitions to graduate. Pursuit of two master's degree programs will not be considered a justifiable excuse for requesting an extension of the time limit for degree completion in any one program. The student's transcript will note both degree programs. Academic and financia l holds apply to the student and not the degree program. For example, a financial hold placed on a student's records as a result of a payment issue for a course in one degree program can prevent the student from pursuing courses in the second degree program. A student may not pursue more th an two graduate degree programs simultaneously. ENROLLMENT IN RELATED CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS Students who are enrolled in a master's degree program and wish to earn a related certificate simultaneously, must complete the Certificate Declaration form on Hood's website. Th e Registrar will then consult with the student's current advisor and dir ector of the certificate program. After consultation and review of the student's academic record, a decision will be rendered. DEGREE REQUIREMENTS Faculty advisors, the program director and the Registrar are available to assist students. Procedures have been set up to check progress toward the degree. It is the student's re sponsibility, however, to know the requirements for her or his degree and to fulfill them. Students are expected to follow the program requi rements in place in the College Catalog at the time of initial enro llment. It is also the student's responsibility to request approval for any course substitutions from their academic advisor or program director prior to enrollment. Failure to receive approval for course substitutions prior to enrollment may result in a delay in program completion. It is the student's responsibility to be thoroughly familiar with the academ ic policies and procedures, as outlined in this catalog. ACADEMIC ADVISEMENT Each degree-seeking student is assigned to an advisor who: 1) advises and approves course registrations, 2) a ssists the student in developing a concentration, if applicable, and 3) in some instances, supervises thesis, capstone or field work if such an option is selected. COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATIONS Comprehensive examinations are requ irements in the Master of Arts programs in Interdisciplinary Studies in Human Behavior (previously Human Sciences), Thanatology and Ceramic Arts. Exams built upon the content of the graduate courses ta ken as components of a graduate program and upon courses for which a waiver or exemption has been granted. A student may not be examined in an area where transfer credit has been awarded. While many or most of the examination questions may deal with specific subject content, some may require the student to draw together several concepts in orde r to demonstrate an understanding of interrelated ideas. The following procedures apply to the comprehensive examination: Notification of Intention. The student must complete the form entitled Notification of Intent to Take the Comprehensive Examination, which is available online at www.hood.edu/gradforms , by the published deadline. Upon submission of the form, the Regi strar will secure the advisor's approval and schedule the student fo r specific date indicated on the 194| HOOD COLLEGE 2019-2020 CATALOG form. No examination will be assembled unless the form is on file with the Office of the Registrar. Only students who are in good standing (maintaining a 3.0 cumulative grade point average) may take the comprehensive examination. The Questions. Comprehensive examination questions are written by the instructor of each course. Assembling the Examination. In consultation with the student, the advisor or the program director prepares the comprehensive examination. Ordinarily, the test questions are drawn from one department. Occasionally, questions are drawn from several departments and appropriate department chairs are expected to assist the advisors in obtaining questions. Administration of the Examination. Comprehensive examinations are administered in the Spring and Fall semesters. The exact dates of the examinations are published in the Academic Calendar for each year. The place of administration of the comprehensive examination will be announced and the program di rectors will determine how the examinations will be administered, which may include the use of Blackboard for online administration. Students are expected to comply with the rules of academic conduct found under the Academic Standards (p. 191) section of the catalog. Students who are unable to take a comprehensive examination on the scheduled date because of hardsh ip may petition the advisor for a substitute date. If the advisor approves the petition, the student must contact the Office of the Registrar and the program director to make arrangements for the administration of the examination and the substitute date. In all cases, if the student wishes to complete the examination within the same semester, the substitute date must occur on a weekday no more than 10 business days after the orig inally scheduled examination date. Grading of the Examination and Reporting the Results. The advisor or the program director , with the assistance of the departmental instructors, arranges for grading of the examination. Where possible, the original writer of an examination question is called upon to grade that question. Questions are graded on a pass- fail basis. The advisor collects all the graded examination questions and, using departmental guidelines, grades the total examination as either pass or fail. Usually a stude nt's total examination is graded pass when four of five questions for Interdisciplin ary Studies in Human Behavior and three of four questions for Thanatology are graded pass. Ceramic Arts students must score at least an 80% on the written exam. Frequently two or three faculty members are called upon to read and assist with the evaluation. Once the total examination is evalua ted, it is the responsibility of the advisor to notify the student and the Office of the Registrar regarding the results of the comprehensive examina tion. This notification must be in writing. The process of examination eval uation and notification must be completed within 30 days following the administration of the examination. Options for Students Who Have Failed the Comprehensive Examination. Only one re-examination may be arranged. Re- examination occurs during the ne xt semester following the initial comprehensive examination, excluding summer session. The student must file another Intent to Ta ke the Comprehensive Examination form. In the case of Interdisciplinary Studies in Human Behavior and Thanatology, the student will only be re-tested on the questions he/she failed. The student also co nfers with her or his advisor six weeks in advance of the re-exami nation. The student who has failed both the initial comprehensive examination and re-examination is not eligible for the master's degree. The dismissed student may consider pursuing a different degree per the College's Fresh Start Policy (p. 192). If a student fails the comprehensive examination, the only option available to that student is re-examination. The thesis, field work or project option is not available to students who fail a comprehensive examination. FINAL FIELD WORK AND RESEARCH PROJECTS Registration must be completed duri ng the regular registration period. Students who elect the 6-credit project option will be registered and billed for all 6 credits in one semester. Cred its will not be split over the course of multiple semesters. The field work or research project is a culminating activity and therefore should follow all necessary work to assure adequate content and methodology. It is required in some degree programs and may be optional in others. Students may elect to do either a 3-credit or a 6-credit field work or research project. Students who elect to do a field work or research project must complete a Permission to Enroll form and submit a written proposal to be approved by the field work or research advisor or instructor, program director and the Office of the Registrar. The 6-credit research project is similar to a master 's thesis in structure, complexity, depth of study and rigor. The Regist rar will continue to re-register students each Fall and Spring semester for the field work or research project as \"IP\" (In Progress) until a fi nal grade is submitted. Students are responsible to pay the Graduate Scho ol comprehensive fee each semester until the project is completed. The 3-credit field work or research pr oject is a disciplined application of theories and techniques learned during the master's study and applied in a field work setting with clearly define d learning objectives. It is graded Satisfactory (S) or Unsatisfactory (U). The grade is awarded by the field work or research advisor or instruct or. (The dean of the Graduate School will review the report and verify th e approval of the Reading Committee.) The student is responsible for initiating either a 3- or 6-credit field work or research project proposal and for securing a field work or research advisor or instructor for the project , who will serve as the chair of the Reading Committee. The advisor and the student, in consultation, will identify two additional persons to serve on the Reading Committee. The basic procedure established for th e master's thesis should be followed for the 6-credit research project. Th e procedure for a well-structured independent study should be followe d for the 3-credit field work or research project. The approved final paper, must be uploaded to MD-SOAR in accordance with the thesis/project deadlines published in the Academic Calendar . Students should review the guidelin es for formatting and electronic submission processes in the Final Thesis, Projects, Capstones, and Research section of ww.hood.edu/gradforms The title of the report will also be not ed in the student's academic record. MASTER 'S THESIS A thesis is required in some degree programs and is an option in others. The thesis course is a 6-credit course and is graded Satisfactory (S) or Unsatisfactory (U). The grade is awar ded by the thesis advisor. Final GRADUATE STUDIES| 195 approval of the dean of the Graduate School is required for completion of the thesis project. Registration must be completed duri ng the regular registration period by submitting a signed copy of their thesis proposal and the Permission to Enroll form to the Office of the Regi strar. Thesis courses are split into two 3-credit courses (580A and 580B), which enables the separation of registration and billing. If students elect to be registered for all 6 credits in one semester, they will be billed for all 6 credits. A detailed statement of regulati ons and guidelines concerning the master's thesis is available from th e Graduate School or available on our website at www.hood.edu/gradforms and should be consulted before a student enrolls for Master's Thesis Preparation. A thesis is a 6-credit course; the charge for Master's Thesis Preparation is in accordance with the per cred it tuition as indicated in the Graduate Tuition and Financial Arrangements (p. 188) section of this catalog. The Registrar will continue to re-register students each Fall and Spring semester for their Master's Thesis as \"IP\" (In Progress) until a final grade is submitted. Students are responsib le for paying the Graduate School comprehensive fee each semester until the project is completed. The approved final thesis, must be uploaded to ProQuest and MD-SOAR in accordance with the thesis/project deadlin es published in the Academic Calendar . Students should review the guidelines for formatting and electronic submission processes in the Final Thesis, Projects, Capstones, and Research section of www.hood.edu/gradforms. The title of the report will also be not ed in the student's academic record. HUMANITIES CAPSTONE (HUM 595) AND HUMANITIES PORTFOLIO (HUM 594) The Humanities Capstone (HUM 595) is eligible for students who began the Humanities program before Fall 2015. For students who enrolled Fall 2015 or after, the completion of the 6-credit thesis (HUM 580A & 580B) or 3 credit portfolio (HUM 594) are the only options. The student must submit the written proposal for either course to the MAHAC (Master of Arts in Humanities Advisory Committee). If the proposal is approved and signed by MAHAC, the student will then submit the Permission to Enroll form and approved proposal to the Office of the Registrar for registration processing. Registration for these courses must be completed during the regular regist ration period, by the drop/add date (see Academic Calendar). If the writt en proposal is not approved, the student will be contacted by a member of MAHAC. A detailed statement of regulations and guidelines concer ning the Humanities Capstone and the Humanities Portfolio is available from the Graduate School website at www.hood.edu/gradforms a nd should be consulted before a student enrolls in the Capstone or Portfolio course. The Humanities Capstone is a 4-credit course and the Portfolio can be for 3 or 4-credits, depending on when the student began the Humanities program. The fees for these courses are in accordance w ith the per credit tuition as indicated in the Graduate Tuition and Financial Arrangements section of this catalog. The Registrar will continue to re-register students each Fall and Spring semester for their Capstone or Portfolio as \"IP\" (In Progress) until a final grade is subm itted. Students are responsible for paying the Graduate School comprehensive fee each semester until the project is completed. Students will receive a letter grade upon completion of the Capstone or Portfolio. TIME LIMITS All coursework and degree requirements must be met within seven years of enrolling in the first course at Ho od College that applies towards the degree and/or certificate program. If a student enrolls in a different certificate or master's program, and one or more of the courses from the first program will satisfy a requi rement of the second program, the program director will evaluate the transcript to determine whether previously completed courses may count in the new program and how the seven-year time limit will be applied. If you started duringYour time expires end of If you started during Your time expires end of Fall 2012 Spring 2019 Fall 2016 Spring 2023 Spring 2013 Fall 2019 Spring 2017 Fall 2023 Fall 2013 Spring 2020 Fall 2017 Spring 2024 Spring 2014 Fall 2020 Spring 2018 Fall 2024 Fall 2014 Spring 2021 Fall 2018 Spring 2025 Spring 2015 Fall 2021 Spring 2019 Fall 2025 Fall 2015 Spring 2022 Fall 2019 Spring 2026 Spring 2016 Fall 2022 Spring 2020 Fall 2026 For students beginning their program of study during a summer term, their time limit will begin that Fall semester. In extenuating circumstances, a stude nt who is in good academic and financial standing at the College and who has completed the majority of their degree coursework, may request a one-year extension beyond their seven year time limit through the Associate Registrar for Graduate Studies. The student must submit th e request and proposed timeline of completion, along with a recommenda tion from his/her or project or academic advisor. Based on this info rmation, the program director may grant an extension not to exceed one year. The student may appeal the outcome of the extension request to the Dean of the Graduate School. A student may request an extension exceeding one year by petitioning the Graduate Council Committee on Student Petitions (please refer to the section titled Exceptions to Academic Policies (p. 195)). TRANSFER OF CREDIT A student may transfer a maximum of 6 graduate credits from another accredited institution prior to the first semester of graduate study. A student in the M.S. in Counseling or the M.F.A. in Ceramic Arts programs may transfer up to 9 graduate credits external to Hood. Those in the DOL or DBA programs may transfer up to 6 credits of doctoral level work. In special cases, a student may transfer additional credits into the program beyond the stated maxima if there are extenuating circumstances, at the discretion of the graduate school dean and program director. Students who completed Hood College certificates in the following areas within five years of enrollment in the related master's program, may apply all certificate credits toward s the master's program: Thanatology certificate into Counseling or Interdisciplinary Studies in Human Behavior Cybersecurity certificate into In formation Technology, Cybersecurity (M.S.), Computer Science GIS certificate into Environmental Biology 196| HOOD COLLEGE 2019-2020 CATALOG Bioinformatics certificate into Bioinformatics (M.S.) Per the below guidelines, transfer cr edit for work completed elsewhere may be accepted after enrollment at Hood College with the permission of the program director and Registrar's office. Transfer credit does not apply toward the cumulative grade point average. Requested transfer credit must meet the following criteria: Courses eligible for transfer mu st have been completed no earlier than five years from the start of the Hood graduate program; Courses must carry at least two semester hours of credit; Courses must carry a grade of B or better; courses earned on a pass/fail basis are not eligible for transfer. The procedure to transfer credits is as follows: The student must submit to the Progr am Director a written request for course transfer, along with the corresponding course syllabi and/or descriptions from the other institu tion, for the requested courses. The Program Director will notify th e student and the Registrar of the decision. The student must submit an official transcript to the Office of the Registrar to have the transfer credits awarded. CONFERRING OF DEGREES Master's and Doctoral degrees are awarded in January, May and September. Students gr aduating in January participate in the May commencement ceremony. Students completing the degree requirements in September participate in the May ceremony the following year. All graduating students w ho have petitioned to graduate with the Office of the Registrar will receive informati on about commencement in April. Attendance is not required of master's and doctoral candidates, but all are encouraged to participate. For fu rther information, see the section on Graduation (p. 196) in this chapter. Graduation Students must complete and submit to the Office of the Registrar the Petition to Graduate form by the established deadlines posted to the College's academic calendar.

Use of Facilities Graduate students may use the academ ic facilities of the College in a manner consistent with the requirement s of the courses in which they are enrolled and only during hours when th e academic phase of the College is in operation. Graduate students may use their Graduate Student Identification Cards to gain admission to the pool and fitness center. GRADING SYSTEM Instructors in graduate programs are required to use the following uniform criteria in assigning grades to students: Grade Meaning A Excellent mastery of course content and excellent ability to apply course content concepts. The work displays initiative, independence and application. In some courses, originality may be required. B Good mastery of course conten t and ability to apply course content concepts. Work shows good grasp of the significance, interrelatedness and uses of the material covered. C Minimal understanding and know ledge of course concepts. F Unsatisfactory understanding of basic facts and principles which constitute the course content. Work receives no academic credit. S Satisfactory performance on thesis, field work or software engineering projects. U Unsatisfactory performance on thesis or field work. Work receives no academic credit. W Withdrawal. This grade is assigned to students who withdraw after the drop/a dd period and according to withdrawal policy. WX Administrative withdrawal due to extensive absences. INC Incomplete work IP In Progress Plus and Minus Grades Instructors may use plus (+) and minus (-) signs with grades to provide differentiation among students. Grade Points and Grade Point Averages Each grade has a grade point value. A grade point average of 3.0 is required for graduation and for stat us as a degree candidate. Only prerequisite and required courses count in the GPA requirement for graduation. A student whose GPA is below 3.0 may be dismissed for academic reasons after the academic warning period (see Academic Standing and Warning section (p. 192)). Grade Point Value Grade Point Value A 4 C+ 2.33 A- 3.67 C 2 B+ 3.33 C- 1.67 B 3 F 0 B- 2.67 U 0 Grades of W and INC carry no point value and are not considered when calculating the GPA Incompletes An incomplete may not be granted un less a student has completed at least half of the work of the course with a passing grade and by permission of the instructor and program director. A grade of \"INC\" (incomplete) will be assigned when illness, emergency or unusual circumstances beyond the student's control prevent the stude nt from completing the assigned coursework and/or examination(s) by the end of the semester or session. A student who wishes to apply for a grade of \"INC\" must secure and complete, with the instructor, the A pplication for Incomplete Grade form. This form is available from the Registrar's Office or online at www.hood.edu/gradforms. The course instructor will identify the deadline date for completion of the work, the conditions under which the grade of \"INC\" will be removed and the consequences for failure to meet those conditions. The instructor, the student, and the program director must sign and approve the Application for Incomplete Grade form and the provisions for completion. The comp leted Application for Incomplete Grade form must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar no later than the date grades are due for that term. All assignments for the course in que stion must be completed by March 15 for fall courses, October 15 fo r summer courses and August 15 for spring courses. Any subsequent reque st for a further extension of the incomplete grade must be submitted by the student and approved by the instructor, program director and Regi strar. Upon completion of all related assignments, the grade of \"I\" will re main permanently on the candidate's transcript with the final grade earned beside it. ACADEMIC SEMESTERS AND SESSIONS The academic year at Hood contains a fall semester, a spring semester and two summer sessions. A calendar published in this catalog gives significant dates within the semesters and sessions. 198| HOOD COLLEGE 2019-2020 CATALOG AUDITING With instructor permission, degr ee and non-degree seeking students may audit graduate lecture courses as space permits. As the term implies, auditors listen rather than engage in class discussions and projects. Auditors attend class meetings but do not write papers or take exams or quizzes. A course that was previously audited may be taken for credit at a later time. A course that was taken fo r credit and successfully passed, may be taken again for audit. See the Tuition, Fees and Other Charges (p. 188) section for rates. Limits/Restrictions: The student receives neither credit, grade nor grade points for an audit; however the audit does appear on the transcript. There is no limit on the number of courses that a student may audit; however students may not exceed a combined 12 credits of for-credit and/or audit bearing coursework in a given semester. It is not possible to audit courses such as creative writing, studio arts and other courses where the nature of the activity requires the participation of the student. No changes to or from the audit option may be made after the end of the drop/add period of the academic term. COURSE CANCELLATION The Graduate School reserves the ri ght to cancel courses in which fewer than eight students are enrolled duri ng the fall and spring semesters, and fewer than five students enrolled for summer terms. Courses may also be canceled due to unforeseen circumstan ces of faculty av ailability. In the event that a course is canceled, st udents will be notified and full tuition will be reimbursed. DOUBLE -NUMBERED COURSES Certain courses have been designate d as appropriate for both graduate students and undergraduates. Thes e \"double-numbered courses\" are identified by numbers in both the 400 and 500 range. Undergraduate students enroll in the 400-level course and receive undergraduate credit. Graduate students enroll in the 500-le vel course and receive graduate credit. Syllabi for such courses will clearly outline different expectations for graduate and undergraduate st udents. Students who took a double- numbered class at the 400-level as an undergraduate student may not take the same class at the 500-level as a graduate student for credit. EXEMPTION FROM COURSES A student may request an exemption from taking any course offered. Exemptions are granted by the department that teaches the course for which an exemption is sought. To reque st an exemption, the student must present a written petition to the program di rector that offers courses in the field where the exemption is being sought. The petition should include the course number and title for which an exemption is being requested and the justification for the request. The action of the department regarding the request will be forwarded to the Office of the Registrar, which will notify the student regarding the disposition of the request and make the necessary notations in the student's record. Exemption does not constitute credit to ward the degree. The total number of credits required for the degree program must be completed in order for the student to qualify for the degree. INDEPENDENT STUDY /RESEARCH Most programs offer a course entitle d Independent Study and numbered 575. These courses offer students an opportunity to undertake an individual project supervised by a f aculty member for topics not covered by coursework that is offered in the program. To be eligible for independent study, the student must identify a faculty member who is willing to supervise the independent study project. The College cannot guarantee that all students will be able to undertake an independent study. Students may not enroll in Independent Study topics to fulfill existing coursework offered in the program. To register for an independent st udy, the student must submit to the Office of the Registrar a completed Permission to Enroll Form. The form requires a written proposal and signatu res of the student, instructor, program director and the Registrar. Registration must be completed during the regular registration period. This form is available from the Registrar's office or online at http://www.hood.edu/gradforms/. The student and instructor must arrange a regular schedule for conferences and submission of work throughout the semester, including the date when the final paper is due. A student may register for no more than 6 credits of independent study or independent research in any degree pr ogram. A student may register for 1, 2 or 3 credits of independent stud y during any semester or during the summer session. CONTINUOUS ENROLLMENT AND LEAVE OF ABSENCE POLICY Once admitted to a graduate progr am at Hood College, students are expected to continue a course of st udy each full semester (Fall and Spring semesters) in the academic year. In certain circumstances, students are permitted to take a leave of absence. To take a leave of absence, students must complete a Request for Leave of Absence form online at http://www.hood.edu/gradforms. This form must be completed for any Fall or Spring semester for which a student is not registered for a course; a Request for Leave of Absence is not required for Summer terms. Students are permitted to request one semester or two consecutive semesters of leave. Leaves of absence do not affect or extend the seven (7) year ti me limit for completion of graduate coursework. Students are required to register for at least one course every semester (excluding summer). If students do not enroll, nor submit the Request for Leave of Absence form, they will be withdrawn from the College and will need to request readmission through the Registrar's office. If accepted, will enter under the catalog in place at the time of readmission. REGISTRATION AND ENROLLMENT A student must be officially admitted and registered prior to attending any class session of any c ourse. Courses and schedules of classes are announced well in advance of the beginning of each semester and summer session. Dates and hours when students may register and instructions for registering are available online at www.hood.edu/gradregister. Students are encouraged to register online using Self-Service. Students are responsible for seeing th at they have met all appropriate prerequisites before registering for courses. Failure to meet course prerequisites places the student at risk and will not be considered as cause for a refund of tuition. Students w ho have not met prerequisites will GRADUATE STUDIES| 199 require approval by their academic a dvisor and/or the instructor. Non- degree seeking students may be required to seek permission from the appropriate instructor or program director in order to enroll. Because some courses may be closed due to heavy student enrollment, students are encouraged to register early. Stude nts nearing the completion of their programs should register as early as possible to avoid facing closed classes. The regular re gistration period continue s through the drop/add period of the semester as defi ned on the Academic Calendar. REPEATING COURSES There are limited circumstances under which a graduate student may retake a course. A course may be repeated only once and no more than two courses can be repeated by a st udent within any single degree or certificate program. The grade of W does not replace a previously awarded grade. When the course is repeated, the student receives the credits for the course (counted once) . While both grades will remain on the transcript for historical purposes, only the higher of the two grades will be calculated in the cumulative GPA. A graduate student may repeat a course if more than seven years ha ve lapsed or the course content is considered outdated. Grades for cour ses taken at other institutions may not be used to replace grades for courses completed at Hood. Courses taken for undergraduate credit may not be repeated for graduate degree credit. ATTENDANCE AND ABSENCE The College does not set a maximum number of absences permissible in any course. Individual faculty members have the prerogative to establish a maximum number of absences at the beginning of the semester, and are encouraged to include a written stat ement of their attendance policy on the course syllabus. Students accept full responsibility for seeing that work does not suffer from excessive absence. The College recognizes that there ar e other justifiable reasons for class absence: observance of religious holid ays or illness. Such absences are acceptable only if previous absences are not excessive and if the student has made arrangements with the inst ructor, prior to the day of the absence, for the work missed. Due to Homeland Security requirements for full-time enrollment, students with F- 1/J-1 visas may not withdraw from any coursework in the Fall and Spring semesters that lowers their course load below full-time status (9 credits). A student with an F-1 or J-1 visa who chooses to withdraw from c oursework, dropping them below full- time status, will be in violation of Homeland Security regulations and will have their visas terminated. Failure to attend class or properly withdraw will result in a grade of F. Limits/Restrictions: For face-to-face courses, students must attend the first class meeting of each of their courses. For online courses, students must participate in the online class as outlined in the syllabus during Week 1 of the semester. Failure to do so or failure to notify the in structor or the Registrar's office of their absence, risk being withdrawn from the class with a grade of WX. Enrollment in a course constitute s an informal contract with the instructor, and a student who violat es an instructor's attendance or participation policy risks dismissa l from the course. Instructors may have a student withdrawn from a class and a grade of WX recorded up until the deadline for course withdrawal. After the course withdrawal deadline has passed, th e student receives a grade of F. A student who is dismissed from a course for excessive absences or who is withdrawn from the class for failing to appear at the first class meeting may be reinstated only by the joint consent of the course instructor and the registrar. Classes are held up to the date and hour preceding vacations and they resume promptly after the recess in accordance w ith the academic calendar. Students are expected to at tend classes meeting just prior to and immediately following holiday periods. Students are fully responsible for making up work missed due to class absence. When students are absent, they are responsible for obtaining lecture notes from re liable sources. Assignments and projects are to be delivered to th e instructor on the assigned date, even when the student does not atte nd class. All exams are to be taken at the scheduled time. Havi ng another exam scheduled on the same day is not considered suffic ient justification for rescheduling the exam. Students who withdraw or are wit hdrawn from coursework after the designated drop/add period, are res ponsible for all tuition and fees associated with that coursework. SCHEDULE CHANGES Students may drop or add courses th rough the Office of the Registrar from the time of registration through the end of the drop/add period. See the Academic Calendar for dates. A student may be added to a class once the semester begins, provided the cl ass has not met more than once and with the written permission of the in structor. During the summer sessions, the substitution or addition of courses is limited to the first two days of classes. All schedule changes must be submitted in writing. STUDENT COURSE LOAD To be considered full time, a gra duate student must pursue 9 hours of credit each fall and spring semester. In gauging the amount of time required for study in preparation for classes, the Graduate Council recommends that three or more hours of study be reserved for each hour of class. This is a general reco mmendation and may vary depending upon the course and individual differences in each student's background. Due to the rigorous nature of graduate c oursework, students are encouraged to limit enrollment to 9 credits each fall and spring semester, however in programs where appropriate, a student may take 12 credits a semester after consultation with his/her academic advisor. A current graduate student may not enroll in more than 12 credits per term without written permission by the program director and academic advisor. Permission may be grante d after the program director and academic advisor consider: the student's rationale for the request provided by the student in a brie f, written statement which will be submitted to the Office of the Registra r no later than two weeks before the start of the term in consideration; and achievement in courses completed at Hood College. The student will be no tified of the decision no later than 7 days before the start of the term. A student enrolling in her/his first te rm at Hood College may not register for more than 12 credits. 200| HOOD COLLEGE 2019-2020 CATALOG STUDENT GUIDELINES FOR ONLINE AND HYBRID COURSES I.

WITHDRAWAL FROM CLASSES AND REFUNDS Notification of withdrawal must be in writing and must indicate the course number and course title. Student s are encouraged to withdraw by submitting the online withdrawal form via secure email submission. Students may also withdraw by se nding an email to hoodgrad@hood.edu or by coming to the Registrar's Office in person. It is the student's responsibility to call to ensure recei pt. Refunds will be given if the drop/withdrawal notice is received by the Registrar before the first course meeting or within the drop/add pe riod as defined by the academic calendar. The drop/add period for summer terms is the first week of each term. After the first class meeting and within the drop/add period, there is an 80% refund/credit and the student is responsible for 20%. Refunds will not be granted for withdrawals received after the drop/add period . Withdrawal notices received befo re the course begins or during the drop/add period will not appear on the student's transcript. Tuition refunds are based on the full tuition ch arge for the course. A grade of W (indicating withdrawal) will be noted on the student's transcript for withdrawals that occur after the drop/ add period. This notation carries no academic penalty. A student who doe s not give official notice of withdrawal will not be eligible for refunds and a grade of F (Unsatisfactory) will be reco rded on the permanent record. It is the responsibility of the student to notify the Office of the Registrar in writing that she or he is withdrawing. A graduate student may withdraw from a course by the withdrawal deadline as posted in the Academic Ca lendar (p. 4). Afte r the deadline, a student may not withdraw from a course. Students enrolled in a 3-credit course that meets for two weekends during the semester may withdraw from such class by submitting an offi cial, written withdrawal notification to the Office of the Registrar befo re the second weekend meeting date. Withdrawals for 1-credit weekend cour ses are not accepted once the class has met. The Office of Financial Aid is required to recalculate federal financial aid eligibility for students who withdr aw. Up through 60 percent of the semester, a pro rata schedule is used to determine how much federal aid a student has earned at the time of withdrawal. The portion of unearned aid must be returned to the federal programs. When unearned aid is returned a student may owe the Colle ge additional funds. Failure to begin or ceasing to atte nd classes does not constitute official notice of withdrawal or rea son for refund/credit on tuition. It is the responsibility of the student to notify the Office of the Registrar in writing of the student's desire to withdraw from a class. GRADUATE STUDIES| 201 WITHDRAWAL FROM HOOD COLLEGE Students who wish to withdraw fr om the College must submit the Graduate Withdrawal from the College form, found at www.hood.edu/gradforms. Students who wish to re-enroll at the College after they have withdrawn must submit the Graduate Readmission Request form. Readmission is granted into the same program of original enrollment, under the catalog in place at the time of readmission. Students who wish to be readmitted to a di fferent program must apply through the Graduate School. Students withdrawn fr om the College due to dismissal must submit a petition for reinstatement to hoodgrad@hood.edu for review by the Graduate Council Sub-Committee on Student Petitions. Students who do not complete their pr ogram of study within their seven- year time limit will be automatically withdrawn from the College. Please refer to the section on Time Limits (p. 195) for information regarding time extensions. EXCEPTIONS TO ACADEMIC POLICIES Exceptions to academic policies as stat ed in this catalog or elsewhere are rarely made. A student who believes an exception is justified may petition the Graduate Council through the A ssociate Registrar for Graduate Studies. The petition should include: 1. The student's name, Hood ID number, email and phone number; 2. The expected date of graduation; 3. The specific exception being requested and the reason(s) for the request; 4. A timeline of completion, in the case of time limits and/or academic performance issues; 5. Letters/statements from the academic advisor and program director addressing whether or not they support the petition. In the case of thesis or project petitions, a letter from the thesis or project advisor is also required. The petition and supporting documentation will be reviewed by the Graduate Committee on Student Petit ions. The Associate Registrar for Graduate Studies will notify the stude nt of the Committee's decision. The student may appeal the outcome to the Dean of the Graduate School. A student may not petition for reinstatement more than once. GRADE APPEAL If a student receives a final grade in a course that she or he believes is incorrect or unfair, he or she may appeal that grade by following this procedure: Student must contact the faculty me mber involved, in writing, within 30 calendar days of the posting of the disputed grade. The grade appeal request must outline the speci fic grievances about the grading procedure, grounds for appeal a nd attach relevant documentation (syllabus, guidelines for papers or presentations etc.). If, after hearing the in structor's explanation, the student still wishes to appeal the grade, she or he mu st present the grade appeal to the program director within 30 days of notification from the instructor. If the student is still not satisfied, the student may make a final appeal to the dean of the Graduate School. In such cases, the dean must be contacted prior to the end of the term immediately following the semester the grade was posted. Failure to follow this timelin e provides sufficient grounds for dismissing an appeal. In each stage of the appeal process, the student will receive a letter stating the reviewer's recommendation within 30 days of initiation. All parties to the grade appeal (s tudent, instructor, program director, dean) are to maintain strict confid entiality until the matt er is resolved. GRADUATE STUDENT CONDUCT As part of Hood's mission to prepar e students for lives of responsibility and leadership, the Graduate School expects students to maintain a high standard of student conduct. Gradua te students are expected to take personal responsibility for their own conduct. Hood College reserves the right to suspend, dismiss or otherw ise discipline a student who violates the policies or regulations with respect to student conduct. In addition, the Graduate School may request that a student withdraw for reasons of conduct detrimental to the College community. The Graduate School defines disrupti ve conduct in the following way: The disruptive student is one w ho continues to make unreasonable demands for time and attention from faculty and staff and habitually interferes with the learning environment by disruptive verbal or behavioral expressions, threatens or abuses members of the College community or willfully damages co llege property. The result is a disruption of academic, administrative, social or recreational activities on campus. Students are asked to refrain from be haviors that include, but are not limited to: Behaviors that disrupt or interfer e with teaching, research or other academic activities Behavior that can lead to physical harm Physical or verbal threats, in timidation that may interfere with another's full participation in the life of the College Conduct that constitutes sexual hara ssment or any violation of Policy 55 Refusing to comply with directions of school officials, instructors, administrators or staff A complaint of alleged student misco nduct should be filed with the dean of the Graduate School by a member of the faculty, staff or student body.
