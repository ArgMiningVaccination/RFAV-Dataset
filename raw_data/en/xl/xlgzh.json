Abstract 63 participants from Maharashtra, Pune, India between 18 to 70 years of age participated in the intervention group, while 49 were in the control group. In the experimental group, there were four participants diagnosed with covid-19 and five more diagnosed with hypothyroid ailments. A 40-day online intervention was conducted for the intervention group as 25-minute daily sessions of AUM chanting and Ujjayi breathing. Questionnaires about psychological health parameters were answered by both groups before and after the intervention. Participants also recorded their pulse rate and respiratory rate before and after the intervention. A highly significant effect of Ujjayi breathing was observed on perceived stress, anxiety, pulse and respiratory score for intervention group, when compared with the control group. Overall quality of life showed less significant impact. Keywords: Ujjayi breathing; Covid-19; Hypothyroidism Introduction A common man, working professional, retired person or even a homemaker faces a lot of troubles and tensions, one after another. The stress often leads to fearful and negative thoughts which in turn, leading to anxiety. If not handled carefully, the reaction to- wards an unforeseen problem can affect one's health. In such a case, one may find it unbearable to cope with such stress and anxi - ety of day-to-day meet. Psycho physiological disorders are physical disorders with psychological overlays [30]. One of the effective ways to reduce this is to adopt yoga as a lifestyle [29]. Yoga aids in reducing the speed of thoughts in one's mind using yogasanas, pranayama and meditation. Once this life- style is adopted, one can face the stressful situations in day-to-day life with a lot more confidence and a lot less anxiety. This trans-formation can help to contemplate over the solution of a problem rather than to be bogged down by it. The problems one might face in extreme stress include high blood pressure, increased pulse rate, irritable bowels, sleep distur - bances, depression, hormonal changes, and acidity among many others. Stress is a feeling of physical or emotional tension. It is body's reaction to a challenge. Stress can trigger what is known as 'fight- or-flight response' within the body. When triggered incorrectly for too long, it may cause severe damage to the body. Ideally, once the threat passes, the body should relax back to its natural state. Stress is caused not by the situation but by our response towards it. As per Yoga Vasishta, stress and yoga are the subject of Yoga as Citation: Rashmi A Bapat and the of Ujjayi Breathing on Covid-19 and Hypothyroidism\". Acta Scientific Women's Health 3.10 (2021): 27-32.' Adhijavyadhi' i.e., bodily disease (Vyadhi) born out of (ja) mental unrest. At the occurrence of a stressful situation, sympathetic sys- tem within the body tries to mitigate the response of the external event, whereas the parasympathetic system is activated to balance the changes caused by the sympathetic system. If stress persists continually in the body, the balance between and sympathetic and the parasympathetic system can no longer be maintained. This im- balance begins in the physical body. Constant and frequent distur - bances at mind level then percolate the stress into prana body or vital sheath existence, thereby disturbing the breath pattern of the person. If this process continues and this Adhi percolates further into the physical body, there by forms as cause for any disorder or as Vyadhi. However, this percolation can be avoided at the mental body or sheath of intellect body either by breath control or cessa - tion of mind (Patanjal yoga sutra Samadhi pad- 1), Pranayama and intelligently followed health habits (Panchakoshaviveka-Taittariya Upanishad). In other words, by following Shreyas (what one should do for one's well-being) against Preyas (what one likes to do but may not be in the best interest of one's well-being), Vyadhi can be avoided. It was observed through many research and studies on yoga that integrated approach of yoga-asanas, Pranayama, meditation and OM chanting improve mind control, thereby bringing about re- laxation to the body-mind complex. An effective way to slow down the breath is Pranayama, one of the aspects of which is Kumbhaka. There are eight Kumbhakas ef - fects of any pranayama are tranquillizing. These practices pacify the body and mind. They simultaneously increase the pranic flow and arouse awareness of the subtle vibration of energy. When the prana is balanced, mind calms down. The discriminating power is restored and well directed, thereby achieving overall wellbeing. Ujjayipranayama is done with a constriction of the glottis. One must take a feeling of the breath at the throat. A hissing or snor - ing sound is produced at the throat region [14]. This sound is (not created artificially), produced by friction of air with the inner lining of the throat is heard only by the one performing Ujjayi. A well-practised Ujjayi Pranayama detaches the doer from all other thoughts including positive and negative thoughts, thus developing pointed awareness. When one's mind becomes relaxed, calm, and stable, one can take better decisions in adverse situa- tions as well. By performing Ujjayi breathing, random negativity in thoughts is lowered and we can better redirect to constructive thoughts. Ujjayi has an additional benefit with respect to increasing pro- ductivity and managing stressful situations, which prevent one from the urge to multitask. It is known that the human brain is usually incapable of multitasking in the true sense [5]. What gives the illusion of multitasking is more accurately described as switch- tasking, where the individual switches their attention from one task to another rapidly. Switch-tasking is usually detrimental be- cause it has three major negative consequences - it leads to longer finishing time, more mistakes and increased stress levels. If in case of such stressful situations, one takes a few minutes to concentrate on Ujjayi breathing, it helps improve their concentration and clar- ity of thoughts, which lead to better prioritizations and efficient work. A layman in his busy daily schedule and tensions may not be able to do perform Ujjayi Pranayama to its full extent. So, by going from difficult to easy but proper way, only Ujjayi breathing is taken into the scope of this study. As stated in classical yoga texts like Hatha yogpradeepika con- trolling over (Prana) the vital force is an extremely tedious pro- cess which requires alertness, awareness and a lot of patience and consistency. So, there is a need for a safe process of Pranayama which is simple, understandable and practicable. If such a process is discovered, it will not remain limited to classroom studies and will be adopted by a wide cross-section of the society. Since Ujjayi breathing does not necessitate dedicated time or a rigorous train- ing to perform, it is easier to adopt in one's daily routine. Thus, it is important to study the physiological and psychological effects of Ujjayi breathing on lifestyle changes. Method Participants 63 participants, male and female, of the age between 18 years to 70 years were in the Ujjayi intervention group. 49 participants, male and female, of the age between 18 to 70 years were in the control group. In the experimental group, there are four covid-19 affected and five hypothyroid cases. 28Pre-post Case Study of the Psycho Physiological Effects of Ujjayi Breathing on the of Ujjayi Breathing on Covid-19 and Hypothyroidism\". Acta Scientific Women's Health 3.10 (2021): 27-32.Materials Following 3 questionnaires were distributed to all participants to both groups electronically via Google Forms. Perceived Stress Scale (PSS): By Sheldon Cohen, This ques- tionnaire contains 10 questions regarding perception of stressful situations. State Trait Anxiety Inventory (ST AI): Developed by Charles Speilburger, This questionnaire contains 20 questions about the anxiety perceived by the participants. Procedure An online intervention was carried out using Google Meet video conferencing application for 40 days excluding Sundays for 25 min- utes daily. The format of the daily session was as follows: Starting prayer in a sitting position of any comfortable pos- ture like Sukhasana,Vajrasana,Padmasana or sitting in a chair Eleven times omkara chanting Ujjayi breathing for 15 minutes, performed by focusing the awareness at the throat region to feel the nada (hissing or snoring sound). Sitting quietly for two minutes Closing prayer -Chanting of the Shanti mantra, which is a prayer for universal peace. The control group was not taught Ujjayi breathing. Question- naires described above were distributed to participants from both the groups before and after the intervention. Data extraction Data was extracted among all the cases only for Covid -19 and hypothyroid cases. Then it was assessed into excel sheets and sta- tistical analysis was carried out using standard formulas.

Also, these practices are very safe and useful to reduce anxiety, perceived stress, respi - ratory rate and there by improvement in physiological functions. Table 2 ujjayi Breathing Practices show significant improve- ment (42.25% for PSS and 18.42% for RR) to reduce anxiety, stress and respiratory rate. Discussion The effect of Ujjayi Pranayama on various health parameters has previously been studied [9-11] , that Ujjayi breathing has a positive effect on stress relief, anger management and fatigue reduction, thereby achieving holistic well-being. This signifies that Ujjayi breathing intervention had an ex - tremely significant positive impact in reducing stress, anxiety and improving breath control, which improve overall health. Compared to the aforementioned parameters, a less signifi - cant impact of Ujjayi breathing was observed on improving overall quality of life of an individual. In this case, although the result was positive, the difference of effect between intervention and control groups was less prominent than that of others. This can be attrib - uted to the duration and timing of the intervention. A parameter as broad as quality of life may not be altered by a noticeable amount within duration as small as the intervention span. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic going on during the intervention may also have affected the mentality of the participants to some extent. As the results show a positive trend nonetheless, further study can be carried out for longer durations and within more normalized social conditions, going into a detailed study of Ujjayi breathing and over - all quality of life. There were some parameters of concern noticed during the in- tervention. An on-line group intervention relied heavily on avail - ability of continuous and stable internet connections, which may cause logistical problems in some cases. Moreover, due to the un- availability of in-person connections, some important health pa- rameters, which play a key role in the physiological health, such as blood pressure, thyroid and blood sugar levels, needed to be ex - cluded from the study.Some of these factors can easily be eliminated and this study can be effectively extended in the future. Especially in the light of such promising positive results on psycho-physiological health parameters, physiological indicators like blood pressure, thyroid levels and SPO2 levels also need to be incorporated and the effect of Ujjayi breathing on these parameters can be studied. As Ujjayi breathing can be incorporated with many routine activities, effect of performing Ujjayi breathing while walking needs to be analyzed with precision instruments. Since Ujjayi breathing has been found to be effective in reducing stress and anxiety, it may also generate a positive effect on improving sleep quality and reducing insomnia. Conclusion Ujjayi breathing practices are very safe and effective in reduc- ing increased anxiety, perceived stress and respiratory rate during covid- 19 pandemic situations and for hypothyroid cases. Authors Note The research was carried out to assess the impact of regular Uj- jayi breathing on psycho-physiological health on a broad spectrum of people across all walks and stages of life.
