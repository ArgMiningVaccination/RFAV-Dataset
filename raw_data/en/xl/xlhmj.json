Today, unfortunately, fast food contributes to a majority of our urban diets. With tight schedules and a fast-paced lifestyle, we understand that it is tough to manage your health, eat well, and have a sustainable routine. This results in constant falling ill and resorting to modern medicine, like a band-aid to our otherwise unsustainable life. Our alienation from natural resources for the sustenance of our immunity is fading at a great pace. Therefore, our steps towards various diseases are becoming longer with each passing day. We are continuously jumping on the bandwagon and applying chemical-based drugs in the name of immunizing ourselves. Instead, if we adopt Ayurvedic solutions to better our health, it can help us take control of our health without causing any harm to our bodies or the environment. What is Ayurveda? Ayurveda is a Sanskrit term that means 'knowledge of life.' It emphasizes bringing harmony between internal and external worlds for good health. It is a sacred form of the healing process and was developed some 3,000 years back in India. Its belief revolves around three entities, i.e., mind, body, and spirit. And the proper balance between these three is indispensable for one's health. Ayurveda explains three concepts of immunity which are also at the core of Foresta Organic's Ayurveda Immunity Booster- - Bala- This is also referred to as the concept of strength. This explains that the combined balance of bodily functions, tissues, digestion, and elimination can effectively prevent oneself from the disease. - Vyadhi Kshamathwa- It points to the power of our immune system to fight against diseases. - Ojas- It explains the relationship between digestion and immunity. It is the result of transformation in our physiological process. It is also considered the food we eat, and its high and healthy level as the indication of proper nourishment. [Ayurvedic Immunity Boosting Remedies](http://www.ayush.gov.in/docs/123.pdf)- - Incorporating turmeric and black pepper in daily meals help reduce toxins and ignite immunity. - Consuming tulsi, pippali, and ginger tea is known to boost immunity.
