Dr. Bradstreet, who is also the father of a child recovering from autism, has the largest patient population of children with ASD (autistic spectrum disorder) in the U.S. While experts in the medical field are striving to find causes and cures for autism, desperate parents of autistic children are fiercely fighting to bring their children back. Elizabeth Horn, president of Autism Recovery Consortium and mother of a child with autism, is a filmmaker producing a PBS documentary on how autistic children recover. Ms. Horn, along with a growing number of doctors working to recover these children, created the Consortium to share information on successful protocols and to get the message out that kids can recover. Both Jeff Bradstreet, M.D. and Elizabeth Horn, together with other parents of autistic children, are available to comment on today's debate.
