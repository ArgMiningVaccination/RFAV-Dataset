As the popularity and intensity of vehicle use on public lands continues, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is challenged to manage the routes used by recreationists while minimizing activity beyond designated routes and mitigating environmental impacts. Ecosystem function and habitat quality can be degraded by vehicle activities, especially when the activities are occurring outside authorized routes or authorized open areas. Restoration mitigates damage to soils and vegetation; however, methods vary across the desert, results appear to be inconsistent, and standardized monitoring plans do not exist. The Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan Land Use Plan Amendment to the California Desert Conservation Area Land Use Plan identified the need for, and directed implementation of, standardized monitoring of restoration, which includes minimizing surface disturbance to agency prescribed levels in areas of critical environmental concern and on California Desert National Conservation Lands. To assist the BLM in implementing the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan Land Use Plan Amendment, we define ecological restoration as the process of halting or minimizing future degradation while simultaneously assisting the recovery of ecosystem function and community composition in relation to intact reference sites. The monitoring strategies provided in this protocol are used to restore degraded ecosystems after use of non-routes has ceased (non-designated routes or vehicle-caused linear disturbances) by applying techniques to improve edaphic properties, hydrologic function, and biotic community composition. This protocol also provides criteria that can be used to distinguish the status of non-routes and land parcels as \"restored\" or \"disturbed.\" This protocol was developed by the U.S. Geological Survey, in collaboration with BLM restoration practitioners, to identify standard restoration methods and establish criteria to determine when restoration is achieved. This protocol also develops new methods to increase restoration rates and successes on public lands in the southern California deserts. BLM's long-term implementation plan for the evaluation of road restoration described in this report is to transition toward managing the work, including developing the workforce and long-term storage and management of the data during the next several years. This report is intended to be regularly updated as the program develops.
