Although it is not required, it is recommended that regional campus students also comply with the IU immunization policy. (Online-only students are exempt from the immunization policy) Please note that you may also be required to provide immunization information separately for your academic program, and that you must submit this form even if you've already completed the IU Health Center's health history questionnaire. Additional information You should be able to get your immunization documentation from your physician's office. Indiana residents may also be able to get records throughMyVaxIndiana. Contact your physician for a PIN that allows you to access your information. If you do not have, or are unable to obtain, medical documentation, self-reported dates of immunization are an acceptable form of documentation. You can submit a record maintained by you or your parent showing the month and year during which each dose of vaccine was administered. If you've not been vaccinated for all IU requirements, Bloomington, IUPUI, Northwest, and South Bend students can also visit their campus health center. Students must provide medical documentation or self-reported dates for the following: Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) - requires two immunizations For more information, see theCDC's official website. Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis (Tdap) - requires one dose in the last 10 years For more information, see theCDC's official website. Meningitis - requires one dose of MenACWY (MCV4) on or after the student's 16th birthday if aged 21 years old or younger For more information, see theofficial CDC website Tuberculosis- All international students must provide documentation of a negative TB blood test result or a chest x-ray indicating that they are not infected with TB. The test must be administered in the United States. For more information, see theofficial CDC website. Meningitis B - two doses of MenB for students aged 23 years old or younger) is not currently required by state law, but is strongly recommended. Visit the CDC website for common abbreviations used on vaccination records. IU has partnered with Med+Proctor for immunization requirements. Follow the step below to become compliant. All immunization documentation must be in English. Med+Proctor is unable to translate documents. If your documents require translation, Indiana University has collaborated with Luna Translation Services to assist with the process, although documentation other professional translation services is also acceptable. What are the next steps? For those who are able to provide immunization records satisfying all requirements, your status will automatically be updated to compliant. No further action is required. You are now considered compliant at all IU campuses. Students who provide records that do not meet the immunization requirements as listedherewill be prompted to make any corrections. Until all appropriate records have been provided, a student is not compliant. Online-only Student Exemption Immunization requirements only apply to students taking at least one in-person class. If all your classes are being taught online, you are exempt from all IU immunization requirements. This is an automatic exemption based off your enrollment. There is nothing you need to do. Medical Exemptions Students are excused from providing medical documentation or self-reported dates for one or more of the required vaccinations only upon provision of or one of the following: You have immunity because you had the disease. A physician's written statement is required to prove immunity. You have laboratory evidence of immune titer. You are contraindicated to a vaccine.If a medical contraindication (e.g., allergy to eggs, pregnancy, reaction to vaccine, participation in a current sequence of immunizations, etc.) exists, a written statement from a physician is required to document each specific medical contraindication. Religious Exemption A religious objection does not exempt a student from immunization unless the exemption is made in writing and signed by the student. Religious exemption forms can be returned in lieu of immunization records. Please note that students filing a religious exemption will be required to leave campus if an outbreak of any listed preventable disease occurs on or near campus. How to Submit an Exemption Go to your Med+Proctor account or register if you have not already created one. MMR- This vaccine qualifies a student for compliancy for mumps, rubella, and one dose of measles. TDaP- Booster vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (whooping cough). Usually given at age 11 or 12. This vaccine is required to be compliant. DTaP- Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (whooping cough). Given prior to age seven. The DTaP vaccinedoes notmake a student compliant. Visit the CDC website for common abbreviations used on vaccination records. When should I submit my immunization records? As soon as possible! You may think you have all the necessary documentation or self-reported dates, but that may not be the case. The sooner you submit your immunizations the more likely you are to avoid interruptions in your ability to attend in-person classes in the event of an outbreak. How do I submit my immunization records? Indiana University has partnered with Med+Proctor to evaluate student immunization records for compliance. To start, go to theirwebsiteand create an account. Once you have created your Med+Proctor account, upload your immunization records or self-reported dates for review. The documents will be evaluated by trained health professionals who will either approve or disapprove each vaccine dose. Why was my vaccine dose disapproved? If you go to your account on Med+Proctor, you should be able to see the issue notes left by the reviewer. The most common reasons a document would be disapproved are the following: The document was too small or blurry to read The vaccine was administered outside the CDC's accepted timeline The document is missing the student's identifying information to prove it is the student's immunizations that were submitted The vaccine record is not in English and requires translation A vaccine is missing at least one of the required two doses You will receive an email from Med+Proctor once your immunization records are approved. If I claim a religious exemption from one or all the required vaccinations, and an outbreak occurs on campus, what happens? If there is an outbreak of any of the diseases IU seeks immunization against, university administrators will consult the database of students who claimed exemption, for religious or medical reasons, and contact them to advise them to leave campus immediately and not return until an \"All clear\" is given. Such actions are for the safety of students who have not been immunized, as they are at higher risk of becoming sick and further promoting an epidemic. At the time of such outbreak, students who formerly claimed exemption may seek to become immunized and present documentation of such immunization, to avoid the keep away notice. I'm pregnant. I had some of my vaccinations as a child but not all, and in my current state, I should not take more immunizations. What do I do? Ask your doctor or prenatal care provider to issue a statement confirming your pregnancy and the expected due date. You can upload that document to your Med+Proctor account to support your request for a medical exemption for the time being. The same precautions will apply to you during that time as with other kinds of medical or religious exemptions: should there be an outbreak on campus, and you have not been immunized, you will advised to leave campus immediately, and not return until an \"all clear\" is given. Indiana law, IC 21-40-5, requires students on residential campuses to provide proof of their immunization status. Please review the official IU immunization policy here. What is meningococcal meningitis? Meningococcal meningitis is a bacterial form of meningitis, an infection of the thin lining that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. While rare, the condition is very serious and can be deadly. If untreated it can have a fatality rate up to 50% (10-15% if properly treated) and death can occur in as little as a few hours. There are several types of bacteria that can cause meningitis. The predominate bacterium of concern for adolescents and young adults is calledNeisseria meningitides.There are at least 12 types ofN. meningitides, called 'serogroups'. Serogroups A, B, C, W and Y cause most meningococcal disease. Adolescents and young adults 16 through 23 years old are considered at an increased risk for the disease. Why is IU adding meningococcal immunizations to their requirements for first year students? The Indiana General Assembly passed a law in 2017 that takes effect beginning with the 2018-2019 school year. The law requires universities with residential campuses to includemeningitis immunization in their immunization standards. This new law will further promote public health and prevent disease in our university community. IU is requiring immunizations that cover the MenACWY (also known as MCV4) serogroup and although not a state requirement, strongly recommends that students be vaccinated for the MenB serogroup. Who else is doing this? All residential universities in Indiana will have to require some form of a meningitis immunization. Most states, including Indiana, currently require the MenACWY (MCV4) immunization in high schools. MenB is currently a recommended immunization for 12thgraders in Indiana and may be a requirement in the future. This new requirement will help prevent infections in the university community. How will this impact students? Under the new requirements, first year students aged 21 or younger will have to be immunized with one dose of MenACWY (MCV4) on or after their 16th birthday. Additionally, first year students aged 23 or younger are strongly recommended to be immunized with two doses of MenB. Students without the MenACWY immunization will have to obtain them either through their primary care physician, local clinic, or university health center. "}
