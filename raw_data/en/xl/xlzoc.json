BoHV-1, either alone or in association with other respiratory cattle pathogens, causes significant economic losses to the livestock industry. The aim of this work was to validate a guinea pig model as an alternative method to the current BoHV-1 vaccine potency testing in calves. Guinea pigs were immunized with two doses of vaccine 21 days apart and sampled at 30 post-vaccination days (pvd). BoHV-1 Ab response to vaccination in guinea pigs measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and viral neutralization (VN) was statistically compared with the Ab response in cattle. The guinea pig model showed a dose-response relationship to the BoVH-1 antigen concentration in the vaccine, and it was able to discriminate among vaccines containing 1 log10 difference in their BoHV-1 concentration with very good repeatability and reproducibility (coefficient of variation 20%). A regression analysis of the Ab titers obtained in guinea pigs and bovines at 30 and 60 pvd, respectively, allowed us to classify vaccines into \"very satisfactory\", \"satisfactory\", and \"unsatisfactory\". Bovines immunized with vaccines corresponding to each of these three categories were experimentally challenged with BoVH-1 virus. The level of protection, as measured by reduction of virus shedding and disease severity, correlated well with the vaccine category used. Concordance analysis of 85 comparison experiments, which included vaccination of calves and guinea pigs with 18 reference vaccines of known potency, 8 placebos, and 18 commercial vaccines, indicated almost perfect agreement between the model and the target species for Ab titers measured by ELISA and almost perfect to substantial agreement when Ab titers were measured by VN. Taken together, these results indicate that the developed guinea pig model represents a reliable tool to estimate batch-to-batch vaccine potency and to predict the efficacy of killed BoHV-1 vaccines.
