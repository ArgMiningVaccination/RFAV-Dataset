An alternative medicine practice that is used in conjunction with a conventional one is known as a \"complementary\" medicine. Example: using ginger syrup to prevent nausea during chemotherapy. Overview of integrative medicine and complementary practices for mental health issues like substance use disorders - Alternative or complementary therapies are any forms of therapy that aren't considered traditional by means of conventional medicine - Alternative therapies help to improve overall mental health by inducing relaxation, stimulating mindfulness, and better mental wellbeing - While there may not be hard evidence to showcase that every complementary therapy works as well as traditional practices, they do help people struggling with symptoms of mental health issues when used in combination with traditional therapies - People living with mental health issues should find the complementary tools that work best for them as every person has different treatment needs and goals Understanding more about complementary and alternative therapies Together, complementary and alternative medicines are often referred to by the acronym CAM. However, they may also be referred to as \"holistic therapies\". Enter integrative medicine. As defined by the National Centers for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of Health, integrative medicine \"combines mainstream medical therapies and CAM therapies for which there is some high-quality scientific evidence of safety and effectiveness.\" In other words, integrative medicine \"cherry picks\" the very best, scientifically validated therapies from both conventional and CAM systems. This direct link between Eastern techniques and Western therapies, taken separately, the practices can bring much relief and benefit. Yet when they are logically related and interwoven, the result is an unshakable foundation for a joy-filled life in recovery. Who can benefit from complementary and alternative therapies? Certain people can benefit from utilizing complementary and alternative therapies throughout their lives and mental health recovery journey. These individuals include people who: - have tried traditional medical treatments in the past but have not gotten the results they want - want more than one approach to treatment and wish to weigh their options - traditional treatments provide adverse effects or reactions (for example, prescription medication side effects) Do complementary and alternative therapies really work? Approaches to mental wellness may be different from person to person. No one person's experience with addiction or mental health issues is the same. So, treatment must not be the same for every individual. One of the goals of complementary therapies is to provide options for individuals in treatment so they can find what best works for them. Different therapies work for different people, and utilizing different complementary therapies allows individuals to find and utilize the therapies that may work best for them. Are complementary and alternative therapies safe? Most complementary therapies are safe and present no high risks for side effects. However, it's always a good idea to consider every therapy before you try it. And, if you are experiencing side effects, speak with your provider to find out whether or not stopping a therapy may help. Before beginning any complementary approach at Agape Wellness, you'll discuss your concerns and history with your healthcare team in order to determine whether or not you're a good candidate for complementary therapies in order to keep you safe and allow you to feel comfortable moving forward with care.
