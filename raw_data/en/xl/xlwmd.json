About the book ~ To take the concept of spirituality pretty good, the author Benjamin W. Decker introduced this book. It's a guide to meditation , to let positivity in and to increase the strength of healing. Let yourself believe that if you don't seize the damn day, you won't grow internally as a positive person. The author is a believer of God and he says that we all are creators of God and that He designed the world for our growth, learning and happiness. The book also points out the fact of our habits shaping us and how we could transform into better version of ourselves by turning bad ones into good. Focusing on our own welfare, manifesting ourselves, showing kindness to others and seeing everyone through inner soul and being less judgemental is what we all must do. Everyone hurts atleast once and no one stays forever. The only person staying by your side no matter what is you yourself. Never let your emotions take over power to your mind and body. There's a line in the book which says, \"By creating supportive stories for ourselves, we begin attracting more positive things in our world. Rather than allowing ourselves to move through life at the 'effect' of our circumstances, we can co-create our experience by taking responsibility for how we respond to what life gives us\" And I can't agree more. By reading this book, one can assure that our mindset will lead to a determining one. Desired thoughts and moral values spread in the community of spiritual world, helps upgrading and being focused in life. \"If you ever feel like drowning in negativity, Invest your previous time in reading Modern spirituality.\" This book talks about faith and spirituality as well as many other things of life. It is genuine, deep and has profound honesty, morality and integrity and many life lessons would be learned from there, which can, in turn, help us later in life. The knowledge in this book is immense and I would that you take out your pen and paper while reading this one because there are a lot of points to hold on to and implement in one's daily life. This book is such an encouraging and promising read. There are so many things that I gained from it which I planned to implement in my daily life and hoping to reap successful results. This book dives deep and defines the word 'spirituality' in a very detailed and precise manner.This piece of writing made me look deep into the many things in my life and self reflect as I go on. I love reading a book that is not only about the story but giving me so many insights and inspirations giving rise to a feeling of motivation and striving to heal and grow myself not just physically but also emotionally because if your mind is not surrounded by a clean space then your body is already rotten no matter how healthy and fit one is. The book is written in a simple, detailed and precise manner, the narration is well done and thought of and the pace of the book is quite fast making it a plus point for me. I do not like reading books that I had to drag myself to complete and this book does not come into that category.
