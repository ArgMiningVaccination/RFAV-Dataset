Thus,wesetouttoreportonASDoccurrencebyMMRvac- cine status in a large sample of US children having older sib-lingswithASDandtocomparefindingswiththoseamongchil-drenwhohaveoldersiblingswithoutASD. Methods Aretrospectivecohortstudywasconductedusinganadminis-trative claims database associated with a large US health plan(the Optum Research Database). The Optum Research Data-baseincludesmorethan34millionindividualseachyear,con-taining both commercially insured individuals and Medicaremanagedcareenrollees.Thedatabaseconsistsofproprietary,deidentified health claims data from a geographically diverseUSpopulation(16%West,20%Midwest,36%South,and27%Northeast).Inaddition,theageandsexdistributionoftheen-rolleesissimilartothatreportedbytheUSCensusBureauforboththecommerciallyinsuredandtheMedicaremanagedcarepopulations. The New England Institutional Review Boardwaivedtheneedforinformedconsentanddeemedthestudyexemptbasedonitsuseofexisting,deidentified 16data. Index children were identified among commercially in- sured enrollees who had both medical and pharmacy cover-age and included all children in the database born betweenJanuary 1, 2001, and December 31, 2007, who were continu-ouslyenrolledinthehealthplanfrombirthtoatleast5years of age and who also had an older sibling continuously en-rolledinthehealthplanforatleast6monthsbetweenthebe-ginning and end of the study period (January 1, 1997-December 31, 2012). Older siblings of index children wereidentifiedusingafamilyidentifiervariableassociatedwiththeinsurancepolicy;siblingshadtobebetween6monthsand17yearsolderthantheindexchildtobeincluded. ASD status in index children and older siblings was determined using a claims-based algorithm with a positivepredictive value of 87% 17that required 2 or more claims on separate dates of service with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM ) diagnosis code in any position for autistic disorder, otherspecified pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) includingAsperger syndrome, or unspecified PDD (299.0x, 299.8x,and 299.9x). Both index child and older sibling ASD statuswere determined using their entire enrollment time that fellwithin the study period. Index children had to have at least1 older sibling with 2 claims with ASD diagnoses or all oldersiblings with no ASD diagnoses. Children with an older sib-ling with only 1 claim with an ASD diagnosis were excluded.Indexchildrenwithonly1claimwithanASDdiagnosiswerealso excluded. MMRvaccinereceiptwasdefinedashavinga CurrentPro- Supplement ).Thedate of administration of the trivalent MMR (or the last-administered component of monovalent vaccines) was usedto determine age at administration for each dose (first orsecond). BecausetherecommendedageoffirstMMRdoseadmin- istrationis12to15months,and4to6yearsfortheseconddose,relative risks (RRs) were estimated to compare ASD status inchildren receiving 1 dose of MMR at ages 2, 3, 4, and 5 yearsand2dosesatage5yearsvsthosewhowereunvaccinatedatthoseages(2-doseRRsatage4yearswouldonlyincludethosechildrenwhoreceivedtheseconddosebytheirfourthbirth-day).SeparateRRswereestimatedforchildrenwitholdersib-lingswithandwithoutASD.Sincenochildrenwerelosttofol-low-upbeforereachingage5,unadjustedRRswerereportedas cumulative incidence rate ratios by taking the ratio of theproportion of children who had an ASD diagnosis in an ex-posedgroup(either1MMRdoseor2MMRdoses)tothepro-portionofchildrenwhohadanASDdiagnosisintheunvacci-natedgroupatagivenage.
