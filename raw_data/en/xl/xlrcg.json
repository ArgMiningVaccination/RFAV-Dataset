Every day in the lab presents itself with new challenges and an infinite number of questions for which we usually have few or no answers. As a consequence of this, there is always work to be done and progress that ought to be celebrated and shared with the rest of the scientific community. I strongly believe that this is what research is about, and I am lucky to enjoy doing it every day.\" - Adrian Piliponsky, PhD, is a principal investigator within the Center for Immunity and Immunotherapeutics at Seattle Childrens Research Institute, and an assistant professor in the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Washington School of Medicine. Dr. Piliponsky received his bachelors degree in Pharmacy from the University of Buenos Aires in Argentina. His passion for research eventually led him to The Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel where Dr. Piliponsky received his PhD. Under the mentorship of Francesca Levi-Schaffer, PhD, Dr. Piliponsky studied interactions of mast cells and eosinophils which are considered major players of allergies. With a desire to broaden his understanding of mast cells in vivo using mice with deficiencies in mast cells to study a variety of allergy and inflammatory disorders. Dr. Piliponsky took a post-doctoral position at Stanford University with Stephen J. Galli, MD, one of the lead researchers in the mast cell field. - Related Pages - The Piliponsky Lab studies inflammatory responses involving mast cells and myeloid cells. Our goal is to understand how the body controls the immune system's response to bacterial infections - and how this process becomes dysregulated. - Working to understand mast cell biology to enhance innate immunity and treat allergic disease. - - - Award Name Award Description Awarded By Award Date Early Career Faculty Travel Grant Honor received to attend the American Association of Immunologists (AAI) 99th AAI Annual Meeting-IMMUNOLOGY 2012TM American Association of Immunologists (AAI) 2012 Travel Grant Honor received to attend The Fourth International Workshop on Signal Transduction in the Activation and Development of Mast Cells and NIH, Basophils at the Bethesda, MD The Aharon Katzir Center, Weizmann Institute of Science 2001 Travel Grant Honor received to attend the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) 56th Annual Meeting in New Orleans, LA.
