Initially it was \"Do you know you look too young to be a doctor?\" Then that became \"Why are you always so weird?\" And lately it's been \"When are you going to retire?\" Therefore, as I inch closer to my golden years, I think more about who is going to take care of my future health care needs and what primary care will look like in British Columbia over the next few decades. There has been a lot of discussion about the lack of family physicians in our province and the vast number of BC residents who are unable to find a doctor. Despite a significant increase in the number of UBC Medical School spots, and programs like A GP for Me, the goal of linking the population with physicians remains elusive. Invariably, the subject of different physi- cian payment approaches comes up and ar- guments are made for replacing the standard fee-for-service method with a different scheme. Those against this method of physician remu- neration believe it encourages high-volume practices, with as many patients as possible seen in the shortest amount of time, to maximize the physician's income. The concern is that pa- tients are not given adequate time to express their concerns, nor to be examined thoroughly or treated appropriately. I have worked in this fee-for-service environment for 30 years, so I may be a little biased against the alternatives. Expanding walk-in clinics will only encour- age a high volume of brief patient encounters without longitudinal follow-up; therefore, this is not a direction we should explore. Any payment system that involves a for-profit intermediary, whether in a clinic situation or a telehealth model, seems counterintuitive as the best way to fund primary care. In that model, money is siphoned away from health care providers into the pockets of businesspeople. By all accounts, that is a poor use of the public funds used for health care in British Columbia. A lot has been said about a new model of patient care referred to in our province as the patient medical home, which is part of a larger primary care network. The idea is that a patient becomes part of a family practice where they can access primary care providers such as physicians and nurse practitioners along with other allied health practitioners such as counselors, dieti- tians, and therapists. All the services a patient might require are available in one location. This model of care sounds ideal, but I wonder about the costs involved. A physical space and admin- istrative staff will be required, and if this is run by the government, I suspect some inefficien-cies may creep in. Also, most allied health care providers are not currently publicly funded, so would patients have to pay for these added ser- vices, or would this also be funded with health care dollars? Lastly, how would physicians be compensated? If they would work for a salary, the pressure to work quickly and move briskly What about me? from patient to patient would be relieved. I suspect that the number of physicians required to treat the same volume of patients would in-crease within this system. What I do know is that my colleagues who work in full-service longitudinal care fee-for-service family practices work exception- ally hard, and despite the large volume provide an excellent and highly efficient service. In conclusion, I really have no idea what the best approach will be moving forward; there- fore, I have decided to leave this problem for greater minds than mine to solve. I do know that replacing the current system will be a huge challenge, and I hope this is worked out before my patients start asking, \"Isn't it time you hung up your stethoscope, old man?\" n \u2014David r. r ichardson, mD Travel insurance that's ready to go.

Statistics Canada figures from 2019 indicate that 17.7% of BC residents (897 567) lacked a regular health care provider.1 The situation in Greater Victoria is of particular note: not-withstanding the ideal climate, natural beauty, and many cultural amenities of the province's capital, it is held that 100 000 residents lack a family physician. 1 On 20 January 2022, Victoria Times Colonist journalist Cindy Harnett explored in detail the resignation of two family physicians practising at Eagle Creek Medical Clinic in View Royal.2 the evolving crisis in primary care The husband-and-wife team \"cited burnout, lack of adequate compensation and support, overhead costs, inefficient use of their expertise, and trying to balance the demands of parenting toddlers with the need to work unpaid hours each day.\" Dr Chelsie Velikovsky stated, \"Having to tell patients, 'Sorry, there is not currently a psychia- trist accepting new patients right now' or that 'you're going to be waiting 18 months to see this type of specialist,' that is just embarrassing. I don't know how else to say it.\" In the same article, clinic director Dr Da- vid Ward said, \"But we're dying out here. We just cannot get doctors to come in and take on patient panels right now. . . . Mark my words, you are never going to see a new privately built family practice in Victoria again.\" Nonetheless, recruiting efforts to replace the departing pair are ongoing, with a full-time vacancy currently posted on Health Match BC (VIHA-4788).3 The job posting indicates that the clinic was built in 2016 and expanded in 2020 to include 17 exam rooms. An RN and so- cial worker practise on site. The fee-for-service split is 70/30, with the option of 75/25 if the applicant can practise from home using tele- health for a couple of days per week. Annual billings are estimated at $400 000 to $500 000. The incoming physician is not required to take on maternity care, ER/hospitalist coverage, or long-term care. Call is 1 month annually and not onerous, with 10 to 15 calls per month. At first glance, this appears an attractive op- portunity. Why, then, would family physicians not line up to work in View Royal or elsewhere in Greater Victoria? A significant factor is likely the fee-for-service payment scheme, which re- mains the primary method of physician pay- ment in Canada. The staple of primary care fee-for-service billing in BC remains the ven- erable \"0100,\" which currently pays $31.62 per Editorials visit for adults up to 49 years of age. This fee item, which was $17.65 in 1985, has since fallen behind the average annual Canadian inflation rate (2.34%). Factoring in overhead of 30% to 40%, fee-for-service physicians must see pa- tients quickly and efficiently to make ends meet. Consequently, a degree of rushing is inevitable, contributing to patient dissatisfaction and phy- sician burnout. The patient profile for the Eagle Creek Medical Clinic vacancy may also dissuade in- coming physicians. The successful full-time applicant to replace Dr Velikovsky and her husband is expected to \"build a practice panel from the more elderly and complex patients of these two practices (~1500 patients).\" While such patients have always been part of general practice, they require considerable expertise, patience, and time to manage, with the latter commodity being in particularly short sup- ply in the fee-for-service setting. Historically, such patients were considered loss leaders in a rounded practice that included the young and healthy\u2014a cohort requiring less time and cog- nitive burden\u2014who effectively underwrote care of the complex. Committing to a fee-for-service practice panel chosen from the most needful 1500 of 3000 legacy patients poses a significant clinical, professional, and economic challenge to a new physician, and doubtless motivates them to look elsewhere. Starting a career in such a fashion contrasts sharply with my own debut as a GP locum in 1986. Following completion of a rotating in - ternship, I practised in the Fraser Valley, Okana- gan, and West Kootenays. Newly qualified and inexperienced GPs like me were accommodated and mentored by senior colleagues and allowed full run of hospitals. I recall a specialist in Trail stating that his \"idea of heaven\" was being a GP in Trail. There were enough GPs to allow patients to shop around until they found a sim- patico physician, or to part ways if difficulties 21SPEAKEASY SOLUTIONS YEARS OF EXCELLENCE 2000 - 2021Secure cloud-based clinical speech recognition Dictate into your EMR from almost anywhere Install within minutes across unlimited computers One synchronized user profile Stunningly accurate with accents speakeasysolutions.com Professional Speech Technology SpecialistsContact us today for a free trial! 604-264-9109 | 1-888-964-9109151 BC MediC al Journal vol. 64 no. 4 | may 2022151 Editorials re: The crisis that CO vID-19 exposed, highlighted, and worsened (but did not cause) I read with pleasure Dr Brian Day's lament about the mounting inadequacies of the hos- pital, physician, and nursing sectors over recent decades [BCMJ 2022;64:53-54]. The burning reality in BC, and certainly in Victoria, is the astonishing deficiency of family doctors, which has resulted in more than 750 000 individuals across the province finding basic health care to be inaccessible. Yet nobody is doing much about it. The recent BC budget failed to immediately increase funding for family doctors' low fees. Were there supplemental overhead cost allow- ances? Was there an enthusiastic endorsement for a realistic alternative to the fee-for-service salary structure? Could an obligation be created for medical schools to channel and support students entering family medicine residencies? How does our BC government justify collect- ing taxes to support medical services that are simply unavailable? We seem to have few an-swers that satisfy. \u2014Neil Finnie, mD (retired) VictoriaLetters to the editor We welcome original letters of less than 300 words; we may edit them for clarity and length.

The absence of walk-in clinics ensured that quick and simple complaints were man- aged by a given patient's own GP or clinic col- leagues, providing professional and economic relief from the burden of complex cases. GPs served as attending physicians for most hos-pitalized patients and could assume as much responsibility as they wished. They covered the hospital emergency, performed minor sur- geries, assisted at major ones, and practised low-risk obstetrics. It was possible for GPs to develop a defined clinical expertise and focus their practice on areas of interest accordingly (e.g., low-risk obstetrics, sports medicine, der- matology, emergency medicine). Physicians regularly rubbed shoulders at the hospital and were (mostly) on a first-name basis, im- measurably easing the consultation process. Significant knowledge acquisition occurred by osmosis alone, given the need to practise in varied settings featuring face-to-face in- teractions with GP and specialist colleagues. Practising as a GP in such circumstances was varied, stimulating, and economically viable. Four decades later, the health care land - scape has changed dramatically. The number of available drugs and the use of laboratory tests and diagnostic imaging have mushroomed. Investigatory and management algorithms are more numerous, complex, and detailed, and sophisticated procedural interventions are now routine in specialty care. Clearly, the general licence bestowed on physicians fol- lowing a year-long rotating internship in BC until 1994 would now be insufficient to per- mit adequate management of primary care or hospital patients. In short, the professional opportunities for newly minted GPs wishing to pursue longitu- dinal care were more attractive professionally and economically when I qualified. Today's GPs are forced to spend more time compil- ing and sifting through thicker electronic charts. Problem summaries include chronic medical illnesses interwoven with psychiatric concerns, addictions, and psychosocial prob- lems. Such complexity mandates input and co-management by collaborating specialists, but as noted above by Dr Velikovsky, con- sultation now must frequently be requested from specialists the GP has no rapport with or has never met, and often entails a wait that is clinically unhelpful. Primary care of complex and elderly patients increasingly requires the practitioner to engage in medical social work that goes uncompensated in the fee-for-service environment. Family physicians are understandably gravitating away from traditional longitudi- nal primary care and toward employment that entails less responsibility and provides more predictable hours as well as clearly defined deliverables and compensation. We are witnessing a shifting primary care landscape where patients whose GPs have retired or moved on are left scrambling to find a new GP , while remaining GPs scramble to orchestrate and coordinate care for aging and increasingly complex patients. Ultimately, such a free-for-all must give way to a functionally integrated system using one EMR, incorporat- ing primary medical care, community health, allied health, specialty care, hospital care, and long-term care. Successful and cost-effective models of this kind of care currently exist in the UK, in the US, and elsewhere. Until that day arrives, we will witness the ongoing exodus of GPs from longitudinal pri- mary care in BC's population centres. As the clinic doors shut behind them, I hear their voices collectively raised in song to the words of the great blues guitarist BB King's \"The Thrill Is Gone,\" crying out that we'll be sorry someday. n \u2014David J.

How do we promote health when our health care system\u2014its design and implementation, structure and poli- cies, and internal operating system\u2014needs dire attention? The very system that is supposed to set us up for success and healthy outcomes is perpetuating illness. And while there are parts of our system that work when we need them to, is this the best we can do? When the foundation of our health care sys- tem depends on primary care access, yet delivery is broken, the system becomes challenging to navigate and we hinder our ability to provide the care and outcomes we, and our patients, deserve. And both patients and providers are growing increasingly frustrated with their lack of influence to cure it. There is not a sole entity to blame for the constraints we experience. Some would say the manner in which physicians are paid and the resources available to take care of patients are archaic and do not reflect the needs of our ever-changing population with increasing com- plexities and disease burden. Our system pays to take care of the sick and injured; it doesn't pay to prevent them from becoming unwell to begin with. A system that does not consider the needs or real-time input of the physicians providing care or promote a healthy culture best suited for its patients is itself not well. A system free from power dynamics, racism, and gender inequity is also necessary, as all these factors affect health and outcomes. Imagine a reality in which we had robust access, where social drivers of illness were ad-dressed, deterioration of chronic disease states was intercepted, and patients moved back into the community from acute care. An ideology based not in reactivity or urgency but rather in laying the groundwork for a commitment to primary prevention and health. We are making inroads to address these difficulties, and yes, it is slow going. The Joint Collaborative Committees ( JCCs) (www .doctorsofbc.ca/collaboration)\u2014where fam- ily medicine, specialist care, and rural medicine meet to collaboratively ef- fect system change\u2014is a first-of-its-kind partner- ship in Canada. Involv-ing government, health authorities, patients, and other stakeholders, all work is grounded in the principles of the quality improvement method- ologies from the Institute for Healthcare Im- provement and framed around the Triple Aim. Through the Engagement and Quality Improvement team, and in conjunction with the JCCs, Doctors of BC is working to ad- dress some of what is broken in our health care system by supporting physician-led qual- ity improvement initiatives, leadership training, and other programs that benefit doctors. And through the support of these initiatives, physi - cians are accomplishing world-class results here in BC. One example is the Surgical Patient Optimization Collaborative, which helps pa- tients improve their health in preparation for surgery. The work of this collaborative has led to a marked reduction in adverse events during surgery, improved outcomes and recovery for patients, and an increase in patient and care - giver satisfaction. Another example is the new provincial cognitive-behavioral therapy skills initiative, which is currently underway and sup- ports physicians to learn skills to manage their own health and wellness, as well as teaching them how they can use those skills to support patients. These are just two of many examples that illustrate the good work that results from bringing physicians and care teams together to collaborate, influence the health care system, and become directly in- volved in leading change. We are committed to continuing to advance the many quality improve-ment initiatives across the province and our shared learnings from the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, and we actively look for opportunities to streamline services from a client-based perspective. I am reminded that there are inspirational physi- cian leaders, patient partners, and health care workers fearlessly devoted to this work. The insurmountable pandemic has been a testa- ment to what we can accomplish when forced to change and adapt in our system. The eternal optimist in me feels there is great opportunity and potential for growth in our system. After all, we can only go up from here. n \u2014r amneek Dosanjh, mD Doctors of BC Presidentthe very system that is supposed to set us up for success and healthy outcomes is perpetuating illness. 153 BC MediC al Journal vol. 64 no. 4 | may 2022153News We welcome news items of less than 300 words; we may edit them for clarity and length.

Each year, eligible doctors in British Columbia receive a unique benefit entitlement to help fund their retirement savings through the BC Contributory Professional Retirement Savings Plan (CPRSP). Doctors of BC will notify you of the amount you can claim each fall, but you'll need to apply online for the CPRSP . If you don't apply for the CPRSP , your basic benefit will expire in 3 years. For example, the CPRSP benefit for 2021 expires on 31 March 2024. You can invest the money in an RRSP , a spousal RRSP , a TFSA, an individual pension plan, or a combination. Contact Doctors of BC if you have any questions about your benefit. Have you contributed too much to your TFSA? The CRA keeps close tabs on every pen- ny moving in and out of your TFSA. If you inadvertently contribute more than your al- lowable limit, expect what's known as an \"ex-cess amount letter.\" This provides information about TFSA rules and what you need to do to resolve the issue. You could be penalized with a tax of 1% per month on the excess amount until it is withdrawn. Did you move any TFSA money from one financial institution to another?You may have any number of TFSA accounts across multiple institutions. But if you with- draw money from one to put into another, be aware that this counts as a TFSA contribu- tion. Yes, the withdrawal increases your TFSA room\u2014but not until the following year, so you could be over-contributing. If you need to move money between financial institutions, ask for a direct transfer\u2014it won't count as a TFSA withdrawal or impact your contribution room. To manage your TFSA account more easily, consider keeping your TFSA money at one financial institution. Have you bought investments that aren't allowed in a TFSA?TFSAs allow a wide range of qualified invest-ments, but there are some general restrictions. For instance, prohibited investments include any property that you're closely connected to\u2014 say, shares of a company or a partnership in which you have a significant interest (10% or more). This can trigger two special taxes: 50% on the value of the investment, and 100% on any income or capital gains derived from the invest - ment. The issuer of your TFSA must take rea- sonable care to ensure that the account does not hold nonqualified investments, but you should still exercise caution and monitor your TFSA.Have you invested in too much fixed income? Despite the name, it's better not to think of the TFSA as a savings account. To enjoy the tax savings of a TFSA, your investments need to have meaningful growth. If your TFSA holds mostly cash and other low-interest-bearing investments, you erode the main benefit of in-vesting in a TFSA Are you using your TFSA for day trading? It is perfectly okay to build and manage your own investment portfolio in a self-directed TFSA account if you prefer to, but be aware that high-frequency or aggressive day trading may draw the attention of CRA auditors. If a TFSA account is determined to be used for \"carrying on a business,\" all gains could end up being taxed as business income. So, if you dream of hanging up your scrubs to trade full-time, chat with a tax professional first. \u2014andrea Cross, CFP senior Financial Consultant, mD m anagement Limited This information should not be construed as offering specific financial, investment, foreign or domestic taxation, legal, accounting, or similar professional advice, nor is it intended to replace the advice of independent tax, accounting, or legal professionals.

The evolution of this relatively new subspecialty in BC over the past 40 years is highlighted. Major milestones include the establishment of an infec - tious diseases clinical pharmacy program, an infec - tious diseases fellowship program, an inpatient HIV/AIDS unit, a transplant infectious diseases service, a fellowship in reproductive infectious diseases program, and an Immunity and Infection Research Centre, as well as outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy and home intravenous anti- microbial treatment programs, outpatient clinics for tropical medicine and travel-acquired diseases, and cross-appointments with the BC Centre for Disease Control. anthony W. Chow, mD, F aCP , Fr CPC the subspecialty of adult infectious diseases in British Columbia: a personal perspective The evolution of the infectious diseases subspecialty in BC illustrates the dynamic nature of infectious diseases and the challenges and opportunities they present to the discipline. Dr Chow is a professor emeritus in the Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia and Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver Coastal Health. He is a pioneer of infectious diseases in BC and Western Canada. This article has been peer reviewed. In 1980, I wrote an editorial for the BC Medical Journal entitled \"The subspecialty of infectious disease (ID) and the multi- faceted role of the ID physician.\"1 The current theme issue offers a unique opportunity to re- flect upon the evolution of the discipline of infectious diseases in our province within the past 40 years and to speculate about its future. Historical perspective With the eradication of many classic commu- nicable diseases in the 1950s, the clinical disci- pline of infectious diseases vanished in Canada. Medical microbiologists who replaced general pathologists in directing the clinical microbi- ology laboratory became the main source of advice to clinicians on antimicrobial therapy and for undergraduate and postgraduate educa- tion. However, it became obvious that bedside consultations by specially trained clinicians in the management of complex diseases were needed. In the 1960s, several luminaries who had trained in the United States returned to Canada to assume academic positions within departments of medicine and/or pathology (notably, Drs Allan Ronald at the University of Manitoba, George Goldsand at the Univer- sity of Alberta, and Hugh Robson at McGill University). The Canadian Infectious Disease Society was established in 1976, and the sub- specialty of infectious diseases was formally approved by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada in 1980, with certifica- tion in 1983. Thus, a new clinical subspecialty of infectious diseases was born. It should be noted that the development of infectious dis-eases as a subspecialty of internal medicine or pediatrics in Canada lagged behind the United States by a decade.2 In the 1980s, due to health care reform and managed care in the United States, there was some concern about an oversupply of infec - tious diseases trainees to meet clinical needs. In contrast, the need for infectious diseases expertise in Canada has continued to escalate. Compared with the United States, where one infectious diseases physician served 110 000 people in 1987, Canada delivered only one in- fectious diseases physician per 220 000.3 It is clear that not all infections require the services of an infectious diseases specialist. Approxi- mately 80% of infections in the community can be managed adequately by family physicians or general internists and other specialists.3 How - ever, life-threatening and complicated infections should receive care from physicians with formal infectious diseases training [Table 1]. Further- more, there is conclusive evidence that infec- tious diseases consultations are associated with improved outcome in terms of patient survival, shortened hospitalization, and cost savings.4,5 The diversity and specialized nature of many infectious diseases have led some infectious diseases trainees to extend their fellowships by 156 BC MediC al Journal vol. 64 no. 4 | may 2022156clinical the subspecialty of adult infectious diseases in British Columbia: a personal perspective 1 to 2 years in order to pursue dual subspecialty certification. Examples include the following: Combined infectious diseases/medical microbiology: Many teaching and non - teaching hospitals are actively seeking well-trained physicians who can direct the clinical microbiology laboratory and provide leadership in antimicrobial stew - ardship, hospital infection control, quality assurance, and cost containment programs. The introduction of multiplex nucleic acid- based diagnostic tests and MALDI-TOF technologies in the microbiology laboratory has also revolutionized clinical virology and diagnostic microbiology by providing the ability to detect previously noncultivable or unrecognized pathogens, which makes this an exciting field for clinical and laboratory investigation. Combined infectious diseases/critical care medicine: Infections continue to maintain a conspicuous presence in ICUs worldwide, where rapid control of sepsis and shock, ap - propriate empirical antimicrobial therapy, and containment of antimicrobial resistance are of paramount importance. Although traditionally dominated by pulmonologists, formal training in infectious diseases by intensivists has strong appeal and potential for synergy in patient care, clinical investi - gation, and epidemiological research.6 Infectious diseases/HIV medicine/chronic diseases: Due to the increasing societal burden of chronic diseases, including the need for continuing care and antiviral therapy for HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis B and C, infections associated with injection drug use, and other opportunistic infec - tions in marginalized populations, there is increasing demand for specialization in this arena. Transplant infectious diseases: With the expansion of solid organ and stem cell transplantation, there is increasing demand for infectious diseases physicians who are specially trained in the management of transplant recipients and other immuno - compromised patient populations, including those with oncologic and rheumatologic conditions. The transplant infectious dis - eases physician is expected to be well versed not only in the epidemiology and risk assess - ment of uncommon infections, and unique clinical presentations associated with graft rejection and different phases of transplant progression or cancer chemotherapy, but also in the knowledge of specific immu - nosuppressive regimens and their toxici - ties, and the ability to deploy specialized diagnostic tools and administer appropriate empiric treatment or clinical trials. Finally, opportunities abound for infectious diseases physicians to pursue specialized training in areas such as public health and epidemiology, sexually transmitted infec - tions, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, travel-acquired diseases or tropical medi - cine, surgical infections, and reproductive or gynecologic infectious diseases. Evolution of the Division of Infectious Diseases in BC The University of British Columbia and Van- couver General Hospital (VGH) Division of In- fectious Diseases was established in 1979 when I was recruited from the Harbor-UCLA Medi- cal Center to join two outstanding young faculty members: Drs William Bowie and Irving Salit. Since all three of us had a similar training back- ground in the clinician-teacher-investigator mode, our collective goal for the division was to develop a model that integrated excellent patient care with quality teaching and schol- arly research. Our priority was to maximize the visibility of the clinical and teaching services through the provision of high-quality consul- tations that also served as an educational tool in the principles and practice of infectious dis- eases. High standards were expected from each written consultation note, which not only pro- vided clear management recommendations but also included a discussion of rationale based on available evidence, possible pathogenetic mechanisms, and a brief list of key references. To broaden the scope of exposure, inpatient consultations were provided throughout the hospital rather than on a dedicated hospital ward in isolation. Telephone consultations were accepted from throughout the province. The funding model was another strategic decision point that was well ahead of its time. The di- vision negotiated with the Medical Services Commission to provide inpatient consulta- tions for geographic full-time funding in lieu of fee-for-service billing. This allowed faculty to rotate off busy clinical services in order to attend to research and other academic pursuits. The subspecialty of infectious diseases in BC underwent substantial growth over the past 40 years, under the successive headships of Drs Anthony W. Chow (1978-1993), Neil E. Reiner (1994-2010), and Peter Phillips (2011-2020).

Some complicated or life-threatening infections that may benefit from an infectious diseases consultation.157 BC MediC al Journal vol. 64 no. 4 | may 2022157Chow, a W clinical The current UBC head is Dr Theodore Steiner. Division members are distributed within hospi- tals across all five health regions of the province [Table 2]. VGH, St. Paul's Hospital, and Sur- rey Memorial Hospital are the major tertiary referral centres for the most complicated infec- tious diseases in the province. All these centres maintain active inpatient consultative services, outpatient clinics for patients with special needs such as tropical or parasitic infections, HIV/ AIDS care, hepatitis B and C, chronic recalci- trant infections such as prosthetic infections, and skin and soft tissue infections, as well as outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy. The BC Infectious Diseases Society within the BC Medical Association (now Doctors of BC) was established in 2006 and currently has a membership of 79 practising infectious diseases physicians in the province. A full list- ing of the UBC-affiliated infectious diseases faculty and associate members is provided on the division's website (https://id.med.ubc.ca/ faculty-members). The following summarizes the major milestones of the division over the past 40 years. Linkages with medical microbiology and clinical pharmacy Critical liaisons were created with both the Division of Medical Microbiology within the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and the Division of Clinical Phar- macy within the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, both at VGH and UBC Hospital. These productive collaborations were pivotal for allowing the Division of Infectious Diseases to gain influence in the provision of key labora- tory services for the management of difficult infectious diseases, and to share leadership in hospital infection control and antimicrobial stewardship. Together with the Division of Clinical Pharmacy, the Division of Infectious Diseases also pioneered the establishment of an infectious diseases clinical pharmacy program at VGH in which clinical pharmacy residents joined the infectious diseases faculty on daily consultation rounds and assisted in antimi - crobial stewardship, drug-drug interactions, pharmacokinetic surance activities. hospitalAttending infectious diseases specialistsConsultation services and specialty clinics vancouver Coastal health VGH, UBC Hospital, BC Cancer Agency, GF Strong Rehabilitation CentreTed Steiner, William Bowie, Richard Lester, Robert Reynolds, Neil Reiner, Jan Hajek, Alissa Wright, Allison Mah, Sara Katherine infectious diseases (ID)Tropical diseasesTransplant IDOPAT and home IV UBC-BC STI, TB, antimicrobial Mary Kestler, Melanie Alissa Wright, Queenie Dinh, Victor Leung, David Harris, Mark Hull, William Connors, Julio Montaner, David Moore General IDTransplant IDHIV/AIDS, hepatitis B and CAddiction medicine BC Women's Hospital and Health Centre and Oak Tree ClinicNeora Pick, Melanie Murray, Mary Kestler, Katherine Plewes, Deborah Money,* TorchinskyGeneral IDOPAT Fraser health Surrey Memorial Hospital (includes coverage for Peace Arch, Langley Memorial, and Delta Hospitals)Yazdan Mirzanejad, Michael Chapman, Greg Deans, Patrick Wong, Kevin Afra General IDTropical diseasesHIV/AIDS, hepatitis B and COPAT HospitalYasemin Arikan, Anurag Markanday General ID Island health Royal Jubilee Hospital and Victoria General HospitalWayne Ghesquiere, Eric TealeGeneral IDSexually transmitted infectionsHIV/AIDS, hepatitisOPAT and home IVTable 2.

Members at the BCCDC who had infectious diseases training were extraordinari- ly successful in the provincial response to the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak; the SARS-CoV-1 ac- celerated vaccine initiative; the H1N1 pandem- ic; the expansion of immunization programming and drug addiction, overdose, and harm reduc- tion programs; sexually transmitted infection and TB control; surveillance of antimicrobial resistance within BC; and most recently, surveil- lance and testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Fellowship training program The UBC infectious diseases fellowship pro- gram, first established in 1982 as one of three programs in the country that was fully accredited by the Royal College of Physicians and Sur- geons of Canada, is designed to attract candi- dates who have completed internal medicine training and are motivated toward a career as clinician-scientists, clinician-educators, or con- sultant specialists in the community. The program provides integrated inpatient and outpatient ro- tations within various affiliated institutions, as well as training in epidemiological and micro- biological research.

It has become the premier training program in the country. An unexpected benefit of the current COVID-19 pandemic is the creation of a phenomenally successful and well-attended weekly infectious diseases confer- ence that is accessible by Zoom to all infectious diseases physicians throughout the province. Outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy and home intravenous antimicrobial treatment programs One of the earliest outpatient parenteral an- timicrobial therapy clinics in the country was started at VGH in 1982 by Dr H. Grant Stiver, who demonstrated that this mode of antimicro- bial delivery was both safe and cost-effective.7 Candidates include patients with bone and joint infections; selective cases of infective endocar- ditis; some acute infections such as skin and soft tissue infections; and urinary, respiratory, and gastrointestinal infections without prior hospitalization. With few exceptions, outpa- tient parenteral antimicrobial therapy clinics are available at all UBC-affiliated teaching hos- pitals and are supervised by infectious diseases specialists. HIV/AIDS and the Urban Health Acute Care UnitIn 1992, at the height of the HIV/AIDS epi- demic, Drs Michael O'Shaughnessy, Martin Schechter, and Julio Montaner established the BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS at St. Paul's Hospital and led an interdisciplinary team that targeted the treatment and preven- tion of HIV/AIDS and opportunistic infec- tions. Dr Montaner and his group were lead researchers on the highly active antiretroviral treatment and \"treatment as prevention\" strate- gies that have since been adopted worldwide. The inpatient HIV/AIDS unit at St. Paul's Hospital was established in 1997. It was unique in Canada and attracted undergraduate and postgraduate trainees from across the country for preceptorships in epidemiological investiga- tions and care of marginalized populations. The success of highly active antiretroviral treatment and treatment as prevention strategies trans- formed the rapidly fatal condition of HIV/ AIDS into a manageable chronic disease. How- ever, the number of patients with complications from infections due to injection drug use that require hospitalization and other marginal- ized patient populations have continued to escalate. The Urban Health Acute Care Unit was established at St. Paul's Hospital in 2014 to meet these needs; it supersedes the former HIV/AIDS unit. The facility provides inpatient care for all patients, both HIV-positive and negative, with complex infections and serves as a provincial tertiary care resource for addiction medicine and other acute and chronic condi- tions in marginalized populations. In addition, the Hope to Health Research & Innovation Centre was established in 2019 to provide in- tegrated and accessible ambulatory health care to clients in the Vancouver Eastside inner city who have complex needs. Transplant infectious diseases The transplant infectious diseases service at VGH was established in 2016 and provides both inpatient and outpatient consults for solid organ transplant and leukemia, and for bone marrow transplant recipients. The service also attends to outpatient consults for solid organ recipients from St. Paul's Hospital. Currently, approximately 500 solid organ transplants, in- cluding heart, lung, kidney, liver, and pancre - as, are performed annually. The service is also linked administratively with BC Transplant for clinical trials and quality improvement projects. clinical the subspecialty of adult infectious diseases in British Columbia: a personal perspective Table 2 ( continued from 157).

Division members also co-direct the UBC Neglected Global Diseases Initiative (http://ngdi.ubc.ca), which addresses 18 neglected tropical diseases designated by the World Health Organization, including HIV/ AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, and the Geo- Sentinel surveillance network (www.istm.org/ geosentinel), a worldwide communication and surveillance network for tracking geographic and temporal trends in morbidity among trav- elers, immigrants, and refugees. Immunity and Infection Research Centre Several scientists were recruited to VGH to investigate the pathogenesis and molecular mechanisms and inflammatory bowel disease, fecal trans- plantation, and more recently the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The success of these research programs culminated in the creation of the Immunity and Infection Research Centre within the Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute in 2011. This vir- tual centre brought together approximately 20 principal investigators and 50 to 60 graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and research as- sociates in a highly productive and collaborative research environment. Key infectious diseases pioneers in BC Several individuals played key roles in the de- velopment of the infectious diseases specialty in British Columbia. Dr Robert M.T. Chan was the first infectious diseases specialist in Vancouver in 1975 and practised at St. Paul's Hospital until retirement in 2011. He was also among the first in BC to be accredited in infectious diseases by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. Dr Frank Jagdis was the first and only infectious diseases consultant on Vancouver Island in 1976 when he attended the Royal Ju- bilee and Victoria General Hospitals in Victoria until retirement in 2010. Although trained as a pediatrician, he treated both adults and children in his practice. Dr Christopher Wong was the Reproductive infectious diseases and the Oak Tree Clinic In partnership with the UBC Division of Infec- tious Diseases, Dr Deborah Money established the first fellowship in reproductive infectious diseases program in Canada within BC Wom- en's Hospital and Health Centre, with a focus on subspecialty training for obstetricians and gynecologists. She also established the Infec- tious Diseases Clinic within BC Women's to provide unique expertise in the management of women with HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B or C, human papillomaviruses, infections dur- ing pregnancy, and other complex gynecologic infections. The Oak Tree Clinic, also housed within BC Women's, is a multidisciplinary fa-cility that provides specialized care to women, children, and their families who are living with HIV/AIDS. It is a provincial resource and pro- vides educational support for health care work- ers, organizations, institutions, and the public. There is a strong research program focused on clinical trials in HIV/hepatitis co-infections, human papillomaviruses, and reproductive, en- docrine, and metabolic health of women with HIV/AIDS. Global health, tropical diseases, and GeoSentinel surveillanceThe Division of Infectious Diseases conducts weekly outpatient clinics at VGH and Sur- rey Memorial Hospital for tropical medicine and travel-acquired diseases. These clinics are supported by the BC Centre for Disease Control's parasitology laboratory and zoonotic and emerging pathogens program. The division also offers an annual tropical and geographic medicine course at UBC, the first of its kind in Western Canada. The UBC Division of Infectious Diseases has had a strong interna- tional presence, including a Canadian Interna- tional Development Agency (CIDA)-funded training and treatment program for chronic hepatitis B in mainland China (1988-1992), a CIDA-Peru-Canada biomedical training pro- gram in Lima, Peru (1989-1994), and mul- tiple CIDA-sponsored projects to establish a network of sexually transmitted infection clinics for low-income sex trade workers in southern Vietnam (1998-2010). More recent international connections include investigations first infectious diseases specialist to join Fraser Health in 1977 and practised in Royal Colum-bian Hospital until retirement in 2016. Summary It has been most gratifying to see how the sub- specialty of infectious diseases has flourished in BC within the past 40 years. It is particularly rewarding to witness how well our trainees have fared and are continuing to contribute to this relatively new but important discipline across our province. In the current COVID-19 pan- demic, the subspecialty of infectious diseases is finally getting the attention it is due, both in the public and the health care community. With continued support from the Province and UBC, I have no doubt our subspecialty will continue to mature and provide invalu- able service to our patients and community for generations to come. n Competing interests None declared. references 1.

In BC, the practice has evolved over many decades to include both hospital-based and outpatient infusion centres, as well as home intravenous programs. Numerous publications demonstrate the safety, efficacy, and cost reduc - tion of outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy, while reducing congestion in emergency depart - ments.

The practice of administering IV antibi- otics in an outpatient setting was first described in Houston, Texas, in 1974, when an indwelling IV infusion set was used to treat chronic bronchopulmonary infection as- sociated with cystic fibrosis in a pediatric popu- lation.1 Numerous Canadian and international studies have evaluated the benefit of outpatient antimicrobial therapy in a variety of settings, including home administration and outpatient infusion centres.2-4 In 1978, Dr Grant Stiver reported on the first Canadian IV antibiotic therapy at-home model, which involved 23 patients in Winnipeg over 12 months. Once infection had begun to resolve, patients who no longer required hospitalization could safely receive treatment through a home care program. The therapeutic efficacy and considerable cost savings of the model were also demonstrated.5 In 1995, BC formally incorporated outpatient antimicrobial therapy into the regional home care program at the Vancouver Hospital and Health Sciences Centre.6 These models have provided many benefits to health care systems, including reducing the length of hospital stay and avoiding unnecessary hospitalization, mini- mizing the risk of nosocomial complications, and improving patient quality of life.2 Over the decades, the use of outpatient antimicrobial therapy has become a routine practice, with infectious diseases specialists expanding its ap- plication in managing increasingly complex infectious diseases. The Infectious Diseases Society of America defines outpatient parenteral antimicrobial ther- apy (OPAT) as the administration of at least two doses of antimicrobial on different days without intervening hospitalization.3 Over time, three main models of OPAT have been created: infusion centre, home-based administration, and skilled nursing facility. These different set- tings facilitate the delivery of medication and minimize the duration of patient hospitaliza-tion for antimicrobial therapy. Each modality operates under different criteria: some require patients to return to a health care facility such as a hospital clinic or outpatient centre for an- timicrobial therapy, while in others, patients can receive antimicrobial treatment at home. Delivery models In the infusion centre model, antimicrobial therapy can be delivered in outpatient health care facilities. This model involves the greatest degree of clinical oversight by a multidisci - plinary care team, which includes regular as- sessments by infectious diseases specialists and other physician groups, nursing administration of antimicrobial therapy and wound care, and 161 BC MediC al Journal vol. 64 no. 4 | may 2022161azhir a, Chapman m clinical clinical pharmacist support for patient educa- tion and monitoring. The infusion centre can also be part of the acute care hospital setting, as an extension of the emergency department.3 The nurse administration model was de- veloped for patients who are eligible to receive antimicrobial therapy at home.3 In this setting, patients can receive visits from home nursing staff once or twice a day to administer anti- microbial therapy and conduct clinical assess- ments, or select patients can also be educated about aseptic techniques for antimicrobial self-administration at home. This model re- quires a certain level of patient or caregiver competency. In the skilled nursing facility model, regis- tered nurses administer antimicrobial therapy and provide other nursing needs, such as wound care. The outpatient approach to antimicrobial therapy is highly cost-effective for the health care system.2 At Surrey Memorial Hospital and the Jim Pattison Outpatient Care and Surgery Centre, the infectious diseases specialist-led infusion centre model with connections to the community for home IV therapy was originally created by Dr Yazdan Mirzanejad in 2005 and serves as a successful model for treating outpa - tient infections [Figure 1]. Patients are referred from the emergency department and inpatient wards and directly from the community for infectious diseases consultation. Following assessment, the infectious diseases physician determines a care plan that is carried out with the support of a multidisciplinary team in the most appropriate setting. Antimicrobials A wide range of antimicrobial therapy is used in OPAT; Table 1 lists common antimicrobi- als that are used. The choice of antimicrobial agent depends on the OPAT model and the Common antimicrobial therapy Infusion centre home Iv therapy Amphotericin antimicrobial therapy. pharmacokinetic properties of the antimicro- bial. For example, in infusion centres, due to specific hours of operation, it is practical to use only antimicrobials that require administration once or twice a day. Consequently, the home IV therapy model is a favorable option because a greater variety of antimicrobial therapies can be administered via a programmable pump with different dosing frequencies and narrower spec- trums of activity. The OPAT setting can be used to practise antimicrobial stewardship. The optimal practice consists of a timely transition from intravenous to oral antibiotics. This needs to be considered both at the point of referral to OPAT and dur - ing the course of therapy. General principles for when to step down from IV to suitable oral options include assessing the patient's clinical condition and ability to absorb oral antibiotic therapy, the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynam- ic properties of oral agents, the availability of OPATReduces length of stay Reduces overall health care costs Increases patient convenience and satisfactionMinimizes risk of nosocomial complicationsDecongests emergency department Figure 1.

Efficacy Emergency department flow and decongestion Emergency department overcrowding, and prolonged wait times to receive treatment and specialist visits are persistent problems for many hospitals in different countries.8 Congestion in the emergency department affects flow through the health care system, and in times of global crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic, it be-comes essential to use resources such as infu-sion centres to help ease congestion. Changes in admitting patterns have been one way of reducing demand for hospital beds.9 Patients who require IV antibiotics may receive care in infusion centres. In this model, the appropriate specialty services at each facility are responsible for disease management and minimizing the need for general internal medicine physicians or hospitalists to admit patients to hospital and occupy emergency department beds.8 The initial model of patient referral from the emergency department to infusion centre was created for adults with nonpurulent skin and soft tissue infection, which avoided hospitalization if pa- tients were not septic.10 Previous emergency department-based studies indicated that IV antibiotics are one of the most frequently ad- ministered medications in those settings.11,12 The infusion centre model benefits the health care system because fewer return visits are made to emergency departments and family physician clinics. It also reduces emergency department overcrowding and helps identify adverse ef- fects or treatment failures in a timely manner, which further reduces repeat presentations to the emergency department. The three main goals achieved by this model are reduced hos- pital admissions, increased patient convenience, and reduced number of emergency department visits.13 A 2013 retrospective study of 1900 pa- tients referred from the Surrey Memorial Hos- pital emergency department to the infusion centre at the Jim Pattison Outpatient Care and Surgery Centre for treatment of a variety of conditions revealed a median stay of 6.1 days, resulting in 3456 patient-days diverted from the emergency department and inpatient beds.14 Minimizing extended antibiotic exposure Advances in infusion centre device technol- ogy and drug stability have made it possible to administer a wider range of antimicrobial therapies that previously were not practical in an OPAT setting.3 However, appropriate treatment begins with the correct diagnosis. Many \"infectious mimickers\" present in these settings; therefore, it is essential to correctly identify the infection being treated in order to determine appropriate management [Table 3].

At the same time, antibiotics are not benign interventions, and unnecessary or inappropriate therapy can lead to community and patient harm, including antimicrobial re- sistance or harm associated with adverse ef- fects.15 In the OPAT setting, regardless of the model chosen, it is the treating physician's re- sponsibility to direct and manage antimicrobial therapy. In the Surrey model and elsewhere around the province, the infectious diseases specialist is responsible for selecting the anti-microbial agent and duration of treatment in OPAT. Patients on IV antimicrobials may be discharged from the emergency department to infusion centres. They subsequently have a visit with the infectious diseases specialist in 1 to 3 days, at which time their treatment is further modified or, in some cases, discontin- ued if an infection is no longer present. In a study conducted in Queensland, Australia, the pattern of antibiotic prescribing in the emer- gency department and its overall appropriate - ness were evaluated by a panel of experts from the fields of infectious disease, microbiology, and emergency medicine, and by a senior an- timicrobial stewardship pharmacist. It showed that in 1 in 3 patients who were prescribed an antibiotic regimen, the regimen was assessed as either suboptimal or inadequate. The antibiotic prescription was most commonly deemed to be inappropriate when the agent chosen was too broad, there was an unnecessary overlap of spectrums, or antibiotics were not required at all.15 In 2013, a single-centre study in an infusion centre in Surrey, BC, showed that infectious diseases specialists modified the ini- tial antibiotic therapy in 373 (66%) episodes of OPAT. The most common interventions were transitioning to oral antibiotic therapy (34%), discontinuation of antibiotic therapy (5%), and other changes including changes to alternative IV antibiotics (27%). This re- sulted in early antibiotic de-escalation in 211 patients.14 A similar OPAT study conducted over 10 years with 7000 patients in Victoria, BC, showed that changes to initial antibiotic therapy given in the emergency department were made in 35% of patients.16 Safety Adverse events Outpatient antimicrobial therapy allows pa - tients to receive parenteral therapy outside acute care settings. While hospitalized, patients have ready access to clinical assessments and laboratory testing to detect potential adverse drug events, whereas in OPAT settings, the frequency of this testing is reduced.17 The types of adverse events associated with antimicrobi-als are not expected to be different for OPAT patients compared with hospital patients, but the incidence of reactions may differ.3 In OPAT settings, patients may require long durations of antimicrobial therapy (weeks or months) because the outpatient service provides an op- portunity to treat more complex infections (e.g., prosthetic joint infections and osteomyelitis), which will increase the cumulative incidence of adverse events to a variety of medications as treatment lengths increase. A readmission rate of 14% to 27% is common among OPAT patients.14,18,19 A patient's readmission to hospi- tal can be related to a variety of factors, includ- ing age, history of a drug-resistant organism, prior hospitalization in the past 12 months, and adverse events. In the Surrey, BC, infu- sion centre study of 2013, treatment failure occurred in 14.0% of patients and consisted of the following: 1.0% worsening mortality; the total success rate was 82.0%. 14 A study conducted at Tufts Medical Center in Boston showed that the most common reasons for 30-day readmission in 207 patients were not related to infection (30%) or the result of infection worsening (30%); how- ever, 14% of patients were readmitted due to adverse events associated with antimicrobial treatment.19 In a prospective study of 339 pa- tients in Israel who were discharged to OPAT, 14.5% had significant adverse drug events that required a change in therapy, early termination of therapy, or readmission, or that resulted in Clostridioides difficile infection. Patients were at higher risk of developing significant adverse drug events in their first 2 weeks of OPAT, known as the hospital-to-home transition peri - od, which highlights the importance of prudent prescribing of OPAT, ensuring proper dosing of medication, educating patients, and careful monitoring of adverse drug events. 18 Even though Clostridioides difficile infections are one of the adverse drug events related to re- admission, the occurrence of these infections in patients receiving OPAT is rare. A retrospective study of 1514 patients in the UK who received antimicrobial therapy in teaching hospitals from 2006 to 2011 and who completed 16 750 OPAT days reported only seven patients with Clos- tridioides difficile infection; all but one of those patients had other possible causes of Clostridi - oides difficile infection.20 The detection rate for Clostridioides difficile infections among OPAT patients is sufficiently low (2%) that with proper monitoring and clinical assessment, receiving prolonged courses of antimicrobial therapy in an OPAT setting is safe for patients. 21 Peripheral line complication The delivery of antimicrobial therapy in OPAT requires the use of vascular access devices. The type of device used varies based on different practice settings, the anticipated duration of treatment, and the antimicrobial selected.22 The principal central devices used in OPAT are peripherally inserted central catheters and long-term central catheters. There are two main types of long-term central catheter: tunneled Patients were at higher risk of developing significant adverse drug events in their first 2 weeks of OP at, known as the hospital- to-home transition period, which highlights the importance of prudent prescribing of OPat, ensuring proper dosing of medication, educating patients, and careful monitoring of adverse drug events.164 BC MediC al Journal vol. 64 no. 4 | may 2022164Figure 2. Outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) benefit of care model.central venous catheters and ports.3 Peripher- ally inserted central catheters are inserted by a clinical nurse specialist; long-term central catheters need to be inserted by the radiology department. Each OPAT model, whether it involves home infusion, a hospital or outpatient facility infusion centre, or community centres, has specific vascular access requirements. Pe- ripherally inserted central catheter lines are the most common type of vascular access used in an outpatient setting. In a large 13-year cohort study in the UK, peripherally inserted central catheter lines were used in 64% of patients who received antimicrobial therapy in infusion cen- tres and in 71% of patients who received therapy at home.23 Vascular catheters can put patients at risk of complications. Common complications are vascular catheter-related infection, occlu- sion, and venous thrombosis. Vascular catheter- related infection is defined as positive blood cultures or obvious purulence at the catheter site, which requires catheter removal. Vascular occlusions occur when the patient or caregiver is unable to infuse the IV antimicrobial due to lack of flow. Venous thrombosis is identified by clinical imaging evidence of deep or superficial venous thrombosis in the blood vessels.22 In a retrospective study of 2766 OPAT patients in Scotland, line infection limited to midlines, peripherally inserted central catheters, and tunneled central venous catheters occurred in 2.3% of all line episodes (0.8 per 1000 line-use days).24 In another retrospective cohort study in the United States, line complications in 3161 OPAT patient encounters were analyzed. Only OPAT courses that were conducted at home were included. The study identified 131 (9%) patients who had one or more vascular access complications, for a total of 144 complications, with an overall rate of 4.29 complications per 1000 OPAT days.20 The most common com- plication was line occlusion, at a rate of 2.26 events per 1000 OPAT days. Thrombosis and line infection each occurred in less than 1% of OPAT courses overall, with only five line infec- tions and 12 thrombotic complications.22 Line complications can occur in the OPAT setting; however, the rate of severe complications such as line infections and thrombotic events is low in both infusion centres and home IV therapy. Cost Cost reduction of outpatient therapy Outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy is associated with a low risk of adverse events such as hospital readmission and line compli- cations, and is an effective model for easing hospital congestion and minimizing extended antibiotic exposure. Cost analysis from a local study conducted at Vancouver General Hos- pital in 1995 indicated that from a hospital perspective, the cost of therapy through the OPAT program was approximately 13% of the cost estimated if the patient received the same therapy as an inpatient.25 The estimated cost of providing outpatient antimicrobial therapy in a hospital setting was $1 997 923, of which $1 659 303 was attributed to the cost of hos- pitalization. The cost of outpatient parenteral antibacterial therapy was $267 403, which in-cluded the cost of labor (pharmacy and nurse educator), laboratory blood tests, catheters, and complications.26 A cost analysis study in the UK that compared the expense of different OPAT models showed that treatment at infusion cen- tres (\u00a3973) was more expensive than at-home infusion by a general nurse (\u00a3788) or special- ist nurse (\u00a3710) for short-term treatments of 4 to 7 days. For patients who required a longer duration of antibiotic therapy, the cost associ- ated with infusion centres (\u00a35135) was also greater than that of home infusions by a general nurse (\u00a32957) or specialist nurse (\u00a32379).26 The analysis showed that home infusion for both long- and short-term therapy was highly cost-effective. Another major economic benefit of OPAT is the reduction in the cost of noso-comial infections associated with hospitaliza-tion. In the United States, 5% of hospitalized patients may develop an infection during their hospitalization; each infection is estimated to cost US$2100, with a cumulative annual cost of more than US$2 billion.27 OPAT settings are Infusion centre antimicrobial therapy Direct referral from community for drug-resistant infectionsStabilized inpatients requiring ongoing IV antimicrobials Home IV therapy Transition to oral therapy or discontinuation of antimicrobialDirect referral from community for complex woundsDirect referral from emergency department Infectious diseases specialist consultationOPATclinical Delivery models, efficacy, safety, and cost reduction of outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy in BC165 BC MediC al Journal vol. 64 no. 4 | may 2022165safe and cost-effective for patients to receive treatment at home or at infusion centres, and minimize the risk of nosocomial infections. Cost-saving methods The cost analysis literature in outpatient settings is limited, but with continuous changes in drug delivery systems, there is potential for further cost reduction. There is increasing evidence that self-administration of IV antimicrobial therapy is safe and reduces costs.28 The use of elasto - meric pumps facilitates outpatient management and favors the use of first-line antimicrobial agents.29 This delivery model reduces the cost associated with nursing and clinic visits, and gives patients more flexibility while being treat- ed.28 Future research on the cost-effectiveness of OPAT services using different drug delivery devices and the use of resources for facilitating at-home infusions will be essential in order to provide better decision making regarding out-patient treatments. Summary For nearly 50 years, OPAT has been proven to be a safe, effective, and cost-saving model of care for patients with severe infections [Fig- ure 2]. Infectious diseases specialists play an increasing role in the management of complex infections in the outpatient setting. The in - creasing number of severe infections, immuno- compromised patients, and multidrug-resistant organisms will shape the future of OPAT. The COVID-19 pandemic has placed a strain on acute care hospitals over the past 2 years, and the ability to provide safe and effective care in outpatient settings has never been more criti- cal. Realizing the cost-saving benefits of OPAT requires increasing investments in resources for infusion centres to reduce congestion in the emergency department and for home IV services to allow patients to convalesce at home with their family. n Competing interests None declared. references 1.

Some infections, such as Pneumocystis pneumonia and cytomegalovirus infection, commonly affect all transplant recipi- ents, whereas some infections are more specific to certain transplant types, such as cholangitis in liver transplant recipients, urinary tract infections in renal transplant patients, and pulmonary mold s.

Numerous protocols and procedures exist to identify and mitigate infectious risk in transplant patients, as do specific treatment strategies. This article pro - vides an overview of the epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of common infections in transplant patients, with a focus on commu - nity practitioners caring for this ever-increasing population. The number of solid organ transplant recipients is steadily increasing in British Columbia. In 2020, 253 kid- ney transplants, 71 liver transplants, 32 heart transplants, and 51 double lung transplants were performed in BC.1 These transplant recipients reside throughout the province; therefore, all health care providers should have a general un- derstanding of common issues this population may face. Infections are a major complication of transplantation and are associated with sig-nificant morbidity and mortality. 2 We review risk periods for infections and chemoprophylaxis, with particular attention to management of cytomegalovirus. Additionally, we focus on management of the most common community onset infections, including recur- rent urinary tract infections in kidney trans- plant recipients, intra-abdominal infections in liver transplant recipients, and mold and respiratory virus infections in lung transplant recipients. Infection risk and prophylaxis In solid organ transplantation, in general, the post-transplant period is divided into three risk periods: early (first month), intermedi- ate (1 to 6 months), and late post-transplant (beyond 6 months)3,4 [Table 1]. All solid or- gan transplant recipients receive perioperative antibacterial prophylaxis to reduce the risk of surgical site infection. In addition, the 2019 American Society of Transplantation Infectious Diseases Community of Practice candidiasis guidelines recommend Candida prophylaxis for adult liver transplant recipients with one or more of the following risk factors: prolonged or repeat operation, retransplantation, renal failure requiring dialysis, high transfusion requirement, hepaticojejunostomy, and Candida coloniza- tion during the perioperative transplant ischemia at the bronchial receipt of a single-lung transplant, hypogammaglobulinemia, cytomegalovirus in- and pre-/post-transplant airways Aspergillus spp. are consid- ered high-risk situations for post-transplant mold infections.6167 BC MediC al Journal vol. 64 no. 4 | may 2022167Early (< 1 month) Intermediate (1-6 months) Late (> 6 months) Perioperative infections: aspiration pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia, catheter-associated urinary tract line-associated bloodstream infections, surgical site e.g., bacteremia With Pneumocystis and antiviral (cytomegalovirus/herpes simplex virus, hepatitis B virus) prophylaxis: BK virus nephropathy, respiratory viral infection, Cryptococcus, Mycobacterium s, Oravec t, Belga s, Wright a, m ah a clinical In all solid organ transplant recipients, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia is recommended for a minimum of 1 year post- transplant, and in BC, it is often continued for the duration of the recipient's life due to infrequent but severe cases of late P . jirovecii pneumonia, which have occurred in the British Columbia transplant program. Table 2 sum - marizes the current recommendations in BC for antiviral prophylaxis against the most com- mon viral pathogens encountered in solid organ transplant recipients.7 Cytomegalovirus Cytomegalovirus is the most frequently occur- ring opportunistic viral infection following solid organ transplant. It affects all organ transplants and is a major infectious cause of morbidity and mortality in transplant recipients.8 In addition to having direct effects of end organ disease, cy- tomegalovirus has a number of indirect effects, including increased risk of bacteremia and inva- sive fungal infections in solid organ transplant recipients. It has also been associated with an increased risk for Epstein-Barr virus-mediated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease, increased risk of acute rejection, and chronic allograft dysfunction.8 The primary infection with cytomegalo- virus may be asymptomatic or it may cause a self-limited febrile illness in immunocompetent individuals.8 After primary infection, cytomega- lovirus establishes a lifelong latent infection that can periodically reactivate and cause shedding of an infectious virus. 9 Cytomegalovirus infection is the presence of cytomegalovirus replication in tissue, blood, or other bodily fluids, regardless of symptoms. Conversely, cytomegalovirus disease is cyto- megalovirus infection with clinical symptoms. The latter is subdivided into cytomegalovirus viral syndrome, with fever, malaise, lympho - cytosis, others.8 Cytomegalovirus serologic status of do- nor and recipient are the key predictors of cytomegalovirus disease after transplanta-tion.

Populations at higher risk are Cytomegalovirus-seronegative organ recipients of seropositive donors (Cytomeg- alovirus mis-match), therapy, such as antithymocyte globulin.10 If Cytomegalovirus-IgG is indeterminate, pro- viders should assume the highest-risk scenario (e.g., the cytomegalovirus-indeterminant donor is assumed to be positive).8 Post-transplant, molecular tests that de- tect cytomegalovirus DNA in blood are the preferred methods for cytomegalovirus moni- toring and for diagnosing cytomegalovirus in- fection. The diagnosis of tissue-invasive disease depends on the presence of positive findings by histopathology. Importantly, the degree of cytomegalovirus viremia may not necessarily correlate with the severity of tissue-invasive disease. This is most commonly seen in cyto- megalovirus enteritis.8,10 There are two cy- tomegalovirus prophylaxis and cytomegalovirus monitoring with pre-emptive therapy.10 These approaches are generally managed by transplant teams during the first year post-transplant when recipients are at greatest risk of cytomegalovirus viremia and disease. Late cytomegalovirus dis- ease can occur beyond 1 year post-transplant, and if clinical concern exists for this entity, community providers can send blood for cy- tomegalovirus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. In BC, all cytomegalovirus PCR testing is sent to and performed at St. Paul's Hospi- tal's virology laboratory. Importantly, ordering providers must specify that cytomegalovirus PCR or viral load is what is desired because the default lab test for cytomegalovirus in blood is serologic testing, which is of no utility in the diagnosis being sought. For cytomegalovirus prophylaxis, valgan - ciclovir 900 mg orally once daily is currently used for the highest-risk groups [Table 2]. The main side effect of valganciclovir is cy- topenias. If this occurs, valganciclovir should be discontinued and pre-emptive monitoring instituted. The dose of valganciclovir should not be lowered to manage cytopenias because it increases the risk of resistance. Letermovir is a novel agent against cytomegalovirus that does not cause significant cytopenias. There is an ongoing randomized controlled trial of letermovir versus valganciclovir for prophylaxis of transplant recipients (ClinicalTrials.gov identi- fier: NCT03443869). Pre-emptive therapy is the administration of an antiviral only to those who develop evidence of rising cytomegalovirus DNA that surpasses a given threshold on PCR monitoring. Treat- ment is with valganciclovir 900 mg orally twice daily, and cytomegalovirus PCRs should be monitored weekly. Therapy is discontinued and weekly monitoring is continued after two se- quential negative cytomegalovirus PCRs spaced 1 week apart. Cytomegalovirus disease is treated with IV ganciclovir 5 mg/kg every 12 hours or oral val- ganciclovir 900 mg twice daily, adjusted based on renal function. Both are equally effective for mild to moderate disease. IV ganciclovir is the drug of choice in severe or life-threatening cy- tomegalovirus disease. Second-line agents may include foscarnet or cidofovir, but their use is limited by renal toxicity and IV-only formula-tions. The duration of treatment of cytomega- lovirus disease depends on the resolution of clinical symptoms and two sequential negative cytomegalovirus DNA levels. Patients with cytomegalovirus disease who fail to respond to therapy after more than 2 weeks of full-dose antiviral therapy should be assessed for the possibility of drug-resistant cytomegalovirus in consultation with specialists in infectious diseases or transplant infectious diseases. Management of common community onset infections by organ group Intra-abdominal infections in liver transplant recipients Risk of intra-abdominal infection following liver transplantation is relatively high11 due pri- marily to the technically complicated nature of liver transplantation, particularly regarding biliary anastomoses. 12 Most liver transplanta- tion is tomosis) or Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.13 The duct-to-duct approach is preferred because it results in a more natural anatomy with preservation of the sphincter of Oddi, which is important in reducing reflux of intestinal contents into the transplanted organ. How- ever, duct-to-duct procedures are not always feasible. Roux-en-Y procedures involve direct juxtaposition of the small intestine with the biliary system and significantly increase the risk of reflux. Vascular complications, includ- ing hepatic artery and portal vein thrombo- sis, also predispose transplant recipients to intra-abdominal infection due to hepatic ne- Prompt recog- nition of intra-abdominal infection following organ transplantation is important, and the early initiation of empiric antimicrobial ther- apy coupled with source control, potentially requiring surgical intervention, is necessary to optimize outcomes.12 An additional factor that complicates intra-abdominal infection in solid organ transplant recipients is increased rates of colonization by multidrug-resistant organisms, which affects the choice of empiric antimicrobial coverage [Table 3].14-16 Infections of surgical incisions should be suspected in patients presenting with pain, erythema, discharge, or dehiscence of wounds, typically within the first 30 days following transplantation.17 Patients presenting with in- cisional infections should receive imaging to evaluate for the presence of deeper infection requiring more aggressive surgical debride- ment. These patients should undergo bedside or operative inspection of their wound to fa- cilitate diagnosis of additional complications, collection of microbiologic specimens for cul-ture, and thorough washout and debridement if applicable. Ultimately, choice and duration of antimicrobial therapy will be dictated by careful consideration of microbiologic testing and clinical response. 12,17 Abdominal solid organ transplant recipi- ents presenting with clinical signs of perito- nitis should receive evaluation by medical and surgical teams, as this may signify perforation or anastomotic leak. 18 Given the immunosup- pression used in solid organ transplant, patients with leaks or perforation may not manifest the usual signs and often present with fever alone; a high degree of clinical suspicion should be maintained, particularly in the first 3 months 169 BC MediC al Journal vol. 64 no. 4 | may 2022169following transplantation.12 Blood and surgi - cal site culture collection, initiation of empiric antimicrobial therapy [Table 3], acquisition of abdominal imaging, and prompt surgical exploration when indicated are important for optimizing outcomes. Definitive management will be dependent on radiographic and/or operative findings. An- timicrobials should be tailored based on micro- biologic results and should be continued until source control has been obtained. 12 Following definitive source control, the duration of an- timicrobial therapy is not clearly established. The STOP-IT trial demonstrated equivalent outcomes in patients who received short courses (~4 days) of antimicrobials following source control versus those who received longer courses (~8 days); however, the trial did not include solid organ transplant recipients.19 Optimal duration in this population is unknown. In general, 1 to 2 weeks of antibiotics are given following source control; longer durations are used if residual collections remain. Liver transplant patients are predisposed to developing intrahepatic infections.12 Biliary strictures, developing recur- rent cholangitis, while biliary leaks contribute to the formation of bilomas and hepatic abscesses. These infections do not occur in isolation: bili- ary ischemia can result in both and duct perforation (resulting in biloma Bilomas may become infected and result in hepatic abscess formation. Both bilomas and abscesses may compromise blood flow and result in further bile duct ischemia and additional stricturing or leaks. Urinary tract infections in kidney transplant recipients Urinary tract infection is the most common in - fectious complication among kidney transplant recipients.20 These infections most commonly occur in the first year after transplantation but may occur at any time.21 Urinary tract infections have been shown to be associated with increased mortality and renal allograft loss.22 Even a single urinary tract infection after transplantation is enough to increase the risk of impaired allograft function.23 Urinary tract infections also increase the risk of acute cellular rejection.24 Almost one-third of patients who develop a urinary tract infection after kidney transplantation will experience recurrent infection.21 In most studies, kidney transplant recipients shared the same classic risk factors for recurrent urinary tract infection as the general popula - tion: female gender and prior recurrent urinary tract infection or urological abnormalities.25 Prolonged use of Foley catheter, presence of a ureteral stent, increased age of recipient, and delayed graft function are risk factors for early urinary tract infection.24 Ureteric reflux disease and cadaveric donors also represent a higher risk.26 Kidney transplant recipients also have unique risk factors, including anatomical and functional abnormalities, as well as immunosup- pression.27 The placement of the renal allograft into the pelvis alters the distance and angle of the ureter in relation to the bladder and kidney, which contributes to increased risk of renal al- lograft infection [Figure].Colonizing organism recommended antimicrobialAlternatives and additional considerations No known multidrug-resistant organismsPiperacillin-tazobactam or ceftriaxone + metronidazole Vancomycin may be added for enterococcal coverage when using cephalosporin-based regimens if high clinical concern For patients with severe \u00df-lactam allergies, ciprofloxacin and metronidazole \u00b1 is not or Enterococcus Carbapenemase-producing Consult infectious meropenem plus colistin, tigecycline, \u00b1 aminoglycoside or fluoroquinolone if susceptibleCeftazidime-avibactam or meropenem-vaborbactamRequires Health Special Access Program approval\u2014consult infectious diseases specialist Multidrug-resistant PseudomonasConsult infectious diseases/transplant infectious Meropenem \u00b1 aminoglycoside/ ciprofloxacinEmpiric depend on patient-specific resistance patterns Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureusVancomycin (in as above)Liver transplant patients with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus colonization are at highest risk Antifungal coverage Fluconazole or micafungin May be added in the case of suspected bowel perforation or anastomotic leak or severe sepsis from intra-abdominal infectionFakhredine s, Oravec t, Belga s, Wright a, m ah a clinical Table 3.

Other common uropathogens include other members of the Enterobacterales, as well \u00df-lactamase carbapenemase-producing organisms and other multidrug-resistant organisms are of particular significance because they have been shown to increase the risk of recurrent urinary tract infec- tion in kidney transplant recipients and often require treatment with IV antibiotics and treat- ments that have greater side effects.27 In order to diagnose and treat urinary tract infection, it is critical to differentiate asymp- tomatic bacteriuria from symptomatic urinary tract infection. Urinary symptoms with or with- out systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, malaise, hemodynamic instability, leukocytosis, flank/allograft pain, or bacteremia are key for diagnosis of a urinary tract infection. If the urinary tract infection is symptomatic, the best next step is to collect a midstream urine sample or use straight catheterization to assess pyuria, followed by culture and sensitivity testing. For patients who have had indwelling catheters for more than 2 weeks, the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends removing the catheter and collecting urine by either a mid- stream void or a newly placed urinary catheter.27 The management of recurrent urinary tract infections in kidney transplant patients requires a proper diagnosis of the underlying mecha- nism.28 Management of recurrent urinary tract infections is summarized in Table 4. Mold infections in lung transplant recipients Invasive fungal infections are a serious cause of morbidity and mortality in lung transplant patients, and both diagnosis and therapy can be challenging. Numerous factors predispose lung transplant recipients to invasive fungal infections, including constant exposure to en-vironmental spores and hyphal elements, lack of normal ciliary action, lack of innervation and cough reflex, and airway ischemia, particularly at the anastomosis.

Diagnostic criteria for pulmonary invasive fun - gal infections are summarized in Table 5.32 CT findings consistent with invasive aspergillosis include ground-glass opacities, peribronchial consolidation, nodules, or dense consolidation; the classical halo sign (dense consolidation sur- rounded by ground-glass opacification) occurs less commonly in solid organ transplant than in hematologic malignancies.6 Tracheobronchial aspergillosis, occurring mainly at the anastomo - sis, accounts for approximately half of Aspergil- lus infections in lung transplant recipients and is both immediately dangerous and a precur- sor to invasive aspergillosis.33 Direct inspec- tion through bronchoscopy aspergillosis may be radiographically silent; microbiologic samples should also be collected, including cultures and galactomannan. Therapeutic options recommended for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis are listed in Table 6. Therapy is typically continued for at least 3 months and until there is resolution of clinical, radiologic, and microbiologic signs of disease.6 Azoles are CYP3A4 inhibitors and increase levels of common immunosuppressants used in solid organ transplant, including calci- neurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus) and mTOR inhibitors (e.g., sirolimus). Careful monitoring of tacrolimus levels is indicated while patients are receiving azoles and sirolimus is contra- indicated. When an azole is discontinued, it results in reduced immunosuppressant levels and may precipitate rejection unless anticipated and proactively managed.

Antifungal agents recommended in the treatment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in solid organ transplant recipients (adapted from husain and Camargo6). 172 BC MediC al Journal vol. 64 no. 4 | may 2022172Solid organ transplant recipients should minimize exposure to soil and decaying organic material by avoiding gardening, landscaping, raking leaves, and construction or excavation sites. If avoidance is not possible, wearing gloves and a mask (N95 if on construction sites) is recommended. Viral respiratory tract infections in lung transplant recipients In solid organ transplant recipients, particularly lung transplant patients, viral respiratory tract infections can lead to serious morbidity and pre - cipitate organ rejection.34 Common pathogens include influenza, ing SARS-CoV-2. Immunocompetent patients infected with these viruses typically have only upper respiratory tract involvement (with the exception of influenza and SARS-CoV-2). In lung transplant recipients, these viruses can cause a wide array of symptoms, ranging from mild symptoms, such as nasal congestion and rhinorrhea, to severe disease, including tra- cheobronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. Seasonal patterns in these viruses exist. 34 There are no clinical features that are useful for distinguishing disease caused by different viruses, but molecular diagnostics using PCR have played an increasingly important role. Es- tablishing a diagnosis is particularly important because medical therapies are available for a few, but not all, of these viruses, and infection can both mimic and potentially precipitate rejec- tion.35,36 Many viruses are also associated with secondary bacterial or fungal pneumonias.34,37 Nasopharyngeal swabs are most commonly used to collect samples for testing. Lower tract sampling may be indicated if clinical suspicion is high and upper tract samples are negative. Given the transmissibility of these pathogens, transplant wards must take care to appropriately isolate patients with confirmed or suspected infection to prevent spread to other vulner- able patients. Influenza and, more recently, SARS-CoV-2 are the only viruses in this group for which vac- cines and targeted therapy are available. Solid organ transplant recipients who contract influ- enza are at higher risk of complications relative to the general population, including pneumo-nia (22% to 49%) and ICU admission (11% to 16%).34,38 Receipt of annual vaccination in solid organ transplant patients has been associated not only with reduced incidence (from 25.0% to 1.3% in a single study on lung transplant patients) but also with a decrease in disease severity in patients who develop influenza de- spite being immunized.39,40 Risk factors for the development of severe influenza in solid organ transplant recipients include diabetes, bacterial or fungal pneumonia, use of antilymphocyte globulins, and acquisition of infection in the first 3 months following transplantation.39 Annual vaccination with inactivated in- fluenza vaccine is strongly recommended (live-attenuated vaccines are contraindicated in solid organ transplant recipients); for patients who are unable to be vaccinated, prophylactic oseltamivir 75 mg orally daily for 10 days can be considered following high-risk exposures. Transplant patients who develop influenza should be treated with oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice daily, regardless of symptom duration, and treatment should be continued for a minimum of 5 days and possibly extended up to 10 days in patients with severe disease or persistent symptoms. Importantly, oseltamivir does not have any significant drug-drug interactions with antirejection medications used in solid organ transplant, although it does require renal dose adjustment.34 Early data indicate that solid organ trans- plant recipients are infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, at twice the rate of the general population, though it is unclear whether this is due to immunosuppression, in- creased comorbidities, or increased exposure.41 Independent risk factors for mortality among solid organ transplant patients with COVID-19 have been reported to be lung transplantation, older age, and nosocomial acquisition. 41,42 The increased mortality in lung transplant recipients is likely due to similar factors that predispose them to other severe viral respiratory infec- tions; the type of baseline immunosuppression does not seem to affect mortality. There are currently insufficient data to provide strong, evidence-based recommendations on the treat - ment of COVID-19 in solid organ transplant recipients. However, there is no indication that treatment should differ from that for the gen- eral population; consideration should be made for drug-drug interactions, and management should involve transplant physicians, particu- larly when alteration of immunosuppression is being considered.43 Transplantation should be deferred if either the donor or recipient is SARS-CoV-2 positive;43,44 potential transplant recipients who test positive may be considered on a case-by-case basis, depending on the ur-gency of transplantation, in consultation with an infectious diseases or transplant infectious diseases physician. Both Canadian and BC guidelines recom- mend vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in solid organ transplant recipients.45,46 Major caveats in the transplant population include a recom- mendation to complete vaccination 2 weeks before transplant (though not to delay necessary transplant while awaiting vaccination), and to delay vaccination by at least 1 month following transplantation or following treatment of acute rejection, and by 3 months following rituximab therapy. The purpose of delaying vaccination in these scenarios is to ensure vaccine efficacy in the setting of increased immunosuppression, rather than due to concerns about safety. The efficacy of vaccination in this population is un- known, and strict adherence to public health measures must be maintained regardless of vac - cination status. Summary Due to the success of solid organ transplant programs in BC, more transplant recipients are living in the community. These recipients remain on lifelong immunosuppression and are at ongoing risk for infectious complications. It is important for physicians working in commu- nities throughout BC to have an awareness of some of the common infections these patients may face and to consult with colleagues in infec - tious diseases and transplant infectious diseases as required to support the ongoing health of this unique patient population. n Competing interests Dr Mah is on the advisory board and/or has re - ceived research support from Avir, Merck, and Ver - ity.

Rates of gonorrhea and chlamydia have been increasing over the past decade. Similarly, the incidence of syphilis in BC has been increasing, particularly in men who have sex with men, but also in women aged 15 to 49 years. This rise has prompted new recommen- dations to repeat syphilis testing in pregnancy around the time of delivery, in addition to routine syphilis screening in the first trimester. In contrast, the rate of HIV diagnosis in BC has been declin- ing. This has occurred as more individuals at high risk for HIV acquisition have been enrolled in the pre-exposure prophylaxis program and more HIV- infected patients maintain undetectable viral loads, which reduces transmission. Despite the lack of incidence data on human papillomavirus infection as a nonreportable sexually transmitted infection, rahel Zewude, mD, Gregory D. Deans, mD, mhs c, Fr CPC, Natasha Press, mD, Fr CPC sexually transmitted infections in British Columbia: an update Though the rate of HIV diagnosis in BC has been declining, physicians should be aware of rising rates of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis to ensure their patients receive adequate screening, treatment, and follow-up. Dr Zewude is an internal medicine resident in the Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia. Dr Deans is a clinical assistant professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases, UBC, and an infectious diseases physician at Surrey Memorial Hospital. Dr Press is a clinical associate professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases, UBC, and an infectious diseases physician at St. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver. This article has been peer reviewed.the rate of human papillomavirus-associated com- plications, namely anogenital warts and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, has been declining in BC since the introduction of human papillomavirus vaccination programs. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in British Columbia are a public health concern, particularly the increasing rates of chlamydia and syphilis. In the spring of 2020, during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pan- demic, STI screening rates declined, probably due to both changes in sexual behavior and re- duced access to sexual health services.1 Howev - er, in 2021, screening rates began to normalize.2 STI clinics have resumed services and continue to provide online STI testing to help overcome barriers in accessing clinic-based assessment.3 In this review, we discuss the current epide- miology, testing, management, and prevention of STIs in BC. We focus on those pathogens tested in routine screening, including gonor- rhea, chlamydia, syphilis, and HIV. In addition to screening, routine vaccinations are available to prevent sexual transmission of hepatitis B and human papillomavirus (HPV). Hepatitis B vaccination has been part of the immuniza- tion schedule in BC since 1992, whereas HPV vaccination was introduced in 2008 for girls and was expanded to include boys in 2017.4 We review BC's HPV vaccination and screen - ing programs and their impact on prevalence.Gonorrhea Twice as many new gonorrhea cases are di- agnosed in men as in women, and rates have been increasing over the past decade. A large proportion of females with gonorrhea infec- tion can be asymptomatic; in those who are symptomatic, particularly with lower genital tract infection, the clinical manifestations are often limited to mild irritation and vaginal dis- charge, which may be interpreted as regular vaginal discharge.5 Males, however, are more likely than females to have symptoms that may drive them to get tested. In addition to sexual behaviors, reasons for increased rates may in- clude frequency of testing, improved sensitivity and specificity of testing methods, or changes in gonorrhea strains. 6,7 Testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia is in- dicated for patients who have symptoms of urethritis/cervicitis or reported contact with a sexual partner who has either infection, and anyone who has tested positive or is being screened for another STI.7 Symptoms of gon- orrhea and chlamydia are quite similar and may include purulent urethral discharge, painful or difficult urination, new mucopurulent vaginal discharge, lower abdominal pain, dyspareunia, testicular swelling or pain, sore throat, or rectal pain or discharge.7 Sites for screening should be based on symptoms and on type of recent sexual activity according to the patient's sexual health history. Active urethral, cervical, or abnormal vaginal discharge should be swabbed for both 175 BC MediC al Journal vol. 64 no. 4 | may 2022175Zewude r, Deans GD, Press N clinical gonorrhea culture and susceptibility, as well as for a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for chla- mydia NAAT is shown in the Figure. Similarly, patients with throat and/or rectal symptoms should have swabs of the symptomatic site(s) collected for both gonorrhea culture and sus-ceptibility, as well as gonorrhea and chlamydia NAAT. Screening of asymptomatic patients should consist of gonorrhea and chlamydia NAAT on first-catch urine, ideally without having voided in the preceding 1 to 2 hours, as well as on swabs of the cervix, vagina, throat, and/or rectum [Table 1]. Unless chlamydia has been ruled out, pa- tients with confirmed or suspected gonorrhea are treated for both infections. In BC, the rec-ommended treatment for gonorrhea is a single dose of either cefixime 800 mg orally or cef- triaxone 250 mg intramuscularly, along with a single dose of oral azithromycin 1000 mg to cover chlamydia [Table 2]. With rising antibi- otic resistance in gonorrhea strains, however, other national agencies such as the United States Centers for Disease Control are currently rec- ommending a 500 mg dose of ceftriaxone intra - muscularly. This increased dose of ceftriaxone has not yet been incorporated into Canadian guidelines.8,9 However, the BC STI treatment guidelines are currently under review, and based on local antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and epidemiology, the gonorrhea treatment recommendations will be reassessed, including the ceftriaxone dose, the need for concurrent azithromycin, and whether cefixime will still be a first-line option. Patients should be counseled to abstain from condomless intercourse until 7 days posttreatment.7 Repeat screening is recom- mended 6 months after successful treatment due to the high risk of reinfection. Chlamydia Chlamydia is the most common STI in BC, and its rate of infection continues to increase.6,10 Females have approximately 1.5 times the di- agnosis rate compared with males, who remain asymptomatic in half the cases of chlamydia infection.11 Rates of chlamydia, as well as gonor- rhea and syphilis, have also increased in seniors, which highlights the importance of extending preventive and screening measures for STIs to include older adults.12 The reason for in- creased rates of chlamydia is likely multifacto- rial. Contributing factors may include increased screening in asymptomatic young adults, the use of NAAT on urine samples, which are less invasive for patients, and possibly, changes in sexual practices.10,13The recommended treatment of chlamydia is doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days, or azithromycin 1000 mg orally in a single dose [Table 2] . Test of cure is recommended 3 to 4 weeks after initial treatment for preg- nant and breastfeeding patients or if symptoms persist following treatment; retesting less than 3 weeks after treatment may be associated with Site Asymptomatic (screening) Symptomatic CervixGC/CT NAAT* on vaginal swab (preferred), cervical NAAT for GC/CT on vaginal swab (preferred), Penile; urethra Urine for NAAT1.

Syphilis The number of new syphilis infections in BC has been increasing. Although most diagnoses are in men who have sex with men (MSM), infections are also increasing among women. From 2017 to 2018, there was a nearly 40% increase in infectious syphilis among women aged 15 to 49 years.6,10 Because of the increase recorded in women, a change has been made to syphilis screening during pregnancy. Routinely, pregnant women are screened for syphilis in the first trimester.14 It is now recommended to re- peat syphilis testing around the time of delivery. The goal of testing twice during pregnancy is to prevent infection being passed from mother to baby. In 2019, two cases of congenital syphilis were identified in BC, after no cases had been identified in previous years. 14 Testing for syphilis is indicated for pa- tients who have symptoms of syphilis, such as a painless chancre at the site of inoculation, diffuse rash, or new visual symptoms; people with reported contact to syphilis; or pregnant patients in the first trimester and at the time of delivery. Patients with genital lesions sus- picious for syphilis should be swabbed for a syphilis NAAT, which has replaced the previous method of dark field microscopy. All patients should be assessed with syphilis serology, which involves both treponemal and nontreponemal tests, which in BC are performed according to a validated algorithm. Treatment of syphilis depends on the stage of the infection, which is determined based on symptomatology, timing of potential sexual exposure, serology results, and the results and timing of any previous testing. In BC, if there is ambiguity in interpreting syphilis test results or determining the stage of infection, support is available from the physicians and nurses at BC Centre for Disease Control sexually transmitted infections clinics.15 Early syphilis, which in- cludes primary, secondary, and latent infections within 1 year of infection, is treated with 2.4 million units of penicillin G benzathine (Bicil- lin L-A) given as two simultaneous intramus-cular injections [Table 2]. Late syphilis, which is usually in the late latent stage, is treated with 2.4 million units of intramuscular penicillin G benzathine (Bicillin L-A) weekly for a total of three sets of injections. Patients with a true al-lergy to penicillin are treated with doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 14 days in early syphilis and 28 days in late syphilis. Follow- ing treatment, all patients should have repeat syphilis serology; patients with early syphilis should generally be monitored with serology every 3 months to assess for the expected de- cline in titer of the rapid plasma reagin. The BC Centre for Disease Control provincial sexually transmitted infections clinics syphilis team can advise on this monitoring for different patient populations. 15 HIV The rate of new HIV diagnoses in BC has been declining over the past decade, even with an in- crease in testing. This is due in part to treatment as prevention, with more HIV-infected indi- viduals maintaining undetectable viral loads.16 During the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, rates of both testing and new HIV Infection First-line Second-line Additional Follow-up GonorrheaCefixime 800 mg orally in a single dose and azithromycin 1000 mg orally in a single dose; or ceftriaxone 250 mg intramuscularly in a single dose and azithromycin 1000 mg orally in a single doseCefixime 800 mg orally in a single dose and doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days; or ceftriaxone 250 mg intramuscularly in a single dose and doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 7 daysAbstain from sexual activity for 7 days from the start of treatment.Test and treat last sexual contact AND any sexual contacts within the last 60 days.Repeat testing at 6 months ChlamydiaDoxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days; or azithromycin 1000 mg orally in a single dose\u2014Abstain from sexual activity for 7 days from the start of treatment.Test and treat last sexual contact AND any sexual contacts within the last 60 days.

Table 2. Treatment for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis.7,11 177 BC MediC al Journal vol. 64 no. 4 | may 2022177Zewude r, Deans GD, Press N clinical diagnoses declined. The greatest number of new HIV diagnoses is in MSM, which the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) program aims to address.6,17 HIV PrEP addresses HIV prevention in HIV-negative individuals at high risk of ac- quiring HIV infection. Those individuals are offered an antiretroviral combination pill (em- tricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) to prevent infection with HIV. There are two ap- proaches to administering PrEP: daily and on demand. In on-demand PrEP , patients take one emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate combination pill 2 hours prior to sexual inter-course, a second pill 24 hours later, and a third pill 48 hours after the first dose. PrEP has been shown to be highly effective in preventing HIV transmission.18 In BC, the PrEP program is publicly funded and open to any HIV-negative individual who meets the criteria for being at high risk of HIV acquisition. 19 Currently, ap- proximately 4000 individuals are actively en- rolled in the PrEP program, most of whom identify as MSM. Transgender women and MSM who are newly diagnosed with syphilis or a rectal bacterial STI, and who report having condomless anal sex, should be informed of the PrEP program. Further information regarding enrolment can be found at the BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS website. 19 Human papillomavirus Screening Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection causes anogenital warts, as well as multiple genital tract malignancies, including cervical, vaginal, vulvar, and anal cancers. Consequently, HPV screening is based on screening for genital tract cancer, primarily cervical cancer. The current BC guidelines for HPV screen- ing recommend cervical cytology obtained through the conventional Papanicolaou smear test (Pap test) as the only screening method in asymptomatic females.20 However, implemen- tation of HPV DNA testing has been identi-fied as a priority by the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer, and provincial health systems are moving toward this goal. 21 The BC Cancer Agency recommends screening for cervical cancer with a Pap test in 25- to 69-year-old female and transgender patients who have a cervix. The recommenda- tions explicitly state that Pap test screening should be continued in patients who have been through menopause, who have ever been sexu- ally active at any point in their lifetime, who have received the HPV vaccine, and who are in a same-sex relationship.22 Patients who do not re- quire Pap test screening include those who have had their cervix removed for any reason, includ- ing total hysterectomy and gender-affirming surgery, and have no history of precancerous le- sions or previous cervical cancer, and those who have never had any sexual contact (including penetrative, digital, or oral sexual contact).20,22 Regarding anal cancer screening, the 2012 BC Cancer Agency guidelines recommend digital rectal exam to be included on annual physical exams at primary care.23 Patients who are identified to be in a higher-risk group for anal cancer, particularly HIV-positive MSM, could be considered for HPV vaccination is now part of the school-based program for all children. In grade 6, two doses of the 9-valent HPV vaccine (HPV9) are given 6 months apart. Individuals who start the vac- cine series at 15 years or older receive three doses at months 0, 2, and 6.20 For those who missed the school-based program, the current BC guideline for HPV vaccination recommends HPV9 (Gardasil 9), which provides protection against cervical, vul- var, vaginal, and anal cancers, as well as ano- genital warts.24 Compared with the previously used quadrivalent HPV vaccine (HPV4), HPV9 provides similar protection against anogenital warts but may also provide up to 15% additional protection against anogenital cancers.24 It is available through the publicly funded program for individuals who start the vaccine series be-fore their 19th birthday and those between 9 and 26 years who are transgender, HIV posi- tive, MSM, or males who are street-involved or in the care of the Ministry of Children and Family Development.24,25 Individuals who do not qualify for publicly funded HPV vaccina- tion include MSM older than 27 years, women aged 19 to 45 years, and males aged 9 to 26 years.25 For those individuals, HPV vaccination is recommended and is available by prescrip- tion. The cost is approximately $500 for the three-dose vaccine series and may be covered by third-party insurance plans. 20 Individuals who have completed an HPV vaccination series with one of the older vaccines (HPV2 or HPV4) may choose to purchase an HPV9 vaccine series in order to ensure protec- tion against the additional HPV strains. A min- imum interval of 6 months between completion of an HPV2 or HPV4 series and initiation of an HPV9 series is recommended. 24 PrevalenceHPV is not a reportable disease in BC, nor is it part of routine STI screening; therefore, the annual incidence and prevalence of HPV in the province is not well documented. A 2016 trial reported 8.2% HPV positivity at baseline screening of more than 15 000 women. 26 Fur- thermore, given that HPV infection with strains 6 and 11 is associated with 90% of anogenital warts, the prevalence rate of anogenital warts in the province can provide valuable informa-tion on the prevalence of HPV infection. In a study that examined the impact of BC's quad-rivalent HPV immunization program on rates of anogenital warts, clinical exam diagnosis of anogenital warts in BC clinic visits from 2000 to 2017 were analyzed: 8.15% of the 85 158 individuals screened were diagnosed with ano- genital warts.27 The incidence of HPV infection appears to be influenced primarily by HPV immuni- zation. The above-mentioned study analyzed anogenital wart rates across different birth co- horts to assess the impact of BC's HPV im- munization programs. The study reported a In BC, the PrEP program is publicly funded and open to any hIV- negative individual who meets the criteria for being at high risk of hIV acquisition.178 BC MediC al Journal vol. 64 no. 4 | may 2022178clinical sexually transmitted infections in British Columbia: a n update 56% overall decline in rates of anogenital warts in the younger birth cohort that is eligible for public HPV4 immunization when compared with older birth cohorts.27 Additionally, a more than 50% decline in the rates of cervical in- traepithelial neoplasia has been reported in the province since the introduction of the publicly funded HPV vaccination program.28,29 Summary Physicians should be aware of rising rates of STIs in BC to ensure adequate screening, treat- ment, and follow-up of their patients. HPV vaccination has significantly reduced the rates of anogenital warts and precancerous genital lesions, and should be encouraged in eligible groups. n Competing interests None declared. references 1.

Further to the release of the 2020 In Plain Sight report, the JCCs have prioritized partner- ing with Indigenous communities and health care organizations to respond to the needs of Indigenous patients and be inclusive of Indig-enous perspectives of health and wellness. The JCCs are advancing cultural safety by positioning health care professionals as humble and respectful partners in care with patients1 in Indigenous cultural experiences, feelings, and beliefs.

Cultural and community connections In Tofino, an emergency room and family medi- cine doctor saw how traditional practices helped a group of patients who were struggling with trauma and experiencing substance use that required frequent treatment in hospital. Want- ing to learn more and understand better, the physician collaborated with a Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation healer and a cultural worker to introduce a group of local health care profes-sionals to traditional healing practices. They arranged a cultural ceremony that included Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation mem- bers, physicians, nurses, X-ray and laboratory technicians, and a firefighter. It incorporated a talking circle, breathing exercises, drumming and singing, and cold-water cleansing pools. Together they explored how these practices and stronger cultural connections might blend with medical care to support people who expe- rience trauma and pain, as well as the benefits of making traditional, nonmedical interven- tions more available to health professionals.

Holistic healing Gathering as a community and learning from Elders are important means for community engagement for Indigenous people. Through a JCC initiative, a traditional gathering in Wil- liams Lake brought together Secw\u00e9pemc Elders to talk about medication use in their commu- nity, where a holistic approach to health and wellness was once the norm. Understanding that storytelling is the tra- ditional way for Indigenous communities to share knowledge, wisdom, and humor, a story titled Coyote's Food Medicines was developed to connect with communities about medications. The award-nominated book was created in part- nership between the JCCs, the First Nations Health Authority (FNHA), and the Interior Health Authority, with guidance from Elders, illustrations by Georgia Lesley, and design and production by Drawing Wisdom. Through a beautifully stitched narrative, the story opens a safe space for Indigenous people to discuss the importance of maintaining good health when taking multiple prescribed medications, while encouraging meaningful conversations with Continued on page 181180 BC MediC al Journal vol. 64 no. 4 | may 2022180coHp The US Surgeon General recently is- sued an advisory on the youth mental health crisis, which was worsened by COVID-19, calling for swift, coordinated ac- tions.1 The situation in BC is similar. It is time for BC and Canada to create comprehensive strategies for child and youth mental health and substance use (CYMHSU), emphasizing prevention. In 2018, one in six BC youth seriously con- sidered suicide in the prior year, one in five self-reported anxiety disorders, one in eight engaged in purging, and one in seven were depressed. All rates increased more than 50% since 2013, with the worst rates among female and LGBTQ+ youth.2 Even pre-COVID-19, BC was not on track to meet its mental health and substance use targets. The situation is simi- lar across Canada, which ranked 31st of 38 high-income countries in children and youth well-being and mental health.3 Unlike in Can- ada, many countries are showing improvement, highlighting the systemic failure and that some- thing can be done. The pandemic exacerbated the situation further. An Ontario study found that approxi- mately 70% of children and adolescents experi - enced deterioration in at least one mental health domain (anxiety, irritability, hyperactivity, atten- tion, depression, or obsessions/compulsions).4 The BC COVID SPEAK survey confirmed a disproportionate impact on families living with children.5 In 2021, opioid overdoses were the third-leading cause of death for BC children under age 19, with a record 29 deaths. BC youth are in a mental health crisis\u2014we must invest in prevention This article is the opinion of the author(s) and not necessarily the Council on Health Promotion or Doctors of BC. This article has not been peer reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board.The majority of CYMHSU disorders begin before the age of 15.3 They are a leading cause of disability and are underfunded compared with other causes of disease burden.3,6 Beyond disease burden, CYMHSU problems early in life lead to impairment across family, social, and academic domains, creat- ing socioeconomic ineq- uities.3 BC's investments in early childhood educa- tion, social and emotional learning, poverty reduc- tion, and mental health services are commendable but insufficient, as noted by Jennifer Charles- worth, BC's representative for children and youth.7 Furthermore, both BC and Canada lack funding for evidence-based CYMHSU prevention. Much more can be done, from better prevention of intergenerational trauma to systematically delivering a suite of effective preventive interventions [Table], including parenting programs, school-based programs, and cognitive-behavioral-therapy-based interventions, both universal and targeted. CYMHSU preventive interventions are highly cost-effective, with societal savings of $6000 to $14 000 per participant.8 Preventing a single case of conduct disorder is estimated to yield lifetime savings of $5 million per child.8 How - ever, evidence-based preventive interventions are far from being implemented systematically in BC or Canada, with little reporting on the impact of current strategies. Therefore, an im-mediate scale-up of evidence-based measures is needed. During the pandemic, we have seen that public health, the health care system, and the government can collaboratively monitor, act, and adjust to address a population-level health threat. We must do the same for the CYMHSU crisis. Physicians can play a role by raising awareness of the crisis, demanding action, or joining the CYMHSU Community of Practice voices. Physicians can also identify and refer children, youth, and families using resources available from https://openmindbc.ca. To solve the crisis, it is crucial for the pro-vincial and federal gov-ernments to establish a comprehensive strategy that includes prevention, with increased pub-licly reported surveillance and evaluation. The future well-being of our province and country rests on how we support and invest in the next generation's mental health. n \u2014Veronic Clair, mD, PhD, CCFP , CPC ealth Promotion teve m athias, mD, Fr CPC Guest a uthor references 1.

Access to quality care closer to home Indigenous populations in rural BC communi- ties face significant barriers to accessing quality care, including having to travel long distances to and from appointments, a lack of provid- ers and services in rural communities, and a lack of access to culturally safe care. These hurdles were further emphasized with the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2020, the First Nations Virtual Doctor of the Day program was launched by the FNHA and the Rural Coordination Centre of BC (RCCbc), which is funded by the JCCs. The program is one of three Real-Time Virtual Support pathways offered by the RCCbc to enhance health equity in BC rural, remote, and Indig - enous communities. Operating 7 days a week, the program en- ables Indigenous people who have limited or no access to a doctor to receive culturally safe primary care virtually; it also supports community-based nurses and other health professionals to deliver primary care. In the program's first year, there were more than 6000 encounters between doctors and hundreds of patients who accessed the service. All physi- cians have training or experience in cultural safety and humility, and many of the doctors have Indigenous ancestry. Access the service and learn more at www.fnha.ca/what-we-do/ ehealth/virtual-doctor-of-the-day. The JCCs commit to keeping the conver- sation going with and between Indigenous communities and BC doctors, as well as col- laborating with health care partners to develop solutions that address systemic health equity issues.

Specifically, Asian health care workers face discrimination due to a unique combination of their racial background and their roles inter - acting with COVID-19-exposed patients. Sources of violence and prejudice may arise from within and outside the health care system. If left unad - dressed, the emotional stress of racial discrimina- tion faced by health care workers can accelerate staff burnout, perpetuate feelings of isolation, and compromise patient care. In this article, we review factors involved in experiences of anti-Asian racism during the COVID-19 pandemic. Proposed areas of action to mitigate incidence of discrimination in the health care system may include policies addressing country-based nomenclature for global issues, funding for Asian community-based medical resources, and early anti-Asian racism education for health care students. As she stood in the lobby of a busi- ness at the end of her 12-hour shift, a Chinese-Canadian nurse couldn't help but notice that her food was being prepared by unmasked workers. What should have been a simple reminder to mask up instead turned into a barrage of racist drivel against her: \"I never thought it would be death caused by China!\" the other pandemic: COVID-19 as a catalyst for hate against asian health care workers A call to action to address anti-Asian discrimination in the health care system. Brooke Cheng, Joshua m a Ms Cheng and Mr Ma are second-year medical students in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of British Columbia. This article has been peer reviewed.and \"You people are always causing problems!\"1 This story highlights the quintessential expe- rience faced by Asian health care workers in Canada as they juggle hearing the empty praise of being called a \"health care hero\" with facing day-to-day overt racism and microaggressions at work and in public settings. 2,3 While this story may surprise some, it is just one of thousands of anecdotes that continue to underpin deeper issues. The Asian population is no stranger to racial discrimination, having been scrutinized for their appearance, culture, and identity.4,5 Though efforts have been made to educate the public on cultural sensitivity and to celebrate racial diversity, the SARS outbreak in 2003 demonstrated the speed at which we can revert to unconscious biases of racist ten-dencies in the face of fear and uncertainty. 5 In a similar vein, the COVID-19 pandemic has reignited racism against Asians, exacerbated by initial public framing of the situation as being caused by the \"Chinese virus.\"2,6,7 This phe- nomenon transcends borders, occurring even in Canada where we pride ourselves for our multiculturalism. The propensity to scapegoat this ethnic group during periods of crisis has contributed to the unfair social exclusion of the Asian population and laid the groundwork for tragedies such as the targeted mass shooting in Atlanta in March 2021.5,8 Six Asian women were among the victims. Unfortunately, racially driven prejudice has not been the only form of discrimination to in- crease during the COVID-19 pandemic. Health care workers have become a target of public fear, seen as a danger due to their higher risk for contact with environments and individuals exposed to COVID-19. 2,7 The manifestations of this fear have been numerous and wide- spread, with reports of violence against health care workers in countless countries around the globe.9-12 Taken together, Asian health care workers are at a unique intersection of increased risk for prejudice and discrimination in both their per- sonal and professional lives.2,7 A survey conduct- ed by the Canadian Union of Public Employees reported an increase of COVID-19-related racism targeting health care workers in Mani- toba.13 Most significantly, while only 1% of health care workers who did not identify as Asian reported experiences of racism during the surveyed 1-month period, a staggering 20% of Asian health care workers reported racism during the same time frame.13 This is supported by a series of interviews conducted with Asian health care workers highlighting experiences ranging from verbal microaggressions to out-right violence. 2 It is well established that the experience of racism and prejudice can have tremendous im- pacts on mental health among those inside and outside the medical field.14-16 However, when paired with the busy and stressful environments of health care settings, discrimination is an un- warranted factor compounding the likelihood of burnout among health care workers. This senti - ment is worsened by a shared frustration of a lack of acknowledgement from institutional and public authorities, as well as constantly feeling the need to prioritize patient trust over one's integrity.2 The resulting burden is an invisible 183 BC MediC al Journal vol. 64 no. 4 | may 2022183yet significant cost to the health care system, potentially manifesting as presenteeism among workers (the lost productivity to the work envi- ronment when employees cannot fully function due to illness or other conditions).17,18 Perhaps the most important implication is that workers experiencing anxiety and stress from racially driven prejudice could have decreased capacity to properly care for patients.19 In this sense, the effects of discrimination are carried downstream to the home and the workplace. If racism is beginning to affect an outcome as critical as patient safety and care, then this issue must be treated as one of utmost importance. It is also important to recognize that this issue does not differentiate based on age or experience.2,20,21 Asian health care workers at all stages of their careers may face the negative effects of racist exclusion, not only those who are currently practising professionals.3 Notably, Asian students studying in the medical profes- sion have also been affected, and we suspect that the same applies for students of other health care occupations. A Polish study demonstrated through an online survey that Asian medical students have experienced increased xenopho - bia since the COVID-19 outbreak, receiving reactions such as individuals pointing fingers or spitting at them, and patients asking in terror whether they are infected with COVID-19. 20 This may have hindered their career develop- ment and worsened feelings of isolation, giv- en that many of these students were studying abroad. Interestingly, the prejudice tended to more greatly affect Asian mask-wearing stu- dents, with anecdotes of lecturers requesting that these individuals remove their masks, even amid student concerns for safety.20 We are re- minded of a similar experience in Vancouver, where mask wearers were targets of prejudice until masks were mandated by the government. Asian individuals were overwhelmingly repre- sented in this group.22 Nevertheless, it would be naive to believe that health care workers are solely the victims of prejudice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cases of health care workers facing stigma from fellow colleagues during the pandemic period have also been reported. For an action as simple as opting to take a COVID-19 test, a female health care worker required psychotherapy and benzodiazepines to manage her psychological distress due to the stigma received from cowork- ers.23 Another health care worker employed in a COVID-19 ward reported feelings of humilia- tion and worthlessness due to derogatory tones and comments made by colleagues after her exposure to COVID-19 patients.23 Even expe- rienced health care workers may lash out inap- propriately as a result of overwhelming stress or fear. It is important to look both internally and externally to identify possible areas in the health care system for targeted interventions to address this issue. Overall, in light of recent events surround- ing the COVID-19 pandemic, the increasing rate of anti-Asian racism has positioned this issue at the forefront of our minds. Public at-tention for the Asian population, one so often overlooked as a quiet \"model minority,\" has reached an all-time high.1 It is now up to the health care system to capitalize on this momen - tum and prevent the hardships experienced by Asian health care workers from being in vain. To do this, we propose the following solutions: Establishment of policy to prevent public framing of future global situations as being associated with a certain ethnicity or country (e.g., supporting neutral language in stan - dardized nomenclature for viral variants).24 Increased government funding for Asian community-based care programs and med - ical resources provided in different lan - guages (e.g., telehealth).25 Implementation of education on Asian his- tory, racism, and psychosocial resilience targeted for health care students, beginning early during preclinical training years.26 As Asian medical students, we believe that an evolution at the political, community, and education levels is imperative to establish a sustainable environment where Asian health bcmd2b care workers feel safe and valued for their work. This is in no way intended to downplay the experiences of other groups, or to suggest that Asians are the only victims of racism. It has been clearly established that members of mi- nority groups such as Indigenous, Black, and Hispanic populations are also victims of racism in the health care system, each with their own devastating and unfair experiences of bias. 27-29 However, we believe that joining the fight against Asian hate is also joining the fight for all people of color. The Asian population should not be thought of as the centre of attention, but rather a facet of a larger issue that must be addressed congruently. We would be honored to have members of all ethnic backgrounds become allies in our journey for racial equality in our health care system. Likewise, this is a call to action for all Asian health care workers to stand up for our fellow peers and colleagues who may be suffering their own battles. Although the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic will likely reach an end, the social aftermath of the situation may persist far be- yond. Furthermore, should new worldwide health crises arise in the future, they will test our ability to grow from past experiences and to respond with empathy. It is critical that this issue is addressed in the health care system, lessons from the COVID-19 experience are used, and an action plan is created to ensure a safe and inclusive environment for all health care workers. n Competing interests None declared. references 1.

A monoclonal antibody, sotrovimab, was also in widespread use until recently; however, its utility has been limited due to loss of activity against the BA.2 variant of Omicron. On 23 March 2022, due to increased drug supply and operational capacity, eligibility criteria were ex- panded to include all symptomatic COVID-19 individuals in BC who are at increased risk of severe illness and hospitalization. Nirmatrelvir/ ritonavir and remdesivir were each evaluated in a randomized controlled trial conducted during the Delta wave in unvaccinated adults with a risk factor for severe COVID-19, such as being over 55 years of age or having a comorbidity.1,2 Adults were offered treatment if they had mild to moderate COVID-19 and were within 5 (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) or 7 days (remdesivir) of symptom onset. Both treatments demonstrated a significant reduction in progression to hospi- talization over placebo (6.3% versus ).1,2 Omicron causes less-severe disease than Delta and nearly 90% of BC adults have received a COVID-19 vaccine, patients who would derive a clinically meaningful ben- efit need to be carefully selected rather than applying trial inclusion criteria when choosing to offer treatment. COVID-19 therapies for mild to moderately ill patients This article is the opinion of the BC Centre for Disease Control and the BC COVID-19 Therapeutics Committee and has not been peer reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board.Who is at risk for hospitalization from COVID-19 in BC during the Omicron wave? In BC, the average risk of hospitalization in the Omicron wave decreased to 1.2% from the 6.3% observed during the Delta wave in patients who were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 3 In addition, an analysis conducted by the BCCDC of hospitalized patients from 3 January 2022 to 9 February 2022 demonstrated that approximately 60% of hospitalizations af- ter testing positive were incidentally diagnosed rather than being caused by severe COVID-19.4 The COVID-19 Therapeutics Committee has developed a set of BC-specific eligibility criteria to identify individuals who would be expected to benefit from these treatments based on local epidemiological data.3,4 Who is eligible to receive COVID-19 treatments? Adjusting for hospitalization rates, vaccina- tion status, and symptomatic versus incidental COVID-19 diagnosis, individuals who are at increased risk include those who are severely immunocompromised or have a combination of risk factors such as advanced age, lack of or incomplete immunization, and chronic condi- tions/comorbidities. Individuals who demon-strated at least a 3% risk of hospitalization in this analysis are currently eligible to receive treatment. Patients eligible for therapy have also been prioritized for PCR testing; however, a positive rapid antigen test is acceptable for diagnostic purposes [Table].

Patients need to be within 5 days of symptom onset to qualify, which can be extended to 7 days for those who would otherwise be referred for IV treatment solely on the basis of the treatment window. Those who are unable to see their family physician in time can be referred to the centralized COVID-19 Assessment and Treatment e-team (CATe) at 1 888 COVID-19. Ritonavir and, to a lesser extent, nirmatrel- vir are potent CYP3A4 inhibitors and interact with many medications that are metabolized through this pathway or are enzyme inducers. Common drug-drug interactions that either contraindicate the use of nirmatrelvir/ritona- vir or require modification include those with amiodarone, anticoagulants rivaroxaban and apixaban, immunosuppressants tacrolimus antiepileptics, calcium channel blockers, and fentanyl.5 A medication review is necessary for most patients, and a pharmacy consultation is recommended if significant interactions are present. A recent Canadian study demonstrated that 68% of older adults eligible for treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir had a drug-drug interaction and 21% were taking at least one inappropriate medication.6 Since patients who are at risk of hospitalization from COVID-19 are elderly with chronic conditions on multiple therapies, probability of drug-drug interactions with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is high, highlight- ing the importance of a comprehensive assess- ment of drug-drug interaction and proactive deprescribing prior to prescribing nirmatrelvir/ ritonavir to ensure patient safety. Remdesivir is the only available alternative for those with significant drug-drug interac- tions, and unlike sotrovimab, which is variant specific and prone to resistance with emerging variants of concern, remdesivir is a nucleoside analogue, which is stable against SARS-CoV-2 mutations. Additionally, the intravenous ad- ministration requires a referral to a health care facility at a local health authority for three daily 30-minute infusions. During the assessment of the first 200 patients who contacted Service BC for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, approximately 30% of patients who were eligible for therapy were referred for an alternative IV treatment due to drug-drug interactions. 7 What resources are available to clinicians? Clinicians can access a wide range of resources to assist with patient assessment and prescrib- ing of COVID-19 therapies. Evidence changes rapidly and resources are updated accordingly. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is prescribed using a specific prescription form, available at www2 .gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/health/forms/2368fil.pdf. Pharmacies that stock nirmatrelvir/ritonavir kits are listed at www.bcpharmacy.ca/paxlovid. The COVID-19 Therapeutics Commit - tee maintains the following resources on the BCCDC website (www.bccdc.ca/health -professionals/clinical-resources/covid-19-care/ treatments): COVID-19 Clinical Practice Guide. A comprehensive guide that includes recom - mendations and supporting evidence, in - cluding local epidemiological data. Practice Tool #1: Step-by-Step Assess - ment. Practical guidance on patient selec - tion, testing, clinical assessment, therapy management, and contact information for referrals and consultations. Practice Tool #2: Definitions of Clinically Extremely Vulnerable. Information for im - munocompromised and other at-risk groups. Practice Tool #3: Drug-Drug Interactions. A color-coded table of common interactions and management tips. Practice Tool #4: Pharmacist Counsel - ling Checklist. A quick-reference guide for pharmacists. Prescribers can also access a summary of the guidance in a two-page format, as well as a provider Q&A document, both available on the BCCDC website. The COVID-19 Antiviral Support Line for Clinicians is also available Monday to Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., at 1 866 604-5924. Prescribers can also request a personal- ized education session on nirmatrelvir/rito- navir provided by the Provincial Academic Detailing service.
