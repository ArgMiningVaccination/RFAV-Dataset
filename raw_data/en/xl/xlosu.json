No longer do you want that large waiting room with a grouchy person hidden behind the frosted glass telling you to take and seat and wait until \"they\" are ready for \"you\" and then being left in a sterile room for who knows how long, nor do we want an unexpected bill for services we didn't even know we needed, or if we even received them. Dr. Gerry and Dr. Steve understand this shift, and our office reflects that. That's why we offer online OR in-person scheduling and/or paperwork that fits your personality and can be done at your convenience, to up-front and clear pricing for our services, to each doctor personally greeting every one of our patients when you arrive. We believe the doctor/patient relationship is an important aspect of your care - which is why our office is set up to be focused on you. Our current pricing for physical medicine services (Chiropractic ~ Meridian / Acupuncture ~ Myofascial) is based on the following scale. Dr. Gerald is still billing insurance companies for any insurance he is in-network with. While you may still use your HSA/FSA cards with Dr. Steve, he is no longer billing services to the insurance company of any new patients. If we accept your insurance, the cost may be less, but never more. We do offer discounted pricing for non-insurance-based monthly and advanced pay care. We now require upfront payment for all Motor Vehicle or Workers' Compensation Accident care. As of Oct 1, 2023, we will no longer be in-network with Anthem BCBS. 15-minute visit - $48 30-minute visit - $90 45-minute visit - $140 Make an Appointment To learn more about each doctor - select their photo or name.
