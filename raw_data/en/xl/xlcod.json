However, based on the number of questionnaires issued to the Local Planning Authori ties and National Park Authorities [hereafter referred to as 'Planning Authorities'] we received 17 completed returns representing a planning authority response rate of 68%. Analysis of questionnaire responses excludes the ei ght planning authorities that did not respond. 2.2 Section B: The Local planning framework 2.2.1 Section B1: Personnel It was confirmed that there were a total of 487 ful l time employees working within planning departments across the 17 planning authorities. Th is equates to an average of circa 29 full time employees per planning department. Figure 1 demonstrates the proportion of personnel a s a function of role within planning departments. The greatest proportion of personnel are classified as development control/management staff at 44%; administration and support staff account for 28%; planning policy officers account for 23%. The remaining 5% are categorised as 'other' which represents officers involved in, among other things, sustainab le development.

Three planning authorities had specific targets in place, including two with a 20% renewable energy requirement on all new developments, and one with a 10% reduction in carbon dioxide over Part L. One planning authority required the ' support of renewable technologies' as identified in TAN 8; one had generic energy require ments; and one required that an energy design advice report accompany any non-residential development over 1,000 m 2. Five planning authorities did not have any specific targ ets in place. 2.2.3 Section B3: Implementation of low and zero c arbon policies Seven planning authorities [41%] required evidence on how low and zero carbon policies have been considered/incorporated into design for each p lanning application. The remaining ten planning authorities [59%] confirmed that they have no formal process in place to implement low and zero carbon policies. Four planning authorities that did require evidence based their assessment on design and access statements and/or sustainability statements; with the remaining three planning authorities basing their assessments on sustainabil ity checklists. One of the planning authorities that used a sustain ability checklist to assess low and zero carbon policies also used an energy design advice r eport, developed by the Carbon Trust for non-domestic developments over 1,000 m 2. Of the seven planning authorities that required evi dence six indicated that a development control officer/manager was responsible for checkin g for policy compliance. The remaining planning authority confirmed that an officer respon sible for grant regimes checked for compliance, although this was only in regard to ref urbishment projects [no department was currently responsible for checking new development compliance]. Regarding a post construction review of development s, three planning authorities [18%] confirmed that they undertake limited post construc tion reviews. Two of these planning authorities indicated that they would only undertak e a post construction review should it become apparent that enforcement is necessary. 2.2.4 Section B5: Preparation of new policy on low and zero carbon development Ten planning authorities [59%] confirmed that they preparing new policy on low and zero carbon development as part of the new Local Develop ment Plan. Of these ten, three confirmed that they are basing their low and zero carbon deve lopment policies on Technical Advice Note 8: Planning for Renewable Energy [TAN 8]; and/or t he Ministerial Interim Planning Policy Statement [MIPPS] on Climate Change. Two planning authorities indicated that they are wa iting for further national guidance prior developing policy as part of the new Local Developm ent Plan. Two planning authorities stated they were still dev eloping their Unitary Development Plans, one of which will incorporate low and zero carbon devel opment policies in the plan. The remaining three planning authorities confirmed they were not currently preparing new policy on low and zero carbon development. 2.2.5 Section B5: Planning Applications relating t o renewable or low carbon energy technologies Ten planning authorities confirmed that they had re ceived at least one planning application for renewable energy or low carbon energy [LZC] technol ogies. However, one of these planning authorities could not confirm the exact number of p lanning applications for each LZC technology between 2005 and 2007. The data provide d by this planning authority has been excluded from this assessment for accuracy. The fo llowing summary is therefore based on the remaining nine planning authorities. Between 2005 and 2007 there were a total of 49 plan ning applications for LZC technologies throughout the nine planning authorities. Four wer e received in 2005; 18 were received in 2006; and 27 were received in 2007. Faber Maunsell Local Authority Research Project on the Implemen tation of Planning Policy for Zero Carbon Developme nt 6 The proportion of LZC technologies between 2005 and 2007 is confirmed in Figure 3 below. Wind turbines were the greatest number of LZC techn ology applications [51%]; followed heating systems [ 8%]; 'other' [8%]; combined heat and power systems [6%]; with the lowest number of application s for solar hot water heating systems and heat pumps [2% respectively]. Wind Biomass Photovoltaic Solar Thermal Heat Pumps CHP Other Figure 2: Proportion of LZC technologies applicati ons between 2005 and 2007. The temporal range in the number and type of LZC te chnology application is given in Figure 3 below. 0.00 2.00 4.00 6.00 8.00 10.00 12.00 14.00 Wind Biomass Photovoltaic Solar Thermal Heat Pumps CHP Ot her 2005 2006 2007 Figure 3: The temporal range of LZC technology app lications The proportion of LZC technology applications durin g 2005, 2006 and 2007 is given in Figure 4 below. Faber Maunsell Local Authority Research Project on the Implemen tation of Planning Policy for Zero Carbon Developme nt 7 During 2005, photovoltaic cells represented the gre atest number of applications at 50% with wind turbines and 'other' LZC representing the addi tional applications [25% respectively]. During 2006, wind turbines represented the greatest number of applications [72%]; with biomass heating systems [11%]; photovoltaic cells [ 11%]; and 'other' LZC technologies. During 2007 the proportion of LZC technology applic ations included wind turbines [41%]; systems [ 7%]; CHP Heat Pumps Solar Thermal Photovoltaic Biomass Wind Figure 4: The proportion of LZC technology applica tions during 2005, 2006 and 2007. 2.3 Section C: Low and zero carbon development exp erience 2.3.1 Section C1: Existing low or zero carbon deve lopments Seven planning authorities indicated that they had either at least one existing or proposed low or zero carbon development. The total number of low or zero carbon developments throughout the seven planning authorities was 20. This included 15 existing buildings and fi ve approved developments. Of the 20 existing and proposed low and zero carbon developments four developments had been designed to a BREEAM rating of 'Excellent', an d one had been designed to an EcoHomes rating of 'Good'. Eight of the proposed and existing low and zero car bon developments incorporated LZC technologies. 2.3.2 Section C2: Low and zero carbon development involvement Of the 20 existing and proposed low and zero carbon developments, four had received personal involvement from a planning authority respondent. All four of these developments involved officers from the same planning authority. One planning authority indicated that they had been directly involved in all previous planning applications for proposed wind farms throughout tha t authority though they could not identify officers with personal experience of individual dev elopments. One planning authority confirmed that they had asse ssed one proposed low and zero carbon development. The application was later refused at planning committee. 2.3.3 Section C3: Effective policy and guidance in implementing low and zero carbon developments One planning authority confirmed that they used eff ective policy from their UDP and SPG to secure low and zero carbon developments. This plan ning authority and a further two planning Faber Maunsell Local Authority Research Project on the Implemen tation of Planning Policy for Zero Carbon Developme nt 8 authorities indicated they recommended other princi ples/methods in securing low and zero carbon developments. These included: /square4 Early discussions with the developers to agree pri nciples for development of the site; /square4 BREEAM requirements /square4 Welsh Assembly Government policy requirements on p ublic buildings /square4 Incorporating 'sustainability' into the contract s pecification 2.4 Section D: Views on barriers and opportunities 2.4.1 Section D1: Do current policies allow for th e successful implementation of low and zero Carbon developments? Four planning authorities confirmed that they consi dered that their current policies allowed for the successful implementation of low and zero carbo n development. Eight planning authorities indicated that the forth coming LDP and/or SPG (including the Sustainable Design Guidance for three National Park s in Wales) will allow for successful implementation in the future. Suggested changes to improve this process include: \"Policies need to be developed which encourage rene wable energy generation or higher than average sustainable energy standards. Targets need to be set, and staffs need to be trained to promote, support and monitor its implementation.\" \"Firm policy lead from WAG will be vital to driving performance.\" \"Further emphasis on public awareness, building, an d development industry training will be necessary.\" \"We need more specific policies to encourage it e.g . introducing the Merton 10% rule etc...\" 2.4.2 Section D2: Additional mechanisms that are i nfluential in delivering low and zero carbon developments Planning authorities were asked to comment on the e ffectiveness of mechanisms outside of local planning policy that are considered influenti al in delivering low and zero carbon developments. Mechanisms included: /square4 National policy and/or guidance /square4 Corporate policy /square4 Financial incentives /square4 Specific requirements of delivering public sector funded development /square4 Developer initiative /square4 Working with support/partner organisations /square4 Local planning officers /square4 Members of planning committee/local councillors /square4 Other Figure 5 indicates the number of planning authoriti es that indicated additional mechanisms that were positively influential in delivering low and z ero carbon developments.

National policy and/or guidance: It was indicated that national policy and/or guidan ce contributed (or would contribute) positively to delivering LZC development by nine planning auth orities [53%]. Comments include: \"Very effective and provide national policy framewo rk in which to work up detailed local policies.\" \"A useful incentive, but which awaits changes in l egislation to be more effective.\" Corporate policy Five planning authorities reported that corporate p olicy contributed positively to the delivery of low and zero carbon developments. One of the plann ing authorities indicated that a 'Green Dragon' programme has had particular success in ach ieving more energy efficient development throughout the authority. Two planning authorities indicated that corporate p olicy had not been effective with one authority stating that this was a particular \"weakn ess.\" Financial incentives Eight planning authorities [47%] confirmed that fin ancial initiatives contributed positively to the delivery of low and zero carbon developments. Comm ents included: \"Potentially a very effective tool which could prov ide large-scale compliance if sufficiently resourced from a national perspective.\" \"Very effective as makes innovative schemes viable and set benchmarks for new development.\" \"Increased fuel costs are driving new projects.\" Specific requirements of delivering public sector f unded development Nine planning authorities [53%] confirmed that spec ific requirements of delivering public sector funded development contributed positively to the de livery of low and zero carbon developments. Two planning authorities stated that developments m ust achieve particular BREEAM ratings; and a further two planning authorities referred to specific housing association / social housing requirements. Faber Maunsell Local Authority Research Project on the Implemen tation of Planning Policy for Zero Carbon Developme nt 10 Additional comments include: \"Any requirements would need to be matched by suffi cient resources made available from national to local government for this purpose.\" Developer initiative Nine planning authorities [53%] confirmed that deve loper initiatives contributed positively to the delivery of low and zero carbon developments, with one planning authority stating that leaving the process to developer initiative was not an effe ctive process. One planning authority stated that organisations' e xisting corporate environmental management initiatives play a part in steering the design of t he development to incorporate some form of low and zero carbon development. Additional comments include: \"Currently, [it is] the best way of pursuing such development, but [it is] also in need of incentive funding.\" \"Effective in setting benchmarks for new developmen t and setting best practice.\" Working with support/partner organisations Eight planning authorities [47%] confirmed that wor king with support/partner organisations contributed positively to the delivery of low and z ero carbon developments. Planning authorities confirmed support/partnership organisations provide d support in sharing best practice and skills in order to deliver benchmarking schemes and to hel p develop sustainable development checklists. Support/partner organisations that were confirmed i nclude: Energy Savings Trust; and the Sustainable Development Fund. Local planning officers Four planning authorities [24%] confirmed that loca l planning officers contributed positively to the delivery of low and zero carbon developments, i ncluding one planning authority that stated it was 'vital'. However, there were some concerns reg arding resourcing and skill levels, with one planning authority stating that [planning officers securing LZC development] was ineffective. Comments included: \"[Officers are] very supportive in principle, but presently lack s ufficient resources to offer an improved service in support of developers.\" \"Effective if skills are in place to deliver aspira tions set out in national and local policy.\" Members of planning committee/local councillors Six planning authorities [35%] confirmed that plann ing committee members and/or local councillors contributed positively to the delivery of low and zero carbon developments, including one planning authority that stated it was 'vital'. Three planning authorities were concerned that some planning committee members and/or local councillors are not aware of positive sustain able design practices/issues. One planning authority stated that committee member s and local councillors were 'ineffective' in relation to this agenda. Other Four planning authorities provided comments on addi tional mechanisms that influence the delivery of low and zero carbon developments. Comm ents include: /square4 Economic - the need and desire for cheap electrici ty /square4 The use of building control officers to help deliv er low and zero carbon developments /square4 Building Regulations /square4 The need to develop general awareness within the c ommunity and development industry. Faber Maunsell Local Authority Research Project on the Implemen tation of Planning Policy for Zero Carbon Developme nt 11 2.4.3 Section D3: Current barriers to implementati on of low and zero carbon development Planning authorities responded on what they perceiv ed to be the current barriers to implementing more low and zero carbon development. A summary of comments is given below and demonstrated in Figure 7 below. 14 planning authorities [82%] indicated that there needs to be further guidance and/or stronger legislation in place. This included guidance and n ational policy/legislation from the Welsh Assembly Government and revisions/updates to Buildi ng Regulations Eight authorities [47%] stated that they felt a lac k of awareness regarding how to advise on and implement low and zero carbon developments; Four planning authorities [24%] stated that there w as a lack of leadership either from the Welsh Assembly Government or their own planning authority . Four planning authorities [24%] indicated that the lack of available grants and/or the cost of developing low and zero carbon projects had been a barrier to implementation. Two planning authorities confirmed that a lack of e xisting resources within the authority were a significant barrier to implementation. Other comments included: /square4 'NIMBYism' /square4 BREEAM and Code for Sustainable Home not actually qualifying for the term 'zero carbon' /square4 Supply Guidance Leadership Awareness / Trainin g Cost / Grants / Viability Limited Resources Figure 6: Current barriers to implementation of lo w and zero carbon developments Faber Maunsell Local Authority Research Project on the Implemen tation of Planning Policy for Zero Carbon Developme nt 12 2.4.4 Section D4: Options to improve the implement ation of low and zero carbon development The following comments were made with regards to im proving the implementation of low and zero carbon developments: /square4 Fiscal incentives /square4 National requirements, not targets - building regu lation /square4 Firstly a need to implement strict regulatory requ irements on carbon monitoring of developments and a legal obligation to reject all d evelopment that produces carbon above agreed levels. /square4 Have carbon and climate change and fossil fuel dep endency as the three central themes of all national, local, and community policies. /square4 Fiscal incentives have proved too many 'false dawn s' the cost of implementation still exceeds all of a business as usual approach. /square4 Trial of a radical alternative in a local authorit y, with strong regulatory and financial backing to ensure all local developments and policies are s ustainable on the strictest possible criteria. /square4 Set higher standards. /square4 Police i.e. enforcement of Part L by the private s ector. /square4 Provision of clear national planning guidance, whi ch includes minimum targets. /square4 Training for members and officers /square4 Information on current best practice and funding f or further examples of best practice. /square4 Officer training and member training. /square4 Clear guidance and support from the top /square4 Nationally set targets. /square4 Assistance with implementation (offering advice to applicants). /square4 0% interest loans to purchase boiler, solar hot wa ter, insulation etc. /square4 Training / information for developers and staff. /square4 Financial incentives, especially for smaller devel opers. /square4 More easily understandable guidance on what techno logies etc are appropriate in which locations. /square4 Council is about to start using a new system for l ogging planning applications which will provide national and local indicators of performanc e. One locally set indicator will relate to sustainable development measures though the exact w ording is not yet decided. 2.4.5 Section D5: Additional comments The following additional comments were made: /square4 The key element to be addressed is to ensure that all development must be able to sustain at the very minimum all of its electrical and heati ng requirements either onsite or as part of a wider community initiative. /square4 Redefine zero carbon development so that it is jus t that. /square4 Strive for, define and then prove that carbon nega tive (inc. all associated carbon) developments can be achieved within a maximum times cale of 10 years. /square4 Is it reasonable to ask this question before the n ecessary changes in legislation and which offer real financial incentives to promote such dev elopments are in place? Probably not. /square4 Operating systems will need to become much more so phisticated and then standardised nationally and within local authorities, before pro per monitoring and performance levels can be set, and this will require a major national inje ction of resources to support incentives locally. Faber Maunsell Local Authority Research Project on the Implemen tation of Planning Policy for Zero Carbon Developme nt 13 /square4 The planning system is capable of setting a framew ork for assessing applications for low and zero carbon development but the detailed assess ment and post construction monitoring of development to ensure compliance is b eyond the current skills base of the planning system and in this respect the role of the building control system needs to be clarified given their skills base. /square4 Stringer guidance and targets should be set. /square4 We are currently exploring a policy similar to Utt lesford District Council, to improve the dwellings in the County. There is a question over h ow much time the Building Regulations team have to offer applicants advice on energy effi cient savings. Your assistance would be appreciated to offer advice whilst planning officer s gain confidence. /square4 Needs to be more prescriptive and informative. 'Gu idance' isn't enough to persuade developers, especially where there are cost implica tions. /square4 More accessible information & opportunity to discu ss with planning professionals about the local stance. /square4 There is an impression that there is a lot of talk ing about the issues & lots of plans and strategies but not much action on the ground. /square4 Need planning inspectors to back up LPA's if refus als for permission are based on low carbon / environmental grounds. /square4 Minimum building standards need to be improved and set nationally through planning policy Wales and/or building regulations. /square4 Initiative should be taken by local planning autho rities to secure development which exceeds minimum standards through positive local po licies and SPG. /square4 More innovative and imaginative ways of securing m ore LZC development will be required in area where the market is relatively weak. /square4 The main ways in which the planning system can del iver more zero and low carbon developments must be through requirements and targe ts embodied in planning policy, either at national or local level and implemented t hrough design requirements at the application stage, and legal obligations. /square4 Building shortly arising from the planning system being expected to deliver. /square4 Substantial contributions to meeting affordable ho using needs. /square4 A step-change in sustainability of new buildings. /square4 A substantial contribution to infrastructure costs . /square4 Require carbon zero development in guidance. /square4 Welsh Assembly Government set carbon reduction tar gets at a local authority level. /square4 Where carbon production is unavoidable in developm ent e.g. power stations, guidance allowing Authorities to require s106 payments to re duce carbon reduction elsewhere e.g. fund for grants to households to install solar heat ing, double & secondary glazing etc. /square4 Guidance with a presumption that development that generates heat and/or energy will capture and use that energy wherever feasible e.g. through CHP district heating schemes etc. or risk applications being refused. /square4 The use of development management to consider the approach of individual proposals rather than national sustainable building standards (minimum). /square4 Development should be seen as good enough to achie ve planning permission (consider each app on its merits), rather than poor enough to refuse, (national sustainable building standards do not encourage development to aim to be as good as it possibly can). /square4 Need to provide strict targets for implementation of zero/low carbon targets and apply them consistently.
