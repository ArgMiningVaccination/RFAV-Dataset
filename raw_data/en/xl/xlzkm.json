Mild symptoms can be helped by acupuncture, herbal medicine, dietary supplements and mind body therapies. - CAM therapies are supportive although hormone therapy is most helpful for moderate to severe symptoms during the menopause transition. CAM can be a helpful adjunctive therapy - CAM (if carefully chosen and properly used) can improve quality of life. - It is important to let your healthcare practitioner know about any CAM therapies you use or are considering using as not all have evidence of safety and effectiveness. - Many CAM modalities are not covered by insurance and therefore have an out of pocket expense. - Visit the website from the [National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/menopausal-symptoms-in-depth) for more information - It's important to consider the benefits and risks of complementary therapies and alternative treatments in the context of the other forms of treatments that are available.
