The Purpose of This Tool Culture, language and health literacy barriers can affect a patient's ab ility to engage in the discharge process and after-hospital se lf care that can lead to preventabl e hospital readmissions. The objectives of this tool are: To explain why it is important to address patient s' culture and linguistic needs as part of the ReEngineered Discharge (RED). To describe the infrastructure needed to delive r RED in a culturally a nd linguistically competent manner. To describe how the Discharge Educators (DEs ) can deliver the RED to diverse populations, defined as diversity of language, culture, race, ethnicity, educational ba ckground, health literacy and/or social circumstance. To provide DEs practical strategi es to ensure the successful delivery of the RED to patients with socio-cultural and language assistance needs, us ing effective cross-cu ltural communication and educational strategies. This RED tool is meant to be used in concert with the other RED tools in this toolkit. \u00a9 Copyright 2011 by Boston Medical Center Corporation 4DRAFT2. Culture, Language and Health Literacy Can Influence Readmissions In its Advancing Effective Communication, Cultural Competence, and Patient- and Family-Centered Care , the Joint Commission states that hospitals should incorporate the patient's unique needs into discharge planning and instruction. 1 Meeting patients' communication needs is critical not only to providi ng quality care, but also in avoiding preventable readmissions. Case example : Undisclosed conflicts in health belief systems can affect a patient's ability to understand the discharge plan. For example, if a patient with asthma understands the illness to be a result of a poorly functioning immune system, it may be difficult for him to understand why treatment to quiet the immune system (i.e., systemic steroids) would help to make him feel better. If the DE identifies this problem as purely a health literacy barrier, he/she may simplify the discharge education approach with little improvement in patient understanding or acceptance of the treatment plan. However, eliciting and discussing the patient's explanatory model of his illness and his health belief system may alert the DE to the underlying cross cultural conflict, allowing the DE to then notify the responsible clinician and suggest a culturally competent renegotiation of the discharge plan to accommodate the patient's explanatory model of the illness. 2.1 Culture and Its Relationship to Readmissions Demographic changes occurring across the United States are impacting and challenging the delivery of health care in U.S. hospitals. By 2030, racial/ethnic minority persons are expected to represent 40 percent of the US population while the health care workforce is expected to be predominantly represented by non-Hispanic whites. 2 One consequence of this rapidly changing demographic is that there will be a notable increas e in the prevalence of cross- cultural clinical en counters involving a broad array of patients with diverse health beliefs, language preferences, cultural norms, and health seeking behaviors. Culture is the learned, share d, patterns of beliefs, values, attitudes, and behaviors char acteristic of a society or population.3 From this cultural context emerges the patient' s health belief system and explanatory model of the illness.4 A patient's explanatory mode l for his/her disease includes his/her understanding of the cause, the treatment options and outcomes associated with the disease. In cross-cultural clinical encounters, there are multiple cultural influences and h ealth belief systems in action, such as the culture of the provider, the culture of the patient, the culture of Western medicine, and the culture of the healthcare system. When these cultures clash, misunderstandings about the nature of an illness, its remedies, and appropriate health behaviors are more likely to occur. It is important to remember that cross-cultural communication requires not just translation of words from one language to another, but also an exchange of shared meanings.5 Aside from the obvious consequence of not understa nding the discharge plan (i.e., non-adherence with follow-up appointments, medicines, etc), communication ba rriers can lead to a sense of not being understood as a person on the part of the patient and the clinician, leading to mistrust and treatment non-adherence that threaten the successf ul transition from hospital to home. 6 Thus, omitting pertinent cultural and linguistic considerations from the discharge planning process may inadvertently expose patients to otherwise preventable adve rse events that can lead to unplanned readmissions. \u00a9 Copyright 2011 by Boston Medical Center Corporation 5DRAFT2.2 Language and Its Relationship to Readmissions Limited English proficiency (LEP) - the limited ability or inability to speak, read, write or understand the English language - can prevent individuals from inte racting effectively with h ealth care providers. Over 20 million people or 8.6% of the US population are LEP status.7 LEP status has been associated with communication problems. For example, non-English sp eaking patients in the U.S. are 40 percent more likely to experience physical harm associated with an adverse event than E nglish-speaking patients reporting an adverse event, and a dverse events reported by LEP patient s are more likely to be due to communication errors.8 Without appropriate language assist ance for LEP patients, DEs will face challenges in teaching patients how to take care of themselves when they get home, including how to take the medicines that could prevent readmission. Arrangements for appropriate language assistance after discharge (e.g., post-discharge follow-up phone call, subsequent laboratory tests, at follow-up appointments) are also needed, a nd required by law. For more info rmation please see The Office of Minority Health's explanation of Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services (CLAS) at http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/templa tes/browse.aspx?lvl=2&lvlID=15 . 2.3 Health Literacy and its Relationship to Readmissions Health literacy refers to a patient's ability \"to ob tain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.\"9 It is estimated that 77 million US adults have limited health literacy, and that heal th literacy barriers are more comm on among minority adults and those who did not speak English before going to school.10 Yet, assessing health literacy in a cross-cultural context can be complex, with a wide array of cultural factors potentially affecting a patient's ability to understand health-related information. Th e Joint Commission, in its report, What Did the Doctor Say? Improving Health Literacy to Protect Patient Safety , recommends practices to avoid miscommunication that could lead to readmission.11 These practices are part of RED and are described in detail in the following sections. \u00a9 Copyright 2011 by Boston Medical Center Corporation 6DRAFT3. Preparing to Provide RED to Diverse Populations 3.1 Hiring bilingual, bicultural Discharge Educators Staff who share the language and cu ltural background of the community se rved by a hospital help create a welcoming environment that encourages open communication.1 If you have a concentration of LEP or non-English speaking patients who prefer to use a pa rticular language, consider hiring a DE who is bilingual and bicultural. If you hire a bilingual DE, you must ensure he/she is proficient in the secondary language and has training in medical interpreting. It can be tempting to try to \"g et by\" with staff members who possess less than proficient language skills or by using bili ngual staff who do not have proper training in medical interpretation but doing so can pose a significant patient safety risk and should be avoided. 3.2 Cultural and Linguistic Competence Training All DE's should participate in formal training in cross-cultural healthcare to gain a full appreciation of how culture and language influence healthcare. Even bi cultural and bilingual DEs will be asked to provide services to patients with cultural a nd language preferences that differ fr om their own. DE's should strive to cultivate cultural self-awareness, avoid making assumptions about patients' needs and be open to learning from patients themselves.1 In addition, all DE's should receive training in cross-cultural communication and the \"Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services\" (CLAS) standards.12 Some available resources for cultural training include: Unified Health Communications (HRSA): http://www.hrsa.gov/publichea lth/healthliter acy/index.html Think Cultural (OMH): https://www.thinkculturalhealth.hhs.gov Addressing Language and Culture in Health Care Practices http://www.vimeo.com/15822032 The Provider's Guide to Quality and Culture (HRSA): http://erc.msh.org/mainpage.cfm?file=1.0.htm&module=provider&language=English 3.3 Availability of Interpreter and Translation Services What is a qualified medical interpreter ? A qualified medical interpreter must have language proficiency, medical knowledge, and interpreter skills. Several organizations have developed standards for interpreter certification including the National Council on Interpreting in Health Care (www.ncihc.org), the National Board of Certification for Medical Interpreters (www.certifiedmedicalinterpreters.org ) and the American Translators Association (www.atanet.org ). Access to language se rvices facilitates patient participation in care. Investing in language services can help prevent costly readmissions and reduce the cost of providing high quality healthcare. 13 A trained medical interpre ter should assist in all in-person and phone clinical encounters with patients requiring language services. Even if your patient speaks English fluently, it may be necessary to employ interpreter services to help teach the discharge plan to supportive caregivers. \u00a9 Copyright 2011 by Boston Medical Center Corporation 7DRAFT4. Overview for Delivering RED to Diverse Patient Populations Each of the components of the RED program can benef it from a culturally-appropr iate approach. Some of the ways this can be done are listed in the Table. RED Component RED Culturally-Responsive Approach 1. Make appointments for follow-up medical appointments and post discharge tests/labs. Arrange for language assistance if needed at follow up appointments. Discuss reason for and importance of appointments, including tests/laboratory work. Instruct patient in any preparation required for future tests. Inquire about follow up w ith traditional healers. Discuss whether any upcoming religious or holiday observances will interfere with follow up appointments. Confirm patient understanding of timing and location of appointments and any advance pr eparation required through teach- back. 2. Plan for the follo w-up of results from lab tests or studies that are pending at discharge. Review laboratory tests that have been performed but results are not ready. Determine how results of the tests will be conveyed to patient. 3. Organize post-discharge outpatient services and medical equipment. Collaborate with case manager to ensure that durable medical equipment is obtained and how and when it will be delivered to the patients home Teach how to use durable medical equipment, with language assistance if needed. 4. Identify the correct medicines and a plan for the patient to obtain and take them. Ascertain what vitamins, herbal medicines, or other dietary supplements patient takes and use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies. Alert clinicians to any possible drug-drug or drug-CAM interactions or harmful supplements. Explain what medicines to take, emphasizing any changes in the regimen, using color-coded calendar in AHCP with symbols and pictorial cues. Confirm understanding through teach-back. Assess patient's concerns about me dication plan, especially conflicts with health beliefs. 5. Reconcile the discharge plan with national guidelines. Compare treatment plan with National Guidelines Clearinghouse recommendations for patient's diag nosis and alert the medical team of discrepancies. 6. Teach a written discharge plan the patient can understand. Create an After Hospital Care Plan (AHCP) in the patient's preferred language. Review and orients the patient to all aspect of the AHCP. Employ the color-coded calendar with symbols and pictorial cues to support comprehension and mastery of discharge plan. 7. Educate the patient about his/her diagnosis. Obtain interpreter services, if needed. Identify key family members and co mmunity leaders or healers to engage in explaining the diagnosis in a way the patient can understand. \u00a9 Copyright 2011 by Boston Medical Center Corporation 8DRAFTRED Component RED Culturally-Responsive Approach Clarify role of family members. Elicit patient's/family's explan atory model of the illness. Inquire about role of lay healers, faith healers and CAM therapy use. Document cultural considerations. 8. Assess the degree of the patient's understanding of this plan. Obtain interpreter service, if needed. Assesses the degree of understanding by asking patients to explain in their own words the details of the plan. Might require removal of lang uage and literacy barriers. Might require utilizing qualified interpreters. Might require contacting family members and/or other caregivers who will share in the care-giving responsibilities. Identify mistrust of treatment plan that might result from conflicting patient beliefs/practices, and create plan to mitigate. 9. Review with the patient what to do if a problem arises. Obtain interpreter service, if needed. Instruct on a specific plan of ho w to contact the PCP by providing contact numbers for evenings and weekends. Instruct on what constitutes an emergency and what to do in cases of emergency. 10. Expedite transmission of the discharge summary to clinicians accepting care of the patient. Deliver discharge summary and AHCP to clinicians (physicians, visiting nurses, etc.) via fax or email within 24 hours of discharge. Include information about language preference, language assistance needs, and cultural considerations. 11. Provide telephone reinforcement of the Discharge Plan. Call the patient within 3 days after discharge to reinforce the discharge plan and help with problem-solving. Use qualified interpreters if caller does not speak patient's preferred language. Staff DE Help Line. Answer phone calls from patients, family, and/or other caregivers with questions about the AHCP, hospitalization, and follow-up plan in order to help patient transition from hospital care to outpatient care setting. Use qualified in terpreters if DE does not speak patient's preferred language. \u00a9 Copyright 2011 by Boston Medical Center Corporation 9DRAFT5. Getting Started with the RED for Diverse Populations Strategies that assist health pr ofessionals to anticipate, identify and address cultural and linguistic communication barriers can sign ificantly improve the hospital discharge experience and reduce unnecessary readmissions. The DE's awareness of the potential for a cross-cultural communication barriers and use of strategies to anti cipate and address these barriers can he lp avert mishaps. It is therefore essential for the DE to know how to assess communication and cultural ne eds and implement strategies to address barriers when providing th e RED program to patients who would benefit for this assistance. 5.1 Understanding Patients and Communicating Across Differences All patients and clinicians have so ciocultural backgrounds that influence their approach to health care and shape their worldviews and values on health and illness. This diversity in health perspectives brings both challenges and opportunities to clinical care. Among the challenges releva nt to cross-cultural health care are the heightened risk for communication problems and disc ordance in health belief systems between patients, their families and clinicians. A number of approaches to cross-cultural communication have been developed. Below is a summary of three approach es to cross-cultural communication. 5.1.1 The Kleinman Model The Kleinman Questions to elicit health beliefs14 The Kleinman Model What do you think has caused your problem? Why do you think it started when it did? What do you think your sickness does to you? How does it work? How severe is your sickness? Will it have a short or long course? What kind of treatment do you think you should receive? What are the most important resu lts you hope to receive from t his treatment? What are the chief problems your sickness has caused for you? What do you fear most about your sickness? \u00a9 Copyright 2011 by Boston Medical Center Corporation 10DRAFT5.1.2 The LEARN Model The LEARN Model (Listening, Explanation of provide r perceptions, Acknowledgement of differences, treatment Recommendations, and Negotiation of plans:15 The LEARN Model The LEARN Model by Berlin and Fo wkes is a structured approach t o crosscultural communication based on a mnemonic of LEARN. L Listen to the patient's perspective E Explain and share one's own perspective A Acknowledge differences and similarities between these two perspectives R Recommend a treatment plan N Negotiate a mutually agreed-on treatment plan 5.1.3 The RESPECT Model The RESPECT Model (Respect; Explanatory model; So cial context, includi Therapeutic alliance/ Team).16 5.2 Non-Verbal Communication Styles While Teaching the RED While language is often the most commonly held noti on of communication, one culturally-rooted aspect of communication style is the empha sis on non-verbal communication. Non-verbal communication includes not only facial expressions and ge stures; it also involves personal distance and time references. Here are some examples of how non-verbal communication can affect patient- clinician interactions. Assertiveness : Differences in cultural norms regarding the appropriate degr ee of demonstrated assertiveness or deference in communicating can create mis understandings during clinical encounters. For example, some racial/ethnic grou ps carry a legacy of discrimination in medical treatment. As such, they may present for care with the expectation of needing to advocate earnestly for the care they deserve and need. This can be expressed or perceived as aggression and create tension between clinicians and patients, resulting in under-treatment of pai n, disregard of serious symptoms or low patient confidence in providers and treatment plans. Deference : Alternately, some patients will not make ey e contact with a clinician as a sign of deference and respect toward the provider. However, this behavior can be misconstrued by clinicians as mistrust or dishone sty. In such a case, it is best to follow the patient's lead and not impose eye contact when it is not desired. Agreeable: Finally, some patient always seem to agree, nod and smile in response to everything you say. Yet, there is some question as to whether they truly agree or und erstand the treatment plan. When this occurs, try the teach-back met hod to assess understanding and shared meaning. \u00a9 Copyright 2011 by Boston Medical Center Corporation 11DRAFTThe rest of this tool addresses the DE directly. 5.3 Health Beliefs, Alternative Healers and Attitudes About Medicines Illness is a culturally constructed experience molded by an individual's health belief system, settled within a complex social, family and cultural contex t. How a person copes and behaves in relation to illness is based on his/her culturally-defined explanatory model and meaning of the illness.6 It is therefore not uncommon to find as many explanations for an illness as there are diverse cultures residing in a community. To ensure the success of a discharge plan, you should elicit the patient's u nderstanding of hi s/her illness and explore how the individual wishes to address treatment. To gath er this information, you might ask \"What do you think has caused your illness?\" \"What do you think will help you get better?\" Reassure the patient that their an swers to these questions will help you in developing a comprehensive and effective treatment plan. This a pproach will allow you to identify any possible underlying discordance between the patient, the family and the clinical team pertaining to how the disease process is defined and beliefs about the proper course of treatment. You s hould inform the primary clinician regarding patient disagreement. You can encourag e this discussion by asking: \"How do you prefer to treat your high blood pressure?\" \"Do you find it easy to take your prescribed medicines or do you prefer other kinds of treatment?\" \"Is there anything that you'd be worried about if you took the medication also?\" \"Would you consider using both garlic and the medication?\" You should check with the patient about dietary change s that may concern him/her, such as fasting or cultural food practices related to holidays or religi ous observances. Be sure th e patient understands when a diet is needed to avoid specific disease complications such as for avoiding Coumadin (anticoagulant) toxicity which is sensitive to diet, or such conditions as glucose control among diabetics or salt intake to prevent worsening of congestive heart failure. Techniques that can be used to encourage communication include: Listening carefully to what is said Repeating messages that ar e not readily understood Accepting responsibility for a lack of understanding Phrasing questions in different ways Creating a relaxed atmosphere. Strive to overcome barriers to eff ective communication by approaching a ll patients from different cultural backgrounds with positive rega rd and an ethic of caring.17 This means focusing on the responsibility to the patient and demonstrating attributes of: \u00a9 Copyright 2011 by Boston Medical Center Corporation 12DRAFT\u00a9 Copyright 2011 by Boston Medical Center Corporation 13 Attentiveness Honesty Patience Respect Compassion Trustworthiness 5.4 Assessing Communication and Cultural Needs To assess the success of the RED program among di verse populations, some strategies include: Conduct a thorough and respectful in quiry into the unique cultural preferences and values of patients. This will allow you to tailor the discharge teaching to meet patients' needs and to ensure that patients' values and norms ar e integrated into the plan for care when the patient is at home. Inquire and document any specific patient needs for language assistance. Please see the HRET Disparities Toolkit for guidance: http://www.hretdisparities.org/ 18 Be sensitive to the fact that patients' language skills can dimini sh under stress. Patients who are usually proficient in English may find themselves needing language assistance. Moreover, patients who competently speak more than one langua ge may have a clear language preference. Use materials and teaching methods (such as the teach-back method) that are appropriate for all levels of health literacy. This is a universal precautions approach and circumvents the need for health literacy screening. DRAFT6. Teaching the AHCP to Limited English Proficiency Patients Using the RED workstation, the After Hospital Care Plan ( AHCP) can now be printed in English, Chinese Mandarin and Spanish. Some tips for teaching the AHCP for LEP patients are listed below: Use a \"universal precautions\" approach for discha rge education, assuming that all patients have some limitation in health literacy. Even patients who have adequate health literacy when they are healthy may have difficulty understanding health information when they do not feel well or worried. Use the teach-back method to assess comprehension of discha rge instructions that is described in the RED tool called \" How to Deliver the RED at Your Hospital \". Remember that just like English- proficient patients, not all LEP pa tients can read in their preferred language. Do not rely on the patient being able to read the AHCP. Make sure you have instructed the patient on all elements of the AHCP and c onfirmed the patient understands. Provide the AHCP in English as well the patient's preferred language, for the benefit of health care providers and care takers who read English. AHCPs that are not printed in the patient's preferred language have a space in each section for a medical interpreter to print the tr anslated discharge instructions in the patient's own language. Be sure that the printing is le gible in the space provided. The AHCP was designed to use symbols and color codes to help make the instructions understandable for patients with low health literacy or LEP. Be sure to explain the meaning of the symbols clearly and confirm shared meaning between you and the patient with respect to what the symbols indicate. For example, be sure to expl ain clearly that a sun symbol on the medication instruction sheet means to take the medicine in the morning, not at noontime or that a moon symbol means to take the medicine in the evening, not at bedtime. The AHCP includes a color-coded ca lendar to help patients learn how to take medicines and to help them remember to the correct dates of th eir follow-up appointment. When printed using the workstation, the calendar will record major religious observances for a wide array of faiths. When helping patients arrange follow up appointments, you can reference the calendar to determine whether any special religious observances will occur in the 30-day period following discharge. This information may be important when sche duling follow up appointments or to determine whether the occasion involves spec ial foods or fasting that might require additional education or a change in the treatment plan. \u00a9 Copyright 2011 by Boston Medical Center Corporation 14DRAFT7. Using Medical Language Assistance to Create and Teach the AHCP All recipients of Federal funds, such as Medicare or Medicaid providers, must offer language assistance to any person requiring such services in a health care setting.19 Qualified medical in terpreters can improve the quality of health care services for LEP patient s. If you have little or no experience working with medical interpreters, find out what training is availa ble to help you work more effectively and efficiently with interpreters. Familiarize yourself with the language assistance progr ams at your hospital. Learn the proper procedures for requesting language assistance and be aware if advanced noti ce is needed. When arranging for language assistance for the final interaction when th e AHCP is taught, be sure to inform the medical interpreter that up to one hour of assistance might be required. Co mmon options for trained medical interpreter services are: Face-to-face trained medical interpreter at bedside Trained medical interprete r accessed by phone or video It is not appropriate to engage the patient's family or friends as medical interpreters to deliver the RED program. They may not be able to ca pably interpret medical information and/or it may interact with power relations within the family in unpredictable ways. Fa mily involvement can be encouraged to support the patient and treatment plan rather than to serve as interpreters. 7.1 Working with Qualified Medical Interpreters A few tips for working with qualified medical interprete rs are included here as an introduction. This is not a substitute for training on working with interpreters. Preparation : Before seeing the patient, explain to the interpreter what the RE D is, what your role is and the goals of the teaching session are. Share re levant patient background information with the interpreter. Ask the interpreter what he/she needs from you during the meeting, and ask them to inform you whenever he/she engages in convers ation or diversions from the exact sentence by sentence interpretation with the patient. The inte rpreter may break role if the patient addresses them directly with a question or statement or if the trained medical interpreter wishes to make a suggestion to you as a cultural expert. Etiquette: Address the patient, not the interpreter, and maintain eye contact with the patient. Try not to \"think out loud\" or have si de conversations with the interpreter. This can cause patients to wonder about what is not being interpreted for them and can impair the rapport building process. Trained Medical Interpreter Tip Direct your empathy and response in English toward the patient. Remember to always look toward the patient when you are speaking, not toward the trained medical interpreter. The trained medical interpreter will provide the verbal translation of your words. However, the nonverbal communication can still be provided by you. The Dialogue: Talk slowly and clearly at a comfortable pace with pauses that allow for interpretation. Avoi d using jargon. Confirm understanding and comprehension, asking the interpreter to give you the patient's exact words, not paraphrases, whenever possible. If the patient uses a \u00a9 Copyright 2011 by Boston Medical Center Corporation 15DRAFTcolloquial term, ask the trained medical interprete r to clarify its meaning if possible, and the patient's intended meaning when us ing it. Make sure the interpre ter is present for the entire conversation with the patient. Debriefing: After your session with the patient, ask the trained medical interpre ter if they noticed anything pertaining to the patient, such as subtle gestures or emotions. Confidentiality and Accuracy : Do not use informal interpreters or family or friends as interpreters. Medical inte rpreting requires specialized skill and training. Further, patients have a legal right to determine whethe r they want family and friend s to know their private medical information. Even if the patient prefers having a family member or friend interpret, also have a competent medical interpreter present to correct any errors in interpre tation. Never use a child under the age of 18 to interpret. Documentation : Document the presence of the trained medical interpreter, the interpreter's name and language service agency name. 7.2 Trained Medical Interpreter Accessed by Phone and Video DE training in both use of the langu age assistance devices and working e ffectively with an interpreter are essential. If you are not experienced with using language assistance de vices, it is strongly recommended to conduct a practice session before the initial pati ent meeting. For example, when using a telephone trained medical interpreter service, find out if there is a dual handset such that both you and the patient have individual telephone handsets for use during your session. If not, a speaker phone system is needed. Practice connecting to the telephone to access the traine d medical interpreter service and make sure the phone numbers and PIN codes are operational. 7.3 What if the Patient Declines Language Assistance Occasionally, a patient with limited English proficiency will decline the assistance of an interpreter, believing that their English skills are sufficient, or request to use a frie nd or family member for interpretation. The hospital's policy should be able to provide interpre ter services to all patients whose preferred language is not English. You should: Make clear that interpreter serv ices are provided free of charge. Explain that it is the hospital's policy to provide interpreter services. Obtain hospital interpreter services even if the patient uses a friend or family member . You should honor the patient's choice of interpreters, but you also have th e right to have an interpreter of your choice. Having both interpreters presen t also helps protect th e hospital from potential liability regarding miscommunication. Hospitals have paid millions for failure to use competent interpreters. 20, 21 \u00a9 Copyright 2011 by Boston Medical Center Corporation 16DRAFT8. The Family as Caregivers after Hospital Discharge Family support is often essential to a patient's safe transi tion from hospital to home. Yet, the role of family members in the treatment of illness and me dical decision making varies considerably across cultures. It is important, therefore, that you inquire and assesses fam ily involvement in a patient's care early in the hospital course. Some ways in which th e cultural differences across families can influence hospital discharge encounters are: Giving \"Bad News \": Issues of \"truth-tel ling\" about serious diagnoses present dilemmas for patients, families and the clinical team. For example, in certain cultural contexts, family members may object to disclosure of health info rmation to the patient himself/herself In such situations, the patient's family and clinicians could disagree a bout the disclosure of a serious diagnosis to the patient; with the family fearing a decline in the patient's condi tion if informed about his/her condition. \"Consultant Healer \": The role family members commonly pl ay is as consultant healers. Some ninety percent of sickness episodes are managed exclusively within the circle of family and community lay healers.4,6 Even when hospitalized, a patient's family and spiritual or cultural healers may remain involved in treatment decisions, assessing the quality of the care, governing the patient's expression of sympto ms and shaping the patient's unde rstanding and expectations of the healthcare experience. \"First Line Responder \": Given that the family is often the \"first-line responder\" to a sickness at home, it should be expected that they will be instrumental in post-discharge medical care and decision making for a patient. You should consider family members as more than potential persona l caregivers in the home or transportation support for follow up appointments, but also as lay healers and a dvisors to the ill patient. Neglecting to assess the pr esence and influence of family members before hospital discharge could lead to untoward consequences of non-adherence to the discharge plan, dissatisfaction with the medical care received, and hospital readmission for relapse of symptoms or other similar adverse events following discharge. Disclosure of Bad News The disclosure of bad news such as a terminal diagnosis is a commonly encountered crosscultural issue in health care. The healthcare system in the United States and other Western countries places great emphasis on the autonomy of the patient. The Patient SelfDetermination Act secures this right legally for all patients in the United States, but its relevance to patients of various cultural backgrounds has often been debated. Arbiters about Following Advice : Family or other caregivers ma y be essential to the patient's willingness to follow treatment recommendations at home, including the decision about when to seek help, what treatment regimens to follow and the willingness or ability to take medicines and attend appointments. Family involvement coul d be particularly important for vulnerable populations who traditionally may have found th e healthcare system difficult to access and unreceptive to their concerns. Autonomy in Care and Decision-Making at Home : In some cultures, family members play significant roles in care and decisi on making for loved ones. The desire for autonomy can be quite different from western values. In essence, certain cultures have a more family-centered approach to decision making, as compared to cultures with a greater focus on the individual as decision \u00a9 Copyright 2011 by Boston Medical Center Corporation 17DRAFTmaker. Patient preferences must be taken in ba lance with informed consent and confidentiality standards of care. Other cultural factors that ar e relevant at the time of hospital discharge can include: o Differences in beliefs about the power of hope and the negative consequences associated with losing hope o The role of the physician and paternalism o The way social roles change with aging It's a good idea to ask the medical team if they have any concerns like these as you prepare the patient for discharge. \u00a9 Copyright 2011 by Boston Medical Center Corporation 18DRAFT9. Additional Considerations You may ask questions to assess for other culturally-influence d factors that can potentially be related to readmissions. These factors include dietary patterns, religious observances and gender preferences of care givers. 9.1 Dietary Patterns Conflicts with the dietary recommendations in the di scharge plan can lead to setbacks in the transition from the hospital to home. You can ask the patient to review the dietary recommendation materials and assess whether the patient anticipates a problem adhering to the diet. If so, you can consult with the hospita l dietician to receive more information about how to assist the patient. Cultural competency tip Make sure the diet plan is culturally relevant and includes foods that the patient is accustomed to eating at home. 9.2 Religious Observances It is not uncommon for patients to adjust medication regimens and diet ary patterns as part of religious observances. Such observances may include fasting or consuming special meals prepared for the occasion or may prohibit the use of certain treatments during periods of observance. Sometimes, these changes can jeopardize the success of the disc harge plan. Some tips include You can use the AHCP calendar to identify common religious observances a nd should also ask the patient if there are religious observances not marked on the calendar that will be observed in the month following discharge. You can then assess whether the patient's religi ous observance affects th e discharge plan. If necessary, the clinical team can be alerted to th e potential problem and the discharge plan can be adjusted. 9.3 Gender Preferences For some patients, the gender of a clinician is importa nt to the delivery of hea lthcare. Gender preference may even extend to non-clinical sta ff, such as front office support and interpreters, who are engaged in collecting private health informati on. For example, female patients of ten prefer a female gynecologist. Indeed, in certain cultures, it is unac ceptable for a male clinician to trea t a female patient. (Keep in mind that this request is based on the patient's preferen ces and values not a judg ment of the clinician's competence.) When arranging for follow up appointments, you should ask the patient if he/she has any preferences for a certain clinician or whether gender is a concern. Attending to this cultural preference for healthca re will help increase the likelihood of successful continuity of care in the ambulatory setting and reduce the risk of readmission. \u00a9 Copyright 2011 by Boston Medical Center Corporation 19DRAFT\u00a9 Copyright 2011 by Boston Medical Center Corporation 20 References 1 http://www.jointcommission.org/assets/1/6/AR oadmapforHospitals finalversion727.pdf 2 http://www.census.gov/population/www/projections/2009projections.html 3 Ember CR , Ember MR.
