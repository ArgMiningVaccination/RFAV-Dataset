What Subscribers Say About Epoch Health M Matthew K Davila This is the best source of information, the best newspaper, ever. The variety of authors gives me a better perspective of life as it is worth living, yet the quality of writing stays high. My local leftist paper, The Modesto Bee, is written with the vocabulary of a 13-year-old, The Epoch Times is not. I bought a subscription for my parents, they both love it. I considering gifting it to more. Everyone should subscribe because The Epoch Times covers subjects found almost nowhere else and details found completely nowhere else. K Katherine Anne Cardwell This journalistic publication is tremendous! I am a very satisfied member and also get the paper. It covers everything and honestly presents the facts. Other news is straight opinion and I'm completely unimpressed! I can't tell you how pleased I am to get the NEWS. Thank you Epoch Times! M Michael Grove The Epoch Times practices traditional journalism - fact-based news about issues important for us as citizens to make informed decisions. D Deborah Mackoy I was starving for independent reporting. I was sick and tired of the \"editorial\" reporting - not the facts, but the media's opinionated reporting and their interpretation or \"take\" on the facts, rather than the actual facts. I found that in THE EPOCH TIMES! I thought that \"news\" had been lost forever . . . . but then I saw The Epoch Times. Love this read, even if I hate what is going on right now in our country! A A. Price The Epoch Times reports the simple news of the day in an unbiased way. No more searching through a lot of clearly biased opinions, like the proverbial needle in a haystack, for real news reports. The Epoch Times is a huge time-saver! S Sharon Shores True investigative journalism, truth not politically-tilted fodder. FAQ What are fundamental differences between The Epoch Times and other media? - The Epoch Times is the first and only media that exposes the true nature, impact, and ultimate goal of communism. We explain its damage to our moral foundation and to Eastern and Western traditions. We also discuss the outcomes of socialism and its impact on countries' economic and political stability. We believe that media has a duty to be upright and responsible to society. - While six corporations own 90 percent of media outlets in the United States (according to Business Insider), The Epoch Times is independent of any influence from corporations, governments, or political parties. Our only goal is to bring our readers accurate information and to be responsible to the public. - The Epoch Times is nonpartisan and values-based. We believe true journalism is based on moral principles. We focus on important issues and on policies and their impact, not partisanship. We report the truth in the midst of the biased media environment. We don't follow the unethical trend of agenda-driven journalism, but instead use our principles of Truth and Tradition as our guiding light to report honestly.

The Epoch Times is driven by its mission, not by money. One of the biggest threats we face is the struggle between freedom and communism. Many Americans haven't realized or paid much attention to this struggle, but it's a battle The Epoch Times has been covering from the front lines for the past 19 years. We are happy that more and more people have begun to pay close attention to this threat. The biggest socialist/communist regime on this planet is the Chinese Communist regime, which is one of the biggest threats to the free world. We at The Epoch Times know well its true nature. Our efforts alone are not enough. We need you to be a part of this journey. By coming together, we can win this battle for our country's freedom.
