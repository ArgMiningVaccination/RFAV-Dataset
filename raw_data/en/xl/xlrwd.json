BACKGROUND GLOBAL BURDEN OF VITAMIN A DEFICIENCY Vitamin A deficiency is widespread among children i n low-income countries. It is estimated that 4 million children under 5 years of age, mostly in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, a re affected by xerophthalmia, the clinical eye manifestation of vi tamin A defi- ciency, which can lead to blindness. Far greater nu mbers of chil- dren (estimated 127 million) show no external signs of vitamin A deficiency, but have dangerously low stores, which lead to in- creased risk of infection and death, making vitamin A deficiency a major contributor to child mortality (1). VITAMIN A SUPPLEMENTATION AGAINST CHILD MORTALITY Vitamin A supplementation is considered among the m ost impor- tant tools to reduce child mortality in low-income countries. Recently a series of papers on maternal and child u nder nutrition were published in The Lancet. It was concluded that \"Of available interventions, counselling about breastfeeding and fortification or supplementation with vitamin A and zinc have the gr eatest po- tential to reduce the burden of child morbidity and mortality\" (2). The Copenhagen Consensus 2008 aimed to set prioriti es among a series of proposals to confront great global challe nges. Vitamin A and zinc supplements for children were ranked the t op priority (3).Combining Vitamin A and Vaccines: Convenience or Co nflict? Christine Stabell Benn DANISH MEDICAL BULLETIN 2 THE CURRENT VITAMIN A SUPPLEMENTATION POLICY For the last two and a half decades the World Healt h Organization (WHO) has recommended that children between 6 month s and 5 years of age receive an oral high-dose vitamin A su pplement every 4-6 months in areas of vitamin A deficiency ( 4-5). Currently, 103 countries are considered priority countries for vitamin A supplementation (1). To increase vitamin A suppleme ntation coverage, WHO recommends integration of vitamin A s upplemen- tation with the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) (4- 8). Two main strategies to reach children are pursu ed. First , it is recommended to provide vitamin A supplementation at routine vaccination contacts. A typical vaccination schedul e in low- income countries is shown in Figure 1 . Figure 1. Routine vaccination schedule in many low- income countries BCG* DTP/OPV* Measle s vaccine DTP/OPV booster OPV Birth 6 9 Calmette Gu\u00e9rin; DTP=diphtheria-tetanu s-pertussis vaccine, increas- ingly given in combination with vaccines against H. influenzae and Hepatitis B as \"pentavalent vaccine\"; OPV=oral polio vaccine. Vitamin A can be provided together with measles vac cine, delay- ed primary vaccination doses or booster doses. Second , vitamin A can be provided at national immunization days or ca mpaigns together with vaccines and other health interventio ns. The two strategies can be combined as long as the coverage through rou- tine vaccination contacts does not exceed 80% (8). During the last decade the coverage of vitamin A supplementation ha s increased dramatically ( Figure 2 ). Every year, roughly 200 million children in the 103 priority countries receive one or more vita min A supple- ments, almost always in combination with other heal th services such as vaccines (1, 9). Figure 2. Progress with vitamin A supplementation f or children aged 6-59 months Source : UNICEF Global Database, 2008. JUSTIFICATION FOR THE CURRENT POLICY The WHO vitamin A supplementation policy picked up steam after a number of randomised community-based trials in th e late eight- ies and early nineties (10-18) had shown that high- dose vitamin A supplementation to children between 6 months and 5 years of age reduced overall mortality. Several meta-analyse s estimated that vitamin A supplementation could decrease morta lity by an impressing 23-30 % (19-21). The effect of vitamin A supplementation is ascribed to the pre- vention and treatment of vitamin A deficiency. Supp lementation is considered safe; as stated in the WHO guidelines \"When vita- min A is administered in recommended doses, there a re no serious or permanent adverse effects, such side-effects as may occa- sionally occur (e.g. for infants, a tense or bulgin g fontanelle or vomiting) are minor and transitory and do not requi re specific treatment. As adequate vitamin A status is achieved through other means, supplementation becomes less necessary , although its continuation is not harmful\" (5). None of the original trials had linked vitamin A su pplements with vaccinations or studied the effect of vitamin A sup plementation according to vaccination status. When they were con ducted, the implementation of the EPI was still in its youth, a nd vaccination coverage was low. Hence, the current WHO policy of providing vitamin A supplements with vaccines has never been tested in randomised trials. In other words, though the world increasingly demands evidence-based medicine, one of the major p olicies to reduce child mortality has never been evaluated for its overall effect on child mortality. INCONSISTENT FINDINGS In fact, two of the eight original vitamin A trials did not find a be- neficial effect of vitamin A supplementation (12, 1 5). Importantly, several recent trials have shown that the effect of vitamin A may not always be beneficial. A large trial of 1 millio n Indian children showed no effect on mortality of vitamin A suppleme nts of chil- dren aged 1 to 6 years. This trial was presented at a conference in 2007, but has not yet been published (22). Furtherm ore, all trials which have tested the effect of providing vitamin A to children between 1 and 5 months of age have failed to show a beneficial effect (14, 23-29), and though such a policy at one stage had many advocates (30-32), it has now been abandoned. Lately, several trials providing vitamin A to neonates, hav e showed wor- rying tendencies for negative effects, as will be d iscussed later. TWO MAIN HYPOTHESES In this thesis, I will argue that vitamin A supplem ents and vaccines interact, and such interactions may explain diverge nt effects of vitamin A supplementation on child mortality. I wil l also argue that vitamin A supplements may have sex-differentia l effects. If these observations are taken into account, the WHO vitamin A supplementation policy can be optimised, resulting in decreased child mortality without additional costs. The main hypotheses are: Vitamin A supplementation and routine vaccinations interact with consequences for child mortality (The Vitamin A-vaccine- interaction hypothesis) (IV) The effect of vitamin A supplementation differs bet ween the two sexes (XI) 2. THE RESEARCH PROCESS AN IDEA In 1992, as a medical student, I decided to do rese arch with the aim of reducing the high child mortality in low-inc ome countries. I would attack the major problems of infectious disea ses and mal- nutrition. I searched Medline for abstracts on infe ctious diseases, vaccines, and nutrition interventions, and became i nterested in DANISH MEDICAL BULLETIN 3 vitamin A supplementation - several recent trials r eported that prophylactic vitamin A supplementation reduced all cause mortal- ity substantially. A recent paper reported a benefi cial effect of vitamin A in the treatment of measles cases in New York. The abstract ended \"Additional studies of vitamin A in measles and other infectious diseases, and in vaccine efficacy trials, should be done\" (33). I searched for papers on the effect of vitamin A sup- plementation on the immune response to measles vacc ine and found no such papers. However, in the process I dis covered that it was already WHO policy to provide vitamin A supplem entation with measles vaccine in low-income countries (4-5). This policy had been instituted by the WHO for logistic reasons . Nobody had studied whether providing vitamin A at the same tim e as measles vaccine would influence the formation of measles sp ecific anti- bodies. I had identified my research topic. A RESEARCH YEAR I approached Peter Aaby at the Bandim Health Projec t in Guinea- Bissau with the idea to study the impact of vitamin A supple- mentation given with measles vaccine on measles-spe cific anti- body titres. I initiated my research year in Guinea -Bissau in 1993. The results were published in 1995 (I, 34), 1997 (I I), and 2000 (35). The main findings were that vitamin A supplem entation given with measles vaccine at 9 months of age was a ssociated with increased antibody titres at 18 months of age. Intriguingly, this was only seen in boys (II). TH1/TH2, AND A FOR ATOPIC? In 2000 I went back to Guinea-Bissau to do a follow -up study of the previous trial participants. Atopic patients ha d been found to have a T-helper (Th)-2-deviated immune system (36). I speculated that since vitamin A deficiency had been associated with Th1 deviation of the immune system (37), vitamin A defi ciency might be part of the explanation why low-income countries have less atopic diseases. Hence, vitamin A supplementation i n childhood - though associated with lower overall mortality and increased antibody titres - could have the side effect that m ore children became atopic. We found no large effect of vitamin A in infancy on the risk of being skin prick test-positive 6-7 y ears later (38). Importantly, the children who had received vitamin A with mea- sles vaccine at 9 months of age still had higher an tibody levels and were more protected against measles (III). A HYPOTHESIS: VITAMIN A-VACCINE INTERACTIONS In 2000 several different lines of thoughts converg ed into a hy- pothesis. First , my interest in the Th1/Th2 balance of the immune system and the impact of vitamin A on this balance. Second, Peter Aaby's research on vaccines, which showed that vacc ines, apart from protecting against the targeted disease, also had important so-called \"non-specific effects\" on overall mortali ty. The live measles vaccine given after 6-9 months of age and t he live BCG vaccine given at birth reduced mortality from other causes than merely measles and tuberculosis - i.e. had benefici al non-specific effects on overall mortality (39-44). In contrast, the inactivated diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine given be tween 1 and 5 months of age was associated with increased child m ortality in areas with herd immunity to pertussis (39-40, 45-46 ). Third, im- munological studies with deviation (47-51) and inactivated vaccines with Th2 deviation (49- 54). Fourth, the surprising fact that though vitami n A supplemen- tation was beneficial after 6 months of age (19-21) and at birth (55-56), it had no effect between 1 and 5 months of age (14, 23-29), even though many children in the age groups we re vitamin A- deficient (25, 26). One evening it converged into a hypothesis: that vitamin A supplementation amplified the non-sp ecific effects of routine vaccines, being beneficial when provided with BCG and measles vaccine, but potentially harmful when given with DTP vaccine, perhaps due to excessive Th2 deviation. Ac cording to conventional understanding, the effect on mortality of vitamin A supplementation was due to prevention and treatment of vitamin A deficiency, the Prevention-of-deficiency hypothesis. However, that interpretation was challenged by a number of f indings, which did not fit, for instance the mortality-age pattern (IV). My hy- pothesis, the Vitamin A-vaccine-interaction hypothesis, seemed to fit the existing data on vitamin A supplementati on better than the Prevention-of-deficiency hypothesis. The hypothesis was published in 2003 (IV). TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS Since I formulated the hypothesis my work has focus ed on testing the hypothesis, continuously comparing the consiste ncy of exist- ing and evolving data with my hypothesis and the Prevention-of- deficiency hypothesis. This has led to three trials and one o bser- vational study in Guinea-Bissau plus a reanalysis o f an existing data-set from Ghana. The vitamin A studies have res ulted in a number of papers (I-XI, 34-35, 57-69), of which the most impor- tant constitute the basis for the present thesis (I -XI). A NEW HYPOTHESIS: VITAMIN A HAS SEX-DIFFERENTIAL EF FECTS Our first vitamin A trials had one thing in common - sex-differ- ential effects of vitamin A supplementation (II, V) . Tendencies for sex differences in response to vitamin A supplement ation had also been observed in the two first trials of neona tal vitamin A supplementation (55-56), and I put forward the hypo thesis that the effect of neonatal vitamin A supplementation is sex- differential (XI). This observation might be linked to the hy- pothesis of vitamin A and vaccine interactions. Whi le the above trials were undertaken it had become more and more clear that the negative non-specific effect of DTP vaccine was strongest in girls (70-75). Hence, vitamin A amplification of a negative non- specific effect of DTP vaccine could be the real ex planation for the sex-differential effects of neonatal vitamin A supp lements. How- ever, there may also be other explanations for the sex differences - such as underlying differences in vitamin A statu s or underlying immunological differences between boys and girls - which de- termine two independent events in girls: a negative interaction with DTP vaccine and a less positive or even negati ve response to vitamin A supplementation. Hence, so far I see the two hypothe- ses as independent. In conclusion, the initial idea to study the effect of vitamin A supplementation on the specific immune response to measles vaccine led to the formulation of two new hypothese s. In the following three Chapters 3-5, I will summari se existing evi- dence regarding the specific vitamin A-vaccine interactions on the immune response to routine vaccines, the non-specific vitamin A- vaccine interactions influencing mortality, and the sex-differential effects of vitamin A supplementation . In Chapter 6, I will briefly review the potential immunological mechanisms behin d the specific and non-specific vitamin A-vaccine interac tions and the sex-differences. Chapters 7 and 8 are devoted to co nclusions, and discussion of further research questions as well as the implica- tions for public health. DANISH MEDICAL BULLETIN 4 3. VITAMIN A AND THE IMMUNE RESPONSE TO VACCINES The policy of providing high-dose vitamin A supplem ents together with routine vaccinations was introduced for logist ical reasons. However, it is plausible that vitamin A could affec t the immune response to vaccines; vitamin A deficiency has been associated with compromised immune function and vitamin A has been shown to affect almost all functions of the immune system (76- 77). Vitamin A has been suggested as a useful adjuv ant to vac- cines (78-79) and animal studies have provided evid ence for a negative effect of vitamin A deficiency on antibody responses to different vaccines, and for an antibody-enhancing e ffect of vita- min A supplements in both deficient and normal anim als (80). When we initiated our study of the effect of vitami n A supple- mentation on the immune response to measles vaccine in 1993, only a few studies had addressed the effect of vita min A on the immune response to routine vaccines in childhood (8 1-83). Since then, several trials have been carried out, mostly on measles vaccine, but the immune response to other routine v accines such as DTP and oral polio vaccine has also been studied . The studies, which have tested the effect of high-dose oral vita min A supple- mentation on the immune response to routine vaccine s, are presented in Table 1 (I-III, 27, 62, 83-95). Below, I summarise the evidence for an effect of vitamin A supplementation on the im- mune response to each of the vaccines. MEASLES VACCINE When we set out to do our study we had the a priori hypothesis that vitamin A would increase the antibody response to measles vaccine, because we believed it would strengthen th e immune system and its capacity to respond adequately. Howe ver, another scenario could be that vitamin A made the immune sy stem clear the virus more rapidly, perhaps too rapidly to esta blish an ade- quate immune response. This fear was strengthened w hen an Indonesian trial providing vitamin A or placebo wit h measles vaccine at 6 months of age was published, showing s ignificantly reduced seroconversion after vitamin A (84). To date a total of six studies have been conducted (I-III, 84-88). Our own study produced several observations for vit amin A given with measles vaccine at 6 and 9 months of age (I, I I), and was the only one which presented data on long-term effects (III). Measles vaccine at age 6 months. Among children, who received vitamin A with measles vaccine at age 6 months , the study from Indonesia reported a negative effect of vitamin A o n seroconver- sion to measles vaccine (84). The results were not presented by sex, but based on the estimates for vitamin A and f or sex, the group which had the lowest seroconversion was girls who re- ceived vitamin A (84). In our study, we found no ne gative effect of vitamin A supplementation at age 6 months on antibody titres and seroconversion at age 9 months (I). Furthermore , we found no negative effect of vitamin A given with measles vaccine at 6 and 9 months of age on antibody titres and seroconversion at age 18 months (II). Boys tended to benefit more from vi tamin A than girls, but the study population was small and none of the effect estimates reached statistical significance. Measles vaccine at age 9 months. Among children who received vitamin A with measles vaccine at age 9 months , two studies reported significant beneficial overall effects on the antibody response (II, 85) and one study reported significan t beneficial effect in malnourished children (87). One study fou nd no effect (88), whereas one found no overall effect, but a ne gative effect in the 14% of the children who had preimmunisation tit res (86). Our study has been the only one to date to study lo ng-term ef- fects of vitamin A on antibody titres. We found tha t vitamin A provided with measles vaccine at age 9 months was a ssociated with significantly higher probability of having pro tective antibody levels against measles at 6-8 years of age. In the placebo group, 7/79 (9%) had non-protective antibody levels agains t measles compared 0/73 (0%) in the vitamin A group (p=0 .0095) (III). In our study the beneficial effect on antibody titr es at 18 months of age was significantly stronger in boys than in g irls. Another study reported data for boys only; there was a tend ency for a better response to vitamin A after 1 month but an o pposite ten- dency after 6 months (88). The other studies have u nfortunately not reported data by sex. Our interpretation of the existing data on vitamin A and measles vaccine is as follows: vitamin A supplementation ma y impair sero- conversion at age 6 months and at least does not se em to be beneficial. In contrast, vitamin A given with measl es vaccine at age 9 months may improve the antibody response to m easles vaccine, perhaps most pronounced in boys, non-breas tfed and/ or malnourished children. One interesting observation, also noted by Savy (96), is that all studies, which found a po sitive effect of vitamin A supplementation, had used Haemagglutinati on Inhi- bition (HI) assays or ELISA assays to assess antibo dy titres, whereas the studies which found no effect all had u sed Plaque Reduction Neutralization (PRN) assays. DIPHTHERIA-TETANUS-PERTUSSIS VACCINE The five studies testing the effect of vitamin A su pplementation on the immune response to DTP vaccine or DTP compon ents have been of quite different design. Two were 2-by-2 fac torial trials with vitamin E (91) and maternal supplementation (2 7), respec- tively. One supplemented older children 14 days bef ore vaccina- tion (83). The outcomes and the time of assessment also differed. Hence, it is difficult to reach any overall conclus ion. Three of the studies suggested that vitamin A may increase the i mmune re- sponse (83, 89-90), none show the opposite. None of the studies reported data by sex. ORAL POLIO VACCINE Four studies on oral polio vaccine have been conduc ted (27, 92- 94). One found a beneficial effect of vitamin A sup plementation on antibody titres to poliovirus type 1 (94). The o thers found no effect. It is noteworthy that the study, which did find an effect, was the study with the lowest seroconversion rate. In situations with very high seroconversion rates, the response m ay be difficult to improve further. None of the studies reported da ta by sex. PENTAVALENT VACCINE Only one study linking vitamin A supplementation wi th the new pentavalent vaccines has been carried out (95). It found no over- all effect of vitamin A on the antibody response to H. Influenzae type b vaccine, but vitamin A significantly improve d the antibody response to hepatitis B vaccine. The authors did no t present the data by sex, but according to the PhD thesis based on the trial the beneficial effect was only significant in boys (97) . DANISH MEDICAL BULLETIN 5 Table 1.

GMT=Geometric DANISH MEDICAL BULLETIN 6 BCG VACCINE We are the only ones to date who have studied the e ffect of vi- tamin A supplementation on the immune response to B CG vac- cine. We examined the effect of simultaneous vitami n A sup- plementation and BCG vaccine on the in vivo delayed type hy- persensitivity response to purified protein derivat ive of Myco- bacterium tuberculosis (PPD). In the placebo group, more boys than girls mounted a positive PPD response at 2 mon ths of age, as also previously observed. However, vitamin A sup plementa- tion at birth significantly diminished the proporti on of boys, who had a positive PPD reaction at 2 months of age. In contrast, vitamin A was associated with significantly increas ed in vitro IFN- production to PPD stimulation in both sexes at 6 weeks of age. Vitamin A supplementation was not associated with e ither PPD response or BCG scarification at 6 months of age (6 2). DISCUSSION Overall, 14 different studies investigated the effe ct of high-dose oral vitamin A supplementation on the antibody response to one or more vaccines. One found a significantly negativ e effect (on the antibody response to measles vaccine at age 6 m onths (84)), six found a significantly positive effect (II, 83, 85, 90, 94-95), whereas seven found no overall effect (27, 86-88, 9 1-93). Most of the \"no-effect\" studies were small, and the conf idence inter- vals allow for rather large effects. One exception is the Ghana trial, which investigated the response to DTP and o ral polio vaccine in more than 1000 individuals, and found no effect (27). Only two studies had cell-mediated immunity as an outcome (62, 89), one found a beneficial effect of vitamin A on delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses to pertussis and t etanus in chil- dren with adequate vitamin A levels (89), the other , our own, found a temporarily negative effect of vitamin A on the DTH re- sponse to PPD at age 2 months in boys. Paradoxicall y, vitamin A seemed to increase the IFN- response to PPD in vitro (62). When assessing the overall evidence for an effect o f vitamin A supplementation on the immune response to routine v accina- tions in childhood, publication bias has to be cons idered, both in terms of overall effects and in terms of potential sex-differential effects. Publication bias resulting in less publica tion of \"no-ef- fect\" trials does not seem plausible. In situations in which vita- min A is recommended given with vaccines, it is imp ortant to make sure that there is no negative effects of comb ining the two interventions. The possibility that vitamin A could enhance pro- tection is of secondary interest. Hence, especially after the first study reporting a negative effect of vitamin A with measles vac- cine at age 6 months, it has been important to repo rt \"no- negative-effect\". It may be that some studies did n ot report non- significant results of sex-stratified analyses, tho ugh it would seem natural in response to our observation of sex- differential effects of vitamin A on the antibody response to me asles vac- cine. However, surprisingly few outside our group s eriously con- sider that preadolescent boys and girls may differ immunologi- cally, and the lack of sex-stratified results is li kely due to the fact that stratification by sex has not been considered. Hence, the current evidence suggests that vitamin A supplemen- tation may enhance humoral responses to measles vac cine and potentially also other vaccines. There are weak ind ications that this could be most pronounced in settings with low seroconver- sion rates and thereby room for improvement, and in boys, in non-breastfed children, as well as in malnourished children. It should be considered whether assay type influenc es the as- sessment of vitamin A effects on antibody responses . Vitamin A may also affect cell-mediated responses, but more studies are needed. Our study suggested that it may temporarily dampen cell-mediated immune responses in boys. The conse- quences of a temporarily dampened cellular immune r esponse to PPD for tuberculosis immunity are unknown, and s hould be more thoroughly investigated before vitamin A was r ecom- mended given with BCG vaccine. The potential biological mechanisms are discussed i n Chapter 6. Weaknesses include that very few studies assessed v itamin A status, and many of the studies, including our own, were con- ducted in areas with potentially limited vitamin A deficiency. We found the best effect in non-breastfed children who were pre- sumably most vitamin A-deficient (II). Another stud y found the best effect in malnourished children (87). Since nu merous ani- mal studies have confirmed a beneficial role of vit amin A on antibody production (80, 98), the more inconsistent results in human studies could be due to lack of vitamin A def iciency. It would be recommendable if future studies included a n assess- ment of vitamin A status, and were powered to detec t more subtle effects, of course to the extent that the ef fects should still be of clinical relevance. If vitamin A supplementation can enhance the antibo dy re- sponse to measles vaccine and prolong the period du ring which children are protected against measles, as we found (II, III), it would be of public health importance. The observation that vitamin A provided together wi th vaccines may amplify the specific antibody response to the v accines adds plausibility to the hypothesis that vitamin A could also amplify the non-specific effects of vaccines. The non-speci fic vitamin A- vaccine interactions are discussed in the following chapter. 4. VITAMIN A-VACCINE INTERACTIONS AND MORTALITY It is currently assumed that vitamin A exerts its e ffect on overall mortality by preventing and treating vitamin A defi ciency, which would otherwise lead to increased risk of infection s and mortal- ity - the Prevention-of-deficiency hypothesis. We have question- ed that assumption and proposed the hypothesis that vitamin A is also an immuno-modulator, and its effects on mor bidity and mortality are dependent on the state of the immune system. In particular, we have proposed that the effect may de pend on the type of vaccine(s) given around the time of supplem entation - the Vitamin A-vaccine-interaction hypothesis (IV). A key difference between the two hypotheses is whet her vita- min A has only beneficial specific effects related to prevention of vitamin A deficiency and its consequences, or wheth er it may also have non-specific effects on the immune system , which may be beneficial, but also potentially harmful. According to the Prevention-of-deficiency hypothesis, vitamin A supplementation would always be beneficial if a chi ld was vita- min A-deficient, or have no effects if a child was vitamin A re- plete - except for acute toxic adverse events such as bulging fontanelles or vomiting as a consequence of transie nt intracrani- al pressure. This is considered to be without signi ficant conse- quence, as the symptoms usually resolve quickly, an d there DANISH MEDICAL BULLETIN 7 seems to be no long-term developmental consequences (5, 30, 99-100). According to the Vitamin A-vaccine-interaction hypoth- esis, the effect of vitamin A supplementation would depend on what was going on in the immune system; it could be beneficial but also potentially harmful. A deficient child wou ld of course benefit from having the deficiency treated - but it could also gain additional survival benefit, if vitamin A was provided under favourable conditions - or the benefit from treatin g the defici- ency could be counterbalanced by negative non-speci fic effects due to amplification of inappropriate activities in the immune system. The hypothesis of vitamin A-vaccine interactions wa s founded on contradictions within the Prevention-of-deficiency hypothesis (IV). The most important contradictions were first , that there apparently was no association between the effect of vitamin A supplementation on one hand and the baseline mortal ity and the degree of underlying vitamin A deficiency on th e other hand. In other words the best effect was not seen in area s with the highest mortality and the highest prevalence of vit amin A defi- ciency (19). Second, there was a peculiar mortality-age pattern; there was a beneficial effect of vitamin A on morta lity when vitamin A was given at birth or after 6 months of a ge, but not between 1 and 5 months of age in spite of vitamin A deficiency in this age group (IV). Since the formulation of th e hypothesis more trials have been published. We have published two trials of vitamin A at birth showing no overall effect (VI I, IX). Two other trials of vitamin A supplementation at birth found no ef- fect in Zimbabwe (101-102) and a significant benefi cial effect in Bangladesh (103). Several smaller trials designed t o study other outcomes than mortality have reported mortality dat a pointing towards a negative effect of vitamin A given with D TP/penta- valent vaccine (27, 29). One large, yet unpublished , trial of vita- min A supplementation to more than 1 million childr en above 6 months of age in India found no effect (22). Hence, the mortal- ity-age pattern is not as clear as when we formulat ed the hy- pothesis (IV). An overview of the existing trials p resenting mor- tality data is presented in Figure 3 , stratified by age group. Apart from the lack of an association between vitam in A supple- mentation effects and vitamin A deficiency, and the strange mortality-age pattern, the hypothesis was based on several ad- ditional contradictions, which have been summarised in the hypothesis paper (IV). We have conducted studies with the specific aim to explore vita- min A-vaccine interactions in terms of mortality an d continuous- ly compare the evidence for our hypothesis against the evidence for the Prevention-of-deficiency hypothesis. Since it would be unethical to randomise children to most vaccines, a nd to ran- domise children above 6 months of age to vitamin A supplemen- tation, we have had to be pragmatic when designing the trials. Hence, our studies have taken many different forms. A SMALLER DOSE MAY BE EVEN BETTER THAN A HIGH DOSE One of the observations, which were contradictory a ccording to the Prevention-of-deficiency hypothesis, was made in a WHO multicenter trial published in 1998 (26). Almost 10 ,000 children were randomised to 25,000 IU vitamin A or placebo w ith the three DTP vaccines. At 9 months of age, at the time of measles vaccine, the children, who had received vitamin A r eceived another 25,000 IU vitamin A, whereas those, who had received placebo, received 100,000 IU vitamin A. According t o the mortal- ity curves in the paper, mortality was slightly hig her among vita- min A compared with placebo recipients during the f irst 6 months of life ( Figure 4 ). However, the curves subsequently crossed, and based on the flow chart in the paper w e calculated that from 9 months of age to the end of follow-up a t 12 months of age, mortality was significantly higher in the g roup that had received 100,000 IU than in the group that had rece ived 25,000 IU with measles vaccine (Paper IV, Table 2 ). If vitamin A supple- mentation worked only by preventing vitamin A defic iency, it was an implausible finding that less should be bett er than more. We reasoned that if vitamin A supplementation inter acted with vaccines and their non-specific effects, a smaller dose of vitamin A might be even better than a large dose. Hence, wh en a nation- al campaign providing oral polio vaccine and vitami n A supple- mentation to children aged 6 months-5 years was due in Guinea- Bissau in November 2002, we obtained ethical permis sion to randomise children to the WHO-recommended dose of v itamin A or half that dose. We hypothesised that the small er dose would be even more beneficial than the recommended dose. We did not formulate any sex-specific hypotheses. A s hypothe- sised, we found a tendency for a better effect of a smaller dose (V). This was due to a significantly beneficial eff ect in girls. Over- all mortality was lower among trial participants th an among non-participants, and there was no indication that the high dose of vitamin A was associated with increased mortalit y - a smaller dose just seemed even more beneficial in girls (V). Numbers were small in the subgroup analyses, but the benefi cial effect of the low dose tended to be most apparent in girls wh o had a DTP vaccine as their last vaccine prior to the campaign . If girls had received DTP, the mortality rate ratio for the high dose versus the low dose was 9.9 (1.3-78), whereas it was 3.1 ( 0.6-15.5) if this was not the case (unpublished data). The findi ng corrobo- rated the finding from the WHO multicenter trial (w hich did not present data by sex) - and hence both studies were incompati- ble with the Prevention-of-deficiency hypothesis. Discussion One of the first vitamin A trials to be conducted u sed a small weekly dose instead of the high dose, and that stud y found the most beneficial effect on mortality of all the tria ls conducted at that time, the relative risk being 0.46 (0.30-0.71) ; 0.41 for girls (p<0.01) and 0.52 for boys (p<0.05) (17). To our kn owledge, no other trials than the two above have compared the m ortality effect of two different doses of vitamin A in commu nity studies. A few smaller studies with morbidity and growth as the primary outcome have generally supported that a smaller dos e was more beneficial than a large dose (108-112). Only o ne study showed the opposite tendency, and in that study the high-dose supplement degraded and subsequent analyses showed that the actual dosing was lower in the high-dose than in th e low-dose supplements (113). Hence, the evidence so far sugge sts that a lower dose is more beneficial in terms of mortality and also mor- bidity than a high dose. Our study suggests that th is is most pro- nounced in girls; the other studies did not report data by sex. The results support that vitamin A supplementation exerts its ef- fects on mortality by other mechanisms than merely prevention and treatment of vitamin A deficiency.

WHO multicentre study curves for vitamin A and controls. Vitamin A recipients received three times 25,000 IU vitamin A with each of the three D TP vaccines, and 25,000 IU vitamin A with measles vaccine. Controls received 100,000 IU vitamin A with measles vaccine 10 VITAMIN A SUPPLEMENTATION WITH MISSING VACCINES Guinea-Bissau has frequent national immunization da ys. In 2003, vitamin A was provided together with missing vaccines to all children above 6 months of age, who came to the health posts. We registered all participating children alo ng with their treatment. This provided an opportunity to test the hypothesis that vitamin A supplementation would be beneficial when given with the live measles vaccine compared with when gi ven with inactivated DTP vaccine. This proved the case (VI). The effect of vitamin A supplementation differed significantly de pending on the type of vaccine with which it was given. Furthe rmore, receiv- ing vitamin A with DTP compared with only vitamin A was asso- ciated with significantly increased mortality. Also , the mortality among children, who received vitamin A with DTP, wa s higher than among non-participants, though non-participant s in such campaigns normally have higher mortality than parti cipants (VI). Discussion Numbers were admittedly small and it was an observa tional stu- dy. In particular we cannot exclude that children w ho were mis- sing DTP vaccines had a higher risk of dying a priori compared with children, who were missing measles vaccine, or who did not miss any vaccines. However, control for a number of background factors did not change the conclusions. The results provided support for our main hypothesis. Combining vitamin A with measles vaccine seemed more beneficial than combini ng vita- min A with DTP. In this study there was no sex-diff erences, the combination of vitamin A and DTP seemed equally bad for boys and girls. No other group has studied this hypothes is. VITAMIN A SUPPLEMENTATION WITH BCG AT BIRTH We conducted two trials of neonatal vitamin A suppl ementation in Guinea-Bissau. The trials were based on the fact that the two first trials designed to test the effect of neonata l vitamin A sup- plementation on mortality, both conducted in Asia, had found significantly beneficial effects on mortality (55, 56). The Indone- sian study reported 64% reduction in mortality (55) , the Indian study 22% reduction (56). In both trials the effect of vitamin A supplementation was only seen during the first 3-4 months. None of the trials provided information on whether vitamin A was given with vaccines. Intriguingly, the Indonesi an trial found the most beneficial effect in normal-birth-weight i nfants (> 2500 g) whereas the opposite was the case in India. The data did not make sense from the Prevention-of-deficiency hypothesis per- spective, since low-birth-weight infants are more v itamin A-defi- cient (114). However, according to our hypothesis v plementation fects of BCG vaccine (IV). While the Indonesian tri al was carried out, it was policy to postpone BCG vaccination in l ow-birth- weight infants - a policy which is implemented in m any low- income countries (IV). In India, there was no speci al policy for low-birth-weight infants (IV). Hence, the data fitt ed well with our hypothesis; the most beneficial effect was seen among nor- mal-birth-weight Indonesian children, who presumabl y received vitamin A supplementation with BCG vaccine (IV). Based on this information, we initiated two neonata l vitamin A trials; a trial in normal-birth-weight infants who came for their BCG vaccine after the delivery, and a 2-by-2 factor ial trial with vitamin A supplementation and early BCG vaccination to low- birth-weight neonates who would normally not receiv e BCG at birth. All children were randomised to vitamin A (5 0,000 IU to normal-birth-weight infants and 25,000 IU to low-bi rth-weight infants) or placebo, and were followed to 12 months of age. Our main hypothesis was that vitamin A supplementation would re- duce overall mortality within the first year of lif e by 25-30%. When we wrote the protocols, we did not formulate a ny hypo- theses regarding sex-differential effects. However, during the conduct of the trials we became increasingly aware that vitamin A supplementation may have sex-differential effects . The previ- ous two trials had both observed tendencies for a b etter effect of neonatal vitamin A in boys (55, 56). Furthermore , we had ob- served that boys responded better to vitamin A in t erms of mea- sles-specific antibody titres (II) and we subsequen tly found that girls had lower mortality after receiving a low tha n a high dose (V). Hence, before the trials ended we had formulat ed another hypothesis - that the effect of neonatal vitamin A supplementa- tion would be particularly beneficial for boys (XI) . Overall mortality Unexpectedly, we found no effect of neonatal vitami n A sup- plementation on overall mortality. However, both tr ials showed remarkably similar results when stratified by sex; boys tended to have a beneficial effect of vitamin A throughout th e first year of life, whereas girls had a negative effect, particul arly after the first months of life (VII, IX). In a combined analy sis of the two trials, the interaction between vitamin A and sex w as statistically significant, as was the negative effect of vitamin A in girls (IX). We speculated that vitamin A given with BCG at birt h had inter- acted negatively with subsequent DTP vaccine in gir ls. A post hoc analysis of the normal-birth-weight trial revealed that, indeed, there was a tendency for a beneficial effect of neo natal vitamin A supplementation as long as BCG vaccine was the la st vaccine to be received, but once DTP vaccine was received t here was a significantly negative effect of having received ne onatal vitamin A supplementation in girls (VI). Though much less p ronounced, the same tendency was seen in the low-birth-weight trial. In a combined analysis of the two trials, vitamin A was associated with 75 % (9-183%) increased mortality, when DTP wa s the most recent vaccine ( Table 2 ). Table 2. The effect of neonatal vitamin A supplemen tation in children who had DTP as their most recent vaccine Overall Boys Girls P for interac- tion vitamin A and (0.88-1.79) 0.80 (0.46-1.39) 1.75 (1.09-2.83) 0.04 It should be noted that the low-birth-weight trial was a 2-by-2 factorial trial with vitamin A and early BCG vaccin e. For funding reasons, the trial was not sized to look for statis tical interactions between the two treatments, but only to look at vit amin A ef- fects in the combined population. We found no evide nce of interaction between BCG and vitamin A, and hence th e two groups were combined (IX). This lack of interaction did not sup port our hypothesis that the combination of vitamin A and the live BCG vaccine would be particularly beneficial. This could per- haps be partly due to the fact that many of the chi ldren random- ised to no early BCG received BCG within the next w eeks at the health centres. 11 With regard to causes of death, the negative effect of vitamin A supplementation in girls was seen for all causes of death, but may have been particularly evident for diarrhoea am ong nor- mal-birth-weight girls (VII) whereas it was most pr ominent for fever, septicaemia, and malaria, as well as malnutr ition among low-birth-weight girls (IX). Morbidity Within the normal-birth-weight trial, we conducted a subgroup study of the effect on rotavirus infection and diar rhoea of vi- tamin A supplementation with BCG at birth. Receivin g vitamin A at birth was associated with increased risk of rota virus infection and rotavirus diarrhoea below 6 months of age in bo th sexes, (68). At the same time vitamin A at birth was assoc iated with decreased risk of non-rotavirus diarrhoea in boys b elow 6 months of age, but an increased risk in girls 6 mon ths or older (68). Unexpectedly we also experienced a measles ep idemic, which provided an opportunity to study the effect o n measles incidence. Significant sex-differential effects, wi th a tendency for a negative effect of vitamin A in girls, were also seen for measles infection (115). The two findings could not be expl ained by a chance allocation of a group of \"weak\" girls and/or \"strong\" boys to vitamin A supplementation, since they were independ- ent of each other. Hence, the morbidity findings su pported the existence of sex-differential effects of vitamin A supplementa- tion at birth. Furthermore, the diarrhoea subgroup study was conducted in 1-8 months children who almost exclusi vely had DTP vaccine as their last vaccine during the study period (68), and the negative effect of vitamin A supplementatio n on mea- sles infection in girls was seen among girls who ha d received DTP vaccine (unpublished data). Hence, the findings were com- patible with the hypothesis that the negative effec t in girls could be due to negative interaction between vitamin A su pplementa- tion and subsequent DTP vaccine in girls. Vitamin A status As a part of the normal-birth-weight trial, we also studied the effect of vitamin A supplementation on vitamin A st atus at 6 weeks of age and 4 months of age. Overall, vitamin A status im- proved during this period. However, there was a sig nificant in- verse relationship between increase in vitamin A st atus and number of DTP vaccines received in girls, which was particularly evident among vitamin A recipients (61). The findin g supported the possibility of a negative interaction between v itamin A sup- plementation and subsequent DTP vaccinations in gir ls. Discussion While we conducted our trials, two other trials of neonatal vita- min A supplementation had been initiated. One of th e trials was conducted in Zimbabwe as a two-by-two factorial tri al, random- ising mothers and their newborn infants to vitamin A or placebo. Children were followed to 12 months of life. The tr ial was re- ported separately for HIV-negative (101) and HIV-ne gative mothers (102). Among HIV-negative mothers there was no over- all effect of neonatal vitamin A supplementation on mortality, but the survival curves indicated that the placebo- placebo group had higher mortality in the first months of life, b ut later the mortality was higher among vitamin A recipients (10 1, Figure 5 ). Unfortunately data were not reported by sex, and ou r request for this information has not been met yet (XI). Amo ng HIV-posi- tive mothers, neonatal vitamin A supplementation ha d divergent effects depending on whether the child did or did n ot become HIV-positive. Among the large majority of children, who remain-ed HIV-negative at 6 weeks of age, vitamin A supple mentation was associated with significantly negative effects on mortality (102). The other trial was conducted in Bangladesh (103). It showed that neonatal vitamin A supplementation was associ- ated with a significant decrease in overall mortali ty within the first 6 months of life in boys as well as girls. In addition to these two trials, which were designed specifically to tes t the effect of neonatal vitamin A supplementation, a trial from Ne pal among 0-6 month-old infants also included a group of chil dren below 1 month of age, i.e. neonates. In this subgroup, vita min A was not associated with beneficial effects (24). Hence, a t otal of seven trials of neonatal vitamin A supplementation have n ow been published. Three of four trials from South Asia sho wed beneficial effects on mortality of neonatal vitamin A suppleme ntation (55, 56, 103). Three trials from Africa found no overall beneficial ef- fect, all estimates going in the other direction (V II, IX, 101, 102). The trials are summarised in Table 3 . Differences in vitamin A status do not seem to expl ain the diver- gent results. It is not easy to assess the vitamin A status since the trials have provided very different measurement s of vitamin A deficiency ( Table 3 ). The Indian and Bangladeshi trials proba- bly had the highest degree of vitamin A deficiency, and found a good effect, whereas none of the women in the Afric an trials suffered from night blindness. However, it should a lso be noted that the Indonesian trial had a good vitamin A stat us for the mothers and a very good effect of vitamin A supplem entation. Also, the 4,495 HIV-positive women in the Zimbabwe trial pre- sumably suffered from vitamin A deficiency, and vit amin A had no beneficial effect in that group; it even had a s ignificantly negative effect in the large majority of the childr en who remain- ed HIV-negative ( Table 3 ). The mortality level, which is consid- ered a marker of vitamin A deficiency (1), is easie r to assess than vitamin A status ( Table 3 ). A plot of the effect of neonatal vita- min A supplementation as a function of baseline mor tality in the placebo groups reveals no association ( Figure 6 ), and supports that differences in vitamin A status are not the on ly explanation for the divergent results. Divergent results would be expected if vitamin A ha d a particu- larly good (or bad) effect on certain pathogens and there were regional differences in the prevalence of such path ogens. The relative risk estimates of vitamin A versus placebo for specific causes of death varied considerably in the trials, e.g. for diar- rhoea deaths they varied from 0.4 in Indonesia (55) to 2.4 in Zimbabwe (101). Hence, there was no indication that the effect of vitamin A was limited to certain disease categor ies, though it does not exclude that vitamin A could have differen tial effect on different pathogens (See also Chapter 6). There was considerable variation in the causes of d eath over the trials, for instance almost two thirds of the death s were ascribed to pneumonia in the Zimbabwe trial (101, 102) compa red with less than a quarter in Guinea-Bissau (VII, IX), and septicaemia was by far the major cause of death in Indonesia (5 5) whereas it was a less common cause of death in India and Zimba bwe (101, 102). These differences are most likely to reflect major variation in the way that causes of deaths are assigned (by v erbal au- topsy) and they do not correlate with vitamin A eff ects. Hence, variation in causes of death over sites does not se em to explain the divergent results. We have proposed that the divergent results may be explained by differences in vaccination intensity (VIII, 63, 65). Figure 5. Survival curves from neonatal vitamin A s upplementation trials Indonesia 1992-1994 India 1998-2001 Bangladesh 2004-2007 Zimbabwe 1997-2001 Guinea-Bissau 2002-2008 References (in order of appearance): 55, 56, 103, 1 01, VII, IX In our normal-birth-weight trial from Guinea-Bissau , all children received BCG at the same time as VAS or placebo (VI I). Having received VAS tended to be beneficial as long as BCG was the last vaccine to be received. However, once children rece ived DTP vaccine, mortality in girls who had received VAS at birth was significantly 2-fold higher compared with girls who had received placebo at birth (VIII). Though vaccination coverag e was lower and the schedule more varied, and though we collect ed vaccina- tion data with larger intervals among low-birth-wei ght infants, the negative effect of vitamin A was also most evid ent among older girls, who had received DTP in the low-birth- weight trial (Table 2 ). Hence, in our experience neonatal vitamin A supp le- mentation could have a beneficial effect as long as BCG is the last vaccine, but may have a negative effect for girls o nce they receive DTP. Such vitamin A-vaccine interactions could help expl ain the vari- ation in trial results. Vaccination intensity was h igh in Guinea- Bissau ( Table 3 ) and probably also in Zimbabwe as judged by the national coverage data (116). If there is negative interaction between vitamin A and DTP and the coverage for DTP is high, then one would expect the survival curves of vitami n A and pla- cebo recipients to cross once the children start re ceiving DTP around two months of age. This pattern is seen both in Guinea- Bissau and among the children of HIV-negative mothe rs in Zim- babwe ( Figure 5 ). The Zimbabwe trial did not provide survival curves for children of HIV-positive mothers, but we calculated that the relative risk of mortality was 1.24 (0.63- 2.43) from en- rolment to 6 weeks of age, but 1.41 (0.89-2.23) fro m 6 weeks to 12 months of age (based on Table 3 in the paper, ma ternal pla- cebo groups only). Vaccine coverage was low, and vaccines were given w ith great delays in the trials from India and Bangladesh ( Table 3 ). The trial from Indonesia was conducted 15 years ago, when vac cination coverage may have been lower. Hence, one would not expect to see the same negative interaction in these trials. Importantly, as seen from the curves from Bangladesh and India ( Figure 5 ), the trials only followed children to 6 months of age, s o a negative interaction between vitamin A and DTP vaccine would have had little time to become apparent. Furthermore, for re asons we do not know, all the Asia studies were characterised b y a high neo- natal mortality, but low mortality in the subsequen t months, du- ring which a negative interaction between vitamin A at birth and DTP vaccine would matter. Hence, the existing data are compati- ble with the hypothesis that neonatal vitamin A may interact negatively with subsequent DTP vaccine in girls. A REANALYSIS OF ONE OF THE ORIGINAL VITAMIN A SUPPL E- MENTATION TRIALS The latest opportunity to test our hypothesis came when we were allowed to reanalyse data from one of the orig inal vitamin A trials. The trial, conducted in rural Ghana from 19 89 to 1991 (16), enrolled 6-90-month-old children, and randomised th em to vita- min A or placebo every 4 months for a period of 2 y ears. In the beginning of the trial, vaccination status was asse ssed. The trial was undertaken in the period, when coverage with ro utine vacci- nations was low, and many children had no vaccinati on card. The original trial had not analysed data by vaccination status; it re- ported a 19% significant mortality reduction after vitamin A sup- plementation (16). However, when we reanalysed the data, we found that vitamin A supplementation only had a ben eficial effect in children without a vaccination card. The mortali ty reduction was 36% (12-53%) in these children, but only 5% (-26%-28%) in children with a health card (X). This differential effect was particularly pronounced in girls. Among children with a card the effect of vitamin A supplementation differ ed significantly in boys and girls (p=0.046). This was entirely due to a negative effect of vitamin A supplementation in girls who ha d received 0 to 2 doses of DTP at enrolment and were likely to rece ive DTP dur- ing follow-up (2.60 (1.41-4.80)) (X). Discussion The reanalysis supports the hypothesis that vitamin A supplemen- tation interacts with vaccines, and that the effect differs between the two sexes, in particular that the combination o f vitamin A supplementation and subsequent DTP vaccine may have negative effects in girls. This finding corroborates the fin dings from our neonatal vitamin A trials. It could be speculated t hat the observed negative effect of vitamin A supplementation among girls in the neonatal vitamin A trials was due to a negative eff ect of neonatal vitamin A in infant girls per se , rather than a negative interaction between vitamin A and DTP. However, the reanalysis encom- passed much older children, and the finding of a ne gative interac- tion between vitamin A and DTP vaccine also in olde r girls sup- ports that this is a true interaction, and not just a result of an unknown age and sex-differential effect of vitamin A. None of the other original vitamin A trials reported data by va ccination status, but it should be noted that they were all carried o ut during the roll-out of the vaccination programme, and they may likewise have had differential effects in vaccinated and unv accinated children. DISCUSSION The initial formulation of the Vitamin A-vaccine-interaction hy- pothesis led to a series of studies of different de signs. We con- ducted an observational study during a vitamin A ca mpaign (VI), a randomised trial testing the effect of two differen t doses of vita- min A during another campaign (V), two randomised t rials of vitamin A given with BCG at birth (VII, IX), and we reanalysed data from an old randomised trial of vitamin A from the perspective of vaccination status (X). The results do not support the existing interpretat ion that vitamin A acts by preventing vitamin A deficiency, since a smaller dose seemed more beneficial than a larger dose in girls and the effect of vitamin A supplementation was harmful in certain subgroups of participants. . The results, on the other hand, supported the hypot hesis that vitamin A and vaccines interact. First, the effect of vitamin A given with DTP was significantly different from the effect of vita- min A given with measles vaccine, and children who received vitamin A with DTP had higher mortality than childr en, who had received vitamin A alone or who did not receive any thing. Second, neonatal vitamin A interacted negatively with subse quent DTP vaccines in girls. Third, the effect of vitamin A to older children depended on vaccination status, being beneficial in boys, but harmful in girls who received DTP during follow-up. Each of our studies has its weaknesses and sources of bias. How- ever, it is quite remarkable that though they did n ot always pro- duce the expected result, e.g. we did not find a be neficial effect of vitamin A given with BCG vaccine, they provided support for the hypothesis that vitamin A and vaccines interact , e.g. vitamin A given with BCG vaccine interacted negatively with s ubsequent DTP vaccine.

In a trial testing the effect of p roviding BCG revaccination, children BCG revaccination at age 19 months. An unexpecte d cluster of deaths occurred in the BCG revaccination group in c onnection with a vitamin A supplementation campaign. In a post hoc analy- sis, the BCG versus no BCG hazard ratio was 4.14 (1 .17-14.7) among children who received vitamin A, but 1.29 (0. 29-5.75) among children, who had not received vitamin A (p=0 .042 for interaction between vitamin A and BCG revaccination ) (67). Very recently, we have analysed data from a two-dose mea sles vacci- nation trial. Children who had received all three d oses of DTP were invited to participate. They were randomised t o receive early measles vaccine or no early measles vaccine a t 4.5 months of age. All children were given the usual measles v accine at 9 months of age. Overall, early measles vaccine was a ssociated with decreased mortality. Some of the children had taken part in neonatal vitamin A trials. In a post hoc analysis we found evi- dence for interaction between neonatal vitamin A an d early measles vaccine (p=0.01). The beneficial effect of early measles vaccine was only seen in children, who had not rece ived neonatal vitamin A; neonatal vitamin A seemed to negate the beneficial effect of the vaccine (117). These findings of nega tive interactions between vitamin A and BCG revaccination and early m easles vaccine, respectively, were clearly unexpected; we were surprised that the interventions seemed to interact when give n so many months apart - and if anything we would then have e xpected the interactions between vitamin A and the live vaccine s to be bene- ficial. Nonetheless, the findings support that vita min A an im- portant immuno-modulator, which interacts with vacc ines. The possible interactions between different health interventions are virtually never explored. Only one other group has studied the interaction between vitamin A and vaccines. In the Indian neonatal vitamin A trial, vaccine information was c ollected every 14 days, and the authors published a separate paper on the po- tential non-specific effects of vaccines (118). In that paper, the authors censored the first week after enrolment and vitamin A supplementation, and followed the children from 1 w eek after enrolment to 6 months of age. They found a negative effect of receiving BCG and DTP vaccine among girls in the pl acebo group. However, they also reported that this negative effe ct was miti- gated by vitamin A (118). Curiously, there were 40 versus 48 deaths in the vitamin A and the placebo group in ma les, corre- sponding to the overall estimate for vitamin A vers us placebo in males of 0.70 presented in the main paper, but ther e were 56 versus 54 deaths in females - not corresponding to the overall estimate of 0.87 in the main paper. Hence, the cens oring of the first week after enrolment censored fewer deaths am ong female vitamin A recipients than among female placebo reci pients. In other words, it seems as if the observed tendency f or a beneficial effect of neonatal vitamin A in females in the Indi an trial was entirely due to a beneficial during the first week of life. The esti- mates for vitamin A versus placebo by vaccination s tatus cannot be deducted from the paper - but it may look as if the combina- tion of vitamin A and DTP vaccine was worse for gir ls (HR= 0.57 for vitamin A plus DTP compared with vitamin A in u nvaccinated children) than placebo and DTP vaccine (HR=0.11 for placebo plus DTP compared with placebo in unvaccinated children) , whereas the opposite was the case for boys (HR=0.00 vs. 0.9 0) (118). This would corroborate our hypothesis of vitamin A ampli fying the non-specific negative effect of DTP vaccine in girl s. Based on the way the data was reported, no conclusions can be ma de. We have asked the authors whether they would be willin g to provide vitamin A-placebo estimates stratified by vaccinati on status in both sexes to further explore the compatibility of their findings with our hypothesis, but unfortunately received no answer. Even if most data seem compatible with the Vitamin A-vaccine- interaction hypothesis, some riddles remain to be solved. The findings of a sex-differential effect of the intera ctions have not been consistent. Also, the timing of vitamin A supp lementation and vaccines is unclear. The campaign study was the only study, in which different vaccines were given at the same time as vita- min A (VI). In the neonatal vitamin A trials, vitam in A seemed to interact with DTP given several months later (VIII) . In the Ghana reanalysis, it was also vaccines given during follo w-up, rather than status at inclusion, which determined the resp onse (X). Lastly, the two-dose measles trial showed that neon atal vitamin A may interact with a vaccine given 4.5 months after. It would seem important to study the window during which vitamin A and vac- cines may interact. In particular, we wonder whethe r neonatal vitamin A may have priming effects on the immune sy stem that may have long-lasting consequences. So far, our data on the vitamin A-vaccine interacti ons on mortal- ity are strongest for a negative interaction betwee n vitamin A and DTP (VI-X). There is less evidence for a positive i nteraction be- tween vitamin A and measles vaccine (VI). The final proof of vitamin A-vaccine interactions having both benefici al and detri- mental effects will have to come from randomised tr ials. Since it is unethical to withhold recommended vaccines, such a trial would have to be designed in special ways, for inst ance testing the effect of vitamin A or placebo with DTP versus the effect of vitamin A or placebo with measles vaccine. 5. SEX-DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS OF VITAMIN A Since the first finding of a sex-differential effec t of vitamin A supplementation on the immune response to measles v accine, stratification by sex has been compulsory in our an alyses of vita- min A effects. Our studies have produced the following observation s of sex- differential effects: 1. The effect of vitamin A given with measles vaccine at age 9 months on the antibody response to measles vaccine was most pronounced and only significant in boys. The e ffect was significantly different in boys and girls (p=0.009) (II). 2. Vitamin A supplementation with BCG vaccine temporar ily diminished the proportion of boys, who had a positi ve PPD reaction at 2 months of age. The effect was signifi cantly dif- ferent in boys and girls (p=0.048) (62). 3. A low dose of vitamin A compared with the recommend ed dose of vitamin A was associated with significantly reduced mortality in girls, but not in boys. The effect was significantly different in boys and girls (p=0.004) (V). 4. The effect on mortality of vitamin A given with BCG vaccine to normal-birth-weight infants tended to be benefic ial in boys, but not in girls. The same was seen among low -birth- weight infants. In a combined analysis, there was s tatistically significant interaction (p=0.01) between vitamin A and sex, and the effect of vitamin A was significantly negat ive in girls (Hazard ratio=1.41 (1.04 to 1.90)) (VII, IX). 5. Vitamin A given with BCG to normal-birth-weight inf ants was associated with significantly higher mortality in g irls after subsequent DTP vaccination, but not in boys. The ef fect was borderline significantly different in boys and girl s (p=0.05). The same tendency was seen in low-birth-weight infa nts. In a combined analysis, vitamin A at birth was associa ted with 75 % (9-183%) increased mortality among girls who s ubse- quently received DTP vaccine, significantly differe nt from the effect in boys (p=0.04) (IX) 6. The effect of vitamin A given with BCG vaccine on n on-rota- virus diarrhoea was beneficial in boys, but not in girls, and differed significantly between boys and girls (p=0. 03) (68). 7. The effect of vitamin A given with BCG vaccine on t he inci- dence of measles infection was beneficial in boys, but not in girls, and differed significantly between boys and girls (p=0.03) (115). 8. There was a significant inverse relationship betwee n in- crease in vitamin A status and number of DTP vaccin es re- ceived in girls, which was particularly evident amo ng vitamin A recipients (p=0.01 for interaction between sex an d DTP and vitamin A and DTP) (61). 9. The effect of vitamin A supplementation in Ghana di ffered between boys and girls who had a health card (p=0.0 46) (X). 10. The effect of vitamin A supplementation in Ghana di ffered between boys and girls who had a health card and ha d mea- sles vaccine as their last vaccine (p=0.009). This was particu- larly pronounced among children, who had received 0 -2 doses of DTP and were likely to receive more doses of DTP during follow-up (p=0.0004) (X). However, it should be noted that not all studies fo und sex- differential effects: 11. The negative effect of receiving vitamin A with DTP during a campaign compared with receiving vitamin A plus mea sles vaccine was seen in both boys and girls (VI). 12. The negative effect of vitamin A given with BCG vac cine on rotavirus infection and rotavirus diarrhoea was see n in both boys and girls (68). Nonetheless, it should be quite clear that we found more sex- differences in the vitamin A response than could be expected by chance. Table 4 summarises all trials that have reported the effec t on mortality of vitamin A supplementation by sex. Surp risingly few trials have done that. There is an overweight of trials, which have found a more benefi- cial effect in boys than in girls in the youngest a ge group ( Table 4). Also, several studies have found sex-differences in the im- mune response after simultaneous administration of vitamin A and vaccines (II, 62, 97). Sex-differences in the m ortality response to other micronutrient interventions have also been seen, in particular in the youngest age groups (66). There are at least three possible explanations why such sex-dif- ferences should occur. First, they may be a product of initial differences in mi cronutrient status. Boys have been observed to be born with low er levels of vitamin A and to be more iron-deficient during infa ncy (114, 119). They grow more rapidly and their requirements may b e larger than girls' and as such they may benefit more from supplementa- tion (fits the Prevention-of-deficiency hypothesis). Second, there may be underlying immunological differences between boys and girls, which determine a differential response to v itamin A (this would imply that vitamin A is an immuno-modulator). Third, the sex-differences may be the result of interaction wi th vaccines, as we have proposed. This third possibility can co-exi st with the two other explanations. It builds on the observation th at vaccines have non-specific sex-differential effects on morta lity. The live vaccines BCG and measles vaccine have been shown to reduce overall mortality much more than can be ascribed to the preven- tion of tuberculosis and measles, respectively, and these effects are strongest for girls. On the other hand the inac tivated DTP has been shown to increase mortality from other disease s in girls (70- 75). We have proposed that the non-specific effects of vaccines are amplified by high doses of vitamin A (IV). Our studies provide support for the latter notion because most of the o bservations of a more beneficial effect in boys and a negative eff ect in girls have been done in connection with DTP exposure. Also, th e mere finding of a negative effect indicates that other m echanisms than prevention of deficiency are in play - it might be possible that girls are less deficient and experience less benefi cial effects of vitamin A supplementation, but it is difficult to i magine why a high dose of vitamin A should cause increased morta lity many months after supplementation, unless it does more t han merely prevent deficiency. The potential biological mechanisms behind the obse rved sex- differences are discussed further in Chapter 6. Irr espective of the underlying mechanism, all future studies of vitamin A should be analysed stratified by sex. If such sex-differences exist, it could have profound implications for the vitamin A supple mentation policy. The present results suggest that while neon atal vitamin A does not seem to benefit girls, it should perhaps b e given to boys. The acknowledgement of the existence of sex-differe nces in the response to vitamin A would also encourage that all other health interventions be analysed by sex. To take it to its logical conclu- sion, we might have to treat boys and girls differe ntly to treat them equally. 6. BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS Though the immunological effects of vitamin A suppl ementation are not the main theme of the present thesis, I hav e reviewed the potential biological mechanisms behind the interact ions between vitamin A and the specific and non-specific vaccine effects in boys and girls. Since our current hypotheses are based o n observations of the effect of vitamin A on T-cell subsets, and o n underlying differences in the immune systems of boys and girls , I have sum- marised the effect of vitamin A and sex, respective ly, on T-cell subsets. I have focused on the balance between T he lper (Th) 1 and Th2 cytokines, and the balance between anti-inf lammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines, though it should be noted that this is very simplistic (120). The effect of vitami n A supplementa- tion on different pathogens may also shed light on the differential effects of vitamin A when given with different vacc ines; it has also been briefly reviewed.

All trials finding a better effect of vitamin A in boys than in girls are in bold. 18 VITAMIN A AND T-CELLS In immunological studies, vitamin A deficiency has been associ- ated with Th1 deviation, and vitamin A supplements have mostly been shown to enhance Th2 type responses (37, 76, 7 7). It was the background for studying the effect of vitamin A on the de- velopment of atopy; if vitamin A supplementation le d to Th2- deviation when given with measles vaccine at 9 mont hs of age, it could perhaps lead to increased incidence of ato py. In our small study we found no indication that vitamin A e nhanced the risk of being skin prick-positive 6-7 years later, but a recent study actually reported that excessive intake of vi tamin A modu- lated the Th1/Th2 development with a shift towards Th2, and increased the risk or severity of asthma in mice (1 21). However, vitamin A may not always induce Th2 deviation. One in vitro study suggested that the effect of vitamin A may de pendent on the environment; vitamin A enhanced Th1 responses u nder Th1 conditions, but enhanced Th2 responses under Th2 co nditions (122). This could be interpreted as if vitamin A am plifies what- ever is ongoing in the immune system. Very recently it has also been shown that vitamin A promotes the generation o f immune- suppressive regulatory T cells, while they suppress the T cell dif- ferentiation into inflammatory Th17 cells (123). He nce, based on the current literature vitamin A seems mostly to in duce Th2 and anti-inflammatory responses. Most of the above work has been done in rodents and in adults, and results have not always been consistent. Furthe rmore, the results may be of limited relevance to infants, bec ause the Th1/ Th2 dichotomy may be less distinct in humans than i n rodents (124), and because infants differ immunologically f rom adults (125). There are very few studies on the immunologi cal effects of vitamin A status and vitamin A supplementation i n children. In South Africa, among children with severe diarrho ea, there was no association between vitamin A status and neo pterin con- centrations (neopterin being a marker of Th1 activi ty) (126). In Indonesia, on the other hand, vitamin A deficiency was associ- ated with increased neopterin concentrations, but s ignificantly reduced ex vivo IFN- production, indicating that vitamin A deficiency was associated with Th1 dominance in the steady state, but impairment of Th1 response after stimula tion (127). In Venezuela, vitamin children had signifi cantly dimin- ished serum IL-10 levels (128). There was no measur able effect on cytokine levels of providing a single large dose of 200,000 IU vitamin A to preschool children (129). Within the n ormal-birth- weight neonatal vitamin A trial in Guinea-Bissau, w e conducted an immunological subgroup study. Vitamin A status w as posi- tively correlated with in vitro IL-5 and IL 13 production to PPD in 6-week-old infants, supporting a positive associati on between vitamin A and Th2-responses. However, we found no e ffect of vitamin A supplementation on the Th1/Th2 balance, b ut vitamin A supplementation was associated with significantly decreased spontaneous TNF- production supporting an anti-inf lammatory effect of vitamin A supplementation (130). SEX AND T-CELLS There are indications that males may have a more pr onounced Th1 profile than females, since they have stronger delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses (62, 131). Convers ely, females may have a stronger Th2 profile, as they seem to mo unt a higher antibody response than males (II, 132-133). To our knowledge, very few studies have addressed the Th1/Th2 balance in boys and girls. In a cohort of children at high risk of developing aller- gic disease, IFN- responses to PHA were higher in boys than in girls at 1 year and 3 years of age, but IL-5 respon ses were also higher at 3 years of age (134). There were no diffe rences in PHA- induced IL-10 production between the sexes. We have found no sex-differences in the in vitro cytokine production within the placebo group in our trial, except for lower TNF- response to LPS among girls (130). A possible explanation for the sex-differences in t he Th1/Th2 balance could be oestrogen levels. Very few studies have been done on oestrogen levels in prepubertal children, b ut they gen- erally seem to report that girls have higher levels than boys (135-136). Oestrogen is positively associated with Th2-cytokine concentrations, whereas it seems to dampen Th1-cyto kine production (137). Hence, the effects of oestrogen o n the genera- tion of Th2-derived cytokines of cytokines and skew the immune r esponse towards Th2-type responses compared with boys. Another possible explanation could be differences i n vitamin A levels; if boys were more vitamin A deficient and v itamin A defi- ciency was associated with Th1-deviation, it could be speculated that boys were more Th1-deviated for that reason. I ndeed, there are indications that boys are born with lower vitamin A levels (114). However, in Guinea-Bissau boys were n o more vita- min A-deficient than girls at 6 weeks of age, and a t 4 months of age they had higher RBP levels than girls (61). VITAMIN A AND PATHOGENS There is accumulating evidence for interaction betw een vitamin A supplementation and specific infectious pathogens . Given the protective effects of vitamin A supplementation on mortality, and the observation that vitamin A deficiency incre ases morbid- ity from diarrhoea and respiratory infections, it w as presumed that vitamin A supplementation would have beneficia l effects on morbidity. However, the findings from the existing studies, al- most all supplementing children above 6 months of a ge, are not consistent. The effects of vitamin A supplementatio n on the pre- vention of diarrhoea and respiratory infections hav e recently been summarised (77, 138-139). With regard to diarr hoea, a me- ta-analysis estimate yielded no overall effect of v itamin A on the incidence (1.00 (0.94-1.07)) (138). However, our st udy of diar- rhoea (68), along with studies from Mexico (140-143 ), has indi- cated that the effect of vitamin A supplementation on diarrhoea is pathogen-specific. For instance, vitamin A reduc ed the preva- lence of enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) infections, but increas- ed the duration of Giardia infections in Mexico (14 0), and we found a negative effect of vitamin A on rotavirus i nfection in both sexes, but age and sex-specific effects of vit amin A on non- rotavirus diarrhoea, the effect being beneficial in the youngest boys (68). With regard to respiratory infections, t wo recent me- ta-analysis yielded estimates of vitamin A effects of 1.08 (1.05- 1.11) (138) and 1.13 (0.88-1.43) (139). Hence, para doxically vita- min A supplementation may increase the incidence of respira- tory infections. Used as treatment against specific diseases, vitamin A has been beneficial in the treatment of m easles infec- tion (144), but potentially harmful in the treatmen t of respira- tory infections (145). Hence, the data on the effec t of vitamin A in the prevention and treatment of infectious disea ses suggest that the effect of vitamin A may differ, depending on which pathogens the immune system encounters. Unfortunate ly, very few studies have presented data stratified by sex. We speculated that the divergent effect of vitamin A supple- mentation on different disease categories could be the underly- 19 ing explanation for a strong interaction between vi tamin A and season observed in our normal-birth-weight neonatal vitamin A trial (VII). However, we were not able to confirm s uch an inter- action among low-birth-weight infants (IX). Nonethe less, we recommend that season should always be considered w hen evaluating vitamin A effects. Different pathogens induce different immune respons es and this may be the explanation for the divergent effects of vitamin A supplementation on disease incidence and outcome. F or in- stance, compared with placebo recipients, 6-15-mont h-old Mex- ican children who received vitamin A supplementatio n every 2 months had reduced IL-4, IL-6 and IFN- levels in f aecal samples when infected with EPEC. In contrast, they had incr eased IL-4 levels when infected with A. lumbricoides (141). The pathogen-differential effect of vitamin A on in fectious dis- ease incidence, disease outcome and cytokine produc tion during disease, supports the notion that vitamin A effects on mortality may depend on vaccine type, and the effects can be beneficial, but also at times harmful. VITAMIN A AND SPECIFIC EFFECTS OF VACCINES As described in Chapter 3, there is some evidence f or interaction between vitamin A supplementation and vaccines in t erms of specific immune response to the vaccine. Vitamin A has been shown to enhance the antibody response to measles v accine, oral polio vaccine and hepatitis B vaccine in some, but not in all studies. The increased antibody response seems biol ogically plausible based on vitamin A's stimulating effect o n Th2 re- sponses. Though very few studies have analysed the data strati- fied by sex, the effect of vitamin A supplementatio n might be most pronounced in boys, i.e. vitamin A may enhance the hu- moral immune response in terms of the antibody titr es more in boys than in girls (II, 97). In contrast, vitamin A may decrease the cell-mediated delayed type hypersensitivity respons e in boys (62). These two observations could be the result of two factors. First, as described above boys seem to be more Th1 prone than girls; boys tend to have stronger cell-mediated res ponses than girls, but lower antibody titres. Second, as also d escribed above, vitamin A supplementation may bias the immune respo nse in a Th2 direction. If boys are more Th1 prone, they may benefit more from the Th2-deviating antibody-enhancing effe cts of vitamin A, but vitamin A supplementation could also lead to loss of the Th-1 driven stronger cell-mediated responses . Based on our studies, vitamin A supplementation made boys re ach the same measles antibodies levels and the same prevale nce of positive PPD responses as girls; in other words, vi tamin A sup- plementation made boys respond more like girls. If vitamin A has anti-inflammatory capacities, this would be exp ected to lead to decreased humoral as well as cellular responses in both sexes, this, however, does not fit with the observations, perhaps be- cause that anti-inflammatory effect would be less p ronounced if the children were marginally vitamin A deficient. VITAMIN A AND NON-SPECIFIC EFFECTS OF VACCINES With regard to the interactions between vitamin A a nd the non- specific effects of vaccines, we clearly need to un derstand the biological mechanisms behind the non-specific effec ts on mor- tality of vaccines before we can come to fully unde rstand how vitamin A may amplify these non-specific effects. B iologically there is no obvious immunological mechanism that ca n explain non-specific effects of vaccines. However, only bio logical proc- esses already known are plausible. In fact, several animal ex- periments have shown that infection with one pathog en strongly affects the way the immune system reacts t owards other unrelated pathogens - so-called heterologous immunity (146). These effects can be beneficial, leading to a more suffi- cient response, or harmful, leading to impaired res ponse. From that perspective it would not be implausible that v accines could do the same, i.e. influence the response to subsequ ent unre- lated pathogens with potential beneficial, but also at times harmful, consequences. Immunological studies have mainly reported that liv e vaccines were associated with Th1 deviation (47-51), and ina ctivated vac- cines with Th2 deviation, also to unrelated pathoge ns (49-54), though the results have by no means been consistent , in particu- lar the whole cell DTP vaccine used in low-income c ountries seems to induce a more Th1-deviated response than t he acellu- lar DTP vaccine used in high-income countries (147- 148). How- ever, a general picture seems to be that live and i nactivated preparations of the same antigen elicit Th1 and Th2 -deviated responses, respectively (49-51). A recent study aim ing to de- velop a live pertussis vaccine have found that a li ve pertussis vaccine induces a more Th1 deviated response than t he inacti- vated pertussis vaccine (149). Aluminium based adju vants used in DTP vaccine induce a Th2 response (150-151). Since infants are born with a Th2-deviated immune s ystem, we have speculated that the Th1 inducing effect of the live vaccines may be part of the explanation for their non-specif ic beneficial effects on overall mortality, whereas the Th2-devia tion induced by inactivated vaccines and the aluminium-based adj uvants may be detrimental. If vitamin A amplifies these immuno logical ef- fects as proposed, it could influence the overall e ffect of vitamin A supplementation on mortality, and the effect coul d possibly be more important than the beneficial effect of vit amin A sup- plementation in vitamin A-deficient children. A neg ative effect would be particularly evident in settings without w idespread vi- tamin A deficiency. Hence, it might be speculated t hat the po- tentially negative effect of vitamin A given with D TP in girls is due to a too strong unnecessary or excessive Th2 de viation, which would be particularly problematic in girls, w ho were more Th2-prone than boys. 7. CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER RESEARCH QUESTIONS When I started working within the field of vitamin A, it was a common perception that vitamin A worked by preventi ng and treating vitamin A deficiency. I interpreted the fi ndings of in- creased measles antibody titres after supplementati on as the result of a well functioning, vitamin A replete, im mune system. However, my subsequent research has clearly shown t hat this interpretation is not sufficient to explain all the effects of vita- min A. Vitamin A is also an immuno-modulator, and i ts effect is modified by other factors, which influence the immu ne system. The effects are different for boys and girls. REFUTING THE PREVENTION OF-DEFICIENCY HYPOTHESIS There is no doubt that vitamin A does prevent defic iency and thereby protects against vitamin A deficiency-relat ed diseases and mortality. However, that assumption fails to ex plain all the existing evidence. Four major contradictions are me ntioned be- low: 20 First , as shown in the first meta-analysis of the origin al trials there is no association between the degree of pre-e xisting vita- min A deficiency and baseline mortality on one hand , and the effect of vitamin A supplementation on the other ha nd (19). This observation has been confirmed in the recent neonat al vitamin A supplementation trials ( Figure 6 ). If vitamin A merely acted by preventing deficiency one would expect a clear asso ciation with a better effect in the more deficient populations. Especially low- birth-weight infants are known to suffer from vitam in A defi- ciency (114), and the lack of a beneficial effect i n our normal- birth-weight trial was by some researchers explaine d by the fact that we had not studied low-birth-weight children ( 152). The lack of a beneficial effect among low-birth-weight infants in our trial clearly disproved such speculations (IX). Figure 6. Baseline mortality and estimated effect o f neonatal vitamin A supplementation Note : Bangladesh only provided mortality per 1000 live births, not per 1000 person years at risk as the rest of the trials. Second , the Prevention-of-deficiency hypothesis does not explain the heterogeneity in effects over age groups. Thoug h the picture is less consistent now, vitamin A still seems to be better for old- er children than for infants, and vitamin A has no beneficial ef- fects in 1-5-month-old infants ( Figure 3 ), though several of the studies found that a substantial proportion of the children had low serum retinol levels (25-26). This should be se en in the light that all infants are born with limited vitamin A st ores. During the first 6 months of life children increase their live r stores by drink- ing breast milk or formula. However, studies from B angladesh, Brazil and Indonesia reported that a quarter to ove r 90% of 6- month-old infants had inadequate liver stores (153- 155). A ne- cropsy study of American infants reported deficient liver vitamin A concentrations in two-thirds of the infants under 3 months of age and in a quarter of 4-6-month-old infants, but none among 6-12-month-old infants (156). If this is the genera l age-related biological trend, it does not make sense that vitam in A is not be- neficial among the 1-5-month-old infants in low-inc ome coun- tries. Third, almost all the trials, which studied the effect of different doses, found a better effect of the smaller dose (V , 26, 108-112). It is generally acknowledged that high-dose vitamin A supple- mentation can have transient toxic effects in the f orm of bulging fontanels or vomiting, but otherwise it is consider ed safe (5). Hence, it is not logical that a smaller dose should have a more beneficial effect than a large dose several weeks t o months after supplementation. Fourth, importantly, if vitamin A supplements merely treate d vi- tamin A deficiency, it would not explain our consis tent observa- tions of a differential effect of vitamin A accordi ng to vaccine status. We hypothesised that it would be so, we tes ted it using several different designs - and we found the same a gain and again (V-X) as well as in different age groups (inf ants in the two neonatal vitamin A trials (VII-IX), older children in the reanalysis of the Ghana trial (X)): vitamin A supplementation was signifi- cantly associated with negative effects on mortalit y for girls when given in relation to DTP vaccine. These findin gs were sup- ported by specific morbidity studies (68,115) and s tudies of vita- min A status (61). There is no way that this effect can be ex- plained by specific deficiency-treating effects of vitamin A. VITAMIN A IS AN IMMUNO-MODULATOR AND ITS EFFECTS AR E MODIFIED BY THE ACTIVITIES IN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM Our research has emphasised that vitamin A is an im muno-mod- ulator, and its effects depend on what is going on in the immune system at the time of supplementation. These intera ctions may lead to a more beneficial effect of vitamin A suppl ementation than can be explained merely from prevention of def iciency, for example the strong beneficial effects after 6 month s of age may also relate to an amplification of the beneficial e ffects of mea- sles vaccine, which is usually given in this age gr oup. These inter- actions may, however, also lead to negative effects , which may help explain the otherwise incomprehensible finding s of nega- tive effects of vitamin A in some subgroups of reci pients. Vitamin A beyond doubt has profound effects on the immune system. Several studies have shown that vitamin A a nd vaccines cannot be seen as two independent interventions, si nce vitamin A enhanced the antibody response to the vaccine. Th e morbidity studies have shown quite clearly that the effect of vitamin A supplementation on disease outcome is modified by p athogens. Though they are yet not well understood, vaccines h ave pro- found effects on the immune system, influencing its capacity to respond to subsequent infections. The effects can b e beneficial, as seen for BCG and measles vaccine, but also harmf ul, as seen for DTP vaccine. Seen from that perspective, it is not so surpris- ing that we have found that the mortality effect of vitamin A supplementation may depend on the type of vaccine w ith which it is given. In particular, we consistently found t hat vitamin A may be negative when provided close to DTP vaccine. This would explain the lack of effect when vitamin A was provided in the age group 1-5 months, when DTP vaccine is the p redominant vaccine, as well as the non-significant but worryin g tendencies for increased mortality in vitamin A recipients, wh en vitamin A was given directly with DTP vaccine (See Chapter 8) . It may also explain that a smaller dose of vitamin A is more be neficial than a large dose, especially if DTP is the most recent va ccine. Lastly, it may explain why vitamin A supplementation even to o lder chil- dren no longer seems to confer the same benefits as it did in the original vitamin A trials, which were carried out b efore the vac- cine programme was rolled out (See Chapter 8). So f ar, we have more limited evidence for a synergistic beneficial effect on overall mortality of vitamin A and measles vaccine; more trials are needed. VITAMIN A HAS SEX-DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS In all our studies we have looked for sex-different ial effects in the response to vitamin A supplementation, and we h ave found them. Vaccines also have sex-differential effects o n overall mor- tality. Seen from my perspective it should be compu lsory to con- duct all analyses stratified by sex. It is incompre hensible how much money is being invested in conducting genetic analyses 21 with the aim to provide individualised treatment - when the po- tentially most important genetic variation is easy and free to test and virtually unexplored. The Vitamin A-vaccine-interaction hypothesis offers an explana- tion for the sex-differential effects of vitamin A supplementa- tion, since many studies have shown that the negati ve non-spe- cific effects of DTP vaccine are particularly marke d for girls. However, as also pointed out previously, there are several other potential explanations for the sex-differences, and we still see hypothesis that vitamin A has sex-differential effe cts as inde- pendent of the Vitamin A-vaccine-interaction hypothesis. FURTHER RESEARCH QUESTIONS Our research raised many questions, which need to b e studied further. Among them I find the following most intri guing: Timing of vitamin A and vaccines Our hypothesis raises the question of the optimal w indow of supplementation. According to our results, vitamin A can inter- act negatively with DTP vaccine in girls, even if t he two interven- tions are given several months apart (VII-X). Furth er studies would be needed to determine a safety time window b etween the two interventions. Combined vaccinations We have observed that the combination of BCG vaccin e and DTP vaccine may carry survival benefit for girls (72), an observation which has been confirmed in several recent analyses of datasets from Asia (unpublished). According to the WHO-recom mended vaccination schedule, children should receive BCG v accine at birth, and subsequently DTP vaccine at 6 weeks of a ge ( Figure 1). Our studies have been done in an urban setting, where most children follow this schedule. However, in many rur al areas chil- dren get their vaccinations with delay, and many ch ildren have reached the age of DTP vaccination when they come f or BCG vaccination, and receive both vaccines at the same time. If vita- min A is provided at birth, it may be speculated th at it would be beneficial for girls, if it was followed by combine d BCG and DTP vaccination instead of a DTP vaccine only. I would anticipate that such a beneficial effect of neonatal vitamin A supp lementation would be seen until the girls received their second DTP vaccine, after which the effect would be negative. According to the WHO schedule, DTP should be given before measles vaccine. However, many children receive DTP delayed, together with measles vaccine. The effect of provid ing vitamin A with combined DTP and measles vaccine remains to be studied. Other modifiers of vitamin A effects Apart from vaccines and sex, other factors may modi fy the ef- fect of vitamin A. They are depicted in Figure 7 . Among them are pathogens. It is well recognised that vitamin A has differential effects on diarrhoea and respiratory infections. Cu riously this has not led to openness to the proposition that the effect may also differ by vaccination status. We have also shown that the dose of vitamin A may b e impor- tant. This observation is supported by all other st udies, which have looked at dose. From my perspective it seems p lausible that more frequent dosing with smaller doses is mor e beneficial than the more non-physiological larger doses, in pa rticular when vitamin A is provided in the same time window as a DTP vaccine to girls, or at the time of a specific pathogen inf ection, for which the immuno-modifying effects of high-dose vitamin A may be detrimental. Figure 7. Potential modifiers of the effect of vita min A supple- mentation on mortality Priming with early vitamin A supplementation may al so be im- portant. Recent results have indicated that early v itamin A sup- plementation may prime a beneficial response to sub sequent doses of vitamin A. A follow-up study of the partic ipants in the neonatal vitamin A trial in normal-birth-weight inf ants showed that after a vitamin A supplement at 12 months of a ge (at the end of follow-up), mortality was significantly lowe r among girls, who had received vitamin A at birth compared with g irls, who had received placebo at birth. Among children who w ere not at home to get vitamin A at 12 months of age, mortalit y continued to be higher among girls who had received vitamin A compared with placebo at birth (157). Furthermore, another t rial of differ- ent doses during a vitamin A campaign revealed that the benefit of a small dose versus a high dose was confined to children, who had not received vitamin A at birth; children who h ad received vitamin A at birth benefitted from a high dose (158 ). To me there is no doubt that there will be other mo difiers of vi- tamin A supplementation. The proposition that vitam in A as an immuno-modulator interacts with other factors, whic h affects the immune system, opens up for a large range of po ssible inter- actions. The important issue in the future will be to be open to such interactions, continuously exploring their exi stence, keep- ing in mind that while such interactions would not necessarily need to be biologically plausible in the first plac e, they would have to be repeatable. Other micronutrients Several recent large-scale randomised trials provid ing iron and zinc supplementation to infants have shown disappoi nting re- sults (159-162). In one trial, the iron arm was clo sed prema- turely due to a significantly increased incidence o f serious ad- verse events including deaths (159). We made the ob servation that the negative effect seemed limited to girls be low one year of age, and proposed that similar negative interact ions with DTP exist for iron and zinc (66). If DTP has negative n on-specific ef- fects on the immune system leading to increased mor tality, girls who have DTP as their most recent vaccine may be be tter off if their immune system is not functioning optimally du e to mar- ginal micronutrient deficiency. IMPLICATIONS OF SPECIFIC AND NON-SPECIFIC VITAMIN A - VACCINE INTERACTIONS The work in the present thesis has shown both specific and non- specific vitamin A-vaccine interactions of relevance for th e cur- rent WHO policy of providing vitamin A with vaccine s to children above 6 months of age. The policy has never been ev aluated in 22 randomised trials. Our results imply that the polic y needs to be evaluated - and not merely for its effect on vitami n A status or on the immune response to the vaccines. Vitamin A m ay have specific beneficial effects in terms of improving vitamin A status or the immune response to the vaccine(s) with which it is given. However, our work has shown that even though vitami n A sup- plementation improves vitamin A status and the immu ne re- sponse to vaccines, it can also have important non-specific ef- fects on survival. The overall benefit of providing vitamin A supplementation can be seen as the sum of vitamin A 's specific and non-specific effects. If there are strong negat ive non-specific effects on overall survival of providing vitamin A with certain vaccines, this could overrule the beneficial specif ic effects. Re- search should be done to provide evidence for polic y - and the research needs to focus on the important outcomes i n order to produce the relevant answers. Our work has emphasis ed that beneficial specific effects such as improved vitami n A status and increased immune responses cannot be interpreted as equiva- lent to an overall beneficial effect - overall mort ality is the most important outcome. A NEW FRAMEWORK: INTERVENTIONS INTERACT AND HAVE SEX-DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS It is a common assumption within public health in l ow-income countries that interventions can be combined withou t unexpect- ed consequences. According to the existing scientif ic paradigm, health interventions are specific. Health intervent ions are also seen as independent of each other. Furthermore, hea lth inter- ventions are assumed to have the same effect in bot h sexes. However, the work presented in this thesis confront s this para- digm. My work suggests a more complex, yet hopefull y more sensible framework: vaccines and vitamin A are immu no-modu- latory interventions that programme the immune syst em. These non-specific effects may interact with unexpected e ffects on sur- vival. Combining interventions can be convenient an d lead to synergistic health benefits, but we documented seve ral exam- ples where it also leads to unexpectedly increased mortality. Thus, to optimise the child health intervention pol icy in low-in- come countries a shift in paradigm is needed. Healt h interven- tions should no longer be seen as merely specific a nd independ- ent, and the policy should probably not be the same for boys and girls. Though more complex, it is necessary to evaluate all health interventions in terms of their effect on ov erall mortality - and their potential interactions with other healt h interventions and potential sex-differential effects should alway s be investi- gated. Only in this way can we assure that the chil dren in the poorest countries get the best possible treatment a nd avoid using large amounts of money and resources on inter ventions, which may, in worst case, kill them. To sum up, the consequences of public health import ance are 1) Vitamin A supplementation is not always beneficial, and we need to seek the optimal policy, taking advantage o f the beneficial effects of vitamin A supplementation, bu t avoid using it when it puts children at risk 2) Child health interactions may interact with consequ ences for mortality 3) There is a need for continuing evaluation of interv entions, which are already recommended, since their effect m ay change in the context of new interventions being la unched. 4) Sex of the child should always be considered when e valuat- ing the effect of health interventions. In the last chapter, I will provide examples of the consequences of my work for public health. 8. PUBLIC HEALTH CONSEQUENCES Our findings have contributed to major public healt h issues. The findings have been commented upon in a number of ed itorials (152, 163-167) and influenced policy decisions on s everal occa- sions: VITAMIN A WITH MEASLES VACCINE While we conducted our trial of the effect on measl es-specific antibody titres a paper was published reporting tha t vitamin A supplementation had negative effect on the antibody response to measles vaccine administered at 6 months of age (84). The paper raised a lot of concern, which was debated in The Lancet (168-170). The benefits of measles vaccine and vita min A sup- plementation were weighed against each other, in th e case that simultaneous administration of the two intervention s should be abandoned and one should be prioritised over the ot her (168- 170). Our paper was published with an accompanying editorial stating that there was no need for concern if vitam in A was given with measles vaccine at the recommended age o f 9 months (163). It closed the debate, also at the WHO (171). VITAMIN A WITH DIPHTHERIA-TETANUS-PERTUSSIS VACCINE Since the beginning of the nineties there has been interest in extending the beneficial effects of vitamin A in ol der children to younger children. In 1998, the WHO multicenter tria l was pub- lished, showing no effect of providing 25,000 IU vi tamin A with each of the three DTP vaccines, even though the maj ority of the participants were vitamin A-deficient (26). The nat ural response would have been to explore the reasons for this lac k of effect - and perhaps to start questioning whether the underl ying as- sumption, that vitamin A worked merely by preventin g vitamin A deficiency, could be true. However, the reaction wa s rather the opposite - it was argued that the dose of vitamin A had been too small - and in 2002 the International Vitamin A Consultative Group (IVACG) came out with a strong recommendation that young children should have 50,000 IU vitamin A with each of the three DTP vaccines (32). Since the formulation of our hypothesis we have arg ued that it would potentially be a very bad idea to provide vit amin A with DTP. We have repeatedly emphasised the observation that vita- min A has never proven beneficial when given in the age group of DTP vaccine - and our subsequent trials have sup ported that. All existing data of providing 50,000 IU with DTP ( alone or as a part of pentavalent vaccine) suggest that this coul d have been detrimental, if the IVACG recommendations had been followed. A small trial from Ghana, which provided 50,000 IU vitamin A with the three pentavalent vaccines and compared it with pla- cebo, had five deaths in the vitamin A group and 1 death in the placebo group, resulting in a relative risk of 4.65 (95% CI 0.55- 39.5), p = 0.12 (29). Another small trial from Bangladesh ga ve 50,000 IU or placebo with the first DTP vaccine to children hos- pitalised with diarrhoea, and followed up with vita min A to the vitamin A recipients when they came for the second and third DTP. The dose of 50,000 IU vitamin A tended to be b eneficial when given to the children with diarrhoea, but it t ended to be negative when given with the second and the third d ose of DTP 23 (3.54 (0.76-16.5)), the effect of vitamin A given w ith the second and third dose of DTP being significantly different from the effect of vitamin A given with the first dose of DT P (28, 57). Another study from The Gambia, testing the effect o f 50,000 IU versus 25,000 IU vitamin A with the three DTP vacci nes, found that those who received the high dose had two death s versus none in the low dose group, and they had significan tly more clinic attendances during the first 6 months of lif e (p=0.018) (110-111). The recommendation to provide any dose of vitamin A with DTP has now been abandoned. To our regret there has bee n little interest in pursuing why vitamin A was not benefici al. NEONATAL VITAMIN A SUPPLEMENTATION While writing the present thesis a heated debate re garding a global or regional recommendation of neonatal vitam in A sup- plementation is ongoing. As outlined in Chapter 4, three of four studies from Asia found a beneficial effect whereas three African trials found no effect and even negative effects in some sub- groups (girls, in particular after DTP, in our tria ls; children of HIV- positive mothers, who remained HIV-negative themsel ves, in Zimbabwe). When some trials found a positive effect of neonata l vitamin A supplementation, and others no effect, a subgroup v itamin A supplementation policy is only acceptable if there is convincing evidence that the subgroup encompasses the children who ben- efit, and not those who might be harmed. Apparently , many seem to accept the geographical area \"South Asia\" a s a reason- able definition of such a subgroup; several voices have been raised in favour of recommending blanket neonatal v itamin A supplementation in South Asia (152, 172-173). We th ink it might be premature to implement neonatal vitamin A supple menta- tion in South Asia before we understand the backgro und for the contradictory effects in existing trials (65). According to the advocates for \"South Asia\", differ ences in vita- min A status and baseline mortality in the neonatal vitamin A supplementation trials is the best way of reconcili ng the contra- diction between the trials. However, as described i n Chapter 4, there is limited data on vitamin A status, and diff erences in baseline mortality do not explain the divergent res ults. As argued in Chapter 4, the divergent results may b e explained by differences in vaccination intensity in the tria ls (VIII, 63, 65). If our hypothesis is correct and neonatal vitamin A su pplementa- tion is made a general policy in South Asia, the in tervention may cease to be beneficial or even become detrimental, as the DTP coverage increases and more children are vaccinated early in life - especially in populations in which mortality is n ot limited to the first months of life. However, there will be no way of knowing, because it is considered unethical to conduct furth er trials once an intervention has become policy. WHO has now decided to carry out three new trials o f neonatal vitamin A supplementation. It was initially propose d that these studies should only follow children to 6 months of age. It was not suggested to collect data on vaccination status and the trials were not designed with the a priori hypothesis that the effect could be different in boys and girls. However, base d on our find- ings from Guinea-Bissau, it has now been decided to prolong fol- low-up to 12 months of age, and vaccination data wi ll be col- lected (Magnus Tingstr\u00f8m, personal communication). An important question for further research is what happens when BCG and DTP are administered simultaneously, a s often happens in rural areas. We suspect that vitamin A s upplementa- tion in this situation may be more beneficial for g irls, since we have previously experienced that combined BCG and D TP vacci- nations are better for girls than for boys (72). Th e previous African neonatal vitamin trials were carried out in urban areas, and most children received their vaccinations in th e recom- mended schedule, first BCG and then DTP (VIII, Jean Humphrey, personal communication). If the two new African tri als are car- ried out in rural settings where BCG and DTP are of ten given together, then the results may be different, with a beneficial effect for girls, at least until the second dose of DTP. IS VITAMIN A SUPPLEMENTATION BENEFICIAL IN THE VACC INA- TION ERA? Among the eight original vitamin A trials leading t o the policy of providing vitamin A to all children between 6 month s and 5 years of age, two used fortification or small weekl y doses of vita- min A and did in fact not test the effect of high-d ose supplemen- tation (11, 17). Two of the other trials did not fi nd a beneficial effect (12, 15). Recently, a large Indian trial was conducted, showing no effect of vitamin A supplements in 1-5-y ear-old children (22). The trial has not yet been published , but it is hard to believe that such a result can be a chance findi ng or due to bias. The original trials were carried out while th e vaccination programme was in its youth. Our re-analysis of the Ghana trial showed that almost half of the children had not rec eived any vaccines (X). It also showed that the beneficial ef fect of vitamin A was limited to children, who had no vaccination c ard. The prevalence of vitamin A deficiency is declining. He nce, the bene- ficial effect of vitamin A on the prevention of def iciency, and thereby on mortality, may be less than it used to b e. Further- more, overall performance of immunisation programme s is often tracked with the coverage of three doses of D TP vaccine (DTP3). As a result of the drive to increase DTP3 c overage, many children now receive DTP vaccine together with or a fter measles vaccine, and the coverage of DTP3 is now higher tha n the mea- sles vaccine coverage in many countries. Furthermor e, many countries provide DTP booster vaccine around 18 mon ths of age. Hence, also older children may now receive vitamin A supple- ments close to DTP vaccine. It could be speculated that the ef- fect of vitamin A supplementation is only beneficia l in deficient children and/or in unvaccinated children - and as t he prevalence of such children declines, the effect ceases to be beneficial. If vitamin A interacts negatively with certain pathoge ns or certain vaccines, it may even become detrimental. For a lon g time it has been considered completely unethical to conduct ran domised trials of vitamin A supplementation in children age d 6 months to 5 years. The time may have come for it to be done, since it is also unethical to continue using large amounts of m oney and resources on interventions that may, in worst case, kill some children. 24 SUMMARY The present thesis is based on 11 papers from 1995- 2010. The studies have mainly taken place at the Bandim Healt h Project in Guinea-Bissau, West Africa, but a reanalysis of a r andomised trial from Ghana is also included. My research has explored the consequences of combin ing high- dose vitamin A supplementation and childhood vaccin es. Vita- min A deficiency is associated with increased morta lity. To pro- tect against the consequences of vitamin A deficien cy the World Health Organization recommends that high-dose vitam in A supplements be given together with routine vaccines to children between 6 months and 5 years of age in more than 10 0 low- income countries. The recommendation is based on lo gistical considerations. The consequences of combining vitam in A and vaccines were not investigated in randomised trials prior to the implementation of this policy - it was assumed that the inter- ventions were independent. My first project aimed to study the effect on the i mmune re- sponse to measles of providing vitamin A together w ith measles vaccine. We found that the two interventions were n ot inde- pendent. Vitamin A enhanced the antibody response t o measles vaccine given at 9 months of age significantly, esp ecially in boys. The effects were sustained over time; the children who had received vitamin A with their measles vaccine were more pro- tected against measles at 6-8 years of age. Though vitamin A supplementation had a beneficial e ffect on the immune response to measles vaccine, it intrigue d me that the effect of vitamin A supplementation on overall mortality was not always beneficial. While vitamin A was benefici al when given after 6 months of age, and two studies had shown a beneficial effect when given at birth, all studies testing the effect between 1-5 months of age had found no effect. These time w indows are dominated by three different childhood vaccines: BC G vaccine given at birth, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine given between 1-5 months of age, and measles vaccine give n at 9 months of age. These vaccines have been shown to ha ve strong effects on mortality from infectious diseases in ge neral, so- called non-specific effects. The live BCG and measl es vaccine protects against more mortality than can be ascribe d to the prevention of tuberculosis and measles, respectivel y. The inacti- vated DTP vaccine worryingly has been associated wi th in- creased mortality from other infectious diseases. B oth positive and negative effects are strongest for girls. I pro posed the hy- pothesis that vitamin A amplifies not only the spec ific vaccine effects, as we saw for measles vaccine, but also th e non-specific effects of vaccines on mortality from other infecti ous diseases. According to my hypothesis, vitamin A would enhance the non- specific beneficial effects on mortality of BCG and measles vac- cine, but also the negative effects of DTP vaccine. Hence, the hypothesis offered an explanation for the mortality -age pattern after vitamin A supplementation. Since it was formulated, I have aimed to test this hypothesis. Since it is associated with ethical problems to ran domise chil- dren above 6 months of age to vitamin A supplementa tion, and to randomise children in general to recommended vac cines, we have had to be pragmatic when designing the trials. Hence, our studies have taken many different forms. We conduct ed an observational study during a vitamin A campaign in which miss- ing vaccines were also provided, and a randomised t rial testing the effect of two different doses of vitamin A duri ng another campaign; we tested the effect of providing vitamin A with BCG at birth in two randomised trials, and we reanalyse d data from one of the original randomised trials of vitamin A supplementa- tion from the perspective of vaccination status. In all studies the main outcome was mortality. The results document that vitamin A supplements do more than protect against vitamin A deficiency. They support the hypothe- sis that vitamin A supplements interact with vaccin es with im- portant consequences for mortality. First, a smalle r dose of vitamin A was more beneficial than a larger dose fo r girls. Sec- ond, the effect of vitamin A given with DTP vaccine was signifi- cantly different from the effect of vitamin A given with measles vaccine, and children, who received vitamin A with DTP vaccine, had higher mortality than children, who had receive d vitamin A alone, or who did not receive anything. Third, vita min A given with BCG at birth interacted negatively with subseq uent DTP vaccines in girls. Fourth, the effect of vitamin A to older children in Ghana depended on vaccination status, being bene ficial in boys, but harmful in girls who received DTP vaccine during fol- low-up. The results also show that boys and girls r espond differ- ently to vitamin A and vaccines. It is a common assumption within public health in l ow-income countries that interventions can be combined withou t producing unexpected consequences. The work presented in this thesis confronts this assumption; the results show that vi tamin A and vaccines should be seen not only as specific interv entions with specific and independent effects, but as immuno-mod ulators, which can interact with important consequences for overall mortality. Combining interventions can be convenien t and lead to synergistic health benefits, but we documented s everal ex- amples, where it also leads to unexpectedly increas ed mortality. Thus, to optimise the child health intervention pol icy in low- income countries a shift in paradigm is needed. Hea lth interven- tions should no longer be seen as merely specific a nd independ- ent, and the policy should probably not be the same for boys and girls. Though more complex, it is necessary to evaluate all health interventions in terms of their effect on ov erall mortality - and their potential interactions with other healt h interventions and potential sex-differential effects should alway s be investi- gated. Only in this way can we assure that the chil dren in the poorest countries get the best possible treatment a nd avoid using large amounts of money and resources on inter ventions which may, in worst case, kill them.
