In the age of the consciousness soul, the independent individual wants to wake up in the encounter with the soul and spirit of another: we must become the awakener of one another. - Rudolf Steiner Dear Friends, In striving to become independent, we simultaneously take on the responsibility of awakening to community. Since we are karmically connected to so many people, we enrich and challenge one another with new impulses and insights when we awaken to one another and to our destiny paths. From such wisdom is born love. This love lights up the will so that creative deeds can bring new life to both individual and community. We warmly welcome you to join our twenty -first year of Renewal Courses, taking place once again on the campus of High Mowing School in Wilton, New Hampshire, a place that has sheltered us well these many years. We are truly grateful to the heritage of life forces that surround our work on this hill. I chose the winged messenger, Hermes -Mercury, as the painting to accompany our Renewal program this year, which will feature many changes in both content and format. We will be sending some of you a much smaller version of our annual catalogue in order to conserve paper and in recognition of the fact that nearly all of you are finding us online. We are also taking up social issues in new ways to help our schools move successfully into the next 100 years. During the first week, a stellar faculty will lead our popular grade -specific courses to support the passion and vocation of class teaching. Please look inside this virtual brochure to find details about these courses. We will again enjoy Christof Wiechert 's short morning lectures. New this year is that Christof will visit grades 1 -5, offering some guidelines for the art of the child study to strengthen the heart of faculty meetings. Roberto Trostli will again offer science to the upper elementary grades courses, while Elizabeth Auer and Cezary Ciaglo will teach art and eurythmy. David Newbatt will return to teach curriculum and blackboard drawing for the upper elementary grades during this first week. Movement, games, and posture work through Spacial Dynamics\u00ae exercises will be offered by Gerry LoDolce, especially in grades 1 -5. Meg Chittenden, our Renewal Musical Director, will enliven us all with music in both weeks. Center for Anthroposophy \u2014RENEWAL COURSES 2020 \u2014www.centerforanthroposophy.org 3 Renewal Courses for the second week will aim to \"hold the middle \". On the one hand, we will host a new group of people seeking to ignite hearts and minds for practical solutions to questions of key social issues, especially school sustain - ability and financial viability, facilitated by John Bloom, Alice Groh, and Ryder Daniels. With Linda Williams, we will also explore contemporary issues of equity and diversity. On the other hand, we will offer a timeless course led by Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler on the spiritual mission of Rudolf Steiner and Ita Wegman, seeking inspiration from their esoteric biographies and the seminal book they wrote together. Michaela will also address today 's pathologies connected to living in the digital age, which we need to prepare for, strengthening the courage of the heart. Leonore Russell will support this course with the health -giving movement of daily tone eurythmy. This second week will also welcome back Linda Bergh and Jennifer Fox with a new course on Biography Studies, open both to former and new participants. Another new course will be offered by Karsten Massei, working deeply with the knowledge that now actively lives between human beings and nature and helps us grow towards the future with more heart and wakefulness. June Albright, an experienced artist handwork teacher, will bring embroidery and stitching based upon the geometry of nature. During this same week, Jamie York will challenge the boundaries of imagination through projective geometry. Michael D 'Aleo will lead a seminar based on Rudolf Steiner 's Philosophy of Freedom/ Spiritual Activity and supplemented with metal work during the afternoons. Signe Motter and the staff of CfA will bring an \"Anthroposophy 101\" course especially designed for early childhood and grades assistants, those wishing to find windows into anthroposophy, or grandparents and parents of children attending Waldorf schools. cont 'd Center for Anthroposophy \u2014RENEWAL COURSES 2020 \u2014www.centerforanthroposophy.org 4 Philosophical presentations and discussion will be enhanced by painting and clay modelling with Elizabeth Auer and eurythmy with Cezary Ciaglo. Robyn Brown has been invited to share her wealth of knowledge and experience of how to heal by working with the lower senses. She will explore Rudolf Steiner 's important Curative Course and ways to put these lectures to practical use for healing the many children in our care. Angela Lindstrom and Natasha Zimmerman, experts in teaching mixed or looping grades, will facilitate a new course to help those who may feel overwhelmed by this task. Torin Finser and Carla Beebe Comey will work deeply with the human encounter through movement, study of karmic relations, and the social health of working as colleagues, parents, and administrators. From England will come Bronia Evers and Melody Brink, with an approach to addressing community building and the healing of social issues through puppetry. This course will teach the technique of puppetry felting, while also preparing participants for storytelling and performance for all ages. Finally, David Newbatt will stay on for this second week to teach veil painting out of the imagery of Goethe 's Fairy Tale: The Green Snake and the Beautiful Lily. Both weeks of these summer courses will be further enriched by evening events, music and lectures, and a social evening of sharing during the first week. Each Thursday, there will be a gathering of CfA and Antioch alumni at 5:15 pm for conversation, updates, shared supper, and a festive evening event. These gatherings will be hosted by Torin Finser and Douglas Gerwin. We all are looking forward to welcoming you to our new line -up of summer programs! As always, please sign up early, especially if you wish to stay on campus. To register, visit: centerforanthroposophy.org/programs/renewal -courses/ Warmest wishes, and take good care of yourselves, Karine Munk Finser , Renewal Director and our Renewal \u2014RENEWAL COURSES 2020 \u2014www.centerforanthroposophy.org 5 With Gratitude and Love, we dedicate this brochure to MaryLyn Yonika This year marks 20 years since MaryLyn (\"ML\") first joined us as administrative assistant at the Center for Anthroposophy (CfA). Prior to this, MaryLyn worked in the office of Pine Hill Waldorf School, where her 3 children were students. We are grateful for ML's steadfast care and meticulous attention to the myriad details that make CfA a warm and welcoming institution. ML brings an artistic touch to everything she does, and we cherish all she has done for us with her usual grace and kindness. She has supported our Renewal Courses in many ways over the years. This year, ML is carrying our housing, both for participants and for faculty. A heartfelt thank you, ML, for your tireless service and friendship! Milan Daler, \u2014RENEWAL COURSES 2020 \u2014www.centerforanthroposophy.org 6 1 1 Morning Lectures and the Art of the Child Study with Christof Wiechert We are grateful to welcome back Christof Wiechert to teach in a different capacity during the first week of our Renewal Courses. Rather than having Christof offer his course on Child Study, we would like to bring him into the grade -specific courses for one session, combining two grades at a time. This session will address challenges in the teaching experience and ultimately help strengthen the classroom by taking up the opportunity of the Child Study. The Art of the Child Study is a treasure that stimulates creativity and healing in schools. Christof will share this practice that has always been the heart of the faculty meeting. To understand a challenge by working together \u2014 activating our own capacity for imagination, inspiration, and intuition \u2014 helps to uplift and strengthen the vitality of a school. Enthusiasm is the result of such work, and perhaps less outsourcing of challenges will become necessary. Christof will offer all of us short morning lectures . These will take place right after announcements in the Big Room: 8:50 -9:25 a.m. We welcome outside visitors to these lectures; please make arrangements with the office by phone (603) 654 -2566 or email: info@centerforanthroposophy.org. Monday: What Is Art and What Is the Art of Education? Tuesday: Creativity and the Philosophy of Freedom Wednesday: The Effects of Different Subjects on the Being of the Child Thursday: The Interaction of the Self with the Body in Childhood Friday: Day, Memory, Night, and Sleep in Education WEEK Center for Anthroposophy \u2014RENEWAL COURSES 2020 \u2014www.centerforanthroposophy.org 7 1 The Joy of Blackboard Drawing and Curriculum Painting in the Upper Elementary Grades with David Newbatt This course will celebrate the joy of painting and blackboard drawing for Grades 6, 7, and 8, working artistically with the many curricular themes. This process will allow every teacher to find and develop anew the artist within and proudly be able to say, \"Like you, I am on the path of learning, too. \" Rudolf Steiner mentioned the importance of creating images spontaneously in front of the children, since this activity brings life to the classroom. In this time of social media, the importance of trusting one 's own capacities to bring life and meaning through an artistic process becomes essential, in that it serves as a source of life and of transformation for both teacher and students alike. This course is for teachers who wish to prepare themselves for grades 6, 7, and 8, or who wish to develop skills and confidence in the arts. We will practice working with themes from the main lessons in these upper elementary years, including images from history, geography, and many other subjects. All the exercises will be useful to all grade school teachers, since they can easily be adapted to the curricula of other grades. Please bring along colored pencils for notetaking, as well as a journal with white pages.

And then the adventures began, as little by little they became a vibrant, loving class; and they learned reading, writing, arithmetic, and much more! How to teach these subjects that the children long to learn is a delicate art best learned through practice. Together we will build confidence and courage for the journey, especially the ability to form this group of children into a class that loves to learn. The long voyage from A to Z will be traveled in stories, songs, movement, drama, drawing, and poems to lay the foundation for reading through the sounds and shapes of the letters. We will progress from letters to writing to reading. The qualities of numbers and the four processes will be explored with practical, hands -on exercises. Other subjects like form drawing, painting, singing, and recorder playing will also be discussed and practiced. Building a repertoire of poems, songs, and games, we will explore ways to lay out the block plans on a monthly, weekly, and daily basis. Teaching is both a dramatic and a social art. We will discuss how to build sound, affirmative relationships with students, parents, and colleagues, as well as supporting the interrelationship of the children with their classmates. Class meetings with parents (to support their inter - relationships, as well) and report writing will also be considered. Holding the middle between the law and order of the classroom and a fun, lighthearted spirit in teaching makes the First Grade journey a true pleasure. Please bring along pentatonic and soprano recorders.

They remain immersed in the world of imagination while seeking to find use for their powers of will. The beautiful images living in the stories from first grade are now brought into sharper focus, while being translated into fundamental capacities and skills. How can we build practical aspects of literacy and numeracy through these imaginative paths, while supporting the healthy development of the child as a future citizen of our contemporary world? The curriculum of the second grade meets this stage of development with fables, folktales, and stories of individuals that address the inner questions faced by seven -and-eight -year -olds. Animals exemplifying human qualities help to bring to life the serious choices that form character in a humorous way. Stories of great individuals from many cultures present examples of what people can achieve when they dedicate themselves to a purpose -driven life, often despite significant struggle. In this course, we will work together to form a living picture of the second grader, discuss methods and approaches for class, and learn practical activities and strategies. We will discuss each block through the year, share resource suggestions, and examine student work. Elements of movement, speech, singing, form drawing, and painting will accompany practical strategies in language and math. Forming positive class routines, practicing good classroom management, and working with parents will also be explored.

With the nine -ten-year change, children come into a new relationship with themselves as \"Ego\" bearers, as well as with the earth, as they learn to become stewards of the land. To support third graders through this profound transition, adults must carry a soul mood of reassurance and unwavering commitment. At the same time, the curriculum for this transitory year offers the children the rich nourishment necessary for this developmental shift. In our time together, we will explore the reasons why particular stories, songs, verses, and movements help children meet this particular threshold. Examples of activities that complement the various blocks and seasons/festivals will be presented along with aspects of the morning lesson: specifically, recall and practice work related to spelling, grammar, and arithmetic. Whenever possible, we will find ways to translate the core curriculum into movement, which is foundational for learning. Stories from the Hebrew Bible, along with creation stories from other traditions, will be shared to support this stage of development. Since third grade children are transitioning from their home space to larger surroundings, they are introduced to practical activities such as farming, gardening, cooking, baking, handwork, and building. In preparation for this year, different project ideas will be shared: a weaving project, a recipe book, a garden journal, and more. Many resources will be provided from sample block plans, weekly schedules, and birthday verses to parent meeting notes related to the nine -ten-year change and practical guidelines for a farm trip. These will all serve as a foundation to encounter and prepare the rich and hearty \"verb\" year of third grade.

Looking for glimpses of their own reflection in the world around them, they enthusiastically take up what is challenging with powerful, new abilities and strong feeling -life. Who are these mighty beings standing before us? What tools do they need to navigate the stormy seas? What inspirations can we use to aid them? What can we learn from them? We will ponder these questions as we explore the emerging academics of the fourth grade curriculum. Through the study of local geography, we will place the fourth grader beside the Sacred Tree of Turtle Island and learn timeless lessons from past and present that build and deepen community and responsibility for each other and Mother Earth. We will explore how to build an immersion experience with First Nation Peoples, expand community, and hear the Voices of the Elders. We will learn to speak the new languages of fractions and zoolo- gy, and expand our understanding of the world with new flexibility of thought. All of these subjects will inspire our paintings and form drawings. This course will also discuss block rotations, lesson plans, and student skill levels. Student class meetings and parent meetings are critical at this time, and we will discuss important topics and strategies for building community within and without the classroom.

The curriculum supports each student 's transformation from a child into a budding, self -directed human being. Teachers are tasked with guiding the fifth grader to understand and respect the consciousness of ancient civilizations. In presenting Greece 's recorded history, we help our students hear the Greek roots in words they use daily; the study of geography enables them to grasp the environmental, cultural, historical, and economic diversity of their own country. Botany helps them develop the capacity for keen observation of the natural world, preparing the ground for phenomenological science studies in the upper grades. In Greek times, training for the pentathlon was not just a physical under - taking; rather, it was an esoteric initiation into mastery of one 's own forces. Under our care, students can be likewise initiated. Grade 5 is a rich year of consolidation and further development of arithmetic, mathematics, and language arts skills; recitation, singing, drama, drawing, and painting; the thrill of researching the unknown. Teachers will leave this course with the strategies and tools needed to embark on an exciting summer of preparation and planning. Possible block rotations and block plans, poems, songs, stories, and academic and artistic exercises will be presented.

No longer adequate are the comforts of family and home. Now is the moment to step into the world with eyes wide open. The grace and confidence of the Greeks is replaced by gangly limbs and the determination to test limits and reputed truths. Such a moment in one 's evolution requires the law and order mirrored in the rise of the Roman Empire. Divine beginnings give way to the rule of kings, caesars, and emperors. Immaculate legions march across a continent, conquering and incorporating diverse peoples, while the Roman senators hammer out the laws that will govern them all. In consequence, a fertile field is laid for the invasion of the barbarians. Chaos reigns, and out of the uncertainty emerge faith and chivalry. The sixth grader is led through this uncomfortable transition to emerge with a hint of grace. Yet what of this world beneath one 's feet and above one 's head? Where are the laws that govern the light of day, heat, cold, the very sounds striking the human ear? Mineralogy, astronomy, and physics engage these wonderings, offering demonstrations that sharpen awareness of cause and effect in the universe. Observational skills must be honed and carefully recorded. Mathematics takes on the world of business, placing the sixth grader squarely in the material world. Geometrical drawing demands the correct use of tools, then offers the form up to artistic imagination. Geography draws the twelve - year -olds into a new landscape and openness for cultures beyond their own borders.

They really don 't have much patience for school anymore. They never learn anything anyway, and the teacher is so unfair! Woe unto the seventh grade teacher who is unprepared for displays of gross disrespect and indifference. But the seventh grade teacher also has the antidote at her fingertips, for the students can hardly contain their delight, bewilderment, and wonder at the deceptive simplicity of perspective drawing; the myriad examples of the Golden Mean all around us; the breathtaking masterpieces and biographies of Leonardo, Michelangelo, and Raphael; the audacity of Martin Luther; the marvels of chemistry and mechanics; the daring stories of exploration around the globe; and the unique geography and cultural expressions of people on distant continents. The teacher need only add a healthy dose of humor, and success is assured. In this course, we will consider strategies for approaching the daunting period of history covered in the seventh grade curriculum. A materials packet will include a sample block rotation along with suggestions for classroom materials and activities. Presentations will include hands -on practice of perspective drawing and sacred geometry, as well as suggestions for homework, independent projects, and recommended books.

In this culminating year, the students are more deeply immersed in adolescence and are met with a curriculum which nourishes their growing curiosity, competence, and thinking, while supporting the challenges and wonders they are experiencing as individuals. From revolutions to modern -day figures of light and hope, we will help outline a path toward the future for our students. Through the sciences of organic chemistry, physics, and anatomy, we will help students look at the forces and processes at work inside and outside. Through the study of economic geography and meteorology, the entire world becomes connected in a new way. In math, we will look at the study of geometry, particularly the Platonic solids and algebra. Language arts will include exploration of the short story, research papers, public speaking, and creative performance. Taken as a whole, these diverse studies will serve as a capstone to a grade school education and set the stage for the next phase of life.

Each one of us can experience the calling of our destiny, which speaks to us in the quiet voice of individual conscience, where the spirit meets the body. This is also the place where our heart is open and listening, a place of true health and wholeness, bridging us to the world beyond the threshold of the sense perceptible. Rudolf Steiner 's esoteric biography is deeply connected to Ita Wegman 's, and we will take courage from that destiny encounter and the work they accomplished together, especially in Rudolf Steiner 's last years on the earth. We will look at some elements of the book Fundamentals of Therapy that they wrote together. Even though their collaboration was cut short due to Rudolf Steiner 's passing, many since have taken up this work out of a destiny connection with these individuals. We will address the topic of pathologies, since we today need to deal with the consequences of the digital age on our children and humanity as a whole. It is part of our modern task to meet this attack on the unfolding human soul and the evolution of the earth. We will work deeply with the collaboration between Rudolf Steiner and Ita Wegman as a source of biographical inspiration that can work into our lives, strengthening our destiny paths with their impulse, and helping us not to lose sight of the essential: to balance the awakening of our hearts with solutions that spring from spiritual research so we may become servants of humanity.

Financing and Making Access to Waldorf Education in the 21st Century: A Call to Action A Practical -Solutions -Based Working Session for Waldorf Leaders and Entrepreneurs with John Bloom, Alice Groh, and Ryder Daniels Independent and Charter Waldorf schools are facing a serious sustainability wall \u2014a condition in which tuition increases and slowing enrollment simply can no longer keep pace with the expenses of a quality educational experience. The financing question needs research, innovative thinking, and a range of experiences brought to bear that is outside the normal pedagogical and governance circles. This meeting of people with fresh perspectives is the purpose of this gathering. We are calling together a 2.5 - day research gathering to explore the full scope of possibilities for the future of Waldorf education in North America. We plan to examine existing practices and explore collaborative approaches that could be further developed. As a research gathering, we expect to develop a set of recommendations and actions, but we are also hoping that representatives of various schools can come prepared to make \"soft commitments \" on behalf of their institutions to proposed collaborative projects. While we will inform existing organizations \u2014and there may be appropriate participants from them \u2014this gathering is not meant to be operating under any specific official sanction, except for those who are bringing a solutions - oriented perspective. While we do imagine inviting at least the core members of this gathering, we welcome all who hold the purpose of the meeting as an area of practice, research, and experimentation. Easing the financial strains on our schools will allow for greater access to the education and therefore provide a more diverse and richer cultural experience for all involved. This \"opening wide the doors \" will be the subject of Part 2 of this symposium, with Linda Williams and colleagues leading a colloquium on access to and diversity within our schools.

Advancing Equity and Diversity in Waldorf Schools: Original Intentions, Future Directions A Working Session for School Leaders to Create a North American Memorandum Beyond Waldorf 100+ with Linda Williams, John Bloom, Ida Oberman, Neil Boland, and Joaquin Mu\u00f1oz Many North American Waldorf schools are working with questions of diversity, equity, and inclusion. What are the obstacles that make it difficult for our schools to attract an array of families and students from a variety of communities and thereby embody the ideal of the universally human so integral to Anthroposophy? In this working session, we will openly address language from the past that has closed doors rather than opened them. We will work with empathetic practices to help school communities cultivate a healthy vision of what 's possible by formulating both wording and concrete steps to move us forward towards greater diversity in our schools. During the course of this two -day session, participants will develop a North American response in the form of a memorandum. We will be building on the recent documents addressing this question, including the AWSNA Member Commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (2019), the Frankfurt Memorandum (2018), and the New Zealand Equity Statement.

Can we become healers of the earth? Can the relationship of nature and human being become moral? The essence of humanity and the organism of the earth form a unity. In this course, we will focus on this unity and the secrets of the earth. The earth receives us, carries us, and gives us our destiny. We are the seeds, and as we grow, we are asked to manifest her evolution, because we essentially carry her evolution. The sanctity of every soul will ultimately become a gift to the earth. Today, we must become more and more conscious of these gifts and begin to act on recognizing this task: we help to heal the earth through our consciously directed deeds. Together, we will develop sensitive attention to celebrating the spiritual human being as an essential requirement for being able to serve the earth and its beings. Therefore, we will devote ourselves to inner activity and the questions connected with that place of inner creativity. We will also deal practically with the question of what we can do to heal the earth and support her life forces. In this course, different methods of meditation and spiritual perception will be introduced and practiced. We will address many aspects of this activity, including working with image and symbol, the wounded and the cosmic child, the nature of plants and animals, encounters with the elemental world, and active ways to bring healing to the earth. This course is open to both new and past participants: it is a new course.

The way we do this is through our connections with one another. -- Orland Bishop Rudolf Steiner gave wonderful insights regarding the life cycles of the human being. Working with these life cycles is a special focus of biography work and of this workshop. Each seven -year phase and 21 -year cycle has an archetypal mission for the body, soul, and spirit. Exploring our life stories through this lens of soul development will bring illumination to our unique themes, patterns, and destiny, as well as connecting us to the evolution of all humanity. The Social Art aspect of biography work creates opportunities for us to reflect on our lives within community \u2014the social artistry of working consciously together. Our experience of self and understanding of others is empowered through doing this Life Cycle work in connection with a group. Individual reflective work will open our life stories through memory, imagination, writing, life charting, and a variety of artistic expressions. We will develop mutual trust in a safe space of small group sharing, as well as larger conversations. Through this sacred sharing and listening, we will come, as Steiner said, to find true interest in ourselves and the other. And we will open more clearly to the golden thread of our own unique destiny. The purpose of biography work is to begin the reflective work consciously during this lifetime \u2014an opportunity to work with our life lessons, to develop an observer, to interact differently with those in our lives out of this gift. -- George and Gisela O 'Neill cont 'd WEEK Center for Anthroposophy \u2014RENEWAL COURSES 2020 \u2014www.centerforanthroposophy.org 21 2 Biography cont 'd This reflective work has the capacity to change the way we see and connect to all those around us --our children, students, parents, and colleagues --for it gives us a larger framework for the development of the whole human being, as well as tools for connection. A longing to understand our lives and others is a part of the human experience. Biography Life Cycles and Social Art are vehicles for strengthening our life--our \"destiny vessel \"--in this time of Consciousness Soul. Participants are invited to bring questions that live in them: Have you done some biography exploration and wonder more about this work as an opening to your life? Have you never done Biography work but feel your life pulling you to step back and take a look? This course is for everyone, even those who have taken it before. This class will bring different lenses to the biography process and content, providing past participants with new ways of looking and listening. What is more precious than gold?

It was Rudolf Steiner's wish that each individual teacher as well as the community as a whole commit themselves to working at a high level on their understanding and support of each single child. What seems to us today to be but a reminiscence from the early twentieth century, is possibly an educational element of the future. -- Peter Selg More and more teachers and parents are receiving children into their care with difficulties hard to understand at first. The answers to many of these questions are to be found in Curative Education. Over the years, we have lost our connection to this work, and so it is no longer a familiar tool; and yet Rudolf Steiner intended the Curative Course as a deepening of Waldorf education. The purpose of this course is to bring a clear, hands -on, practical, and accessible picture, so that we can begin to use Steiner's work effectively with all the children in our care. We will start by working with observation and experience, discovering how judgment stands as a contrast or polarity to that inner activity. In our time together, we will explore the six Curative Polarities and how they affect the conditions of the twelve senses so that we can build up a new living imagination and a deeper understanding of the child's inner condition. We will conclude with solutions Rudolf Steiner provided to help children work through their obstacles and truly heal. Each day will begin with what Rudolf Steiner referred to as \"Therapeutic Gymnastics\" -- so come prepared to move! Participants will also be asked to observe the walk and run of a child they may have a question about. They should observe the walk, memorize it, and be prepared to replicate it during our class.

In terms of mathematics, that course is projective geometry, in which eleventh graders get to bend their minds around (and through) infinity. Here is your chance! Join us as we blend the elements of art, math, and imagination. Even though this mysterious topic eluded mathematicians for more than 2,000 years, it is equally fascinating and accessible to both the mathematically adept and the mathematically timid. Participants will find their concept of geometry greatly altered as they experience infinity through drawing and in their imagination. The course will approach the vast subject of projective geometry by starting with simple geometric drawings and then studying the relationships that emerge as these drawings are altered. While much will be learned through drawing, the course will also involve discussions and an examination of how the historical roots of projective geometry shook the previously firm foundation of geometry. The course is tailored for the math teacher, the math enthusiast, and the math timid. The only prerequisites for participation in the course are open - mindedness, enthusiasm, and a desire to stretch one 's imagination.

Through a process of reflecting on reading assignments, observations, and practical exercises, participants will be encouraged to develop a deeper understanding of this essential aspect of Waldorf education, drawing from Rudolf Steiner 's Intuitive Thinking as a Spiritual Path: A Philosophy of Freedom (GA4). Classes will focus on three central themes: improving the ability to observe our surroundings developing a conscious understanding of the relationship between sense experience and thought exploring how this process relates to and affects our daily life and work as teachers Exercises involving dynamic, lively scenes in the natural world will be investigated to illustrate the challenges posed by the observation of living nature. Through small group work and individual journaling, the relevance of intuitions in ethical individualism will become more apparent. Themes from the morning discussions will be deepened further during the afternoon sessions through the practice of metal work, as well as other arts.

Through traditional storytelling, we can use word, movement, and gesture to bring alive the story world in the hearts and minds of our listeners. Stories and storytellers these days find themselves called to serve in a wide range of environments -- in homes, schools, libraries, theaters, community centers, nature parks, and other settings. In our current social climate, how can we be as inclusive as possible when meeting an often diverse range of listeners and listening needs? Here, puppetry can lend a helping hand. In our highly visual culture, where we are often bombarded with fast and complex images on screens, the direct simplicity of a little puppet beckoning us into the world of a spoken story can be surprisingly effective. Suddenly, we lean in closer. It 's enough to awaken our curiosity, whilst leaving us open to imagine the rest for ourselves. In this course, participants will craft their own puppet to accompany them on their travels into the world of storytelling. At the start of the week, each participant will be given a folktale to journey with. Through games and exercises, we will get to know our stories and explore ways to tell them using our many senses. Alongside this process, each participant will make a puppet using dry felting techniques. No previous craft experience is necessary, just a willingness to engage with the materials and learn along the way. The process of making the puppet can also help us work on storytelling. Whilst our hands are busy, our imaginations can roam, nourishing our connection with both the puppet that is coming into being and the story that is waiting to be told. Having crafted our puppets, we will sense through playful exercises their individual characters, voices, and movements. cont 'd WEEK Center for Anthroposophy \u2014RENEWAL COURSES 2020 \u2014www.centerforanthroposophy.org 26 1 2 Storytelling and Puppetry cont 'd We will explore the potential of the puppet character to introduce and frame spoken stories for young audiences. How can we work with ritual, rhythm, and simple puppet action to find engaging and enjoyable \"take - offs and landings \" for our storytelling? The aim here is for the puppet to become a helper to introduce and close the storytelling session, rather than to create a puppet play. Therefore, the puppet need not be a character from the storyteller 's chosen story. Participants will have the opportunity to develop their own telling of a folktale, with support from their puppet, who may introduce and/or close the story, and might even comment on it somewhere in the middle. On the final day, we will have space for harvesting the fruits of our time together and for participants to share their puppet and story in the supportive environment of the group. Participants will come away with: A unique, handcrafted puppet that can be an ally and helper in the classroom or other setting Some basic puppetry and puppet -making skills A story they will feel confident to tell Storytelling skills that can be applied to learning and telling other stories Materials fee: $30 Eurythmy with Cezary Ciaglo WEEK Center for Anthroposophy \u2014RENEWAL COURSES 2020 \u2014www.centerforanthroposophy.org 27 2 Teaching Students in Mixed or Looping Grades: The Art of Seeing the Child with Angela Lindstrom and Natasha Zimmerman The healthy social life is found when in the mirror of each human soul the whole community finds its reflection and when in the community the virtue of each one is living. -- Rudolf Steiner In order to offer Waldorf Education, we need to adapt to the demographics of our communities, such as the multi -age configurations in our classrooms. How can we enhance our powers of observation and our knowledge of human development to embrace the ever more diverse needs of our students -- especially when we expand the age range in a single classroom? Angela Lindstrom and Natasha Zimmerman have been class teachers at the Whidbey Island Waldorf School for almost two decades. Offering Waldorf Education to a community whose enrollment ebbs and flows has given them ample opportunities to explore ways to support the individual students while combining classes in different ways. This course will offer practical applications of combining classes and explore possibilities of looping combinations. Faculty involvement, parent expectations, and student experiences will also be addressed.

The Time is at Hand! \u2014from Goethe 's Fairy Tale This course is a creative journey inspired by Goethe 's wonderful fairy tale, The Green Snake and the Beautiful Lily . This jewel in the crown of fairy tales will allow for rich imagery to renew both experienced and less experienced painters. Both guided exercises and freedom of expression will help participants connect with the bridge that spans heaven and earth. We will use the artistic skills and discipline of veil painting, discovering healing aspects of this art form. David Newbatt will introduce the fairy tale and lead participants through various related themes that arise out of the story, which concerns the relationship between the individual and the community, like the relationship of individual veils of color to the whole composition. This course will be open to all who are willing to \"set veil \" on a journey. We will be painting with watercolor veils on dry paper. Participants are welcome to bring their own favorite name -tagged brushes and small lidded jars, if they wish to bring their paints home afterwards.

This course will benefit parents, grandparents, or prospective Waldorf teachers who are interested in understanding more about this philosophy. We also think that our schools will be greatly supported if early childhood or grades assistants are able to study with seasoned teachers embedded in this Renewal culture, where destiny paths meet and inspiring evening performances and lectures support the joy of sharing. We will offer a rich overview of the essential aspects of the human being -- the foundation of the age -appropriate curriculum shared by all our schools --and will study themes from Intuitive Thinking as a Spiritual Path, by Rudolf Steiner, in lively conversation. Each afternoon session will include supportive exercises in painting and clay modeling, along with daily singing and eurythmy.
