Executive Ov erview of RHP Plan Regional Healthcare Partnership (RHP) 6 is hono red to participate in the Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program. Th e 20 counties, anchored by University Health System, are committed to working together to make significant progress over the next five years toward the triple aim goals of assuring pati ents receive high-quality, pati ent-centered care, in the most cost-effective ways. RHP 6 also strives to leverage lo cal and federal waiver financing to: Further develop and maintain a c oordinated care delivery system Improve outcomes while containing cost growth Improve and prepare the health care infrastr ucture to serve a newly insured population RHP 6 the following counties: Atascosa, Ba ndera, Bexar, Comal, Dimmit, Edwards, Frio, Gillespie, Kendall, Kerr, Kinney, La Salle, McMullen, Medina, Real, Uvalde, Val Verde, Wilson, and Zavala. This RHP represents nine per cent of the Texas population and covers more than 24,000 square miles. The majority of RHP 6 residents are Hispanic (54%). Twen ty percent of the RHP 6 population did not complete high sch ool, and 16% live below the poverty line. The per capita income is $35,989. Twenty-four percent of resi dents lack health coverage. 11 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Each county varies in terms of its demographics, socioeconomics, and current health care infrastructure, but nearly every county in RHP 6 is designated as a Health Provider Shortage Area (HPSA) for primary care mental health and/or dental care. As a resu lt, the counties within RHP 6 face similar community needs and health challenges. RHP 6 seeks to improve quality and patient satisfaction. A high prevalence of chronic disease and related health disparities requi re greater prevention efforts and improved management of patients wi th chronic conditions. Leading causes of death in RHP 6 include cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. Many residents of RHP 6 lack acces s to medical and dental care due to high rates of uninsurance and health care pr ovider shortages. There is a shortage of high quality mental and behavioral health se rvices that are integrated with physical health care services and/ or provide crisis stabilization. Lack of interconceptional and prenatal care for women and primary and pr eventive pediatric care results in poor maternal and child health outcomes. High rates of communicable diseas e and potential for vaccine prev entable diseases due to low vaccine coverage levels in the community. The vast majority of health care infrastructure is located in Bexa r County, home to over 73% of RHP 6 residents. The Bexar County Hospital District, dba Un iversity Health System, is the primary safety-net hospital. University Health System has a long hist ory of partnering with private hospitals, both non- profit and for-profit, to meet the needs of Bexa r County and south Texas residents. Major hospital partners in Bexar County include CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health System, Children's Hospital of San Antonio, Methodist Healthcare, Bapt ist Healthcare System, Nix Health, Clarity Child Guidance Center, and Southwest General Hospital. Bexar County is also home to the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSCSA), which provides trai ning to future doctors, nurses, dentists and other health care providers. The San Antoni o Metropolitan Health District is a full service city-county health district which provides leadership and services for San Antonio and Be xar County to prevent illness and injury, promote healthy behaviors, a nd protect against health hazards. In the surrounding areas, six hospita l districts provide services thr ough their hospitals, which include: Dimmit County Memorial Hospital, Frio Regional Hospital, Guadalupe Re gional Medical Center, Medina Regional Hospital, Uvalde Memorial Hospita l, and Val Verde County Re gional Medical Center. Gillespie County recently established a new hospital authority. Hill Country Memorial Hospital and Peterson Regional Medical Center are private/non-profit hospitals which serve residents in Gillespie and Kerr Countie s, respectively. The following counties do not have hospitals: Bandera, Edwards, Kendall, Ki nney, LaSalle, McMullen, Real, and Zavala. 12 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs) are an impor tant part of the regional partnership. Lack of access to mental and behavioral health services has been identified as a critical issue within RHP 6 and the state. Four organizations are actively partnering with hospitals and othe r entities in unprecedented ways to help improve the delivery and quality of health care in RHP 6. These entities include Bluebonnet Trails Community Services, Camino Real Community Center, Center for Health Care Services, and Hill Country Mental Health and Development Disabilities Centers. Furthermore, these entities have partnered with local health depart ments, Federally Qualified Health Centers, elected county official s, community organizations, and other stakeholders to understand community needs, identify new sources of local funding, and ensure investments are made in a collaborative manner. The 120 Delivery System Reform Incentive Program (DSR IP) projects proposed in this plan address the needs of the broader community. Projects span the breadth of o pportunities presented in the RHP Planning Protocol. Projects incl ude expanding medical homes and pr imary care, increasing access to specialists, implementing technology to perform te lemedicine and manage patient registries, and numerous other initiatives. The projects differ in si ze, scope, and targeted population, but each is geared to achieve specific outcome measures and populatio n-focused improvements. Together, these efforts will enable RHP 6 to achieve the goals of the Tr iple Aim - improving the health of a population and patients' experience of care while lowering the associated cost of that care.

Community Needs Assessment Regional Healthcare Partnership (RHP) 6 compri ses approximately 9% of Texas' population and geography. Like much of Texas, RHP 6 has a high uninsured rate and report ed health outcomes are often poor. Key health challenges include limited access to primary and specia lty care, unmet mental and behavioral needs, chronic di sease, and poor maternal and child outcomes. The need for improved health care infrastructure will con tinue to increase as the population is expected to grow and more Texans gain health care coverage under the federal Affordable Care Act. Demographics Population The 20 counties in RHP 6 cover 24,734 square miles or approximately 9.5% of the total land area of Texas.1 In 2010, there were 2.3 million people living in this region, accounting for 9% of the state's population. Seventy-three percent (7 3%) of the RHP population resides in Bexar County. The majority of RHP 6 residents are either Hisp anic (54%) or Anglo (37%). This differs from the state as whole, which is 46% Anglo and 38% Hispanic.2 Forty-three percent of the Bexa r County population speaks a language other than English (primarily Spanish) in the home, compared to 34% across the state. The range varies dramatically within the region. For example, 12% of Bandera County reside nts and 72% of Zavala County residents speak languages other than English outside the home. 3 In terms of age, 26% of the RHP 6 population incl udes children under th e age of 18 years, while 12% of residents are age 65 years or olde r.

The coun ties with disproportionately higher senior populations include Comal, Kerr, Gillespie, and Kendall.4 Education The educational attainment of resident s within RHP 6 is consistent with the rest of the state. Nearly 20% of residents ages 25 years and olde r did not finish high school or obtai n a GED. The percent of residents finishing high school varies among counties by a range of 58% (Zaval a) to 91% (Kendall).5 Economics In 2010, the per capita income in RHP 6 was $35,989, compared to $38,609 statewide. Individual counties vary widely as evidenced by Zavala County's per capita income of $17,892 and Gillespie County's of $44,723.6 In 2010, the unemployment rate for RH P 6 was 7.4%, better than the stat e's rate of 8.2%. As expected, the unemployment rate is correlated with education and per capita income a nd again, varies widely by county. Zavala County had an unemployment rate of 15.6%, while Gillespie Count y had the lowest rate at 4.8%.7 In 2009, Some 380,000 residents, approximately 16% of the population, lived below the poverty line in RHP 6. Forty percent of those livi ng below poverty were children under the age of 18 years.

In addition, there were four psychiatric hospitals. RHP 6 had a total of 7,430 licensed acute care beds, 77% of which were staffed. Sixty-five percent of the 746 licensed psychiatric beds were staffed.13 In 2010, acute care gross patient re venue in the region totaled $13.7 bill ion.

The population change projections for 2015 vary widely by individual counties within RHP 6. The Hispanic population will experience the largest net growth of 106,000 residents. The Anglo population is expected to decrease by 2%. 17 According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, there are four contributing factors to Texas' projected population growth, which also apply to most of the counties in RHP 6. These include: 18 1. \"Natural growth\" (i.e. births minus deaths). Texas ha s the nation's second highest birth rate which has been attributed to a variety of de mographic, socio-economic, and cultural factors. Natural growth accounted for 55% of Te xas' population increase between 2010 and 2011. 2. Continued international migration given Texas' proximity to Me xico. International migration accounted for 18% of Texas' popula tion growth between 2010 and 2011. 3. Low cost of living due to supply of land and low housing prices. 4. Oil and gas industry . The recently developed Eagle Ford Shale significantly impacts RHP 6 \"producing counties\" including Atascosa, Dimmit, Frio, La as two \"periphe ral counties\" (Bexar, and Uval de) involved in non-production activity. The shale activity is projected to create nearly 117,000 full-time jobs by 2021.19 Insurance Coverage The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), were signed into law in March 2010, and, for the most part, upheld by the United States Supreme Court in June 2012. One intent of this law is to increase the accessibility and affordability of health coverage for currently uninsured individuals. This coverage will be available through subsidized insurance ex changes and, if Texas elects, the expansion of Medicaid up to 133% of the Federal Poverty Level. Te xas' current uninsured rate of 24% is projected to decrease to 15% in 2014 even if Texas chooses no t to expand Medicaid c overage.

Those remaini ng without coverage would include individuals eligible but electing not to enroll in Medicaid or subsidized programs, individuals not eligible for subsidized cove rage, and undocumented residents.20 RHP 6 expects this legislation to affect its uninsured population in a manner consiste nt with that of the entire state. Health Care Infrastructure and Environment With the rise of insured individuals, the demand on h ealth care infrastructure will also increase. One of the key aims of Texas' 1115 waiver is to \"improve a nd prepare the health care in frastructure to serve a newly insured population.\"21 This will require improved access to primary and mental health care, effective management of chronic disease, enhanced technology, and innovative payment mechanisms to promote high quality care and reduce the costs associated with that care. Key Health Challenges Health Care Quality According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's 2011 report, Te xas ranks last in the nation on health care quality. The report is base d on 155 quality measures which include disease prevention efforts, deaths from various conditions, cancer treatment, and how well health care providers manage chronic conditions such as diabetes. Unde r the category of \"Types of Care,\" Texas scored \"weak\" on preventive measures, acute care measures, a nd chronic care measures. Under the category of \"Care by Clinical Area,\" Texas scored \"weak\" on diab etes, heart disease, and respiratory measures, and \"average\" on cancer measures.22 The University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, funded by the Robert Woods Johnson Foundation, publishes an annual County Health Ranki ngs Report. The health outcomes rankings are based on equal weighting of mortality and morbidity measures. The health factors rankings shown in Table 3 are based on weighted scores of four types of factors: behavior al, clinical, social and economic, and environmental. Highest rankings (lowest number s) indicate better perfor mance. Of the 221 Texas counties reviewed, Kendall, Comal, and Gillespie pe rformed well, however Atascosa, Dimmit, Kerr, LaSalle, Real, Uvalde, Val Verde, and Zavala ranked in the lower half of all Texas counties. Kinney and McMullen counties we re not ranked in the report.23 20 Texas Health and Human Services.

Between 2005 and 2010, HHSC found that RHP 6 had 125,090 potentially preventable hospitalizations, about 8.5% of the entire state. The conditions studied include bacterial pneumoni a, dehydration, urinary tract infection, angina, congestive heart failure, hypertension, asthma, chronic obtrusive pulmonary disease, and diabetes. The hospitalizations are c onsidered \"potentially preventable\" because \"if the individual had access to and cooperated with appropriate outpatient health care, the hospitalization would likely not have occurred.\" These hospitalizations amounted to $2.9 billion in hospital charges, roughly $1,700 per adult living in the region's 20 counties. 24 A January 2012 Medicaid report found that, excluding newborns, the pot entially preventable readmissions rate in the Medicaid population was 3.7% overall, 0.8% for obstetrics, 4% for non-obstetric pediatrics a nd 8.4% for non-obstetric adult stays. 25 Health Care Provider Shortage and Access to Care Given the high number of counties in RHP 6 designated as HPSAs, this region, like the rest of the state, is in need of additional providers. Recent reports s how Texas ranking 45th in the nation in the number of physicians per capita. The state's grow ing population, increased longevity of its residents, vast expanses of rural and border areas, growing pr evalence of chronic diseases, gr eater availability of specialty services, and breakthroughs in medical science ar e all contributing to an accelerating demand for physicians.26 The shortage of providers is one reason many hospitals report high emergency room utilization. Not only is this an expensive way to de liver health care, but it also means that the i ndividuals accessing this care tend to receive less preventi ve care, less comprehensive care, and they often delay seeking treatment until the illness is advanced. Greater access to high quality care has been shown to result in improved health outcomes. 24 Potentially Preventable Hospitalizations by County.

The Te xas Department of State Health Services requires each authority to pla n, develop policy, coordinate, allocate and develop resources for mental health services in the local service area.27 A March 2011 report published by the Hogg Foundation for Mental Health and Methodist Healthcare Ministries warns the most severe health profession shortages are in mental he alth services, with Texas ranking far below the national averag e in number of mental health professionals per 100,000 residents. Less than 33% of the state's 48,700 practici ng doctors accept Medi caid patients. Nearly every county in RHP 6 is designated as a H PSA for mental health. Inadequate mental health services results in avoidable costs to hospita l and criminal and juvenile justice systems.28 Strategic planning sessions sponsored by the Bexar County Commissioners Court and Methodist Healthcare Ministries identified the following issues: Inadequate and fragmented continuum of care fo r children with behavioral health diagnoses Need for integrated behavioral health and primary care services Inadequate access to care mana gement and resource navigation Inadequate services for individuals who have been arrested or inca rcerated either as a result or precipitated by unmet beha vioral health needs Inadequate resources for special needs popul ations (e.g., homeless adults, sex offenders) including efficiencies such as integrated be havioral and primary care, pharmacy services, telemedicine, and physician extenders Inadequate outpatient care for adults with mode rate acuity behavioral health needs to support reductions in hospital readmissions and the in appropriate use of emergency departments 27 https://www.dshs.state.tx.us/mhsa/mh adultservices/ , accessed July 25, 2012. 28 http://www.hogg.utexas.edu/uploads/documen ts/Mental_Health_Crisis_final_032111.pdf , accessed July 25, 2012. 56 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 The FY 2010 Texas Medicaid Managed Care STAR Program Quality of Care Report found that among Medicaid members hospitalized for mental illness, only 45% had a follow-up visit within 7 days of discharge from the hospital, and 72 % had a follow-up visit within 30 days of discharge from the hospital. The STAR Program rate for mental health readmission within 30 days was 11%.29 Chronic Disease Cardiovascular disease, cancer, unintentional injuries, and diabetes top the list of causes of deat h in RHP 6. Of the 16,000 deaths in 2008, 60% were due to these potentially preventable causes. 30 Disease management and wellness programs are critical to reducing morbidity and mortality of these diseases. Maternal and Child Health Of the 36,000 live births in RHP 6 in 2008, only 59% of mothers received prenatal care within the first trimester. Six percent of births occurred to girls under 18 years of age and 44% of births were to unmarried mothers. Bexar County, which has the highest number of births in RHP 6, reports an adolescent (ages 13-17 years) pre gnancy rate of 30.6 per 1,000 women, compared to 26.1 for the state. This rate is even higher in nine other RHP 6 counties. Nine percent of babies were born with low birth weight. Prematurity and low birth we ight can contribute to long term health and economic costs to the family and society. For children, access to primary and preventive care is especially important. The FY 2010 Texas Medicaid Managed Care STAR Program Quality of Ca re Report provides the following statistics on utilization of preventive care serv ices for the Bexar Service Area: 31 Sixty-five percent of STAR members who turn ed 15 months old during the measurement year had six or more well-child visits with a physic ian provider during their first 15 months of life Less than 80% of children in their 3rd, 4th, or 5th year of life had at least one well-child visit Less than 62% of adolescents ha d at least one well-care visit. 29 and Human Services Commission.

The diabetes rate in Bexar County is 10% and more than double among African Americans (14%) and Hispanics (13%), compared to Whites (6%). Foster social change and strengthen positive behaviors around healthy eating and active living to ensure access to nutritious foods and build environments that enable all residents to make healthy choices and lead healthy lives. Healthy Child and Family Development More than 25% of pregnant women in Bexar County received late or no prenatal care. 9.4% of Bexar County babies are born with low birth weight. 57% of Bexar County Head Start participants reported to have dental caries Make pregnancy and early childhood the focus of system level changes that support healthy child and family development. Safe Communities Unintentional injuries were responsible for 74 hospitalizations per 10,000 people in 2008, in Bexar County Unintentional injuries were responsible for almost 478 years of potential life lost from age 65 in Bexar County in 2008. Motor vehicle accidents were one of the leading causes of death in Bexar County in 2008 for adults and children. Develop safe neighborhoods by identifying what woks locally, planning how to replicate successes in our neighborhoods, and enhancing systems that respond effectively to community- identified safety needs. Behavioral Health and Mental Well- Being About 6 people per 1,000 are hospitalized for mental disorders every year in Bexar County About 1 person in 10,000 dies every year in Bexar County due to suicide, adjusted for age.

This underscores the importance of safety net providers and helps explain why the issues described above of are particular relevance to RHP 6. The residents of these counties tend to be older and less e ducated, experience lower per capita income and more poverty than the regi on as a whole, further compounding the challenges faced here. Conclusion RHP 6 represents a vast geographi c area of both rural and urban commu nities where rates of insurance coverage are low and poor health outcomes are common. Continued popul ation growth is expected to exacerbate current health challenges, including li mited access to primary and specialty care, unmet mental and behavioral health needs, prevalence of chronic disease, and poor maternal and child outcomes. Near-term decisions, incl uding potential Medicaid expansion and the prevalence of the use of health insurance exchanges, could ha ve significant impact on the health status of residents and outcomes of RHP 6 initiatives. The opportunity to implemen t transformative projects through the 1115 waiver funding will help RHP 6 address the needs of this community. Summary of Community Needs University Health System, the RHP 6 Anchor, c onducted the community needs assessment with input from the Performing Providers and other stakeholde rs. Demographic, insurance, and health care infrastructure data were collected from HHSC an d United States Census resources and compiled for each county in the region. Hospital, university, health department, and community mental health center leaders reviewed and validated these data and pr ovided comment on anticipated changes to these measures throughout the waiver period. These leaders and other stakeholders al so provided specific information on initiatives funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and health care needs specific to their local co mmunities. The draft community needs assessment was posted to our dedicated RHP 6 Web site (www.TexasRHP6.com) to allow public review and comment. These contributions from the public and our partners, in c onjunction with a variety of data sources available via the internet, provided the content for this needs assessment. The following table summarizes the needs that exist throughout the region.

RHP Participants Engagement Providers within RHP 6 have been actively enga ged in 1115 waiver activiti es since before it was approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. University Health System's President and Chief Executive Officer, George B. Hernandez, pa rticipates in HHSC's Executive Waiver Committee which began in June 2011. Mr. Hernandez continue d to be in regular communication with public hospitals around the state and loca l private hospitals in and around Bexar Count y. Industry groups such as Teaching Hospitals of Texas (THOT), Texas Organization of Rural and Community Hospitals (TORCH), the Texas Hospital Association (THA), the Texas Medical Associ ation (TMA), and the Texas Council of Community Health Centers, served to educate their members regarding 1115 waiver developments. In February 2012, HHSC created a Clinical Champion's Workgroup. Me etings and conference calls were held between February and May 2012. RHP 6 was represented by the following physicians who contributed to the development of the RHP Planning Protocol. Dr. Bryan Alsip, Chief Medical Offi cer, University Health System Dr. Barbara Turner, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio Dr. John Holcomb, Texas Medical Association Dr. Jim Martin, CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health System Dr. Jan Patterson, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio During the month of February 2012, University Health System c ontacted hospital CEOs and county judges in the proposed region and adjacent areas to provide education about the 1115 waiver and gauge interest in participating with Bexar County. Based the feedback co llected from these conversations, University Health System subm itted the preliminary RHP Regions Survey to HHSC on February 24, 2012. On March 21, University Health System hosted a re gional stakeholder meeting with HHSC. University Health System mailed letters to hospital CEOs, co unty judges, and county comm issioners inviting them to attend. During the meeting, Stanle y Stewart provided an overview of the waiver. The meeting was attended by 57 individuals. Following the stakeholder meeting, and as HHSC fina lized the geography of Region 6, numerous phone conversations and meetings began taking place. Perf orming Providers began networking with University Health System and each other, sharing information with their boards and stakeholders, and discussing new opportunities to transf orm healthcare with entitie s they might not have worked with previously. A list of these meetings is included in Addendum A. As the Anchor, University Health System led effo rts to inform RHP participants and stakeholders regarding the 1115 Waiver thr ough its dedicated Web site: www.TexasRHP6com , which was launched 62 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 May 1, 2012. This site has served both to educate and inform as well as to receive input into the RHP 6 plan and DSRIP projects. A secure portal within the Web site allows Performing Providers to submit their RHP organization informati on, contribute to development of the community needs assessment, propose initial plans for DSRIP projects, and provide examples of stakeholder engagement from their communities. Further, University Health System hosted two meetings with other anchoring ent ities - El Paso Hospital District and University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler - to share anchor processes, best practices and lessons learned. Univer sity Health System's CEO gave a waiver presentation to the Ector County Hospital District (Region 14) . University Health System also shared its RHP 6's valuation methodology with Regions 12 and 18. Given the large number and value of projects propos ed for our region, University Health System will promote and facilitate learning co llaboratives through the remaining fo ur years of the demonstration program. Following completion of the RHP Plan, Universi ty Health System will f acilitate the formation of working groups of performing providers who are pursuing similar projects. These working groups will develop their learning collaborative st ructure which may include the following: Identify participants Establish Learning Co llaborative goals Develop a calendar of regular meetings, site visits, and/or conference calls Develop a plan to communicate ideas, da ta, and successes across the region and state Organize a learning event and inv ite experts and other Performi ng Providers from outside the region to share knowledg e and best practices Adopt metrics to measure success University Health System will seek to provide facilitation and administrative assistance as needed to ensure the success of these endeavors. The RHP 6 website will be available to the Learning Collaboratives to network and shar e ideas, challenges, and success stor ies with colleagues. RHP 6 hopes to make significant transformational progress on its pr oject milestones to achieve waiver goals and share what we learn with th e rest of the State. Additionally, University Health Syst em plans to provide support to RH P 6 participants in meeting semi- annual reporting requirements. University Health Sy stem has contracted with Performance Logic, a vendor that hosts a web-based project manageme nt tool. Previously implemented by hospitals participating in the California Medicaid waiver, the tool includes a module speci ally designed to manage the categories, milestones, measures, values, and Inte rgovernmental transfer (IG T) contributions unique to DSRIP projects. 63 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 B. Public Engagement The dedicated Web site has proven to be a robust tool for communicating with partners and stakeholders in our region. Screen shots of the website ar e included in Addendum B. As of December 18, 1,653 unique individuals have vi sited the website, creating a total of 17,912 page views. The average visitor spends nearly five minutes viewing the site. The site includes an overvie w of the 1115 waiver, news updates, state waiver resources, and provides the opportunity for vi sitors to submit comments, ask questions, and sign up to receive emails. Over 170 vi sitors have submitted their email addresses. Using this database, University Health System has emailed numerous updates about how RHP 6 is participating in the 1115 waiver. Examples of th ese communications are in cluded in Addendum C. University Health System leaders have met and/or held conference cal ls with numerous stakeholders and local businesses interested in participating in the waiver. Examples include: Federally Qualified Health Centers Home health agencies Information Technology vendors County and city officials Indigent care coordinators Advocacy groups Healthcare Access San Antonio In addition, University Health Syst em leaders served as invited guest speakers at meetings of the following organizations: Teaching Hospitals of Texas (March 30, 2012) Bexar County Medical Society (May 23, 2102) Alamo Area Council of Governments (June 27, 2012) The Health Collaborative Board of Directors (August 2, 2012) Methodist Healthcare Ministries (December 3 and December 4, 2012) All but one Performing Provider eligible for a Pass 1 allocation are participating in the DSRIP incentive program. South Texas Regional Medical Center will pa rticipate in the Uncompensated Care Pool only. On October 25, 2012, University Health System a nnounced its upcoming public meeting scheduled for November 7, 2012. The announcement was emailed to stakeholders, posted on the Web site, and communicated publicly via a press release on November 2, 2012. A draf t of the RHP Plan (including Pass 1 projects) was posted to the website on Novemb er 6, 2012. Stakeholders were invited to submit comments electronically and/or in pe rson at the public meeting. The public meeting was attended by 55 individuals representing 35 organizations. The official public co mment period for Pass 1 of the RHP Plan was November 6 through November 9, 2012. University Health System hoste d a webinar on December 13, 2012, to update stakeholders on the RHP Plan. The meeting was announced November 30, 2012, through email and on the Web site. An updated 64 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 draft of the RHP Plan was posted December 11, 2012. Th e official public comment period for the Final RHP Plan was December 11 through December 14, 2012. Since its launch, the TexasRHP6.com website has included a \"Comments and Feedback\" tool which allows all stakeholders to submit questions and feedb ack to the anchor at any time. University Health System will continue to update and engage stakeholders using the dedi cated website and emails targeted to stakeholders who provide email addresses. Ad ditional public meetings w ill be held as needed. 65 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Section V. DSRIP Projects A. RHP Plan Development RHP 6 is assigned to Tier 2 for the 1115 Medicaid Waiver. According to the Program Financing and Mechanics Protocol, Tier 2 regions contain at least 7 percent and less than 15 percent share of the statewide population under 200 percen t Federal Poverty Level as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau: 2006-2010 American Community Survey (ACS) for Texa s. As a Tier 2 region, RHP 6 must select a minimum of 12 projects from Categories 1 and 2 combin ed, with at least 6 of the 12 projects selected from Category 2. RHP 6 has identified 79 projects in Pass 1, 36 projects in Pass 2, and five projects in the Anchor Pass (Pass 3) for a total of 120 projects . Due to the size of our region, RH P 6 implemented Pass 1 and 2 using a decentralized approach. Performing Providers were en couraged to identify projects that were most appropriate for their service areas. In most cases, the services areas included the county where the provider is based. The Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs) are unique because their service areas span multiple counties, and in some cases , regions. This provided an opportunity for new networking and collaboration to occur that had not existed previously. Many hospital providers collaborated with their county indi gent care programs, Federally Qua lified Health Centers (FQHCs) and other provider practices and stakehol ders in developing projects best su ited to meet the needs of their residents. In Bexar County, numerous meetings were held between University Health System, The Center for Health Care Services, private hospital providers , and other stakeholders to discuss potential projects, make selections, and ensure projects were not duplicative. The process for submitting projects was iterative and began July 9, 2012, when University Health System first requested submission of projects. This occurred earl y in the development of the RHP Planning Protocol, which was ultimately finali zed and approved on October 1, 2012. This early submission, and those that followed, provided opportunities for regional partners to become familiar with the type of projects eligible for incentives and to share ideas with one a nother. University Health System made a sequence of updates to the project narrative templates as we received new information from HHSC and revisions to the RHP Plan template and protocols. Final Pass 1 narratives and electronic workbooks were due October 26, which provided time for University Health System to conduct an administrative review of proposed projects and provide feedback to performing Providers to ensure the formats and content were in compliance with Waiver protocols. As Performing Providers submitted their project proposal s, University Health Sy stem compiled matrices to share project information with regional partners a nd encouraged them to network with each other as appropriate. University Health Syst em also reviewed the proposed va luations of similar projects across the region and assessed these for consistency. A comple te list of projects cons idered, including those not submitted in the RHP Plan ar e listed in Addendum D. 66 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Health System, with input from Pe rforming Providers, compiled the community needs assessment and posted the document on our RHP 6 Website on August 28, 2012. Each county varies in terms of its demographics, socioeconomics, and curre nt health care infrastruc ture, but nearly every county in RHP 6 is designated as a Health Provid er Shortage Area (HPSA) for primary care mental health and/or dental care. As a result, the counties within RHP 6 face similar community needs and health challenges. RHP 6 seeks to improve quality and patient satisfaction. A high prevalence of chronic disease and related health disparities requi re greater prevention efforts and improved management of patients with chronic conditions. Lead ing causes of death in RHP 6 include cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. Many residents of RHP 6 lack acces s to medical and dental care due to high rates of uninsurance and health care pr ovider shortages. There is a shortage of high quality mental and behavioral health se rvices that are integrated with physical health care services and/ or provide crisis stabilization. Lack of interconceptional and prenatal care for women and primary and prev entive pediatric care results in poor maternal and child health outcomes. High rates of communicable diseas e and potential for vaccine prev entable diseases due to low vaccine coverage levels in the community. The 20 counties are committed to working together to make significant progress over the next five years toward addressing our community needs, expand ing access to care, and achieving the specific triple aim goals of assuring patients receive high-quality, pati ent-centered care, in the most cost-effective ways. RHP 6 also strives to leverage local and federa l waiver financing to: Further develop and maintain a c oordinated care delivery system Improve outcomes while containing cost growth Improve and prepare the health care infrastr ucture to serve a newly insured population On September 6, University Health System propos ed a methodology for Performi ng Providers to use in evaluating, prioritizing, and selectin g their projects. Many providers re ported that this methodology was helpful, and two other regions (12 and 18) requested permission to use it as well. While RHP 6 did not require Providers to use this methodology, many di d submit projects that scored highest on the evaluation criteria. Each Performing Provider was given a custom templa te containing their Pass 1 allocation spread across all four categories per th e PFM Protocol. University Health Sy stem also included a recommended range for the number of Category 1 and/or Category 2 pr ojects anticipated from each Performing Provider 67 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 based on HHSC's allocation, maximum project value, and provider size. Using the template, Performing Providers were asked to list and br iefly describe each proposed projec t, and then scored the project(s) using the criteria below: Criteria Description Achieves Waiver Goals Scale: 1 to 5 1=Minimal impact on waiver goals 5=Greatest impact on all waiver goals Relative to your other proposed projects, to what extent does this project achieve the following waiver goals: Triple Aim: assuring patients receive highquality and patientcentered care, in the most cost effective ways Improve the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of our counties Further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system Improve outcomes while containing cost growth Performing Providers may consider the following attributes when scoring projects on this domain: Will the project impact one or more of the goals? Does the project primarily impact Medicaid and/or uninsured residents? How significant is the expected impact? To what extent will it \"move the dial\"? Is there strong evidence, as shown by literature review, best practices, and/or past experience, that the proposed project will be effective in its impact? Addresses Community Need(s) Scale: 1 to 5 1=Minimal impact on community need(s) 5=Greatest impact on community need(s) Relative to your other proposed projects, to what extent does this project address community needs? Performing Providers are advised to reference the draft RHP Community Needs Assessment, available at http://www.texasrhp6.com/rhp plan/ . Performing Providers may consider the following attributes when scoring projects on this domain: Will the project address one or more community needs? How significant is the expected impact? To what extent will it \"move the dial\"? Is there strong evidence, as shown by literature review, best practices, and/or past experience, that the proposed project will be effective in its impact? Project Scope Scale: 1 to 5 1=Small numbers/percent of population impacted 5=Large numbers/percent of population impacted Relative to your other proposed projects, how \"big\" is this project? Performing Providers should consider targeted improvements/increases in: Outreach to the targeted population Patient visits/encounters Providers recruited/trained Savings estimated from avoiding/preventing unnecessary ER visits or hospitalizations 68 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Project Investment Scale: 1 to 5 1=Small investment required 5=Large investment required Relative to your other proposed projects, how large isthe expected investment to successfully implement this project and achieve milestones and metrics? Performing Providers should consider: Human resources Equipment purchase and maintenance Legal and professional fees Time to implement Risk assessment Organizational priorities The Delivery System Reform Incentive Program (DSR IP) projects proposed in this plan address the needs of the broader community. Projects span the breadth of o pportunities presented in the RHP Planning Protocol. Projects incl ude expanding medical homes and pr imary care, increasing access to specialists, implementing technology to perform te lemedicine and manage patient registries, and numerous other initiatives. The projec ts differ in size, scope, and targ eted population, but each is geared to achieve specific outcome measures and population-focused improvements. The table below lists the Performing Providers who are exempt from Category 4 reporting according to the criteria in paragraph 11.e. in the Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol.

Project Valuation As described above, University Health System reco mmended Performing Provide rs use four criteria to value DSRIP projects, specifically: 1. To what extent does it achieve waiver goals? 2. To what extent does it address community needs? 3. What is the project scope? 4. What is the project investment? For each proposed project, the scores across each of the criteria in the proposed methodology were summed to produce a total score, called the Value Wei ght of Project. Using this assessment, Performing Providers were able to value projects for submissi on to the RHP Plan. The template calculated initial project values for the selected projects based on the Performing Pr ovider's allocation of funding and project scores, as shown in the example below: Total DSRIP Project Description Value Weight of Project Value DY 2 DY 3 DY 4 DY 5 Total Open a schoolbased clinic at Waiver Elementary School 18 $255,000 $480,000 $675,000 $1,0260,000 $2,436,000 Implement $170,000 $320,000 $450,000 $684,000 $1,624,000 $575,000 Performing Providers were advised that they may n eed to adjust the number of projects and/or the project values upon consideration of such factors as availability of local matching funds (IGT) and consistency of project valuations across the region. Category 3 meas ures were often valued using a similar distribution. Many providers also conducted more detailed va luations for their projects by assessing the anticipated investme nts and community benefit, part icularly savings resulting from avoiding unnecessary healthcare costs. The likelihood that a proj ect would reduce morbidity and mortality was also factored into the valuation of many projects. Furt her, the Community Mental Health Centers worked together with thei r industry association to engage a health economist in valuing their projects. This was important since many of thei r projects cross regiona l boundaries and these organizations placed great emphasis on en suring consistency throughout the state. 70 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Project valuations do range significan tly within our region. This is attrib uted to the diversity of providers and markets they serve. Given that 75% of the region's population lives in Bexar County, it was not surprising that the project valua tions for Bexar County providers w ould be valued much higher than similar projects for smaller hospi tals in rural counties. DSRIP Projects narratives and tables a re included on the following pages: Category 1: Infrastruc ture Development ........................................................................................ ......... 71 Infrastructure development projects lay the founda tion for delivery system transformation through investments in technology, tool s, and human resources. Perfor ming Providers participating in Category 1 projects may include ho spitals, community mental health centers (CMHCs), local health departments, physician practices affiliated with ac ademic science health centers, and physician practices not affiliated with academic health science centers, as defined in Section II of Attachment J (Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol). Category 2: Program I nnovation and Redesign ................................................................................... .. 615 Program Innovation and Redesign projects emphasi ze the piloting, testing, and replicating of innovative care models. Perfor ming Providers participating in Category 2 projects may include hospitals, community mental health centers, local health departme nts, physician practices affiliated with academic science health ce nters and physician practices not affiliated with academic health science centers, as defined in Section II of Attachment J (Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol). Category 3: Quality Improvements .............................................................................................. ........ 1070 The goal of Category 3 is to assess an outcome of a project implemented unde r Category 1 or 2. As described in the Program Funding and Mechanics Prot ocol, each Category 1 and 2 project is required to have an associated Category 3 outcome measure. Category 4: Population-Focused Im provements (Hospitals Only) ...................................................... 1591 Population-focused improvements are \"pay for re porting\" measures reported by hospitals that demonstrate the impact of delivery system reform investments made under the demonstration. With limited exceptions, all hospital Performing Provi ders shall report on a ll Category 4 population- focused improvement measures desc ribed in Attachment I: RHP Pl anning Protocol and categorized in six domains: Domain 1: Potentially Preventable Admissions Domain 2: Potentially Preven table Readmissions - 30 days Domain 3: Potentially Preventable Complications Domain 4: Patient-Centered Healthcare Domain 5: Emergency Department Optional Domain 6: Children and Adult Core Measures 71 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Baptist Health System C. Category 1: Infrastructure Development Identifying Project and Provider Information: Title: 1.1.1 Establish more primary care c linics: Expand Primary Care Capacity Unique RHP ID#: 159156201.1.1 - PASS 1 Performing Provider: VHS San Antonio Part ners, LLC d/b/a Baptist Health System Performing Provider TPI: 159156201 Project Summary: Provider Description : Baptist Health System includes five acute- (Baptist Me dical Center (623 beds), Mission Trail Baptist Ho spital (110 beds), North Centra l Baptist Hospital (280 beds), Northeast Baptist Hospital (379 beds), and St. Luke's Baptist Hospital (282 beds)) which offer 1,674 licensed beds. In 2011, Baptist Health Syst em was recognized by U.S. News and World Report for earning more, high performing specialty ra nkings (5) than any other health system in the San Antonio metropolitan area. All five hosp itals have earned Accred ited Chest Pain Center designation, as well as Primary Stroke Center Ce rtification. Medicare ha s designated each as Texas' only Medicare Value Based Care Centers. The system also includes Baptist Regional Children's Center, Baptist Breast Center, HealthLink wellness and fitness center, Baptist M&S Imaging Centers, community health and wellnes s programs, ambulatory services, rehabilitation services, air medical transport, School of Health Professions, and other health-related services and affiliations. It is part of the Nashvill e, Tennessee-based Vanguard Health Systems. Intervention(s) : This project will establish additional pr imary care locations in Bexar County and add incremental primary care providers thus incr easing the number of patients receiving timely primary care services in Bexar County for both acute illness and chronic disease management. Need for the project : There is a shortage of primary care providers in Baptist Health System's primary service area. Per the 2011 Carnahan repor t there was a need for 413 additional Primary care providers in our five sites' service areas. The prevalence of chronic disease in RHP 6 as demonstrated in the Community Needs Assessment, particularly diabetes and CHF, is further complicated by a shortage of pr oviders, high % of uninsured maki ng Texas last in the nation in health care quality. Target population : Bexar County residents needing a prim ary care provider. The shortage of healthcare providers in RHP6 is further complicated by almost half a million uninsured residents (471,000 in 2009). The uninsured and those with Medicaid are the most underserved as many physician practices do not take these patients. Al l of our primary care sites accept uninsured and Medicaid patients. Our sites c over the northeast, north central , west, downtown and southeast county. We are locating new pr oviders adjacent to new frees tanding ED locations (> 20% uninsured) which will provide a draw and refe rral potential so patients will know where new providers are and days/hours of service. BHS is also targeting a large downtown location and south Bexar County which is the most underser ved, highest uninsured or Medicaid related patient population. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : Provide incremental primary care visits ranging from a minimum of 5,433 additional visits in DY 2 to a minimum of 16,300 additional visits by DY5. Our clinics and sites all accept Medicaid plans and self pay patients. Potential indigent population target ed through this expansion is incremental primary care visits approximating: 72 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Baptist Health System DY 2 + 851 DY 3 + 6399 DY 4 + 8495 DY 5 + 8753 TOTAL = 24,899 or 53% of in cremental visits projected. Category 3 outcomes: Diabetes Care: HbA1c poor control (<9%). Project Description: Baptist Health System (BHS / Baptist) will improve primary care access for our community through Baptist Managed Servi ce Organization (MSO) and supporting our hospitals with recruitment/relocation of provide rs targeting underserved areas by establishing more primary care clinics and providers in creasing number of primary care visits year over year. The goals of this project will be to increase access to primary care providers by (1) adding additional primary care offices (2) adding additional physician providers and (3) otherwise increase av ailability and choice for our community to manage their health in an appropriate setting using a primary care provider. This project allows San Antonio/ RHP6 to develop a more robust primary care delivery platform. By increasing provider availabi lity, those needing primary car e can develop medical home relationships and improve preventive and health maintenance care. With expanded access to primary care, patients will have improved diseas e prevention, improved management of chronic conditions and regular follow up care which can intervene and prevent worsening conditions. This will not only reduce the use of the ER fo r primary care but will improve population health particularly related to the chronic diseases th at are prevalent in RHP6 such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. There are multiple challenges to this issue including: identifi cation and engagement of those in need, provide resources for initiatives, identificati on and incentivization of pr oviders to serve this population, and the members of this population ta king ownership for their own health needs. This project will seek to recr uit and incentivize primary care physicians and provide automated tools to track, monitor and improve chronic di sease management of our MSO patient population- as an example, BHS will also provide our MSO physicians with valuable tools such as Crimson for monitoring and improving our performance in managing the health of our patients. The five year expected outcome is that by increasing primary ca re sites and providers, Baptist will meet community/population needs of improvi ng access to primary care. Disease prevention will be increased by improved access to care and chronic conditions will be better managed by regular primary care and early interventions. These outcomes will be achieved by accomplishing the project goals noted above. This project meets the RH P Regional Goals : Triple Aim: assuring patients receive high-quality , patient-centered care, in the most cost effective ways Improve the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of our counties 73 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Baptist Health System Further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system Improve outcomes while containing cost growth This project meets the following RHP identified Community needs : CN.1 Texas ranks last in the nation on health care quality CN.2 A higher prevalence of chronic disease an d related health dispar ities require greater prevention efforts and improved management of patients with chronic conditions. CN.3 Many residents of RHP 6 lack access to medical and dental care due to high rates of uninsured combined with health care provider shortages. Through BHS Operational Improvement Office, BHS staff will use P-3 Quality Improvement Milestone to further enhance the Process Impr ovement (PI) impact on improving care, quality and cost for our patients. Starting Point/Baseline: BHS MSO had 54,334 patient visits in existing 11 Primary Care Sites for Calendar year ending 12-31-11 which will be the baseline. Adding new loca tions and/or providers will increase patient access and number of patient visits beginning 1-1-2012. We will track both the # of new locations opene d after 1-1-2012 and the incremental patient visits/encounters performed annually in suppor ted Primary Care locations and will report increased visits > 54,334. Rationale: The reason for selecting this project is that currently Baptist hos pitals' service areas have a demonstrated need for Primary Care Provide rs of BMC = 114, MTB = 136, NEB = 152 and SLB = 11 or a total for the BHS market of 413 Primar y Care providers per the 2011 Carnahan Report. BHS will recruit/employ/ relocate Primary Care providers to serve Bexar County needs by expanding primary care physicians in these key geographical areas. This project is aligned wi th the Triple AIM Goals : Increases access for all patients includ ing Medicaid and uninsured patients Increasing access to physicians and special ists improves patient outcomes through chronic disease management and earli er intervention for acute conditions Eliminates inappropriate and costly use of Emergency Room visits This project also aligns with th e RHP 6 Community Needs Assessment by improving access, outreach and care for the areas' underserved and chronically diseased patient population. RHP 6 is expected to have 6% population gr owth with Bexar County up to 15% growth between 2010- 2015; and Texas ranks 45th in the nation in # of physicians per capita. Increasing access improves disease prevention, patient outcomes thr ough chronic disease management and earlier interv ention for acute conditions Eliminates inappropriate and costly use of Emergency Room visits This project certainly is in accord with na tional initiatives such as Accountable Care organizations. This project meets Community needs CN.1, CN.2, CN.3 as not ed in the narrative section above. 74 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Baptist Health System Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): Texas ranks last in the nation in healthcare qua lity and weak in quality of diabetes care. The diabetes rate in Bexar Count y is 10% overall and the rate of diabetes for African Americans and Hispanic is more than double the rate Whites. BHS primary care sites have selected Category 3 Project outcome measure: IT-1.10 Diabetes Care: HbA1c poor contro 0059 Stand Alone Measure Baptist MSO new location employed primary care prac titioners will reduce ye ar over year the % of their patient practice meeting the id entified criteria with an HbA1c > 9%. Relationship to other Projects: This project would have the added advantage of developing/preparing st aff for the medical home concept : Category 2 : Project Area 2.1 Enhance/Expand Medical Homes Category 2 : Project Area 2.3 Redesign Primary Care Category 2: Project Area 2.11 Conduct Medication Management Expanding access to Primary Care practitioners in our underserved areas also supports the patient population focused improvements in Category 4 : Population Focused Measures RD-1 Potentially Preventable Admissions 1. Congestive Heart Failure Admission rate 2. Diabetes Admission rate 4. Chronic Obstructive Pulm onary Disease Admission rate 5. Bacterial Pneumonia immunization RD-2 30 day readmissions 1. Congestive Heart Failure Admission rate 2. Diabetes Admission rate 4. Chronic Obstructive Pulm onary Disease Admission rate 5. Stroke Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: CHRISTUS facilities, University Health System, and Baptist have all iden tified the expansion of Primary care as a Category 1 Project and there is demonstrated need for all efforts as evidenced by the need for 413 more primary care providers ju st in Baptist hospital primary service areas. Plan for Learning Collaborative: Following completion of the RHP plan, University Health System (anchor) will facilitate the formation of working groups of performing provi ders who are pursuing similar projects. These working groups will develop their learning co llaborative structure which may include goals, regular meetings, site visits , conference calls, communication plan development, organizing learning event, and adopt metrics to measure success. 75 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Baptist Health System Project Valuation: Baptist values each project based on the specific needs of the communit y, the projected impact on the health outcomes of the community, the leve l of advancement to the healthcare delivery system, and the time, effort, and clinical resources necessary to implement each project. In valuing this project, Baptist took into account the extent to which the expansion of primary care would potentially meet the goals of the Wa iver (support the development of a coordinated care delivery system, improve outcomes while containing costs, improve the healthcare infrastructure), the extent to which it will ad dress the community needs, the population served, and resources and cost necessary to implement the project. The expansion of primary care clin ics addresses a substantial, co mmunity need to increase access to primary care while advancing the Waiver goa l of improving outcomes while curbing the risk of healthcare costs. Primary care is one of the most cost effective methods to increase health outcomes. 76 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Baptist Health System 159156201.1.1 PASS 1 1.1.1 N/A 1.1.1 ESTABLISH MORE PRIMARY CARE CLINICS : EXPAND PRIMARY CARE CAPACITY VHS San Antonio Partners, LLC d/b/ a Baptist Health System TPI - 159156201 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 159156201.3.1 Care : HbA1c poor c ontrol 0059 Stand Alone Measure Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P-1] Establish additional /expand existing/ relocate primary care clinics Metric 1 [P-1.1]: [# of additional clinics or expanded hours or space] Baseline/Goal: # Primary Care Clinics 1/1/2012 with Goal of adding a minimum of two new locations by 9/30/2013 Data Source: BHS Financial Records- #/location of distinct clinics in operation Milestone 1 Estimate Incentive Payment: $1,350,539 Milestone 2 Milestone 3 [P-1] Establish additional/expand existing/relocate primary care clinics Metric 1 [P-5.1]: [Documentation of increased providers & staff and/or clinic sites] Baseline/Goal: Add minimum of one additional location by 9/30/14 Data Source: BHS Financial Records- #/location of distinct clinics in operation Milestone 3 Estimated Incentive Payment: $1,473,366 Milestone 4 [I-12] Increase primary care Milestone 5 [I-12]: Increase primary care clinic volume of visits and evidence of improved access for patients seeking services .

In 2011, Baptist Health System was recogni zed by U.S. News and World Report for earning more, high performing specialty ra nkings (5) than any other hea lth system in the San Antonio metropolitan area. All five hospitals have earned Accr edited Chest Pain Center designation, as well as Primary Stroke Center Certification. Medicare has designated each as Texas' only Medicare Value Based Care Centers. The system also includes Ba ptist Regional Children's Center, Baptist Breast Center, HealthLink wellness and fitness center, Bap tist M&S Imaging Centers, community health and wellness programs, ambulatory services, rehabilita tion services, air medical transport, School of Health Professions, and other health -related services and affiliations . It is part of the Nashville, Tennessee-based Vanguard Health Systems. Intervention(s) : This project establishes additional specia lty care locations and providers in Bexar County increasing patient access for timely, specialty care services for acute and chronic disease management. Need for the project : There is a shortage of specialty care providers in Baptist Health System's primary service area. For example, per the 2011 Carnahan report there was a need for +108 new cardiac care providers, +79 psychi atrists, and +301 additional pr oviders for pediatric related specialties. The prevalence of chronic disease in RHP 6 as de monstrated in the Community Needs Assessment, particularly diabetes and CHF, is further compli cated by shortage of providers, high % of uninsured making Texas last in the nation in health care qua lity. The CNA also identifies a shortage of high quality mental and behavioral heal th services and a lack of inter-c onceptional and prenatal care for women and primary and preventive pe diatric care results in poor mate rnal and child health outcomes. Target population : Bexar County residents needing improve d access to specialty care in cardiac disease, psychiatry, maternal/infant health and other targeted specialties including hospitalists who are trained to manage acute hospital conditions using Evidence Based Medicine and improving quality of care while reducing costs and LOS. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : Provide incremental specialty care visits ranging from a minimum of 9,359 additional visits in DY 2 to a minimum of 46,794 additio nal visits by DY5. All supported clinics and sites all accept Medi caid plans and self pay patients. Potential indigent population targeted with expa nsion is incremental specialty of incr emental visits projected. Category 3 outcomes: Congestive Heart Failure 30 day readmission rate 79 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Baptist Health System Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) 30 day readmission rate Project Description: Baptist Health System will improve care access for our community population by increasing access to specialty care providers. The goals of this project will be to increase access to specialty care providers by (1) adding additional specialty care offices/clinics (2) adding additional physician providers and (3) otherwise increase av ailability and choice for our community to manage their health in an appropriate setting when accessing a specialty care provider. Through Baptist Managed Service Organization Clinics and supporting our hospitals with recruitment/relocation of providers targeting underserved areas, Ba ptist will continue to recruit specialists to meet the critical access shortages in Bexar County. This project will allow San Antonio to augment our primary care delivery platform by increasing specialists that (1) meet the s hortage needs of our area particul arly for the underinsured and (2) increase provider availability to shorten time to treatment for both prev alent acute and chronic conditions, while expanding access to preventive and health maintenance care. With expanded access overall, health will be improved and cost of health care reduced. This will also reduce the use of the ER and will improve population health particularly rela ted to the chronic diseases that are high need in RHP6- including diabetes and cardiac disease. There are multiple challenges to this issue including: identifica tion and engagement of those in need, resourcing of initiatives, identification and incentivi zation of providers to serve this population, and the members of this population taking ownership for their own health needs. BHS will meet these challenges by recruiting speciali sts dedicated to improving the care provided to our RHP population and to their specific needs where specialty care is severely needed. BHS will also provide our MSO physicians with valuable tools such as Crimson for monitoring and improving our performance in managing the health of our patients. The five year expected outcome is that by increasing specialty care sites and providers, Baptist will meet community/population needs of improving access to specialty care especia lly in cardiac disease, behavioral health and maternal/p ediatric health. Disease preven tion will be increased by improved access to care and both acute and chronic conditi ons will be better managed, when indicated, by improved access to specialists and early interventions. These outcomes will be achieved by accomplishing the project goals noted above. This project meets the RH P Regional Goals : Triple Aim: assuring patients receive high-quality , patient-centered care, in the most cost effective ways Improve the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of our counties Further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system Improve outcomes while containing cost growth 80 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Baptist Health System RHP 6 Community Needs assessment shows that Texa s scored \"weak\" on clinical care areas of diabetes, heart disease and respiratory measures . We will recruit cardiology specialties and neurosciences specialties as two cri tical examples. These actions meet both \"triple Aim\" goals as well as match our Community Needs. The Community Needs Assessment also shows that Texas ranks far below the national average in number of mental health profe ssionals per 100,000 residents. Al most every county in RHPA is designated as a HPSA for mental health. Bapt ist will recruit additional psychiatrists including psychiatric hospitalists. RHP 6 Needs also focus on Maternal and Child Health issues and Baptist will recruit and or expand access to medical providers for these specialty areas. In summary, this project meets the following RHP identified Community Need Goals : CN.1 Texas ranks last in the nation on health care quality CN.2 A higher prevalence of chronic disease and rela ted health disparities re quire greater prevention efforts and improved management of patients with chronic conditions. CN.3 Many residents of RHP 6 lack access to medical and dental care due to high rates of uninsurance and hea lth care provider shortages. CN.4 There is a shortage of high quality mental and be havioral health services that are integrated with physical health care services and/ or provide crisis stabilization. CN.5 Lack of inter-conceptional an d prenatal care for women and primary and preventive pediatric care results in poor maternal and child health outcomes. In the implementation of this pr oject, Baptist will endeavor fo r continuous quality improvement by monitoring the patient volumes and pa tient utilization to ensure that progress is being made towards meeting the project milestones. A dditionally, Baptist will ensure that all MSO specialty clinics make ongoing efforts to meet or exceed all nationally r ecognized protocol or quality benchmarks for specialty care providers. Through BHS Operational improvement Office, BHS staff will use P-3 Quality Improvement Milestone to further enhance the PI impact on im proving care, quality and cost for our patients. Starting Point/Baseline: BHS MSO had 92,590 patient visits in existing 20 Specialty Care Sites for Calendar year ending 12- 31-11 which will be the baseline and 94,586 Hospitalists visits for a total of 187,176 patient visit encounters. Adding or supporting new locations and providers will increase patient access and number of patient visits beginning 1-1-2012. We will track both the # of new locations opened/s upported after 1-1-2012 and the incremental patient visits/encounters performed annually in these loca tions and will report increased visits > 187,176. As Baptist assists other physicians/prac tices with relocating incremental sp ecialty care providers to Bexar County, that impact will be included as accretive to the community. Rationale: This project was selected for focus on the critical provider s hortages cited in the Community Needs Assessment as well as there is a demonstrated need in BHS hospitals' primary service area for 81 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Baptist Health System additional physician specialists Carnahan 2011 need s assessment. As examples cardiac care alone indicates +108 providers, Psychiatry +79 and for Pediatric related spec ialties there is a need of +301 specialty providers. All specialties are detailed in the Carnahan report. BHS will expand specialty care access with goals of prevention and h ealth maintenance through health care organizations and through establishment of alte rnative health care delivery channels. These partnerships and new alternative delivery cha nnels will be enhanced through new locations, new platforms and expanded hours in conjunction with and in addition to BHS supported primary care practices. This project is aligned with the Triple AIM Goals : Increases access for all patients includ ing Medicaid and uninsured patients Increasing access to physicians and specialis ts improves patient outcomes through chronic disease management and earlier intervention for acute conditions Eliminates inappropriate and costly use of Emergency Room visits The core components of the project are: (a) Increase service availability (b) Increase number of specialty clinic locations (c) Implement transparent, standardi zed referrals across the system (d) Conduct quality improvement for project This project also aligns with the RHP 6 Community Needs Assessment by improving access, outreach and care for the areas' underserved and chronically diseased patient population. RHP 6 is expected to have 6% population gr owth with Bexar County up to 15% growth between 2010-2015; and Texas ranks 45th in the nation in # of phys icians per capita. Increasing access improves disease preventi on, patient outcomes through chronic disease management and earlier intervention for acute conditions Eliminates inappropriate and costly use of Emergency Room visits Addresses chronic disease states where health ratings are poorest in Texas as noted above in project narrative This project certainly is in accord with national initiatives such as Accountable Care organizations. This project meets ALL of the Community n eeds CN.1, CN.2, CN.3, CN.4, and CN.5 as detailed above. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): IT- 3.2 Congestive Heart Failu re 30 day readmission rate (Stand Alone Measure) IT- 3.5 Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) 30 da y readmission rate (Stand Alone Measure) Cardiovascular disease is the largest caus e of preventable death in Texas in RHP6. Texas is rated \"weak\" in heart disease. By adding Cardiac and other specia lty providers, Baptist can provide cardiac interventions and chronic disease management improving the cardiac health of Bexar County. This includes evidence based strategies including CHF Navigator, relationships with post-acute ca re providers with active CHF and cardiac management programs. Adding specialty provi ders aids our Primary care provider base and patient population in establishing medical hom es that address their health needs. 82 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Baptist Health System Relationship to other Projects: This project would have the added advantage of s upporting these additional Cate gory 1 and 2 projects: 2.1 Enhance/Expand Medical Homes 2.2 Expand Chronic Care Management Models 2.5 Redesign for Cost Containment 2.7 Implement Evidence Based Disease Prevention Programs 2.10 Use of Palliativ e Care Programs Expanding Specialty Care access also supports the patient population focused Category 4 improvements in RD-1 Potentially Preventable Admissions 1.

Stroke Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: University, Baptist, and Methodi st systems have all cited expa nding specialty care as a DSRIP Initiative. Per the Carnahan 2011 Needs Assessmen t for Bexar and surrounding counties, there is a critical need for additional providers in all of the areas and our community should be well served by all of this active recruitment and expansion. Plan for Learning Collaborative: Following completion of RHP plan, University Hea lth System (anchor) will facilitate formation of working groups of performing providers pursuing si milar projects. These working groups will develop a learning collaborative structure which may include goals, meetings, site visits, conference calls, communication plan development, a learning ev ent, and adopt metrics to measure success. Project Valuation: Baptist values each project based on the specific needs of the community, the projected impact on the health outcomes of the community, the level of advancement to the healthcare delivery system, and the time, effort, and clinical resources necessary to implement each project. In valuing this project, Baptist t ook into account the extent to which the expansion of specialty care would potentially meet the goals of the Waiver (support the devel opment of a coordinated care delivery system, improve outcomes while containing cost s, improve the healthcare infrastructure), the extent to which it will address the community need s, the population served, and resources and cost necessary to implement the project. The expansion of specialty care clinics and providers will help address a substantial need in the community for increased access to specialty care. It also advan ces the Waiver goal of improving 83 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Baptist Health System outcomes while curbing the risk of healthcare cost s, because early intervention and chronic disease management are cost effective met hods to increase health outcomes. 84 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Baptist Health System 159156201.1.2 PASS 1 1.9.2 A-D 1.9.2 IMPROVE ACCESS TO SPECIALTY CARE : EXPAND SPECIALTY CARE CAPACITY VHS San Antonio Partners, LLC d/b/ a Baptist Health System TPI - 159156201 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 159156201.3.2 159156201.3.3 3.IT-3.2 3.IT-3.5 Heart Failure 30 rate Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) 30 day readmission rate Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P-11] Establish or expand existing specialty care clinic Metric 1 [P-11.1]: # of patients served by new or expansion of specialty care and hospitalists in new sites or by new providers Baseline is 187,176 annual visits 12/31/2011 and the DY2 goal will be an increase of 5% over baseline for year ending 9/30/2013 by adding new sites and new providers.

We will train Baptist staff and physicians on Lean and other Process Improve ment (PI) tools. Using trained staff and a variety of PI tools, we will improve efficiencies and reduce variation in care processes resulting in improvement in qual ity measures and reduced costs. Need for the project : The Institute of Medicine (IOM) states that the majority of medical errors result from faulty systems and processes, not fau lty individuals. Enhanced staff training and focus on tools to improve processes, reduce waste, and elim inate variation in care all contribute to Triple Aim goals of improving patient flow and increasing access for all patients, a more coordinated care delivery system and improving patient safe ty and quality while reducing costs. This project also ENABLES 2.8 which is the prac tical application of th ese tools to improve efficiency and quality. Target population : The specific target popul ation is Baptist employe d staff and both employed physicians as well as other medical st aff leaders. By trai ning staff with tools to improve processes, eliminate waste and reduce variation in care we ar e not only improving the quality of care provided to our patients but also creating increased access to care through reduced LO S, reduction in barriers in throughput all of which benefits the reside nts of Bexar County needing access to acute care. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : With at least 128 employees/physicians trained in PI tools by end of DY3 and at least five improveme nt projects completed each year, by DY 4 and 5, we will have measureable improvement in patient qu ality measures from our Scorecard such as reduction in readmissions, reductions in hospital acquired conditions and reduction in falls. All of these quality improvements are direct benefit to the patients treated in Baptist hospitals and other entities. Over 26% of BHS' I npatient population is Medicaid or Uninsured indigent and another large % have Medicaid supplemental to Medicare. Over 43% of BHS' Ou tpatient population is Medicaid or Uninsured indigent and another large % have Medicaid supplemental to Medicare. The impact staff training to yield quality and cost improvements through standa rdization while reducing variation will greatly bene fit this patient population Category 3 outcomes: 86 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Baptist Health System Congestive Heart Failure 30 day readmission rate Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) 30 day readmission rate Project Description: BHS proposes the implementation of lean and si x sigma performance improvement methodology to improve safety, quality, and efficiency. Sigma six is a widely accepted clinical methodology to improve the quality and efficiency of the delivery of healthcare services. Baptist will implement sigma six in Category 1 Project 10.1 Enhance Pe rformance improvement capacity within people, which will ENABLE Category 2 Project 8 Appl y process improvement methodology to improve quality/efficiency. Various tools will be used to drive contin uous improvement including, but not limited to, FMEA (failure mode evaluation an alysis) value stream mapping, process mapping, identification and elimination of waste and non-va lue added processes via direct observation and data collection. The goals of this project are (1) Establish and staff an office of Operational improvement (2) Train BHS staff and physician on lean and other PI tools (3) Use trained staff and array of PI tools to impr ove efficiencies and re duce variation in care processes to drive improvem ent in quality measures Various challenges faced by BHS during this implementatio n include educating a large number of staff on lean, changing the way problems are a pproached and improved upon, empowering front-line staff to identify opportunities for improvement along with capturing their ideas to make the improvement, and the significant amount of variati on that exists within BHS and all healthcare processes. To address these challenges, BHS proposes a perfo rmance improvement infrastructure to educate employees on lean and performance improvement t ools. Training is accomplished through various avenues including a four day lean practitioner training where em ployees are trained on lean principles and tools and how to apply them to a live project through thei r training. In addition, targeted training sessions will focus on transfer ring knowledge to employees and physicians on how to identify and eliminate waste. BHS will track all trained staff along with their indi vidual knowledge of specifi c lean tools with the goal of developing teachers and lean leaders. BH S will track all performance improvement activity in a project tracking application that tracks project details including metrics impacted and staff involvement. The five year goals are to have a substantial workforce that is trained and using various PI tools in approaching work and cost efficiencies, reducing variation in processes while improving clinical care, patient outcomes and improvi ng the total patient experience. This project meets the RH P Regional Goals : Triple Aim: assuring patients receive high-quality and patient-centered care, in the most cost effective ways 87 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Baptist Health System Improve the health care infrastructure to bett er serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of our counties Further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system Improve outcomes while containing cost growth This project meets the following RHP identified Community needs : CN.1 Texas ranks last in the nation on health care quality CN.2 A higher prevalence of chronic disease and rela ted health disparities re quire greater prevention efforts and improved management of patients with chronic conditions. BHS Operational improvement Office will use P- 3 Quality Improvement Milestone to further enhance the PI impact on improving care, quality and cost for our patients. Starting Point/Baseline: An Operational Improvement Department has been fo rmed to support the lean deployment for BHS. This department consists of a Vice Presiden t of Operational Improvement and Operational Improvement Engineers trained and certified in lean and/or six sigma. As of September 2012 there are 71 BHS employees trained as lean practitioners. The source for this information is the BHS lean practitioner employee roster maintained in the Operational Improvement Department at BHS. Rationale: Having an office responsible for performance improvement will increase the improvement capacity in BHS by championing the knowledge transfer of l ean and other quality improvement tools to BHS staff. Ongoing training by the office of Operational Improvement will increase the capacity for performance improvement activi ties on a continuous basis. Capturing employee ideas for improvement through an employee suggestion mechanism and implementing those ideas fosters a culture of continuous improvement. Encouragement of continuous improvement throughout a ll levels of the organization wi ll accelerate th e lean culture change that promotes employee empowerment to encourage change for improvement This project's Core Components are: (a) Provide training and education to clinical a nd administrative staff on process improvement strategies, methodologies and culture. (b) Develop an employee suggestion system that allo ws for identification of issues that impact the work environment, patient care and satisfact ion, efficiency and other issues aligned with continuous process improvement. (c) Continuous Quality Improvement. BHS recognizes th at a substantial part of this project is geared towards enhancing quality improveme nt\u2014in fact the entire project is the implementation of one comprehensive quality improvement methodology. In addition BHS will Participate in face toface learning (i.e. meetings or seminars) at least twice per year with other providers and the RHP to promote co llaborative learning around shared or similar projects as listed in P-3 of the quality improvement milestones of the DSRIP Menu. This project is aligned wi th the Triple AIM Goals : 88 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Baptist Health System Improving patient flow and infrastructure processes increases access for all patients including Medicaid a nd uninsured patients Improving flow and processes contributes to a more coordinate d delivery system Improving flow and processes, reducing varia tion and increasing care reliability improves patient safety and outcomes and reduces costs, eliminating waste from system This project also aligns w ith the RHP 6 Community Needs Assessment by improving access, outreach and care for the areas' underserved, diseased patient popul ation by equipping BHS leaders and staff with PI tools and knowledge to improve patient flow and increase access to care. This project addresses CN1 and CN2 as detailed above. This project is directly in accord with national initiatives such as Accountable Care organizations.

Cardiovascular disease is the largest single cause of death in Bexar County. Improving internal and transitional care and patient educ ation through staff working knowledge and utilization of PI tools will assist BHS in reducing readmission rates for the above cardiac conditions and improve population health. Relationship to other Projects: The project is a direct lin k to 2.8 Apply Process Improvement Methodology to Improve Quality/Efficiency. Lean tools can be utilized to improve cycle times in facilities/clinics and improve patient flow and experience by identifyi ng constraints, wastes, and non-value-added steps from the patient's perspective. This project supports Texas Waiver 1115 and Tr iple Aim goals to improve outcomes while containing cost growth. Lean is utilized to im prove outcome via the identification and elimination of waste in processes. These tools focus on re ducing undesirable variation in clinical practices which supporting Triple Aim concept of optimizing the health system and system integration.

Intervention(s) : The primary goal of this objective is to increase the capacity to provide pediatric sub-specialty care services and the availability of targeted specialty providers to better accommodate the high demand for such services. Need for the project : On September 21, 2012, CH OF SA Santa Rosa Children's hospital converted to a free-standing children's hospital and is now officially called Children's Hospital of San Antonio. This was the first step toward creating a Tier 1 Children's hospital, which will be the focal point for a network of pediatric serv ices. This project will enable CH of SA to create the much needed geographically dispersed network of pediatric sp ecialty care services throughout the community. Target population : This project will target the pediatric population, ag es 0 - 17, which currently account for more than 26% of the total population. In Bexar and Comal counties, an estimated 14% of the population is covered by Medicaid or indigent. Increasing s ubspecialty care access for this population can significantly improve patie nt health outcomes, patient satisfaction, utilization patterns and help to reduce healthcare costs. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : CH of SA converted to a free-standing children's hospital in September 2012 and is in the process of developing a network of pediatric services with its new Academic partner. The goal of this pr oject is to increase access to subspecialty care by adding 1 new subspecialty care clinic in DY2, 1 in DY3, 1 in DY4 and 1 in DY5. This benefit to patients is reflected in our milestones. Furthermore, this project will enable CH of SA to increase the number of subspecialist by 4 in DY3, 3 in DY4, and 3 in DY5. With each new clinic, CH of SA estimates pa tient visits to be 1,000 in DY 3, 1,500 patient visits in DY4, and 2,000 patient visits in DY5. CH of SA expects that approximately 20 % of the patients served in these new clinics will be Medicaid or indigent. Category 3 outcomes: [IT-9.2] The goal is to reduce pediat ric emergency department visits in DY4 and DY5. Targets will be determined based on the baseline established in DY3. Project Description: Children's Hospital of San Antonio (CH of SA ) will create a free-standing, Tier 1 Children's hospital, which will be the focal point for a network of pediatric services throughout the community. As part of this network, CH of SA will improve the access to sub-specialty care by establishing practices and creating clinics and other sites of services to im prove access to care for children with subspecialty healthcare needs. A dditionally, CH of SA will serve as an aggregator where needed or desired to bring smaller practi ces together to improve efficiencies in care delivery models and further expand access points. Goals and Relationship to Regional Goals: Project Goal: 94 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Children's Hospital of San Antonio The primary goal of this project is to increase the capacity to provide pediatric sub-specialty care services and the availability of targeted sp ecialty providers to better accommodate the high demand for such services. Targeted sp ecialties include, but are not limited to: Pediatric Neurosurgery Otolaryngology Orthopedics Surgery Cardiology Nephrology Plastic Surgery Endocrinology Gastroenterology This project meets the following regional goals: Triple Aim: assuring patients receive high-quality , patient-centered care, in the most cost effective ways. Improve the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of our counties Further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system Improve outcomes while containing cost growth 5-Year Expected Outcome for Provider and Patients: Children's Hospital of San Antonio expects to incr ease the number of specia lty care clinics by 4, and 10 new pediatric specialists from the targeted list of specialties over the next five years. This increase will result in more av ailable appointment times, increase d patient awareness of available services, improved patient health outcomes, im proved patient satisfaction, improvement in utilization patterns, and reduc tion in cost of services. In the implementation of this project, CH of SA will endeavor for continuous quality improvement by monitoring the patient volumes and patient utilization to ensure that progress is being made towards meeting the project milestones . Additionally, CH of SA will ensure that all specialty care clinics make ongoing efforts to me et or exceed all nationa lly recognized protocol or quality benchmarks for specialty care clinics. Starting Point/Baseline: According to 2010 3d Health physician need study, Shortage of 20 pediatri c sub-specialists in S.A. MSA; limited number of sites of care - most are congregated near the acute care facilities rather than spread across the region. 95 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Children's Hospital of San Antonio Rationale: As stated in the RHP Community Needs Assessm ent, chronic disease management (CN.2) and provider shortages (CN.3) are majo r issues facing the region. Furthe rmore, recent data indicates that the San Antonio MSA has an es timated deficit of 20 Pediatric S ubspecialists. This deficit is projected to intensify over the coming years due to physician retirements and increased demands from growth in the 00 to 18 age cohort. Additionally, current conditions in Bexar county are not conducive for retaining and attracting the base of pediatric speciali sts needed to serve the curren t population. By creating a free- standing, Tier 1 children's hospital, CH of SA is well positioned to help fill the gaps in pediatric sub-specialty care. This project will include the following components: a) Increase service availab ility with extended hours: a broad network of specialists will be established through this program, which wi ll allow for improved access to pediatric specialists and the opportunity to expand hours of care in sele cted locations as necessary. b) Increase number of specialty clinic locations; the proposed plan is to develop a broad based network of specialty clinics, which will improve access throughout the geographic market and to leverage more limited pediat ric specialists through rotations to various clinic sites. c) Implement transparent, standardize d referrals across the system; the proposed network will use a common information system and sc heduling process to minimize delays in scheduling specialty visits and to assure that patients can access needed specialists in the right location wherever they may be located. d) Quality Improvement for proj ect using methods such as rapid cycle improvement. Activities may include, but ar e not limited to, identifying project impacts, and identifying \"lessons learned.\" Network performance metrics to include scheduling issues, patient satisfaction issues and specialty physician needs will be monitored using the common network information system. Any identified performance gap will be addressed on a real time basis to ensure that the network is functioning at the highest levels to achieve the Trip Aim: improved access, quality and outcomes. Three major milestones were selected to ensure that this project achieves the intended results: 1) Conduct specialty care gap assess ment based on community need : this will establish which specialties should be targeted 2) Launch/expand a specialty care clinic : This will address the needs of the community thereby improving access to specialty care services. 3) Increase the number of specialist providers , clinic hours and/or procedure hours available for the high impact/most impacted medical specialties: this is a necessary element to improving overall access to specialty care. Unique community need identificati on numbers the project addresses: CN.1 - Texas ranks last in the nation on hea lth care quality. RHP 6 is challenged to deliver improved quality a nd patient satisfaction. CN.2 - High prevalence of chronic disease and related health dispar ities require greater 96 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Children's Hospital of San Antonio prevention efforts and improved management of patients with chronic conditions. CN.3 - Many residents of RHP 6 lack access to medical and dental care due to high rates of uninsurance and health care provider shortages. How the project represents a new initiative or significantly enhances an existing delivery system reform initiative: On September 21, 2012, CH OF SA Santa Rosa Child ren's hospital converted to a free-standing children's hospital and is now officially called Children's Hospital of San Antonio. This was the first step toward creating a Tier 1 Children's hosp ital, which will be the focal point for a network of pediatric services. This pr oject will enable Children's Hosp ital of San Antonio to create the much needed geographically dispersed network of pediatric specialty ca re services throughout the community. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-9, right Care, Right Setting: IT-9.2 - Appropriate ED Utilization Reduce pediatric Emergency Department visits (CHIPRA Core Measure) Reasons/rationale for select ing the outcome measure: The emergency department frequently becomes the focal point in the hea lth care system when care is poorly coordinated. W ith shortages in many pediatri c specialties, chronic disease management is a critical area of concern due to the impact it can have on ED utilization. The primary objective of this project is to improve access by establishing pediatric specialty practices, clinics and other sites of services. By providing a more ge ographically dispersed network of specialty care, patient s with chronic diseases will have greater access to these much needed services, which will redu ce ED utilization. For this r eason, improvement target IT-9.2, ED appropriate utilization will be used as an improvement measure for this project. Relationship to other Projects: Expanding pediatric specialty care supports/reinforces several of th e Category 1 and 2 projects: By increasing the number of pediatric sub-specia list and clinics, patients will have better access to providers who are equipped to manage their ch ronic diseases (project 1.3 & 2.2); this project will also support projects (2.1) Enhance/Expand Medical Homes, as it will give providers participating in medical home better access to speci alty care for their pa tients; and ultimately, this project reinforces the objective of (2.4) Redesign to Improve the Patient Experience. Additionally, this project will support each of the population focused improvements in Category 4: RD-1, Potentially Preventable Admissions; Patient-Centered Healthcare Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: University Health System Baptist Medical Center Methodist 97 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Children's Hospital of San Antonio Southwest General Dimmit County Memorial Hospital Val Verde Regional Medical Center Connally Memorial Medical Center University of Texas Health Science Center Plan for Learning Collaborative: Following completion of the RHP plan, University Health System (anchor) will facilitate the formation of working groups of performing provi ders who are pursuing similar projects. These working groups will develop their learning co llaborative structure which may include goals, regular meetings, site visits , conference calls, communication plan development, organizing learning event, and adopt metrics to measure success. Project Valuation: The valuation of CH OF SA projects use a method which rank s the importance of each projects based several key factors. First, CH OF SA cons idered the extent the project helps further the goals of the Waiver, which are to (a) enhance access to health car e, (b) increase the quality of care, and (c) improve the cost-effectiveness of ca re provided in the community. Next, CH OF SA considered the degree of need for the project in the community as addressed and identified in the Community Needs Assessment. The size of the required investment was also considered, which included considerations of personnel, equi pment, time and complexity as well as the cost of the time, effort, and clinical resources invo lved in implementing the project. Finally, CH OF SA reflected on the scope of the project: the number of patients that would be affected, including the type of patients; the number of patient visits or encounter s; how many providers or staff members would be added; the cost s that would be avoided as a result of the project; and the ripple effect the project would have on all member s of the healthcare syst em. These factors were weighed against the amount of funding availabl e. We believe this approach is the best methodology available to assess the impact of th e project, the investment of the performing provider and the overall value to the community to the extent co mmunity resources are available to help fund DSRIP projects. Final project va luation and funding distri bution across categories was then determined based on the valuation pr ovisions in the Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol. The pediatric population often requires subspecialis ts in order to adequately address the unique needs of this population. Therefor e, the expansion of specialty pediatric care will meet the Waiver goal to increase access to appropriate care by helping address a substantial need in the community for increased access to specialty care. Th is increase in access will also lead to better health outcomes for this vulnerable population, a nd ultimately increased efficiency of healthcare resources as the population becomes less reli ant on EDs to receive appropriate care. 98 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Children's Hospital of San Antonio (TPI Pending).1.1 PASS 1 1.9.2 1.9.2.

Increasing primary care access for this population can significan tly improve patient hea lth outcomes, patient sa tisfaction, utilization patterns and help to re duce healthcare costs. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : Working with its new academic partner, CH of SA seeks to enhance primary care capacity for the Medicaid and the indige nt population by adding new clinics and hiring new physicians to serve the community. To accomplish this, CH of SA will open 1 clinics in DY2, 2 in DY3, 2 in DY4 and 2 in DY5. Furthermore, it will hire 1 new pediatrician in DY2, 2 in DY3, 2 in DY4, and 2 in DY5. With each new clinic, CH of SA estimates that it will have the ability to offer 1,170 urgent care appointments in DY 4 and an additional 810 in DY 5. CH of SA expects that approximately 20% of the patients served in these new clinics will be Medicaid or indigent. Category 3 outcomes: [IT-9.2] The goal is to reduce pediat ric emergency department visits in DY4 and DY5. Targets will be determined based on the baseline established in DY3. Project Description: Children's hospital of San Antonio (CH of SA) will develop a geographically dispersed network of pediatric primary care clin ics throughout Bexar County to e nhance access points, increase available appointment times, and promote patient awareness of available services and overall primary care capacity, all of which will ultimately result in better health outcomes, patient satisfaction, appropriate utilizati on and reduced cost of services. Recent physician demand analysis indicates a sh ortage of over 100 primary care physicians in the San Antonio area. Due to the growth of the population and impending physician retirements, 101 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Children's Hospital of San Antonio this deficit is likely to grow in the coming year s. The primary focus will be on the expansion of Pediatric practices, pediatrician s, but could also include mi d-level providers and Family Medicine practices Goals and Relationship to Regional Goals: Project Goal: The primary goal of this objective is to expand th e capacity of Pediatric primary care to better accommodate the needs of children in the commun ity. Increased access to primary care allows patients to receive the right care at the right time in the right se tting. This will be accomplished by: Assisting established practices with ne w expansion and replacement of retiring physicians. Adding new practices in areas with significant access issues Serving as an aggregator where needed or de sired to bring smaller practices together to improve efficiencies in care delivery models. This project meets the following regional goals: Triple Aim: assuring patients receive high-quality and patient-centered care, in the most cost effective ways. Improve the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of our counties Further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system Improve outcomes while containing cost growth 5-Year Expected Outcome for Provider and Patients: Children's Hospital of San Antonio expects to in crease the number of primary care access points by at least 7 new clinics over the next five years. This increase will result in more available appointment times, increased patient awareness of available services, improved patient health outcomes, improved patient satisfaction, improveme nt in utilization patterns, and reduction in cost of services. In the implementation of this project, CH of SA will endeavor for continuous quality improvement by monitoring the patient volumes and patient utilization to ensure that progress is being made towards meeting the project milestones . Additionally, CH of SA will ensure that all pediatric primary care clinics make ongoing effort s to meet or exceed a ll nationally recognized protocol or quality benchmarks fo r pediatric primary care clinics. Starting Point/Baseline: According to the 2010 3d Health assessment, ther e is a shortage of 40 Pediatricians in Bexar County. Rationale: 102 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Children's Hospital of San Antonio In the current health care system , more often than not, patients receive services in urgent and emergent care settings for conditions that could be better managed in a primary care setting. This often results in more costly, less coordinate d care and a lack of appropriate follow-up care. To further complicate matters, Texas has a growi ng shortage of primary care doctors due to a decline in the number of medical students choosing to go into primary care. The recent community needs assessment identified healthca re provider shortages as a major issue facing RHP 6. With 26% of the population under the age of 18 and projected future growth of this age cohort over the next five years, access to pe diatric primary care will only intensify. The primary objective of this project is to es tablish more pediatric primary care clinics and practitioners in order to expand access to pediatric primary care. Three major milestones were selected to ensure that this project achieves the intended results: 1. Establish additional/expand existing/relocat e primary care clinics: this will be a critical factor to increasing pediatric access to primary care. 2. Train/hire additional primary care providers and staff and/or increase the number of primary care clinics for existing providers: th is is an equally cr itical factor to increasing pediatric access to primary care. 3. Enhanced capacity to provide urgent care services in the primary care setting: by increasing access to primary care, patients can access their primary care provider for urgent care services that ar e appropriate for the primary care setting rather than using the ED. Unique community need identificati on numbers the project addresses: CN.1 - Texas ranks last in the nation on hea lth care quality. RHP 6 is challenged to deliver improved quality a nd patient satisfaction. CN.2 - High prevalence of chronic disease and related health dispar ities require greater prevention efforts and improved management of patients with chronic conditions.

This shortage of pediatricians can cause significant access issues, forcing parents/guardians to use the ED as their child's primary care provider for acute illness management and preventative care needs. The primar y goal of this project is to help established practices expand, replace retiring physicians, and add new practices in areas with significant access issues. The ED Appropriate Utilization improvement target is an accurate measure for determining the impact this increased access has on ED utilization. Relationship to other Projects: Expanding pediatric primary care s upports/reinforces several of the Category 1 and 2 projects: By increasing the number of pediatricians, patie nts will have better access to providers who are equipped to manage their chronic diseases (pro ject 1.3 & 2.2); this project will also support projects (2.1) Enhance/Expand Medical Homes, as it provide additional pediatricians who could potentially participate in a medi cal home model; and this project al so reinforces the objective of (2.4) Redesign to Improve the Patient Experience , in that increased access to primary care will result in greater overall patient satisfaction.

The positiv e benefits of preventative primary care are especially prevalent in the pedi atric population because many clin ical issues can be identified and addresses before they become chronic or even acute conditions. 105 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Children's Hospital of San Antonio (TPI Pending).1.2 PASS 1 1.1.1 N/A 1.1.1 Establish more primary care clinics: Primary Care Expansion Program Children's Hospital of San Antonio TPI - 020844903 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): (TPI Pending).3.2 3.IT-9.2 ED Appropriate Utilization Year 2 (10/1/2012 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 P-1: Establish additional/expand existing/relocated primary care clinics.

With a combined total of 496 beds, CSRHS currently serves the San Antonio and New Braunfels markets which has a total population of 1.9 million. Intervention(s) : This project will expand primary care capacity by increasing the number of primary care clinics, hours and staffing, which will improve overall access for the targeted population. Need for the project : Texas has a growing shortage of prim ary care providers due to the needs of an aging population. This is especially true for the far Northwest side of San Antonio, which is considered a medically underserved area and has an identified n eed of 106 primary care physicians. CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Family Health System currently does not have an adequate number of physicians to expand in to this service area and will n eed to add an additional four providers to its practice ov er the next four years. Target population : The target population for th is project lives on the fa r northwest side of San Antonio, which is currently consid ered to be a medically underse rved area. The total population for this area is estimated to be at 464,000, and 12% of that population is e ither Medicaid eligible or indigent. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : In the last twelve mont hs, the existing primary care clinic had 29,494 total offi ce visits. The goal of this project is to increase access by offering an additional 4,500 office visits in year four of th e program and an additional 3,750 visits in year five. This increase in capacity will provide much needed access to the uninsured, underserved, indigent and Medicaid populat ion. CSRHS expects that approximately 20% of the patients served in this clinic will be Medicaid or indigent. Category 3 outcomes: [IT-9.2] The goal of this project is to improve ED utilization in DY4 and DY5. Targets will be determined based on the baseline established in DY3. Project Description: Texas has a growing shortage of primary care docto rs and nurses due to the needs of an aging population, a decline in the number of medical students choosing pr imary care, and thousands of aging baby boomers who are doctors and nurses l ooking towards retirement. The shortage of primary care workforce personnel in Texas (CN.3) is a critical problem that can be addressed under this waiver. The shortage of primary care providers has cont ributed to increased wait times in hospitals, community clinics, and other care settings. Expanding the primary care workforce will increase access and capacity and help create an organized structure of primary care providers, clinicians, and staff. Moreover, this expansion will strengthen an integrated health care system and play a key role in implementing disease management programs. A greater focus on primary care will be crucial to the success of an integrated h ealth care system. Furthermore, in order to effectively operat e in a medical home model, ther e is a need for residency and training programs to expand the capabilities of primary care providers and other staff to effectively provide team-based ca re and managed population health. 108 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health System The CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Family Health Ce nter (CSRFHC) is a NCQA Level III Patient- Centered Medical Home accredited program providing comprehensive outpatient medical and wellness care to pediatric and adult patients while training physicians in th e specialty of Family Medicine. The CSRFHC's goal is to provide qua lity, comprehensive, interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary outpatient medical care of varyi ng severity to all patients seeking care in a teaching environment. Additionally, all physicians successfully graduating from this program will be fully trained to operate patient-centered medical homes. Goals and Relationship to Regional Goals: Project Goals: The goal of this project is to expand primary care capacity by increasing the number of primary care clinics, hours and staffing, which will improve overall access for the targeted population. This project meets the following regional goals: Triple Aim: assuring patients receive high-quality and patient-centered care, in the most cost effective ways. Improve the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of our counties Further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system Improve outcomes while containing cost growth 5-Year Expected Outcome for Provider and Patients: CSRHS plans to expand beyond its existing clinic space and add an additional 4 primary care physicians over the next four years. By expanding the number of primary care clinics, physicians, hours and staffing, this pr oject will result in a decrease in the number of patients that receive services in urgent and emergency set tings, therefore resulting in improvement in the overall health of the populati on and reduction in costs. In the implementation of this project, CSRHS will endeavor for continuous quality improvement by monitoring the patient volumes and patient utili zation to ensure that progress is being made towards meeting the project milestones. Additio nally, CSRHS will ensure that all primary care clinics make ongoing efforts to meet or exceed all nationally recognized protocol or quality benchmarks for primary care clinics. Starting Point/Baseline: 1 clinic location in Downtown San Antonio, 13 pr imary care providers, 29,494 total office visits Source: CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Family Health Center internal records 109 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health System Rationale: In 2010, Texas had 176 patient care physicia ns per 100,000 population and 70 primary care physicians per 100,000 population with a state ra nking of 46 and 47, respectively (comparable ratios for US total are 219.5 and 90.5, respectiv ely). From 2001 to 2011, the Texas physician workforce grew 32.3%, exceeding the population gr owth of 25.1%. Primary care physician workforce grew only 25% in the same peri od. From 2002 to 2011, Texas increased medical school enrollment 31% from 1,342 to 1,762 in line w ith the national call by the Association of American Medical Colleges to in crease medical school enrollment s by 30%. In 2011, there were 1,445 medical school graduates. Coincidentally, there were 1,445 allopathic entry-level GME positions offered in the annual national Resident matching program (there were 31 osteopathic slots). The Texas higher Educat ion Coordinating Boar d recommends a ratio of 1:1 entry-level GME positions for each Texas medical school gra duate. The number of Texas medical school graduates is expected to peak at over 1,700 in 2015. This implies a need for 400 additional GME positions by 2015. The shortage of GME positions or residency slots may be the single most problematic bottleneck in Texas' efforts to al leviate the state's physician Shortage. Resident physicians provide low-cost care to needy populations and tend to remain in the state in which the complete their residency training. Consistent with what is occurri ng at the state level, RHP 6 is in need of additional providers. By expanding its existing clinic and adding four add itional primary care provide rs over the next five years, CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health System (CSRHS) hopes to increase the number of primary care physicians practicing in Bexar County, thus improving primary care access to the community, while also strengthening an integrated health care system. The core project components include: a) Expand primary care clinic space : CSRHS will add an additional primary care clinic to its CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Westover Hills Campus in DY2. b) Expand primary care clinic hours : CSRHS will add a total of 4 new primary care physicians by DY5. In doing so, the number of available appointment hours will be increased according. c) Expand primary care clinic staffing : As a result of the addi tional clinic and physicians, CSRHS will increase the number of clinic staff to adequately support the additional volume. Two major milestones were selected to ensure th at this project achieves the intended results: 1) Establish additional/expand existing/relocate primary care clinics: The addition of a clinic and new providers in far northwest San Antonio will allo w CSRHS to increase access in a currently underserved area. 2) Train/hire additional primar y care providers and staff and/or increase the number of primary care clinics for existing providers: CSRHS plans to hire a total of 4 new primary care providers by DY5 to staff the new clinic in far northwest San Antonio. This will provide much needed access to this underserved area. Unique community need identificati on numbers the project addresses: CN.2 - High prevalence of chronic disease a nd related health dispar ities require greater prevention efforts and improved management of patients with chronic conditions. 110 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health System CN.3 - Many residents of RHP 6 lack access to medical and dental care due to high rates of uninsurance and health care provider shortages. How the project represents a new initiative or significantly enhances an existing delivery system: The CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Family Health Ce nter, an NCQA level III medical home, is planning to expand to a new me dically underserved location in San Antonio. To adequately provide the much needed access to this populati on, CSRHS will increase the number of primary care providers by 4 over the next four years. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-9 Right Care Right Setting IT-9.2 ED Appropria te Utilization Reduce all ED visits Reasons/rationale for select ing the outcome measure: The lack of primary care access has a direct correla tion with increased utilization in the ED. The growing shortage of primary care workforce pers onnel in Texas is a crit ical problem that has contributed to increased wait times in hospitals , community clinics, a nd other care settings. Patients with non-emergent issues are using the ED for their primary care needs, which is a costly burden to the health care system. The primary goal of this project is to train more workforce members to serve as a primary care provi der, which will help address this substantial shortage, therefore giving patients a less costly alternative to the ED. Relationship to other Projects: Expanding primary care supports/reinf orces several of the Category 1 and 2 projects: Increasing the number of physicians rotating through the prim ary care residency program will have a direct impact on Expanding Primary Care Capacity (1.1); this project not only will increase the number of available physicians to participate in medical homes (2.1), it will also ensure that they are trained in the medical home concept; finall y, the medical home con cept of this training program also reinforces the Redesign of Primary Care (2.3), th e Redesign to Improve the Patient Experience (2.4) Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: University Hospital Baptist Medical Center Children's Hospital of San Antonio Frio Regional Hospital Guadalupe Regional Medical Center Peterson Regional Medical Center Medina Regional Hospital Val Verde Regional Medical Center University of Texas Health Science Center 111 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health System Plan for Learning Collaborative: Following completion of the RHP plan, University Health System (anchor) will facilitate the formation of working groups of performing provi ders who are pursuing similar projects. These working groups will develop their learning co llaborative structure which may include goals, regular meetings, site visits , conference calls, communication plan development, organizing learning event, and adopt metrics to measure success. Project Valuation: The valuation of CHRISTUS projects use a met hod which ranks the importance of each projects based several key factors. First, CHRISTUS cons idered the extent the project helps further the goals of the Waiver, which are to (a) enhance acce ss to health care, (b) in crease the quality of care, and (c) improve the cost-effectiveness of care provided in the community. Next, CHRISTUS considered the degree of need for th e project in the community as addressed and identified in the Community Needs Assessment. The size of the required investment was also considered, which included considerations of pe rsonnel, equipment, time and complexity as well as the cost of the time, effort, and clinical resources involved in implementing the project. Finally, CHRISTUS reflected on the scope of the project: the number of patients that would be affected, including the type of patients; the number of patient visits or encounters; how many providers or staff members would be added; the costs that would be avoided as a result of the project; and the ripple effect the project would have on all members of the healthcare system. These factors were weighed agains t the amount of funding available. We believe this approach is the best methodology available to assess the imp act of the project, th e investment of the performing provider and the overall value to the community to the extent community resources are available to help fund DSRIP projects. Fina l project valuation and f unding distribution across categories was then determined based on the va luation provisions in the Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol . The recruitment and expansion of primary care clinics and physicians will help address a substantial need in the community for increased a ccess to primary care. It will also go a long way towards achieving the Waiver goal of improving out comes while curbing the risk of healthcare costs, because primary care is one of the mo st cost effective methods to increase health outcomes. 112 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health System 020844901.1.1 PASS 1 1.1.2 1.1.2 (A - C) 1.1.2 Expand existing primary care capacity CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health System TPI - 020844901 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 020844901.3.1 3.IT-9.2 ED Appropriate Utilization Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 P-1: Establish additional/expand existing/relocate primary care clinics Metric 1 P-1.1: Number of additional clinics or expanded hours or space Goal: Add 1 additional clinic at CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Westover Hills Campus Data Source: Documentation of detailed expansion plans Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $1,990,269 Milestone 2 P-5: Train/hire additional primary care providers and staff and/or increase the number of primary care clinics for existing providers.

Our 52-bed hospital, along with day treatment and outpatient therapy will help over 8,000 children. Patients primarily arrive from Bexar County, with a county seat that is the 7th largest city in the nation. However, 20% of Clarity's patients arrive from surrounding rural counties, which often l ack any psychiatric services. Intervention(s) : This project will provide the \"right car e at the right time\", in order to assess children's psychiatric needs and pr ovide the appropriate treatment pl ans. Five beds of a 20 bed expansion will be reserved as a regional psychiat ric service to assess pati ents sooner and provide the appropriate treatment plan. Since Clarity o ffers a continuum of services, the appropriate treatment plan is expected to i nvolve preventive outpatient therapy, thereby avoiding acute care in some cases. We will also free up busy emergency rooms from patients who present with psychiatric symptoms, yet psychiatric care is not immediately available. Need for the project : Over 1,300 children present at loca l emergency rooms presenting with psychiatric symptoms, only to be \"boarded\" for care. We propose creating a children's regional psychiatric service where the patient can be as sessed and treatment plans implemented, bypassing ER's where psychiatric services are often not av ailable. We anticipate that over 300 children and adolescents per year can be asse ssed for services, with a con tinuum of care provided that can result in treatment plans such as a referral, individual, family or group therapy, medication evaluation, medication management, psychological assessments and consultations or partial hospitalization as alte rnatives to acute car e hospitalization. Target population : Children and adolescents, ages 3-17, pr imarily with the Medicaid population, as we are a disproportionate share hospital and one of only a few resources providing serious mental health care in our region. Expanding our continuum of servi ces, including preventive behavioral health services, to more Medicaid children has a s ubstantial community impact. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : Divert patients from presenting at ERs where care is not readily accessible Assess patients (>300) for best treatment cour ses related to mental health in DY4 and DY5 Provide the appropriate level of care to patients ages 3-17 Thereby, decreasing unnecessary hospital admissions for acute care, while increasing preventive treatment options such as outpa tient therapy and incr easing satisfaction 2% Category 3 outcomes: Our goal is to reduce the behavioral health acute admission rate for children and adolescents, with the percentage improvement to be determin ed after creating a ba seline in DY3. Project Description: Clarity Child Guidance Center proposes to provide regional psychiatric serv ices to children ages 3-17 in a setting where a continuum of care is available, to effec tively divert patients from local 115 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Clarity Child Guidance Center ER settings into the appropriate care level. A report completed in 2010 by Meth odist Healthcare Ministries rese arched children's psychiatric beds in our region and revealed a 21 bed deficit, which has grow n to 65 beds over the past two years. The Texas Department of State Health Se rvices concurs with thos e findings, noting that in the last 17 years, psychiatric beds have shr unk by more than 30%, wh ile demand continues to soar. Compounding the problem is the increased in cidence of mental health crises. Root causes of mental health illness can often be tracked to abuse and neglect of children in our community, increased obesity (which leads to depression and other mental illnesses), increased single parent homes and other factors which all lead to substantial increases in mental health needs. As a result of the increased need in children's mental h ealth care and lack of access, 1,300 children annually present to ERs with a psychiat ric condition. However, most re gional hospitals do not provide psychiatric services. These hospitals have coined the term \"boarding,\" ke eping a patient in the ER until a bed is made available at another facility that does provide care. As a solution, Clarity Child Guidance Center provide s a continuum of mental health services for children ages 3-17, including acute inpatient hos pitalization. We are uniquely positioned to expand capacity for the shortage of inpatient ca re beds for children, by creating a regional children's psychiatric emergency service. Th is regional emergency service for children's psychiatric needs will help to divert the 1,300 children being board ed at ERs to a facility where appropriate mental health care ca n be provided. This also frees beds in ERs for patients who can be treated at local hospitals. Busy ER's turn a bed over about every two hours, meaning that creating a regional access point for children's ps ychiatric emergencies could open thousands of traditional ER beds by caring for children more appropriately in Clarity CGC's clinical settings. It is Clarity CGC's history and focus on childre n's mental health and a continuum of care, including outpatient therapy a nd day treatment that will prevent many children from being hospitalized. Our expected outcome is a reduction in Pediatric ER visits to hospitals that lack care while offering a treatment plan that incl udes options such as outpatient therapy, day treatment, and if medically necessa ry, acute emergency services. Goals and Relationship to Regional Goals: Our goal is reduce ER admissions in settings wher e care is not readily av ailable, while providing a continuum of mental health services to children ages 3-17. By providing the right care in the right setting, we can reduce admissions and increase preventive care treatment. Project Goals: Divert patients from presenting at ERs where care is not readily accessible Assess patients for best treatment courses related to mental health Provide the appropriate level of care to patients ages 3-17 Thereby, decreasing unnecessary hospital admissions for acute care, while increasing preventive treatment options such as outpatient therapy This project meets the following regional goals: Triple Aim: assuring patients receive high-quality and patien t-centered care, in the most cost effective way; and Improve the health care infrastructure to bett er serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of our counties 116 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Clarity Child Guidance Center Challenges: The primary challenge for this project will be the coordination and co mmunication with regional hospitals that don't offer psychiatric care for ch ildren ages 3-17 to ensure their knowledge and processes for referring patients to our regional services. With effective communication and coordination, the project will be successful. 5-Year Expected Outcome for Provider and Patients: Clarity Child Guidance Center expects to see im provements in behavioral healthcare outcomes for patients assessed and treated. Patients will be surveyed on satisfaction and improvements initiated as a result of all metrics. Starting Point/Baseline: The following data/information about our organizat ion would help establ ish a baseline in DY2: Nearly 7,000 children served through outpatient therapy services resulting in 21,000 outpatient visits The largest concentration of trai ned professionals already on sta ff, with capacity to grow to increase service availability through the cr eation of a regional children's psychiatric emergency service Rationale: Project 1.9.2 seeks to increase the capacity to provide specialty car e services and the availability of targeted specialty providers to improve access to specialty care. As one of only four providers for children in our region suffering from serious mental illness, and the only nonprofit providing services to children as young as three, we be lieve we are uniquely qualified to expand and enhance service availability. The project option of 1.9.2 is the best alignmen t to our project goal, as we will be increasing capacity to behavioral health services, while increasing the number of providers. Project Components: With the design, development and deployment of the Regional Children's Psychiatric Services project, we propose to meet all required project components. a) Increase service availab ility with extended hours. Through collaboration and a referral network, we will increase servic e availability by creating a regional psychiatric emergency service for children ages 3-17. The psychiatric emergency service shall be available 24/7 to the community. b) Increase number of specialty clinic locations. A 65-bed deficit of children's psychiatric beds exits in our community. Th is project seeks to in crease the number of beds to 20, with five beds reserved for a regional psychiatric serv ice. This effort inherently increases capability and cap acity, which is the intent of item b). c) Implement transparent, standardize d referrals across the system. Clarity Child Guidance Center is part of the health info rmation exchange effort to create a pathway for transparent, standardized referrals. Even independent of this effort, we maintain a large referral base (both refe rring in or out of our system ). We intend to expand the referral base as a re sult of this project. d) Conduct quality improvement for project us ing methods such as rapid cycle. A project management team will deploy this initiative, creating the opportunity for quality improvements. Further, standardiz ed processes within our hospital system allow for rapid cycle improvements, through suggestions, policy updates, and various 117 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Clarity Child Guidance Center councils and committees who evaluate metrics and processes for improvement opportunities. Unique community need identificati on numbers the project addresses: Our project aligns with the Region's needs as outlined in the Co mmunity Needs Assessment, specifically to the following identification areas: CN.1 Texas ranks last in the na tion on health care quality. In particular, Texas ranks last on nearly all mental health indica tors. An investment in a behavi oral health project such as Clarity CGC's creates the foundat ion to change this trend. CN.2 Many residents of RHP 6 lack access to medi cal and dental care due to high rates of uninsurance and health care provider shortages. W e care for the uninsured and under-insured daily. We are one of only four providers in the region that offer serious mental health treatment for children ages 3-17, and we are th e only provider on the 1115 waiver list that would provide services specifi cally as young as three. CN.4 There is a shortage of high quality mental and behavioral health services that are integrated with physical health care servic es and/or provide cr isis stabilization. Clarity CGC currently offers the largest concentration of child and adolescent professionals in the region, through our partnership with Southwest Psychiatr ic Physicians and our affiliation with The University of Texas Health Science Center's Department of Psychiatry. We are uniquely positioned to increase the number of providers, services, and integrate with physical health. Part of our project planning is to expand our affiliation with UTHSC to the Pediatrics Department. Our project represents both a new and expanded initiative. First, it 's new in its thought process of creating a regional psychiatric emer gency service to prevent \"board ing\" of children in hospitals who lack appropriate providers a nd care and who merely transfer th eir patients to our facility and precious few others, on average 12 hours after admission. Second, it 's an expanded initiative in that Clarity CGC offers a continuum of services based on decades of service. We offer outpatient therapy, day treatment and acute inpatient hospitaliz ation (for a fraction of the cost of standard pediatric ER settings). Third, through our esta blished affiliation with The University of Texas Health Science Center's Department of Psychiatry, we are positioned to form a similar affiliation with Pediatrics, creating a sy stem of integrated care. How the project represents a new initiative or significantly enhances an existing delivery system reform initiative: This project reflects a new initia tive in that it seeks to regionalize psychiatric emergency services where care is available, versus the many existing ER's where children are \"boarded\" for care. As for data to support the need, one in five children will be diagnosed with a mental, emotional or behavioral disorder (affecting over 80,000 children in Bexar C ounty alone). Clarity CGC is a disproportionate share hospi tal and will continue to serve Medicaid/CHIP children presenting with psychiatri c symptoms in order to assess and provide the best treatment plan. Texas ranks last in per capita spending on mental health care fo r children amongst all states. Improvements in mental health delivery and outco mes are critical for our overall community's 118 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Clarity Child Guidance Center health. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): We have selected a measure within OD-2, \"Poten tially Preventable Admissions\" and the related standalone outcome measure of 3-IT 2-4. This measure's goal is to reduce Emergency Department visits for one of several optional target conditions, one of which is behavioral health/substance abuse. However, because this measure is available only for patients 18 and older, we were advised by HHSC to utilize the custom/optional measure of 2.13 to address that our outcomes would be related to youth, ages 3-17. Our project is of be nefit to all performing providers in the region, as children are presen ting in local Emergency Rooms without access to \"right care, right setting\" and displacing beds for treatment plans that can be addressed effectively by the local hospitals. Further, treating children when they are children prevents a host of unwelcome outcomes, including but not limited to suicide, incarcerati on, dropout, alcohol and drug abuse and many other societal ills. Our Category 1 Project, to improve access to sp ecialty care, directly links to potentially preventable admissions, a key outcome of 2.13. Im proving the health of low-income populations will lead to long-term sustainable outc omes while decreasing societal burden. Relationship to other Projects: Improving behavioral care outcomes is a key te net of the 1115 Waiver and also prominently noted in the Community Needs Assessment for ou r Region. The Center for Healthcare Services (CHCS) has multiple companion projects in the beha vioral health areas of Category 1 and 2. Our project (112742503.1.1) will have several integrated links with the multitude of CHCS projects. Specifically, our project ties into Category 4 measures such as Po tentially preventable admissions (RD-1.3); 30-day readmissions (R D-2.3); Patient Centered health care (RD-4.1), including patient satisfaction and medication management; and fi nally, Emergency Department (RD-5). We believe we will be exempt from many of the measures in RD-3, potentially preventable complications (PPCs), as our hospital is spec ialized in behavioral health treatment. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: The Center for Healthcare Services has multiple companion projects in the behavioral health areas of Category 1 and 2. Following completion of the RHP Plan, our anchor, University Health System will facilitate the formation of worki ng groups of performing providers who are pursuing similar projects. These working groups will deve lop their learning collaborative structure. University Health System will s eek to provide facilitation and administrative assistance as needed to ensure the success of these endeavors. The RHP 6 website will be available to the Learning Collaborative to network and share ideas, challeng es, and success stories with colleagues. RHP 6 hopes to make significant transformational progre ss on its project milestones to achieve waiver goals and share what we learn with the rest of the State. 119 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Clarity Child Guidance Center Plan for Learning Collaborative: In addition to the information sh ared directly above, we are me mbers of the Bexar County Health Collaborative. Additionally, we are a teaching hospital, affiliated w ith the UTHSC, where outcomes will be openly shared as part of the learning process. Staff is also members of the Community Resource Coordination Group (CRCG ) for both Bexar County and the surrounding counties. We are also members of the MDRC, a group of medical director s that meets quarterly that was formed by Judges at the Probate Court. Ideas will be shared, tested, and solutions provided as part of our membership process. Project Valuation: The total scope of adding addi tional services, including a be d expansion, hiring additional providers, infrastructure updates, et c., is close to $8M in scope. Local funding is in the form of IGT funding by our affiliation partner, Univer sity Health System, who will provide $1,968,152. The 1115 Waiver will add $2,350,064 in funding for a total of $3,936,807. The remaining costs will be covered through development efforts of our nonprofit agency and self-funding through bonds. The populations that will be served are youth ages 3-17, and the community benefit is immense, not only in line with the Community Need s Analysis, but with Texas' woeful lack of providers and access to mental healthcare. 120 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Clarity Child Guidance Center 112742503.1.1 PASS 1 1.9.2 A-G 1.9.2 Improve access to specialty care Clarity Child Guidance Center TPI - 112742503 Related Category Potentially Prev entable Admissions: Behavior admissions for youth Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 P-1: Conduct specialty care gap assessment Metric 1 (P-1.1) Data Source: Documentation of gap assessment.

CMMC is the sole comm unity hospital serving Wilson County with a population of 43,000 Intervention(s) : CMMC will establish hospital owned and operated specialty clinics for targeted specialty care services based on community need Need for the project : Establishing specialty care clinics will allow CMMC to expand specialty services for most impacted specialties and impr ove access for targeted populations. A project to expand high impact specialty care is needed in Wilson County and the surrounding areas. The leading causes of death in Wilson county are rela ted to cardiovascular conditions (30% of all deaths) and heart diseases (24%). Based on the GMNEC Model for physician to population ratios, Wilson County has a shortage of 34 physicia ns (representing all specialties) Additionally; Wilson County has been designate d as a Health Provider Shortage Area as well as a Medically Underserved Area by the U.S. Departme nt of Health and Human Services. Target population : Our target population would be all of Wilson County. Currently in Wilson County 10% of the population lives below the fede ral poverty level. Additionally, 23% of our patients are either Medicaid eligible or indige nt/self pay, so we expect they will benefit from this service. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project seeks to provi de 17,402 specialty clinic encounters/consults from DY2 - DY5. Hospital does not currently operate any specialty clinics, therefore all specialty encounter s/consults will be new services provided to community, thus increasing access to care. Category 3 outcomes: IT-1.6 Cholesterol Management for patients with cardiovascular conditions Our goal is to reduce the total bl ood cholesterol level for patients w ith known heart disease. Goal is TBD Project Description: Connally Memorial Medical Center proposes to establish hospita l owned and operated specialty clinics for targeted specialty care services based on community need. Specialty clinics will provide care for unassigned patients and will coor dinate care with primary care clinics, and hospital emergency department to ex pand access to specialty services. Connally Memorial Medical Center serves a population of over 40,000 residents. Goal and Relationship to regional Goals: The overarching goal of this project is to impr ove clinical health outcomes for residents of 124 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Connally Memorial Medical Center Wilson County. We will work toward achieving that goal by recruiting specialty providers to Wilson County, establishing specia lty care clinics and implementing an electronic health record within these clinics to better coordinate care and referrals from primary care physicians. Project Goals 1. Increase the number of specialty providers 2. Increase the number of patients seen in specialty clinics This project meets the following regional goals. 1. Improves outcomes while containing cost growth. 2. Develops and maintains a coor dinated care delivery system. 3. Assures patients receive high-quality and patient-cen tered care in the most cost effective ways. Challenges: The primary challenge for this project will be to recruit specialty provi ders to our community. Small and rural communities, such as Wilson Co unty, have historically had a difficult time attracting and retain ing physicians. 5 Year expected outcome for Provider and Patients: Connally Memorial Medical Center expects to see improvements in the number of specialist providers available to treat patients in Wils on County. Additionally, the provider expects to see improvements in the health outcomes for chronic diseases and health disparities outlined community needs assessment Starting Point/Baseline: No current baseline exists as the hospital doe s not currently own and operate any specialty clinics. Therefore, the baseline number for encounters as well as the participating providers begins at 0 in DY 2. Rationale: CMMC has chosen the project option of EXPANDING HIGH IMPACT SPECIALTY CARE CAPACITY IN MOST IMPACTED SPECIALTIES. Establishing specialty care clin ics will allow CMMC to expand specialty services for most impacted special ties and improve access for targeted populations. Additionally, specialty care clinics allow for enhanced care coordinati on for those patients requiring intensive specialty services. A project to expand high impact specialty care is needed in Wilson County and the surrounding areas. The leading causes of death in Wilson county are related to cardiovascular conditi ons (30% of all deaths ) and heart diseases (24%). Based on the GMNEC Model for physician to population ra tios, Wilson County ha s a shortage of 34 physicians (representing all speci alties) Additionally, Wilson Count y has been designated as a Health Provider Shortage Area as well as a Me dically Underserved Area by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In addition to already being underserved, the Wilson County population is expected to increase by 24% by 2015. Project Components a) Identify high impact/most impacted specialty services and gaps in care coordination - CMMC will conduct a formal specialty needs assessment to determine most impacted specialty services and gaps in care. 125 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Connally Memorial Medical Center b) Increase the number of residents/train ees. CMMC will not initially address this component due to the fact that provider does not offer a residency training program. c) Design workforce enhancement initiatives to support access to specialty providers. CMMC will recruit additional specialty provide rs to support goal of providing additional services in underserved markets. d) Conduct quality improvement for project using methods such as rapid cycle improvement - CMMC will expand and implement hospital EMR to specialty clinics. We will create a registry of patients seen in CMMC inpatient setting and emergency department to help facilitate clinical follow up to outpatient se tting. Reports will be r un monthly and shared with specialty clinic staff at monthly meeti ngs. Meetings will be held monthly to discuss any issues associated with communication be tween hospital and clinic providers as well as patient transfers. Community need Identification number: CN.2 (A high prevalence of chronic disease a nd related health dispar ities require greater prevention efforts and improved management of patients with chronic conditions. Leading causes of death in RH P 6 include cardiovascular di sease, cancer and diabetes.) CN.3 (Many residents of RHP 6 lack access to medical and dental care due to high rates of uninsurance and healthcare provider shortages. How the project represents a new in itiative or significantly enhan ces an existing delivery system reform initiative. Currently there are no hospital based clinics in Wilson Count y. The Wilson County medical community is a system of independent medi cal providers including private physician groups, clinics and Connally Memorial Medical Center. Our project will improve access for targeted patients while helping CMMC reach capacity for tr eating patients with sp ecialty needs. More specifically, we will increase the number of special ty clinic locations and service availability. This will in turn allow patients to have greate r access to hospital resources including quality improvement, case management and social services. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-1 Primary Care and Chronic Disease Management IT-1.6 Cholesterol Management for patie nts with cardiovascular conditions Reasons/rationale for selecting the outcome measures: Total blood cholesterol is directly related to the development of coronary artery disease (CAD) and coronary heart disease (CHD), with most of the risk being associated with low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). When LDL-C le vels are high, cholesterol can build up within the walls of the arteries, causing atherosclerosis, the build up of plaque. Hemorrhagin or clot formation can occur at the site of plaque build-up, blocking arte ries and causing heart attack and stoke. Reducing cholesterol in patients with kno wn heart disease is critically important, as treatment can reduce morbidity (heart attack and stroke) and mortality by as much as 40%. The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCE P) has established guidelines for managing cholesterol levels in patients with heart disease. The guidelines established the need for close 126 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Connally Memorial Medical Center monitoring of LDL cholesterol in patients with co ronary heart disease and set a target for LDL-C of less than or equal to 100 mg /dL for such patients. Cholestero l screening and control depends on the combined efforts of patient, physician and organization. Life style factors and new medications offer tangible means for reducing ch olesterol and the risk of heart disease. Relationship to other Projects: This project's focus on treating patients with cardiovascular condi tions and preventing conditions such as heart attack and stoke supports our Category 1 project in our RHP: 135151206.1.1- Expand Specialty Care Capacity. Related Category 4 measures include potentially preventable admissions in RD-1 and Potentially Preventable Complications in RD-3. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: n/a Plan for Learning Collaborative: n/a Project Valuation: Wilson County is underserved by many specialty care providers. The po ssible expansion of Medicaid services in 20 14, with the inherent pent up demand for services, will exacerbate this shortage. Multiple sources of information document a specialty care shortage in many specialties. Many health specialty services have wait times of greater than 2 weeks for the third available appointment, our primary care network is growing rapidly, the northern county area of Wilson and Karnes Counties are rapidly growin g in population. Expanding specialty services will also expand preventive services for patients in this area. Our electronic medical record will allow seamless referrals and co mmunication between our primary care and specialist providers. Additional specialty access will improve the quality of care and health care outcomes in the community. 127 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Connally Memorial Medical Center 135151206.1.1 PASS 1 1.9.1 A, C, D EXPAND HIGH IMPACT SPECIALTY CARE CAPACITY IN MOST IMPACTED SPECIALTIES Connally Memorial Medical Center TPI - 135151206 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 135151206.3.1 3.IT-1.6 Cholesterol management for patients with cardiovascular conditions Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P-1]: Conduct specialty gap assessment based on community need Metric 1 [P-1.1]: Documentation of gap assessment.

Goal and Relationship to regional Goals: The overarching goal of this project is to expa nd primary care to better accommodate the needs of the Wilson County patient population as identi fied by the RHP needs assessment, so that patients have enhanced access to services, allowi ng them to receive the right care at the right time in the right setting. We will work toward achieving that goal by recruiting more primary care providers to Wilson 131 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Connally Memorial Medical Center County, establishing more primary care clinics and implementing an elect ronic health record within these clinics to better coordinate care and referrals from other providers.

Therefore, the baseline number for encounters as well as the participating providers begins at 0 in DY 2. Rationale: CMMC has chosen the project option to establish more primary care clinics . In our current system patients receive services in urgent and em ergent care settings for conditions that could be managed in a more coordinated manner if provide d in the primary care setting. This often results in more costly, less coordinated care and a lack of appropriate follow up care. Patients may experience barriers in accessing prim ary care services se condary to transportation, cost, lack of assigned provider, physical disabi lity, inability to receive appointments in a timely manner and a lack of knowledge about what types of services can be provided in the primary care setting. By enhancing access points, available appointment ti mes, patient awareness of available services and overall primary care capacity, patients and th eir families will align themselves with the primary care system resulting in better health outcome, patient satisfaction, and appropriate utilization and reduced cost of services.

Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-6 Patient Satisfaction IT-6.1 Percent improvement over baseli ne of patient satisfaction scores Reasons/rationale for selecting the outcome measures: The intent of the HCAHPS initiative is to provid e a standardized survey instrument and data collection methodology for measuring patients' pe rspectives on hospital care. The surveys are designed to produce comparable data on the patien t's perspective on care that allows objective and meaningful comparisons between institutions on domains that are important to consumers. Public reporting of the survey results is designed to create incentives for institutions to improve their quality of care. Public repo rting will serve to enhance public accountability in health care by increasing the transparency of the quality of in stitutional care provided in return for the public investment. Relationship to other Projects: This project's focus on patient satisfaction and HCAHPS initiatives supports our Category 1 project in our RHP: 135151206.1.2- Establish mo re primary care clinics.

The hospital serves Dimmit County, population approximately 10,000, across 1,329 square miles. Intervention(s) : The project will expand the range of specialty care services and providers available to our rural population. Increasing access will decrease tran sfers to specialist providers in San Antonio. Need for the project : Currently the hospital has a very high ra te of patient transfers for its size (100/month). This rate is expected to increase as the population c ontinues to grow in response to nearby oil and natural gas operations. A shortage of local specialty providers is the main cause for these transfers with the most notable gap bein g the lack of a general surgeon. Currently these transferred patients travel 100+ miles to San Antonio to for specialty care. Target population : The target population is our patients in need of specialty care. Our current Medicaid inpatient utilization rate is 67% and our low income utilization rate is 70%. Approximately 32% of our population is uninsured. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : Cut the patient transfer ra te in half (to 50/month) through specialty care capacity e xpansion and quality improvements. Currently we are recruiting a general surgeon, an internal medicine phy sician, and a general practitioner. Recruitment into these and other sp ecialties will likely be completed by the end of DY 3. Based on these specialties with the need a nd potential for recruitm ent, we anticipate 2,000 specialty visits and/or procedures by the end of DY 4 for these new specialties. In DY 5 we have set a goal to increase this numb er to 2,500 specialty visits a nd/or procedures for these new specialties. For all specialist providers we expect an average of 2 visits per patient per year. Category 3 outcomes: IT-6.1 Our goal is to improve pa tient satisfaction scores over DY 3 baseline, specifically in regards to the patient 's rating of doctor access to a specialist. Actual percentage improvement goals TBD in DY 3. Project Description: Dimmit Regional Hospital proposes to expand its speci alty care capacity to meet the needs of its growing rural population. Dimmit Regional Hospital (DRH) is seeking to improve access to specialty care for its rural community. DRH is a 45 bed non-profit public hospital owned by Dimmit Regional Hospital District. It is located approxima tely 100 miles southwest of Sa n Antonio. Currently, due to the extremely limited specialty servic es offered by DRH, the patient transfer rate is very high (avg. 100/month). These transferred pati ents are required to drive 1.5 - 2 hours one way for specialty care in San Antonio. This places an undue hardship on a low inco me rural population that is 86% Hispanic. These transfers are an ticipated to increase dramatic ally as the rural population is experiencing a large growth in population, due to the nearby Eagle Ford shale natural gas and oil operations. DRH seeks to eliminate this hard ship on local families by expanding high impact specialty care capacity in the most impacted medical specialties, improving local access to 138 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Dimmit Regional Hospital specialty care. We will reduce patient transfers and reach th e associated Cat. 3 outcome improvement target (improve patient satisfaction scores - patient's rating of doctor access to a specialist) through implementing the project in 4 steps from DY 2 - 5. First, we will conduct a specialty care gap analysis to identify the medical specialties with the highest potential for positive impact on the health of our population, i.e. our greatest community need. This will also establish a baseline for the future steps of our project. Next, we will train care providers and st aff on processes, guidelines and technology for referrals and consultations into selected medical specialties. Then we will increase the number of specialist providers, clin ic hours and/or procedure hours in ta rgeted specialties. During the two years following this expansion in capacity we will attend semi-annual learning collaborative meetings hosted by the RHP 6 anch or facility. At these meetings we will share lessons learned and commit to implementing at least one \"raise the floor\" improvement in itiative each year. We will then assess the impact of these specialty ca re improvement initiatives through ensuring that specialty care patients receive satisfaction surv eys. We will put forward ideas and initiatives aimed at increasing the response ra te of these surveys. These speci alty care patient satisfaction surveys will also allow us to collect accurate data for achie vement of our Cat. 3 outcome improvement target. Goals and Relationship to Regional Goals: Project Goals: Increase access to specialty care in th e local rural community, currently a HPSA Improve patient rating of doctor's access to a specialist (see Cat. 3 improvement target) Reduce the patient financial, health and acce ss costs associated with a high patient transfer rate by cutting this rate in half. Ensure staff are well trained in medical specialty referral guidelines, processes and technology Implement \"best practices\" from semi-a nnual RHP 6 Anchor learning collaborative attendance, improving the quality of specialty care provided. The project meets the following regional goals: Work together to make significant progress towards the Triple Aim goals of assuring patients receive high-quality and patient-cen tered care, in the most effective ways. Improve the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of our region. Further develop and maintain a c oordinated care delivery system. Improve outcomes while containing cost growth. Improving rural access to specialty care in our community will significantly decrease the number of patients that are transferred more than 1.5 hours away to San Antonio for care. The alleviation of this financial hardship for patients within our low-income rural community will better serve the residents of our region. Be tter training of staff and redesi gning clinics for improved cycle time will improve outcomes while containing cost growth. Challenges: In the past, a significant challe nge to supporting greater specialis t capacity has been low patient volumes. However, with the recen t natural gas/oil boo m at the Eagle Ford Shale operation, the Carrizo Springs population is growing rapidly. This growth in population is expected to continue for many years. This presents an opportunity to attract specialists into our community to support 139 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Dimmit Regional Hospital the health needs of our growing population. 5-Year Expected Outcome for Provider and Patients: The 5-year expected or desired outcome is to cut the average rate of transfers in half (to 50/month). This project is related to regiona l goals because it will improve the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured resident s of our region. It will reduce the cost to the patient, the hospital and the payer. This project will achieve this through conducting quality improvement projects using me thods such as rapid cycle improvement and continual project evaluation. Starting Point/Baseline: Improving Rural Access to Specialty Care does not resemble any curren t or previous project we have ever implemented. Each component of the project is unique. Therefore, no baseline has been established at this time. Baselines for each milestone will be established according to the time period outlined below: Milestone 1 [P-1]: Current specialty se rvices: podiatry, pediatric de ntistry, ENT and cardiology. Most notable gap is lack of a general surg eon. Timeline: baseline will be established upon completion of the specialty care gap assessment in DY 2. Milestone 2 [P-2]: 0, a training program of this kind has never been implemented prior to this project. Timeline: DY 2 Milestone 3 [P-2]: 50% of staff and providers trained in referr al guidelines, process and technology. Timeline: baseline is derived from Milestone 2 goal achievement in DY 2. Milestone 4 [I-22]: Currently 4 specialis t providers. Timeline: DY 2, Baseline may change if any DY 2 provider changes occur. Milestone 5 [P-21]: 0, attendance at RHP 6 anchor learning collaborati ves or implementation of \"raise the floor\" improvement initiatives has never occurred previously. Milestone 6 [ I-23]: TBD in DY 3 after accomplishment of I-22) Milestone 7 [I-27]: 0, patient satisfaction surveys have not been sent to specialty clinic patients prior to the implementation of this project. Milestone 8 [P-21]: 2 meetings attended in DY 4 with at least 1 \"raise th e floor\" improvement initiative implemented. Milestone 9 [I-23]: TBD in DY 3 after accomplishment of I-22) Milestone 10 [I-27]: 60% received surveys in DY 4 (b ased on Milestone 7 goal achievement in DY 4), Rationale: The primary reason this project option wa s selected is the overwhelming need in the community for specialty care providers. DRH curre ntly offers: podiatry, pediatric dentistry, ENT and cardiology. The lack of a general surgeon is one notable gap in specialty services. The limited number of specialty servic es offered by DRH has caused the patient transfer rate to be very high for a small rural hospital (avg. 100/mont h). Many of these patient s have to drive 1.5 - 2 hours one way for specialty care in San Antoni o. This places an undue hardship on our low income rural population that is 86% Hispanic. These transfers are antic ipated to increase dramatically. The population of our rural commun ity is experiencing large growth associated with the nearby Eagle Ford shale natural gas operation. The selected milestones and metrics were chosen according to what addressed the DRH patient population needs with the highest degree of impact. Increasing sp ecialty care capacity while ensuring proper training will improve the quality of care while avoiding future costs 140 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Dimmit Regional Hospital associated with untrained staff. In DY 4-5, the improvement milestones were chosen to focus on patient satisfaction with increased access to higher quality specialty care services. This keeps the focus on the patient experience, quality of care and cost. Project Components: Through \"Improving Rural Access to Specialty Care\", we propose to meet all required project components, except for component B. A. Identify high impact/most impac ted specialty services and gap s in care and coordination. This component will be accomplished in DY 2. We plan to hire a third-party healthcare consultant to perform this specialty care ga p assessment. The results of this assessment will establish a firm baseline for our project in those specialty care areas where there are gaps in coverage. Currently there are only 4 specialty care providers in the following areas: podiatry, pediatric dentistry, ENT and cardiology. A notable gap in specialty care is the lack of a general surgeon. B. Increase the number of residents/trainees choosing targeted shortage specialties. This project component will not be a ddressed in this project. The reason this component is left out is because of the small size of the hospital (45 license d beds) and its rural location (100+ miles southwest of San Antonio). Cu rrently our facility does not have the resources, space or staff to provide resi dencies for physicians. Not only this, local housing for these residents would be extremel y difficult to find, c onsidering the recent natural gas/oil boom. Also, completing this project component is unrealistic given the few specialists available in our area to provide such training. C. Design workforce enhancement initiatives to support access to specialty providers in underserved markets and areas (recruitment and retention). Our community is an underserved market considering the lack of sp ecialty care services and its designation as a HPSA. We plan to meet this project co mponent through two different implementation steps. First we will train care providers and staff on processes, guidelines and technology for referrals and consultations into selected me dical specialties. Then we will increase the number of specialist provid ers, clinic hours and/or procedure hours in targeted specialties. This will occur in DY 2 and DY 3. D. Conduct quality improvement for project using methods such as rapid cycle improvement. We plan to meet this project com ponent through partic ipating in face-to- face learning (i.e. meetings or seminars) at least twice per year with other providers and the RHP. These meetings will be to promot e collaborative learning around shared or similar projects. We will then implement at least one \"raise the floor\" improvement initiatives established at the semia nnual meeting per year for DY 4 and 5. Unique community need identificati on numbers the project addresses: CN.1 - Texas ranks last in the nation on hea lth care quality. RHP 6 is challenged to deliver improved quality a nd patient satisfaction. CN.3 - Many residents in RHP 6 lack access to medical and dental care due to high rates of uninsurance and health care provider shortages. Currently residents of DRH's serv ice region do not have access to mo st specialty services, due to severe shortage of local specia lty care providers. Implementati on of \"Improving Rural Access to Specialty Care\" address; the triple aim goals of the waiver, the RHP 6 goal of improving the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of the region, and addresses a severe specialty provi der shortage area. This project will help alleviate an ongoing financial hardship on our 86% Hispan ic, Medicaid and uninsured population. 141 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Dimmit Regional Hospital Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-6 Patient Satisfaction IT-6.1 Percent improvement over baseline of patie nt satisfaction scores (all questions within a survey need to be answered to be a stand-alone measure) (3) patient's rating of doc tor access to a specialist Reasons/rationale for select ing the outcome measures: The selected Category 3 outcome measure is dire ctly linked to the improvement milestones in DY 4-5 for the 1.9.1 project option that was chos en. Implementing \"Improving Rural Access to Specialty Care\" is directly relate d to the patient's view of how easy it is for him or her to access a specialist. Focusing on this outcome will he lp the Medicaid and uninsured population have better and better access to local specialty care. This will directly impact patients, most of whom cannot afford to travel 100 miles or more into San Antonio for care. Also, patients are more likely to receive specialty care faster than if they had scheduled an appointment at a large facility in San Antonio. DRH understands a nd is better equipped to meet th e needs of its population than specialty care providers 100 miles to the northeast in San Antonio. Relationship to other Projects: The primary way this project supports, reinforces and enables other projects in the RHP is its contribution towards the RHP 6 goals. Implem enting \"Improving Rural Access to Specialty Care\" will improve the health care infrastructure and better serve our Medicaid and uninsured population. It will do this by expandi ng specialty care capacity to reduce a severe shortage of providers while focusing on patie nt satisfaction. Increasing the cap acity for local specialty care providers and training for their staff will help develop a coordinated care delivery system. This is another RHP 6 goal. Most importantly, this proj ect achieves the triple aim waiver goals of assuring patients receive high-quality and patient-cente red care in the most cost effective way.

Project Valuation: Of all potential DSRIP projects consider ed, DRH has chosen \"Improving Rural Access to Primary Care\". This project scored high in all cat egories used to assess project value to the RHP and to our community. Categorie s included in the valuation pr ocess included: project scope, achieves waiver goals, and addresses community n eeds and project investment. These categories were assigned by University Hea lth System, the RHP 6 anchor. In addition to valuing potential projects base d on these 4 areas, the project selected fills the most pressing and important community healthca re need. The population of the service region is growing rapidly. Currently, an average of 100 pa tient transfers/month to San Antonio (over 100 miles+ away) are occurring at DRH. This is num ber is expected to cl imb exponentially as the population grows to accommodate workers moving for the Eagle Ford shale natural gas boom. The population needs local providers of high impact specialty care services to remain healthy, lower their costs and overcome geographic isolation. A detailed outline of the costs associated w ith each component, including the cost of recruiting specialty providers, cannot be reliably assessed at this time. This will be assessed after process milestone 1.1 is achieved. Achievement of this m ilestone will identify high need specialty care shortages and recommend specialty care services with the most im pact for the patient population. 143 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Dimmit Regional Hospital 112690603.1.1 PASS 1 1.9.1 1.9.1.

Unique RHP ID#: 112690603.1.2 - PASS 2 Performing Provider: Dimmit Regi onal Hospital (previously Dimm it County Memorial Hospital) Performing Provider TPI: 217884001 Project Summary: Provider Description : Dimmit Regional Hospital (previ ously Dimmit County Memorial Hospital) is a 45-bed hospital located in Ca rrizo Springs, TX. The hospital serves Dimmit County, population approximately 10,000, across 1,329 square miles. Intervention(s) : This project will introduce an urgent medical advice line while simultaneously creating a \"fast track\" triage system for the ED. These changes will decrease ED wait times. Need for the project : Currently the average time between wh en an ED patient arrives and when he or she is seen by a physician is 90 minutes . This time has the potential to increase as the population continues to grow in response to nearby oil and na tural gas operations. We are already seeing more trauma cases in the ED as a re sult of this growth and type of employment. A higher number of trauma cases results in a l onger wait for ED patients with non-emergent medical conditions. Target population : The target population is our ED patie nts with non-emergent conditions. Our target population also includes patie nts who could be seen in a prim ary care clinic instead of the ED for their urgent medical condition. Providing greater access to same-day primary care appointments through an urgent medical advice line would decrease ED volume. Our current Medicaid inpatient utilization rate is 67% and our low income utilization rate is 70%. Approximately 32% of our population is uninsured. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project will reduce the average \"door to doc\" time in our ED from 90 minutes to 60 minutes by the end of DY 4. In DY 4, we have set a goal to reduce this baseline 90 minute wait time (current DY 2 baseline time) to no longer than an average of 45 minutes. Typically our ED averag es 11,000 admissions per year . If each of these patients wait for 90 minutes (our current average), this amounts to 16,500 hours or 1.88 years of total wait time to see a doctor. However, if by DY 5 we cut this wait time to an average of 45 minutes, this equates to a 50% re duction in \"door to doc\" time in our ED. This translates into an additional 8,250 hours or 344 total days our ED pa tients have outside of our emergency room. This has a very real impact on the health and well-being of our populatio n. In addition to this benefit, lower acuity patients will utilize a new urgent medical advice line while higher acuity patients will benefit from a more effective and efficient ED. Category 3 outcomes: IT-9.2 - Our goal is to reduce all ED visits. The actual percent reduction in ED visits realized in DY 4 and DY 5 is TBD in DY 3. Project Description: Dimmit Regional Hospital proposes to reduce ED wait times by reducing the number of ED patient visits for non-emergent conditions thro ugh a new urgent medical advice line and through a new ED fast-track system. Dimmit Regional Hospital (DRH) is seeking to improve access to urgent care for its rural community. DRH is a 45 bed non-profit public hospital owned by Dimmit Regional Hospital District. It is located approxi mately 100 miles southwest of San Antonio. Currently the rural population is experiencing a large growth in popul ation, due to the nearby Eagle Ford shale 148 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Dimmit Regional Hospital natural gas and oil operations. The nature of the work performed and the work environment these individuals are exposed to has caused a dramatic increase in the number of ED patients with acute, emergent conditions. This has resulted in excessive wait times for ED patients with non- emergent conditions. The proposed project will develop clinical protocols for an urgent medical advice line within the first year (DY 2). A vetting process will also be established for these protocols within RHP 6. After these protocols are developed, ED nurses w ill be trained on these clinical protocols. ED nurses will be assigned to staff this urgent medical advice li ne. Finally, in this first year an assessment will be conducted on ED workforce needs for an ED \"fast track\" system. The plan for such a system will be developed along with its implementation timeline. During the second year of the project (DY 3), ED patients will be informed and educated with regards to the urgent medical advi ce line. The goal is to have at least 10% of ED patients seen in this year informed about the urgent medical advice line, with at least 5% who utilize it in the first year. Also, the number of mid-level providers in the ED will be in creased to support the implementation of the ED \"fast track\" system during this year. In the third and fourth years of the project (DY 4 - DY 5), the project performance will be measured based on advice line utilization and the average \"door to doc\" ED patient waiting times. It is our goal to increase utilization of the advice line wh ile decreasing average \"door to doc\" times substantially during these two years. Goals and Relationship to Regional Goals: Project Goals: Increase access to primary care in the local rural community, currently a HPSA Reduce utilization of the ED by pa tients with non-eme rgent conditions Reduce the average time spent wa iting for care by ED patients Improve the patient experience and qualit y through reducing cycle time while improving provider productivity. The project meets the following regional goals: Work together to make significant progress towards the Triple Aim goals of assuring patients receive high-quality and patient-cen tered care, in the most effective ways. Improve the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of our region. Further develop and maintain a c oordinated care delivery system. Improve outcomes while containing cost growth This project and its goals cont ribute toward achieving regional goa ls. The project will achieve these through educating patients on the benefit of utilizing primar y care services (clinics and the urgent medical advice line) instead of ED servic es. Nurses will triage patients to primary care clinics based on developed, vetted clinical protocols. Also, it will improve patient satisfaction and quality of care through reduced wait times. This will improve efficiency and outcomes while reducing cost. Finally the urgent medical advice line will increase access to primary care advice and emergent care (when necessary - ED fast trac k) during times when lo cal primary care clinics are closed. Challenges: Currently, the average time between patient arrival in the ED a nd being seen by a physician is 90 minutes. Without an urgent medi cal advice line coupled with an ED \"fast track\" system, this average wait time is expected to increase dramatically. Already ED physicians are experiencing a 149 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Dimmit Regional Hospital higher rate of trauma patients. This is a direct result of working conditions experienced by those employed by companies taking advantage of the lo cal Eagle Ford natural gas and oil boom. This high rate of trauma patients (expected to increas e with the projected growth of the population) has already caused ED patients with non-emergent conditions to experience wait times that are excessive. 5-Year Expected Outcome for Provider and Patients: The five year expected outcomes for Dimmit Re gional Hospital and for our patients are: a 50% reduction in average patient \"door to doc\" time in the ED, at least 15% of DY 5 ED patients have used the urgent medical advice line on at leas t one or more occasions, and at least 45% of patients who respond to the urgent medical advice line survey re port advice was appropriate. This project is related to regional goals because it will improve the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsur ed residents of our region. It will reduce the cost to the patient, the hospital and the payer. This proj ect will achieve this through conducting quality improvement projects suggested during the semi-annual RHP 6 learning collaboratives and continual project evaluation. Starting Point/Baseline: Baselines for Process Milestones are effectiv ely 0 at this time as this project is new for Dimmit Regional Hospital. There is not currently a ny similar project in our service region as we are the only hospital within our rural community. Baselines for process milestones extending to DY 4 and DY 5 will be set in DY 2 and/or DY 3. Baselines for Improvement Milestones are listed below: The average ED \"door to doc\" time is approximately 90 minutes. The [I-13] - 0, The baseline will be established by the end of DY 2 after the ED nurse advice line has been implemented [I-15] - 0, no advice line currently ex ists. Survey would begin in DY 4 [I-X] - 90 minute ED patient \"doo r to doc\" time average in DY 2. Rationale: A reduced ED waiting time is important b ecause it reduces the number of patients who leave without being seen (LWOBS). This ensure s compliance under EMTALA. An urgent medical advice line will reduce wait times by providing a s ource of medical advice for patients with non- emergent medical conditions. Our hospital is loca ted within a designated Healthcare Professional Shortage Area (HPSA). This creates a high percenta ge of patients that do not have access to a primary care physician. However, the area is growing and primary capacity expansion is moving forward. An urgent medical advice line will facili tate access to primary while also aiding patients during times when primary care clinics aren't open. Despite the high potential for impact the urgent medical advice line will have on our population, Dimmit Regional Hospital anticipates a re gular flow of non-emergent patients in the ED. This is due to a 32% average rate of unins ured residents combined with the low per capita income level throughout our rural community. Also, the increase in primary care capacity will be gradual; it will take time for the supply of pr imary care physicians to catch up to the high demand in our community. The selected milestones and metrics were chosen according to what addressed the DRH patient population needs with the hi ghest degree of impact. Project Components: a. Develop a process (including a call center) that in a timely manner triages patients 150 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Dimmit Regional Hospital seeking primary care services in the ED to an alternate primary care site. Survey patients who use the nurse advice line to ensure patient satisfaction with the services received. This component will be included in the proj ect by achieving process milestones: P-1, P-3, P-5, and P-6. A patient satisfac tion survey will be sent to patients who utilize the nurse advice line with goals to improve scores in DY 4 and DY 5 (improvement milestone I- 15). b. Enhance linkages between primary care, urge nt care, and Emergency Departments in order to increase communication and im prove care transitions for patients. This component will be included in the proj ect by the achievement of these process milestones: P-1, P-3, P-5, and P-6. c. Conduct quality improvement for project using methods such as rapid cycle improvement. This component will be included in the project by the achievement of these process and improvement milestones: P- 1, I-13, I-15 and I-X. The achievement of improvement milestone I-X is especially critic al to reducing cycle time of ED processes, impacting patient wait times. Unique community need identificati on numbers the project addresses: CN.1 - Texas ranks last in the nation on hea lth care quality. RHP 6 is challenged to deliver improved quality a nd patient satisfaction. CN.3 - Many residents in RHP 6 lack access to medical and dental care due to high rates of un-insured and health care provider shortages. Currently residents of DRH's se rvice region lack sufficient access to primary care services as they live within a rural community and a designate d HPSA. This project woul d be the first of its kind in our region. An urgent medi cal advice line, if successful, has the potential to be adopted by rural hospital in nearby communities. This would decrease ED admits for non-emergent conditions throughout the rural service areas of RH P 6. Implementation of this project addresses; the triple aim goals of the waiver, the RHP 6 goal of improving the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsur ed residents of the region. This project will help alleviate an ongoing financial hardship on our 86% Hispan ic, Medicaid and uninsured rural population. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-9: Right Care, Right Setting IT-9.2 - Reduce all unnecessary ED visits (including ACSC) Reasons/rationale for select ing the outcome measures: The selected Category 3 outcome measure is dire ctly linked to the improvement milestones in DY 4-5: [I-13], [I-15], [I-X]. Th e [I-13] milestone ensures that utilization of the urgent medical advice line by ED patients is increasing over ti me. This will lead to fewer unnecessary ED admits or fewer patients who visit the ED for non-emergent conditions and higher community utilization of primary care services . The [I-15] milestone ensures th at patients' trust in the advice provided by the nurse is increasing over time. This will lead to fewer unnecessary ED admits or fewer patients who visit the ED for non-emergent conditions and higher comm unity utilization of primary care services. Also this milestone wi ll provide the opportunity to evaluate the performance of nurses assigned to staff the urge nt medical advice line, including how well they are following established clinical protocols. The [I-X] milestone will ensure that ED wait times 151 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Dimmit Regional Hospital are significantly reduced. This will allow for higher quality care, higher patient satisfaction and reduced ED length of stay. Th is will free up ED physicians to spend more time on caring for patients with emergent conditions. The \"fast track\" system used to achieve a shorter cycle time (decreased patient waiting times) will also allow for an opportun ity to inform patients of the urgent medical advice line. Relationship to other Projects: The primary way this project supports, reinforces, enables and is related to other projects and interventions within the RHP plan are through contribution to RHP 6 goa ls. The project will achieve these by educating patients on the benefit of utilizing primary care services (clinics and the urgent medical advice line) instead of ED serv ices. Nurses will also triage patients to primary care clinics based on developed, vetted clinical protocols. Also, it will improve patient satisfaction and quality of care through reduced wait times. This will improve efficiency and outcomes while reducing cost. Related Category 4 Population-focused measures: RD-1: Potentially Preventable Admissions RD-4: Patient-centered Healthcare RD-5: Emergency Department Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: We are not aware of any other provider s in the RHP proposing similar projects. Plan for Learning Collaborative: DRH plans to participate in an RHP-wide lear ning collaborative with other providers with similar projects. RHP 6 is committed to transf orming health care in our region and throughout the state. Given the large number and value of projects proposed for our region, University Health System, as the RHP 6 anchor, will prom ote and facilitate learning collaboratives. Following completion of the RHP Plan, University H ealth System will facilitate the formation of working groups of performing providers who are pursuing similar projects. These working groups will develop their learning collaborative structure which may include the following:\" -Identify participants -Establish Learning Collaborative goals -Develop a calendar of regular meetings, site visits, and/or conference calls -Develop a plan to communicate ideas, data, and successes across th e region and state -Organize a learning event and in vite experts and othe r Performing Providers from outside the region to share knowledge and best practices -Adopt metrics to measure success DRH plans to be a significant part of learning collaboratives with other performing providers with similar projects. Project Valuation: This project scored high in all categories used to assess project value to the RHP and to our community. Categories included in the valuatio n process included: project scope, achieves waiver goals, and addresses community needs an d project investment. Dimmit Regional Hospital also values each project based on the following f actors: the potential im pact on health of our population, the resources necessary to implem ent the project, and level of improvement 152 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Dimmit Regional Hospital anticipated in overall patient satisfaction. Dimm it Regional Hospital also took into account the extent to which reducing ED wa iting times and reducing the volume of non-emergent ED patient visits would potentially meet the goa ls of the region and the Waiver. 153 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Dimmit Regional Hospital 112690603.1.2 PASS 2 1.6.2 1.6.2.

Intervention(s) : This project will expand access to primary care by recruiting additional physicians, building new clinic space and incr easing efficiencies in clinic offices. Need for the project : There is a serious lack of primary care in these counties, resulting in a number of inefficiencies in healthcare deliver y. Chronic care management results with a high percentage of patients with uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease. Target population : The target population is our patient s needing primary care appointments without having to wait for 4 - 6 weeks. About 1/3 of our community lives below the poverty line, and we expect that they will be better able to access primary care. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : We seek to increase office times so that patients can access care after normal business hours and on weeke nds. It is hoped to decrease the wait time for an appointment by at least 1 week. We anticipate in DY 4 for the new primary care provi der we recruit in DY 2 to have an estimated panel size of at least 1,800 patients. With this panels size, we are setting a goal in DY 4 of 3,600 visits or 1,800 patients X average of 2 visits pe r patient = 3,600 visits. However, since the new primary care provider's panel size may grow at a slower rate than anticipated, we will also lengthen clinic hours. Patient visits during these ex tended hours will be included in this total. In DY 5 we expect our new primary care provider's pa nel to have grown to at least 2,000 patients. Resulting from this panel size we expect at le ast 4,000 visits in DY 5. Ag ain, visits made during extended clinic hours will be included. Category 3 outcomes: Our goals are to increase the number of diabetes management measures such as retinal eye examina tion, foot examination and mi croalbumin/neuropathy test. Project Description: DSRIP Project 1.1.2, \"Expand Primary Care Capacity \" is important to Frio County because of poor access to primary care in our area. Many un treated conditions increase in acuity. This overloads available emergency services. Project Goals: The project will increa se opportunities to obtain primary care by increasing the number of physicians, physician assistants and nurse practitioners. This necessi tates an increase in available office space to house clinics. Additional training w ill be provided to clinic office staff to enable better scheduling of patient appointments and re ducing the number of \"no shows\". Improving for primary care, will enable patients to avoid the em ergency room, resulting in fewer transfers to tertiary facilities for additional services. This project will meet the following regional goals: The project will encourage working together to make significant progress towards the Triple Aim goals of assuring patients receiv e high-quality and pa tient-centered, in the most effective ways 158 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Frio Regional Hospital The project will improve the health care infras tructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of our region. The project will further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system. Finally the project will improve outcomes while containing cost growth. The project achieves an improved infrastructure for Medicaid and uninsured residents through increasing primary care capacity. The project will increase capacity by ex panding the number of primary care clinics and/or expanding existing sp ace/hours. The project develops and maintains a coordinated care delivery system through impr ovements in EHR, HIT and communication systems. The project improves outcomes while containing cost growth by providing access to primary care providers. Patients who now rely on the emergency room for primary care will then have access to a less costly and mo re appropriate mode of care. Challenges: Frio County is designated as a \"Health Professional Shortage Area.\" Because of the payer mix, it has been difficult to recruit physicians as well as other health professi onals. This presents a major challenge. Frio Regional Ho spital will increase its' efforts to recruit physicians, employing professional recruiters to do so. Another obstacle is the lack of training among clinic employees on scheduling patients. As electr onic medical records are implem ented, and additional training is provided, this will improve efficiencies. There is al so a lack of available clinic space, so either new construction or refurbishing of existing space is necessary. Expected Outcome for Provider and Patients in 5 Years: Our aim is to improve the ability of patients to access primary care by in creasing the numbers of physicians and mid-level providers , improving clinic staff efficien cy and providing more clinic space. Achieving this goal should reduce our non- emergent ED patient volume by 15 to 20% by the end of DY 5. Clinical outcomes we expect to be significantly improved in five years are those related to the management of prevalent chronic diseases specifi c to our population. We have reflected this expected patient benefit and impact by sel ecting Category 3 improvement targets centered on improving diabetes care by in creasing: retinal eye exams, foot exams, microalbumin/nephropathy screenings. 159 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Frio Regional Hospital Starting Point/Baseline: Between October 1. 2011 and September 30, 2012 area pr imary care clinics ha d patient visits of roughly 38,000. The community is served by 6 F TE Family Practice Physicians and I FTE OB/Gyn. Given the population of Frio County of 16,163 the number of family practitioners should number 18 FTE's. Based on these calcul ations, another 12 Family Practitioners are needed. There are 2 Physician Assistants and 2 Nurse Practitioners. In addition, there are 26 employed by these primary care clinics. Some offices utilize electronic medical records and some do not. None of those menti oned are trained in this project. Rationale: Frio County is medically underser ved as are most counties in RHP 6. There is a shortage of physicians and other health professionals. Our community has a significant amount of diabetes, obesity, heart disease, and hype rtension. Untreated, these chroni c conditions lead to further complications. A main source of he alth education is th e clinic office. With a physician shortage, it is difficult to address and manage chronic c onditions. This is further complicated by high levels of uninsured. Thirty percent of the populat ion lives below the poverty line. Many work for small businesses that cannot afford to provide health care benefits. This tr anslates to 25% of the population being uninsured. In gene ral the citizens of the area tend to less educated and have a lower per capita income. The statistics of Frio County ar e consistent with RHP 6. This re gion is noted for high uninsured rates and poor health outcomes. Our population is 54% Hispanic and 37% Anglo. In Frio County it is approximately 76% Hispanic and 24% Angl o. Geographically, around 61% of RHP is rural and \"feeds\" the tertiary systems in San Ant onio. Because of the lack of primary care management, many acute worsen and require transf ers to tertiary center emergency departments. The region is undergoing an \"oil boom\" which ha s attracted new people to the area. It is expected to tax existing resources to expand services. The area ha s been challenged in attracting primary care physicians and mid-level practitioners . An expansion in healthcare coverage could have a significant impact on maki ng recruitment more attractive. To reiterate from earlier, there are three aspects to our project: A) Recruit primary care physician s and mid-level practitioners to allow for expanded and extended hours of service. B) Increase Clinic Space to accommodate th e increase in medical professionals C) Provide training to Clinic Staff to enable gr eater efficiencies in scheduling and providing appointments, including extende d office hours for follow-up care. The project addresses the a bove stated needs for our area and RHP 6, especially: CN.3 Many residents of RHP 6 lack access to medi cal and dental care due to high rates of uninsurance and health ca re providers shortages. Process milestones selected were: 1. P-4 - Expand the hours of a primary care clinic , including evening and/or weekend hours, and P-4.1 will be the metric increasing hour s over the baseline. Current operating hours for the area primary care clinics is 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM Monday through Friday. There are no appointments available after hours or on weekends. 160 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Frio Regional Hospital 2. P-5 - Train, hire additional primary care providers and staff as evidenced by P-5.1 Documentation of increased numbers of provi ders and staff in Pearsall, Dilley and Cotulla. The improvement target selected is (1.1.2) I-12 w ith the milestone to be the increase in clinic visits as evidenced by improved access. I-12.1 - Will be documentation of increased visits I-12.2 - Documentation of the number of uni que patients or size of patient panels. This will significantly improve the general standards of care by management of chronic conditions. Better access to medical care will in crease opportunities to educate patients on becoming more compliant with treatment. The cost of not managing chronic conditions is reflected in use of the emergency services both locally and by transfer. Specifically, diabetes management is being targeting as a response to community input. It is es timated that nearly a third of the population is either diabetic or at risk of devel oping diabetes. Better management will reduce the overall cost of providing care. Related Category 3 Outcome Measures(s) We have chosen 3 non-stand- al one measures from Category 3: Outcome Domain - 1 (Primary Care and Chronic Disease Management) IT - 1.12 Diabetes Care; Retinal Eye Exam 1.13 Diabetes Foot Care exam 1.14 Diabetic Ca re: Microalbumin / Neuropathy Frio County has a high inciden ce of diabetes. This condition creates complication in other conditions causing a strain on local resources. In creased access to primary care should result in better management of diabetes and its complications. Relationship to other Projects: 1.1.2 - Expanding Primary Care Capacity provide s a foundation to numerous other 1115 Waiver Projects across various categories. Without proper access to primar y care almost any of the other projects would be difficult to accomplish. It relates to other projects as follows: 2.2- Expansion of the chronic care management model seeks to reduce unnecessary acute and emergency room utilization by of easy access to primary care. Primary care can better manage chronic conditions such as hypertensio n, obesity and diabetes. Timely screenings identify conditions at an early stage that permit better management and leads to a more efficient use of resources. 2.3 - Redesign Primary Care - Expansion of the chronic care management model above places more demands on PCP's and their clinics to provide easy access. Timely screening for early detection of chronic condi tions requires efficient schedu ling. Expansion of primary care capacity increases the likelihood of this outcome. 2.4 - \"Redesign to improve Patient Experience\" depends upon easy access to primary care. A major frustration is the long wait time for a ppointments, up to 6 weeks. Expanding primary care capacity reduces wait times, making it easie r for patients to remember appointments. \"No shows\" decrease the patient experience. Category 1.1.2 \"Increasing Traini ng of Primary Care Workforce\" directly relates to expanding 161 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Frio Regional Hospital primary care capacity in that an adequate primary care physician staff with support staff enables the primary care physician and mid-level providers to see more patients and schedule necessary screenings. 1.3 - \"Implement a Chronic Disease Management Re gistry\" indirectly relates in that chronic disease requires adequate primary care to manage the chronic disease. 1.10 - \"Enhance Performance Improvement and Reporting Capacity\". Performance improvement processes will be integrated to th e expansion of primary care capacity and the category 3 outcomes of screenings for diabe tic patients. Since these activities are major component to clinic efficiency, education will be provided to physicia ns and their staffs. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Methodist Hospital System Southwest General Hospital University Hospital Baptist Medical Center University of Texas Health Sc ience Center at San Antonio Guadalupe Regional Medical Center Children's Hospital of San Antonio Medina Regional Hospital Peterson Regional Medical Center Val Verde Regional Medical Center Plan for Learning Collaborative: University Health System in San Antonio as the anchor hospital for RHP 6 is promoting and organizing learning collaborative. Frio Regional Hospital will participate with those hospitals performing similarly related projects to networ k and share best practi ces and solutions. Project Valuation: Out of all potential DSRIP pr ojects considered, Frio Regional Hospital has chosen DSRIP Project 1.1.2, \"Expand Primary Care Capacity\". This project received a sc ore of 5 on a scale of 1-5 in all categories used to assess project va lue to the RHP and to our community.

Unique RHP ID#: 112688002.1.2 - PASS 2 Performing Provider: Frio Regional Hospital Performing Provider TPI: 112688002 Project Summary: Provider Description : Frio Regional Hospital is a 22 bed hospital located in Pearsall, Texas serving Frio and LaSalle Counties with a combined population of approximately 25, 000. Intervention(s) : This project will implement telemedicine to provide patient consultations by a cardiologist for inpatient, outpa tient and emergent situations. Need for the project : There is no resident cardiologist and patients must wait for a visiting cardiologist or travel to San Antonio for consultation. This wi ll provide a more timely delivery of care to our patients. Target population : The target population is our patients needing cardiology consults. About 1/3 of our population lives below the poverty level and this program will make it easier for them to access cardiology services. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : We expect to provide 100 telemedicine cardiology consults in DY4 and 200 in DY5. The rate of cons ults per patient is expected to average between 1 and 2 consults per patient per year. We expect to reduce the number of transfers and improve the quality of care delive red to our inpatients. Category 3 outcomes: We expect to reduce the number of readmissions for patients diagnosed with congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease. Project Description: DSRIP Project 1.7.1, \"Implement tele medicine program to provide or expand specialist referral services in cardiology\" is important to Frio County because of the high incidence of cardiac disease in our area. Most patients presenting in the emergency department with heart problems, must be shipped to other facili ties because of the lack of cardiac assessment. The goal is to provide cardiac consults via te lemedicine with a San Antoni o based cardiologist in our emergency department so that patients receiv e care in a timely manner. Prompt and accurate diagnosis can reduce complications. Prompt treat ment improves patient outcomes. It can also prevent unnecessary transfers which can overload available emergency serv ices in San Antonio as well as ambulance services. Additional training will be provided to emergency room staff to assist the cardiologist making the diagnosis. Frio County is designated as a \"health professi onal shortage area\". Because of the payer mix, it has been difficult to recruit primary care physicians , not to mention cardiologi sts. This presents a major challenge. Frio Regional Hospital will increase its' efforts to recruit an internal medicine physician, employing professional recruiters to do so. This will provide back-up support for the cardiologist on site. However, recruitment w ill take time and with the projected population growth will continue to strain the emergency depa rtment. Another obstacle is the lack of training among emergency department nursing staff in conducting cardiologist directed patient 164 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Frio Regional Hospital examination. As electronic medical records are implemented, and a dditional training is provided, this will improve efficiencies. There is also a lack of available space for increasing demand, so that new construction may be necessary. There have been issues with the local EMS in the past in terms of coordi nation care between patient pick- up and arrival at the emergency department. A new EMS has been hired by Frio C ounty and it will be necessary to work closely with them to develop protocols. It will be nece ssary to better coordinate care with the local nursing home as well. Our aim is improve the patients outcomes in cardiac events by improving the assessment process. This project will meet the following regional goals: The project will encourage working together to make significant progress towards the Triple Aim goals of assuring patients receiv e high-quality and pa tient-centered, in the most effective ways The project will improve the health care infras tructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of our region. The project will further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system. Finally the project will improve outcomes while containing cost growth. The project achieves an improve d infrastructure for Medicaid and uninsured residents by providing access to specia lists who otherwise would only be av ailable after traveling 70+ miles to San Antonio. The project develops and mainta ins a coordinated care delivery system through improving the link between primary care physicia ns, patients and specialists. The project improves outcomes while containing cost grow th by creating an alternative to specialist recruitment to our rural area. This project ai ms to improve outcomes through greater access to specialists, specifically reducing 30 day re -admission rates for CHF and CAD (Cat. 3 improvement targets). Starting Point/Baseline: Currently, there is no on-site sp ecialist assessment of patients in our emergency department. Consultations occur between the emergency room physician and the appropriate physician in the facility accepting the referral. We have a cardiol ogist who visits the community every week and would like to provide assessments via telemedicine . We have to develop appropriate training as well as policies and procedures to provide this service. Rationale: As evidenced in the RHP Community Needs Assessm ent, access to (or lack of) specialty care is a serious issue in Texas, especially in rural pa rts of Texas. The following Community Needs are specifically related to this project and we re identified locally in Frio as well: CN.1 Texas ranks last in the nation on health care quality. RHP 6 is challenged to deliver improved quality and patient satisfaction. 165 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Frio Regional Hospital CN.2 A high prevalence of chronic disease and related health disparities require greater prevention efforts and improved management of patients with chronic conditions. Leading causes of death in RH P 6 include cardiovascular di sease, cancer, and diabetes. CN.3 Many residents of RHP 6 l ack access to medical and dental care due to high rates of uninsurance and health care provider shortages. One of the greatest challenges across the nation a nd especially in RHP 6 to provide quality care in rural areas which don't have access to spec ialty physicians. Frio County is medically underserved as are most counties in RHP 6 and has no resident specialists. Th ere is a shortage of physicians and other health professionals. The us e of technology to deliver health care from a distance, or telemedicine, has been demonstrat ed as an effective way of overcoming certain barriers to such as exist in rura l areas. With a physician shortage , it is difficult to address and manage chronic conditions. This is further co mplicated by high levels of uninsured. Thirty percent of the population lives below the povert y line. Many work for small businesses that cannot afford to provide health care benefits. This translates to 25% of the population being uninsured. In general the citizens of the area tend to less educat ed and have a lower per capita income. Telemedicine can ease the gaps in prov iding crucial care for those who are underserved, principally because of a shortage of sub-specialty providers. The statistics of Frio County ar e consistent with RHP 6. This re gion is noted for high uninsured rates and poor health outcomes. Our population in RHP 6 is 54% Hispanic and 37% Anglo. In Frio County it is approximately 76% Hispanic and 24% Anglo. Geographically, around 61% of RHP is rural and \"feeds\" the tert iary systems in San Antonio. Becau se of the lack of primary care management, many acute worsen and require transfer s to tertiary center emergency departments. Frio County has a high percentage of its popul ation categorized having cardiac conditions. A more efficient method of processing patient thro ugh put in the emergency department will reduce unnecessary transfers and better coordinate with local primary care physicians. The region is undergoing an \"oil boom\" which ha s attracted new people to the area. It is expected to tax existing resources to expand services. The area ha s been challenged in attracting primary care physicians and mid- level practitioners which has led to excessive use of the emergency department. An expansion in healthca re coverage could have a significant impact on making recruitment, both in primary care and emergency care, more attractive. The project option selected was: 1.7.1 Implement telemedicine program to provide or expand specialist re ferral services in an area identified as needed to the region. Required core project components: a) Provide patient consultations by medical a nd surgical specialists as well as other types of health professional s using telecommunications b) Conduct quality improvement for projec ts using methods such as rapid cycle improvement. Activities may include, but are not limited to, identifying project impacts, identifying \"lessons learned\", opportuni ties to scale all or part of the project 166 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Frio Regional Hospital to a broader patient population, and iden tifying key challenges associated with expansion of the project, including special considerations for sa fety-net populations. This will significantly improve the general standards of care provided in the emergency department. More efficient throughput will impr ove improvement coordination of chronic care between the primary care physicians and the emergency department. The overall goal of the proposed telehealth projec ts is to reduce disparities in access, outcome, cost and satisfaction that are cr eated by geographic barriers. Speci fically, we hope to achieve the following goals: 1.) Increase the knowledge and capaci ty of rural primary care phy sicians to manage complex chronic conditions 2.) Increase patients' timely access to specia lty care and reduce geographic barriers 3.) Create the ability for specialists to provide di rect patient consults to patients based at rural clinics 4.) Improve efficiency in the rural referral pr ocess by letting specialis ts divert unnecessary referrals and decreasing the wait time for urgent referrals 5.) Provide service in HPSA's 6.) Enhance access to other health care serv ices (case manageme nt, education, etc.) Related Category 3 Outcome Measures(s) We have chosen 2 stand- alone measures from Category 3: IT - 3.2 Congestive Heart Failu re 30 day readmission rate IT - 3.6 Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) 30 day readmission rate Frio County has a high incidence of diabetes which is a risk factor for heart trouble. This condition creates complications cau sing a strain on local resources. Increased efficiency in the emergency department through use of telemedici ne should improve access to primary care which should result in better management of heart disease and its complications. Relationship to other Projects: 1.7.1 -\"Implement telemedicine program to provide or expand specialist re ferral services in an area identified as needed to the region\", provide s a basis for more efficient assessments and more initiation of care. It is closely related to the Category 4 project \"Improves Quality\". It provides better coordination with primary care physicians to provide better management of chronic conditions. In rural communities there is a cl ose relation between primary care and the emergency department. Many of the physicians w ho staff the emergency department also work in the community as primary care physicians. Coor dination of care is nece ssary to better manage chronic conditions. 2.2- Expansion of the chronic care management model seeks to reduce unnecessary acute and emergency room utilization by of easy access to primary care. Primary care can better manage chronic conditions such as hypertensio n, obesity and diabetes. Timely screenings identify conditions at an early stage that permit better management and leads to a more efficient use of resources. 2.3 - Redesign Primary Care - Expansion of the chronic care management model above 167 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Frio Regional Hospital places more demands on PCP's and their clinics to provide easy access. Timely screening for early detection of chronic condi tions requires efficient schedu ling. Expansion of primary care capacity increases the likelihood of this outcome. 2.4 - \"Redesign to improve Patient Experience\" depends upon easy access to primary care. A major frustration is the long wait time for a ppointments, up to 6 weeks. Expanding primary care capacity reduces wait times, making it easie r for patients to remember appointments. \"No shows\" decrease the patient experience. 1.10 - \"Enhance Performance Improvement and Reporting Capacity\". Performance improvement processes will be integrated to the expansion of primary care capacity and the category 3 outcomes of screenings for diabe tic patients. Since these activities are major component to clinic efficiency, education will be provided to physicia ns and their staffs.

Intervention(s) : This project initially moves a long standing indigent clinic to the hospital campus, improving access and security. Short an d long term goals are to increase the volume and scope of services to improve continuity, acces s and effectiveness of chronic disease care in the community. Need for the project : The current clinic was in an unsafe and difficult to access building with no security, and is open for very limited hours dur ing the month. Funding was based exclusively on charitable donations and volunteer time. The avai lability of clinics wi lling to accept chronic disease patients for free in Guadalupe County and surrounding communities does not exist. Target population : The target population are indigent a nd uninsured patients with chronic a disease such as diabetes, hypert ension, CHF and COPD. We e xpect 100% of these patients to meet the financial qualifications of indigent or Medicaid. Eventually th e clinic may grow to provide services for other ch ronic disease patients who do not have primary care support. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project seeks to increase patient volume by 100% in year three (80 patients per month) 150+% ( 120 patients per month) in year four and 200+% more (200 patients per m onth) in year five. Category 3 outcomes: Our goal is to proactively manage uninsured patients with chronic disease, with a specific focus on diabetes. The hospital's Prescripti on Assistance Program, which receives no federal funding, will be the pr imary resource used to ensure that patients receive necessary medications. The clinic will also provide regular free lab checks, ongoing education, and continuity of care. All these actions are intended to improve health and reduce unnecessary hospital admissions. Project Description: Project description: A long standing, loosely organized grou p called the Christian Free Clinic is at risk of closing due to the current building's unsafe condition and lack of medical resources. Local indigent and uninsured patients with chroni c diseases who seek medi cal care at this clinic four evenings a month would have no medical options other than the ER. As a result of this need, and need to expand healthcare access to reside nts of Guadalupe County and its contiguous communities, GRMC will be providing space to this clinic, as well as augmenting its current structure with staff and resour ces to expand care to patients who are underserved and without insurance. Challenges identified : The existing clinic bu ilding is in poor condition (i.e., no wheelchair access) limited personnel support, limited hours and medical resources, and no access to lab or imaging reports. Additionally, th ere is no well formalized process in place to track patients, 171 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Guadalupe Regional Medical Center which makes it difficult to follow up with patients. Project goal(s) : -Expand primary care access to indigent and uni nsured population by relo cating clinic to the hospital campus. -Expand clinic hours of operation from one eveni ng a week to three days a week. -Add additional staff to clinic to provide for extended hours. Staff would include: one physician extender, one medical assistant/receptionist and one front office receptionist. - Prevent unnecessary ER visits and hospital readmissions for uninsured diabetic population, who have been identified through the Christian Fr ee Clinic, recently discharged from the hospital or local primary care clinics that do not have the time or means to support diabetic management and education for their patients. -Prevent the number of diabetic -related hospital visits by provid ing diabetic education, access to free diabetic medications thr ough the hospital's pres cription assistance program (for the uninsured or indigent population) and access to physician medical management for this chronic disease. This project not only aims to address access to care, but provid es access to medication to help those manage chronic illnesses. This project will also provide one- on-one education, free lab screenings to monitor A1C levels, and provide a system for follow-up care for patients with diabetes. Ongoing quality initiatives this project will help to address : Avoidable hospital readmissions Medication education and management Transitional care resource for uninsured patients Improve ER patient flow & wait times Assist with patient follow up and compliance of medications and lab work, specifically for the diabetic population. This project relates to the following RHP 6 Regional Goals: Triple Aim: assuring patients receive high-quality and patient-centered care, in the most cost effective ways. This pr oject will support this goal by connecting patients to the necessary healthcare resources and/or services for free or at a substantially reduced cost. Improve the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of our counties. This project will he lp meet this goal by e xpanding clinic access and healthcare resources to patients in th e hospital's eight-county service area who are identified as underserved and without insuran ce. Patients with Medi caid would fall into the financial classification to receive care. Improve outcomes while containing cost growth . This project will seek to impact this goal by connecting patients to necessary medi cations to manage their chronic illness, helping to avoid ER visits and pot ential inpatient hospital visits. 5-year expected outcome - This project aims to improve primary care access and outcomes of the uninsured and indigent population with iden tified chronic illnesses, specifically, those individuals diagnosed with diab etes. By expanding clinic hour s to provide for day-time and evening healthcare access, it is expected that unnecessary emergency room visits will be reduced, readmission rates for diabet ic related illnesses will be re duced and the less fortunate in 172 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Guadalupe Regional Medical Center the community will have a dedica ted resource to receive care and access to medications to help them manage their chronic illness. Starting Point/Baseline: Project Baseline: The clinic is currently se eing 6-10 patients per week, most who are being treated for one or more chronic illnesses. The hospital's Prescription Assistance Program (P AP), which is a not for profit entity that receives no federal funding, provides uninsured and indigent patients with prescription medications for $15 a month. A large portion of patients who receive medication through the PAP have received care at the Christian Free Clinic . There are currently 84 Christian Free Clinic patients who are receiving medications through the PAP. Once the clinic has been relocated, and staff le vels and hours of operati on have increased from one evening a week to three days a week w ith extended evening hours, we project patient volume to increase by 100% over baseline in year three, 150+% over baseline in year four, and 200+% over baseline in year five, based on the patient volume from the prior year's reporting period. Rationale: 1.1.2 Expand existing primary care capacity Required core components: a) Expand primary care clinic space b) Expand primary care clinic hours c) Expand primary care clinic staff Project core components will be addressed as follows: We selected Project Option 1.1.2, Expand Existing Primary Care Capacity, after discovering the poor facility condition of Seguin's Christian Free Clinic. The Clinic is in extreme need of safer access and increased square footage to provide primary care services to local uninsured and indigent patients. GRMC selected this project as a means to ex tend supportive resources to the clinic and voluntary providers who currently trea t clinic patients one ev ening each week. GRMC views this clinic relocation as an opportunity to build on the Chri stian Free Clinic's structure and augment the clinic with additiona l clinical staff support to provide the ability to expand clinic hours and care for underprivileged patients who cannot afford healthcare. The clinic expansion will be specifically carried forth with the addition of a physician extender, medical assistant and front office receptionist. One of the primary goals of this clinic is diabetic disease management and prevention, given that the majo rity of the patients currently being treated at the Christian Free Clinic are diagnosed with diabetes. Current ly, 84 patients who receiv e care at the Christian Free Clinic are receiving medications from the Prescription Assistance Program (PAP) at the hospital. The PAP, which is a department of the hospital, is supported by various local donors, as well as the hospital. Neither the PAP, nor any services related to the clinic project receives any federal funding. The unique community needs identified the project addresses are: CN 2 & CN3. This project will address access to primary care for the uninsured and focus on chronic disease management of 173 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Guadalupe Regional Medical Center diabetes. GRMC would take this clinic on as a new project initiative, as there is no community clinic owned or supported by the hospital at this time to enhance access to primary care services to the uninsured, nor is there a local community clinic willing to see patients for free except for the Christian Free Clinic. GRMC would build on the Ch ristian Free Clinic's structure, which is a non-profit tax exempt organizati on, and offer expanded services by means of hours, staff, and educational resources. The Chri stian Free Clinic in its current location and weekly operating schedule sees on average 6-10 patients a w eek, approximately 40 patients a month. The prevalence of Type II Diabetes in Guadalupe County is currently 11.7%, compared to the national rate of 8.3%. It is currently an unmanaged issue in Seguin and surrounding communities, due to lack of patient access to medi cal care, affordability of diabetic medications, and lack of educational resour ces and follow-up support services. Expanding clinic hours will impact the greater comm unity due to the fact there is not a clinic open and available during normal business hours (8- 5pm) that is willing to accept patients free of charge. Currently, diabetic patients end up in the emergency room, and are often times costly admissions because they cannot acquire or afford their diabetic medications. By focusing on the diabetic population in this clin ic, we expect to see a reduction in unnecessary ER visits, reduction in diabetic related hospital admissions and r eadmissions, and a greater rate of diabetes management/ compliance given th e access to free healthcare resources. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): We selected Improvement Target (IT)-1.10 Diab control (>9.0%) - NQF 0059 (stand-alone measure) from Category 3, due to the high prevalence of patients diagnosed with diabetes in the Seguin and surrounding comm unities; and, because it is one of the leading causes of death in our region, as noted in our community needs assessment. The goal of this clinic is not only to expand access to care for those who are uninsured, but to proactively manage those patients who have be en diagnosed with diabetes. Clinic staff will ensure that patients receive their prescribed me dications by means of the hospital's Prescription Assistance Program, receive free regular lab check s, and on-going education for their illness, by arranging follow-up appointments to the clinic. Our Category 1 project will impact the target of this outcome, as well as impact the greater community due to the fact there is not a clin ic resource open and available at normal business times. Currently, these patients end up in the emergency room, and are often times costly admissions because they cannot acquire or afford their diabetic medications. Relationship to other Projects: This project will support GRMC's Transitional Care Project, RHP 2.12, and Patient Navigation Project, RHP 2.9 by providing a valued clinic resource for follow up care for those patients identified without insurance and a primary car e physician. The collaboration of these two projects will help ensure these patients rece ive follow up care once out of the hospital or Emergency Room. By focusing on the diabetic population in this clin ic, we expect to see a reduction in unnecessary ER visits, reduction in diabetic related hospital admissions and r eadmissions, and a greater rate of diabetes management compliance given the ac cess to free healthcare resources. 174 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Guadalupe Regional Medical Center In addition, RHP Projects: 2.2, 2.7, 2.9, 2.11 will also be impacted by the addition of this clinic because of its focus and slated resources on chronic disease management of diabetes and prevention. Related projects include: 2.2 Expand Chronic Care Models 2.7 Implement Evidence-based Disease Prevention Programs 2.9 Provide navigation services to targeted patients who ar e at high risk of disconnect from institutionalized health care 2.11 Conduct Medication Management 2.12 Implement/Expand Care Transitions Program Category 4 population measure: RD1.

Denominator: Number of resident s age 18 and older living in the RHP counties Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: N/A Plan for Learning Collaborative: GRMC is interested in participating in a lear ning collaborative with other regional partners pursuing similar projects. Project Valuation: The scope of this project should be categorized as a large project, due to the amount of staff resources, supplies and systems that will be n eeded to develop, train, and manage a growing clinic. In response to our commun ity needs assessment, we anticipat e this clinic growing quickly with patients, given the lack of uninsured access to health care in our community. Currently, the Christian Free Clin ic is funded by charitable dona tions from local organizations, however, the amount of money received monthl y, which is approximately $3,000.00 is nowhere near the amount of funds needed to s upport monthly operations of a clinic. The clinic will also be marketed to local pr imary care physicians as a valuable educational resource for indigent or uninsured patients with chronic diabetic needs. It is recognized that physicians have limited time to spend on one-on-on e education with their patients. This clinic will help fill that void by being a referral sour ce for diabetic educati on, in addition to managing other chronic illnesses. 175 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Guadalupe Regional Medical Center 138411709.1.1 PASS 1 1.1.2 1.1.2 A - C 1.1.2 EXPAND PRIMARY CARE CAPACITY -GRMC Guadalupe Regional Medical Center TPI - 138411709 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 138411709.3.1 3.IT- 1.10 Diabetes care : HbA1c poor control (>9.0%) Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 P-1: Establish additional/expand existing/relocate primary care clinics.

Unique RHP ID#: 133260309.1.1 - PASS 1 Performing Provider: Medina Healthcar e System (Medina Regional Hospital) Performing Provider TPI: 212140201 Project Summary: Provider Description : Medina Healthcare System is comp rised of Medina Regional Hospital (\"MRH\") and three Rural Health Clinics. MRH is a 25 bed critical access hospital and is the sole hospital provider in Medina County with an approximate populat ion of 47,000 and square mileage of 1,335. The hospital is located in the City of Hondo, which is a 10 square mile area, and approximate population of 9,000. Intervention(s) : This project will add need ed staff (physicians and/or mid-level providers), clinic staff, and square footage to increase clinic vi sits and expand clinic hour s. This project is therefore an expansion of our existing clinics. Need for the project : As the only rural health clinic s in the County, the facilities are overcrowded with almost 48,000 visits annually. Patients walk out due to long waits and cancel appointments. With very little weekend access, patients often seek medical attention through the busy and costly emergency department. These i ssues are due to inadequate access to primary care. Target population : The target population is those patien ts in the County that need medical (primary) care access to physicians/mid-level providers (not only duri ng 8-5 hours), but also after hours and on weekends. Approximately 32% of our clinic patien ts are Medicaid or indigent. Many more are by de finition charity patients. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : This project seeks to expand clinic hours/staff and space available to improve access to care. By DY(4) and (5), the pr oject seeks to increase clinic visits by 3% (1,435 patients) and 5% (2,390 pati ents) respectively. In addition, the unique number of patients will increas e by 3% (450 patients) and 5% ( 750 patients) from the baseline number. Currently, primary care physicians have over 47,000 combined visits annually. Thirty- two percent of these patients are Medicaid or indigent. Category 3 outcomes: 1. 3.IT-1.12 seeks to increase the percent of qua lified patients who receive an eye exam (retinal or dilated) currently by (TBD) % by DY5. 2. 3.IT-1.13 seeks to increase diabetic foot exams in qualified patients by (TBD)% in DY5. 3. 3.IT-1.14 our goal is to increas e the number of diabetic patients who had a nephropathy screening test by (TBD) % in DY5. 179 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Medina Regional Hospital Project Description: Medina Regional Hospital proposes to expand primar y care capacity to impr ove accessibility to citizens of the County and surrounding areas. DSRIP Project 133260309.1.1, \"Expanding Primary Care Capacity\" is essential to providing accessible healthcare to citizens of Medina Count y, Texas. Access to comprehensive, quality services is important for the achie vement of health equity and for increasing the quality of life. This goal requires: gaining entry into the system, accessing a locati on where services are provided, and finding a trusted healthcare provi der. The goal of \"expanding capacity\" would allow patients to access the right care in the ri ght place at the right time. This goal will be accomplished by adding healthcare providers an d increasing the hours of Medina Regional Hospital (MRH) health clinics, as well as some expansion of space. Achieving this goal would allow patients access to care outside normal business hours reduc ing trips to Bexar County or improper utilization of emergency departments. This utilization of \"after hours\" emergency sites results in less coordinated, as well as more costly care. Goals and Relationship to Regional Goals: The goal of this project is to expand primary care capacity in the region by seeking to keep patients healthier, and thereby lessening the burd en of regional emergency departments. By increasing access, patients can util ize the appropriate care destin ation both in Medina County and in RHP6 in general. Project Goals: The project/option selected is: Expand Existi ng Primary Care Capacity with the corresponding components of: a) Expand Primary Clinic Space; b) Expand Primary Clinic Hours; and c) Expand Primary Clinic Staffing This project meets the following regional goals: Transform healthcare by providi ng the right care at the righ t location and in a timely manner, thereby reducing costly care, unn ecessary hospitalization, and builds on the strength of the RHP. Develops a regional approach to healthcare delivery that improves existing programs in our hospital and the region. This goal is responsive to patient needs and should improve ove rall patient satisfaction. Challenges: As Medina County is a designated \"health professional shortage ar ea\", recruitment and retention of physicians and mid-levels (Physician Assistan ts and Nurse Practitioners) are major challenges in meeting the goal described above. Medina Healthcare System (MHS) plans to increase recruitment efforts and employ outside agencies to meet these challenges. A staffing plan will be implemented to ensure the extended hours of the clinic become a reality. Efficient scheduling remains an obstacle to care access predominantly due to the lack of an el ectronic medical record system and an outdated scheduling process. MR H has purchased an electronic system and plans are underway for a \"go-live\" date. 180 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Medina Regional Hospital 5-Year Expected outcome for Provider and Patients: Medina Regional Hospital expects to see improve ments in the number of visits and unique patients seeking care in our rural health clinics. Expected outcomes will relate to the project goals described above. Starting Point/Baseline: In the fiscal year ending on September 30, 2012, th e number of patient visits in rural health clinics of MHS, equaled 47,850. In September 2012, care was delivered u tilizing one physician assistant, one nurse practitioner, 24 clinic sta ff members, and six Family Practice physicians. Three full-time schedulers were employed for all three clinics. Patient record keeping and scheduling utilize a slow, cumberso me process, and no electronic hea lth record is in place. Rationale: Regional Health Partnership (RHP) 6 reports a hi gh uninsured rate as we ll as reportable poor health outcomes. One key challenge faced by this RHP is a limited access to primary care. This RHP is composed of 54% Hispanic and 37% Anglo population. Spanish is the predominant language in many homes. 12% are 65 year s of age or older; many with limited mobility/transportation issues. Th e per capita income is less than the state average. In 2009, 16% of the population lived below the poverty li ne. Medina County averaged 11%-20%. In 2009, 471,000 residents lacked health insurance, part icularly in rural areas such as Medina County. Many residents are employed by small busin esses or are self-empl oyed. This lack of insurance is another barrier to access to \"primary care\" services. Thirty-three providers in RHP 6 are designated as Rural Health Clinics. Medi na Regional Hospital is designated as a Critical Access Hospital and manages three rural health c linics located in Hondo, Castroville and Devine. The National Rural Health Association (NRHA) has identified several is sues of particular interest to rural communities, the first of whic h is \"access to health care services, particularly health disparities and physician shortages.\" Rural counties in RHP 6 comprise 61% of the geographical area. This highlights the importan ce of safety net providers and explains the importance of increasing access to primary care, both in the RHP and in Medina County. The citizens in these counties tend to be older, less educated, wi th lower per capita income. Continued population growth, both in the RHP a nd Medina County, will exacerbate the current challenge of providing primary care services. Fu ture decisions (Medicaid expansion, health insurance, exchanges, etc.) could have a signific ant impact on the health status of residents in Medina County. This opportunity to implem ent the transformative project of increasing access to primary care (through the 1115 Waiver funding) will assist MRH in addr essing the needs of its community. In Medina County, patients often seek care for prim ary care services in urgent or emergent care settings. This can result in a less coordinated and more expensive approach to healthcare. Lack of appropriate follow-up is yet a nother downside to this type of care. When primary care clinics are closed (after-hours, weekends, holidays) or scheduling is difficu lt, residents seek treatment in the emergency department, or worse, seek no treatm ent at all. Particularly with the elderly and indigent populations, transporta tion to other counties (such as Bexar County) is not a viable option. Conditions can exacerbate during these time periods leading to an increase in possibly preventable readmissions. This can also be co mplicated by the inability to receive appointments 181 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Medina Regional Hospital in a timely manner. By enhancing clinic hours, expanding appoint ment times, and generally improving access to care, patients should align themse lves with the primary care system in Medina County resulting in better outcomes, improved coordi nation of care, and reduced costs. The prevalence of other chronic diseases, such as diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease, is above state and national levels. 60% of the deaths in 2008 in RHP 6 were due to these potentially preventable causes. Access to providers, ex tended hours and more efficient scheduling could certainly assist in preventing these deaths. The rural health clinic s service over 47,000 visits, with patients from birth to death. Access to a primary care provider is essential to this county and for patients of all ages. According to the 2011 physician needs assessm ent, Medina County was short six Family Practice physicians. According to the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps , Medina County showed 1,701 residents per Family Practice prac titioner. This is well below the national benchmark of 631:1. Texas ranks 45 th in the nation in number of physicians per capita. The Region's growing population, increased life spans and growing prevalence of chronic diseases, contribute to an accelerated need for primary car e providers. For children, access to primary care is extremely important. The FY 2010 Te xas Medicaid Managed Care STAR Program Quality of Care Report stated that less than 80% of children between the ages of three to five had a well-child visit. Adult obesity was 30% compared to the national average of 25% and diabetic screening was 79% compared to 89%. Low birth weight was 7.9% compared to 6% nati onally, and the teen birt h rate was 55 (compared to 22). The project chosen certainly addresses the RHP a nd the county needs. To fulfill that project, process and outcome measures were chosen that specifically lead us to the desired outcomes. The process milestones selected were: 1. P-4 - Expand the hours of a primary care clin ic, including evening a nd/or weekend hours, and P-4.1 will be the metric increasing hours over th e baseline. The current hours for the rural health clinics as of P-5 - Train, hire additional primary car e providers and staff as evidenced by P-5.1 Documentation of increased numbers of pr oviders and staff in Devine, Hondo and/or Castroville. The improvement target selected is I-12 with the m ilestone being the increase in clinic visits as evidenced by improved access. I-12.1 - Will be the documenta tion of increased visits I-12.2 - Documentation of the number of unique patients or size of patient panels Clinic space will also be enhanced/expanded to meet the growing volume of patients. One specific chronic disease target will be diabet es. The diabetes rate in Bexar County is 10% 182 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Medina Regional Hospital and more than double for African Americans and Hi spanics (13%) as compared to Whites (6%). The population of Texas will continue to grow an d a portion of this growth (18%) will be from international migration from Mexi co. According to national examination services, Hispanics are almost twice as likely as non-Hispan ic Whites to develop diabetes. According to the Agency on Healthcare Rese arch, Texas scored \"weak\" on preventative measures and \"weak\" on diabetes measures. In f act, in RHP 6, diabetes was listed as one of the top causes of death. Disease management, sc reening and wellness programs are crucial to reducing morbidity and mortality due to diabet es. By improving access to care and allowing for increased visits, thereby increasi ng screening exams, diabetes can be better managed in Medina County. Many diabetic complications can be preven ted if detected and ad dressed early. Control of diabetes can extend and improve the quality of lives of thousands of patients in Medina County. Project Components: To expand primary care access we propose to meet all required project components. a) Expand primary care clinic space. We plan to increase existing space to allow for the increase in patient volume. An expansi on plan will be developed addressing space priorities. b) Expand primary care capacity hours. We plan to increase hours by offering services on weekends and later in the ev ening. This should allow patients more flexibility in scheduling as well as \"drop-in\" hours. Exte nded hours should also lower the hospital ED utilization. c) Expand primary care capacity staffing. We plan to hire an additional provider (mid-level, physician or both) as well as clinic staff to improve throughput, scheduling, and patient satisfaction. Unique community need identificati on numbers the project addresses: Screening is obviously an important factor in improving health outcomes of both RHP 6 and in Medina County. A summary of RHP 6 needs incl udes one most relevant to Medina County and that is: CN.3- Many residents lack access to medical and dental care due to high rates of uninsurance and healthcare provider shortage s. As a provider with almost 50,000 visits annually, increasing access to primary car e will enhance our existing primary care delivery processes. How the project represents a new initiative or significantly enhances an existing delivery system reform initiative: This project significantly enhances the care curr ently being delivered. When the clinics are closed, patients seek care mainly in the only emergency room in the county, or make the long trip into Bexar County, or seek no care at all. All these circumstances lead to increased costs and fractionated care in both the County and RHP 6. Increasing access to providers, expanding the hours/ space of the clinics, will certainly lead to better healthcare for chil dren, adults, and the elderly in Medina County. 183 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Medina Regional Hospital Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): Related Category 3 Outcome Measures Three non-stand-alone measures were chosen from Category 3 to include: Outcome Domain - 1 (Primary Care and Chronic Disease Management) IT-1.12 Diabetes Care: Retinal Eye Exam 1.13 Diabetes Foot Care Exam 1.14 Diabetic Care: Microalbumin/Neuropathy Reasons/rationale for selecting the outcome measures: These were chosen because diabetes is one of the most common and costly diseases in both RHP 6 and in Medina County. Half of all resident s with diabetes go undiagnosed, making screening a vital part of primary care in the area. Compli cations cost millions of dollars and undiagnosed diabetes can lead to amputations, blindness and kidney failure. In the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps , Medina County scores below both Texas and national benchmarks in diabetic screening. Adult obesity ranks high at 30% , as well as a 26% score on physical activity. Given the high prevalence of diabetes in the RHP and the County, fueled by a high obesity rate, access to fast foods, a high rate of uninsured/ underinsured, low educational levels and the percentage of residents living below the poverty line (16%), screening for complications and prevalence of diabetes is of vital importanc e to the healthcare need s of Medina County. The rural health clinics in Medina County, w ith over 47,000 visits annually, serve the primary healthcare needs of many of these residents. Improving access to primary care will provide even more citizens the screening exam needed to live a healthier lifestyle, a nd at a reduced cost. Note: Medina Regional Hospital purchased an EHR system in 2012 and plans to go-live in 2013, but this is not directly related to this project. Relationship to other Projects: 1.1.2 - Expanding primary care capacity is interrela ted to numerous other 1115 Waiver Projects in several categories. 2.2 - Expanding the chronic care management model aims to reduce unnecessary acute and emergency care utilization by effectively mana ging chronic conditions (i.e. diabetes). Elements include the ability to identify thes e conditions earlier. Expanding primary care access and diagnosing diabetes earlier, go hand-in-hand. 2.3 - Redesign Primary Care - As patient volumes increase, physicians struggle to ensure their patients have prompt access to care and receive adequate screenings for chronic conditions. Receiving appointments timely and understanding serv ice availability, is the rationale for this project option which indirectly in line with 1.1.2 expanding prim ary care capacity. Increasing providers and hours certainly l eads to improved primary care 2.3. 2.4 - Redesign to improve Patient Experience is al so closely related to 1.1.2. Improved access to 184 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Medina Regional Hospital care and more flexible scheduling can only result in an improved pa tient care experience. With an improved experience, patients should \"keep ap pointments\" and can be followed more closely. 1.1.2 (Increase training of Primary Care Workforce) is obviously related to expanding primary care capacity. Expanding the primary care workfo rce will increase capacity and help create a more organized structure of providers and space. The expansion will lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment of chronic diseases and decrea se healthcare costs overa ll. In 2010, Texas ranked 47 in numbers of primary care physicians per 100,000 in population. Impr oving this number is key to expanding capacity. 1.3 - Implement a Chronic Disease Management Re gistry. Although not a di rect link, the ability to track screening results of patients with diabetes by improving primary care access has the similar goal of \"prompting\" physicians and team s to conduct assessments and deliver specific recommended cure. For example, P-8 would create protocols for reminders for targeted diseases (such as screening exams for diabetes). 1.10 - Enhance Performance Improvement and Re porting Capacity. Performance improvement activities will be woven into expanding primary care capacity and Category 3 outcomes of screenings for diabetic patient conditions. \"P erformance improvement is a large component of success of all of the project areas across the categories. \" Educati on and training will be provided to physicians and staff in process improvement strategies. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Other performers selecting this project include: Methodist Hospital System Frio Regional Hospital Southwest General Hospital Guadalupe Regional Medical Center University Hospital University of Texas Health Science Center (S an Antonio) Peterson Regional Medical Center Baptist Medical Center Val Verde Regional Medical Center Children's Hospital of San Antonio Many of these facilities are ge ographically positioned with ov erlapping patients. Improving access will assist all these patients and simultaneously reduce ED visits. Plan for Learning Collaborative: As the anchor for RHP 6, University Health System will promote and facilitate learning collaboratives. Medina Regiona l Hospital will participate with many of the above providers performing similar projects to share ideas, be st practices, challenges and success stories. Working groups will be formed to establish the goals, develop a calendar for meetings, and share ideas. New solutions can be tested. 185 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Medina Regional Hospital Project Valuation: This project touches almost all citizens in Medina County, and in fact, compliments other providers in the RHP. By improving access to care, costly preventable admissions and over- utilization of emergency departments will be decreased in Medina as well as neighboring counties such as Bexar and Uvalde. Cost avoida nce is obviously a major justification for this project. Barriers to accessing health services lead to delays in receiving appropriate care, inability to receive preventative services, and hosp italizations that could have been prevented. In terms of cost, providers including physicians, mi d-levels and staff will need to be hired and trained. Processes will have to be developed a nd implemented. As the only hospital in Medina County, access to care is both bene ficial and a priority. Over 47,000 visits to the clinics were recorded last year. As the demand for h ealthcare increases (through migration, population growth, baby boomer aging), demand will rise even farther. 186 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Medina Regional Hospital 133260309.1.1 PASS 1 1.1.2 1.1.2 (A)(B)(C) E XPAND PRIMARY CARE CAPACITY - MEDINA HEALTHCARE SYSTEM Medina Healthcare System (M edina Regional Hospital) TPI #212140201 Exam Diabetes Care: Microalbumin/Nephropathy Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P5]: Train/hire additional primary care providers and staff.

MRH is a 25 bed critical access hospital and is the sole hospital provider in Medina County with an approximate populat ion of 47,000 and square mileage of 1,335. The hospital is located in the City of Hondo, which is a 10 square mile area, and approximate population of 9,000. Intervention(s) : This project will lead to the im plementation of process improvement methodologies that will improve patient safety, qual ity, and efficiency. Res ources will be put in place to conduct, report, drive and measure qual ity improvement; Specifically an office and director will be established/hired and a form al process of education will be implemented. Need for the project : Currently, the hos pital has no director or office for Process Improvement or Quality. No formal methodology is being utilized and little da ta reporting is taking place, which complicates the ability to improve upon patient safety initiatives or report mandated/meaningful data. Although it is an expansion of our current process, this project will be a huge undertaking for this facility. Target population : The target population is those patients served in our rural health clinics and hospital. Approximately 32% of our clinic pati ents are Medicaid or i ndigent, and will benefit from this project. Many more by definition ar e considered charity patients. The hospital inpatient/outpatient percent of Me dicaid/indigent approximates 20%. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project seeks to in crease the number of reports generated to three in DY4 and to submit thr ee quality dashboards by DY5. Additionally, we seek to increase the number of performance activ ities (designed and implemented) to three in DY4 and demonstrate improvement in two selected quality m easures by DY5. We will also utilize this Category 1 proj ect to drive improvements in three Category 3 areas. All employees (approximately 200) will be affe cted and educated during this project. Additionally, the primary care physic ians will be educated and bene fited by this project. With advanced process improvement training, over 47,000 clinic patients will benefit as well as 1100 inpatient hospital patients (Approxi mately 32% of clinic patients are Medicaid or indigent.).

Project Description: Medina Regional Hospital proposes to expand quality improvement capacity through people, processes and technology so th at the resources are in pla ce to conduct report, drive and measure quality improvement. DSRIP Project 212140201.1.10, \"Enhance Performan ce Improvement and Reporting Capacity\" will lead to the implementation of process impr ovement methodologies that will improve patient safety, quality and efficiency. A new operational mindset will be instituted to lead staff to identify inefficiencies in the healthcare delivery system and to work toward the elimination of these inefficiencies. Process improvement in healthcare is imperativ e in today's rapidly changing environment. These improvements assure that our systems ar e operating at their optimum. The goals of healthcare process improvement are to enhance the effectiveness of systems to alleviate waste/cost and ultimately improve the quality of the patient experience, care and outcomes. Improvement in numerous areas will allow us to reduce duplication of efforts and minimize the waste of resources. Changing the management of critical processes ca n generate a 20-50% improvement in those processes impacting pati ent and employee satisfaction, as well as the bottom line. With the IOM's \"to err is human\" and \"crossing the quality chasm\", a widespread incidence of medical errors in U.S. hospitals was reported. The IOM report estimated that medication errors alone caused more than 7,000 deat hs annually. Additionally, \"to err is human\" revealed that between 44,000 and 98,000 Americans die each year due to medical errors, and total costs of these erro rs are estimated to be between $17 billion and $29 billion dollars, with healthcare costs comprising over 50%. Accordi ng to Health Aff. (2006), in 2003, Medicare paid hospitals an additional $300 million per year for five types of adverse events. Healthcare professionals also pay with a loss of morale and increased turnover. Since then, much progress has been made in developing indicators and risk adjustment mechanisms to compare and improve quality acr oss systems. Hospitals that perform well on process measures have better outcomes, employee and patient satisfaction, and reduced costs. Goals and Relationship to Regional Goals: The goal of this project is to expand quality im provement capacity through people, processes and technology so that the resources are in place to conduct, report, drive and measure quality improvement. Project Goals: The project/option selected is: Enhance Performance Improvement and Reporting Capacity with the corresponding components of: d) Provide training and education to clinic al and administrative staff on process improvement strategies, met hodologies, and culture; and e) Develop an employee suggestion system that a llows for the identifica tion of issues that 190 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Medina Regional Hospital impact the work environment, patient care a nd satisfaction, efficiency and other issues aligned with continuous process improvement. This project meets the following regional goals: One of the key goals of the Waiver and RHP6 is to improve and prepare the healthcare infrastructure's newly insured population. This will require effective management, enhanced technology and improved processes to promote quality care and to reduce the costs. RHP6 represents a vast area with many rural communities where poor health outcomes are common. Limited access to prim ary and specialty care exacerbates these problems. Healthcare facilities in RHP6 must become efficient in delivering care to an increasing population. The region has a high emergency room utilization, low access to primary/specialty care, and 125,090 potentially preventable hospitaliz ations leading to of $1,700 per adult livi ng in the regions' counties. Performance improvement is key to improvement in all the categories name d above, plus all the other projects in the partnership. It meets the triple aim of a ssuring patients receive high quality and patient centered care, in the most cost effective ways. This project will assist in developing a regi onal approach to healthcare delivery that enhances or replaces an existing process in our hospital system and RHP. The goal is responsive to patient needs and should im prove overall patient satisfaction. Challenges: The primary challenge for this project will be th e recruitment and retention of a qualified process improvement coordinator to engage the stakehol ders. As a health provider shortage area, recruiting a well-trained, passionate Director to lead process improvement will be difficult. Obtaining management and staff buy-in to a fo rmal change process may also prove to be daunting, as well as rolling out process methodologies throughout th e medical and hospital staff. 5-Year Expected outcome for Provider and Patients: Medina Regional Hospital expects to have a Pe rformance Improvement office with a qualified director leading the change for a formalized quality performance program. Our goal is to have a substantial workforce that is trained and us ing various performance improvement tools in approaching work and cost efficiencies wh ile reducing variations in processes. Starting Point/Baseline: Currently no position for Director of Process Im provement/Quality exists at Medina Regional Hospital. No formal methodology is being utilize d at this time and little date reporting/charting is taking place. Therefore, the baseline number of employees in the process improvement department is zero, and dedicated space is also zero. 191 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Medina Regional Hospital Rationale: Enhancing performance improvement and reporting capacity will lead to the implementation of process improvement methodologies that will impr ove patient safety, quality and efficiency. A new operational mindset will be instituted to lead st aff to identify inefficiencies in the healthcare delivery system and to work toward the elimination of these inefficiencies. The project chosen certainly addresses the RHP a nd the county needs. To fulfill that project, process and outcome measures were chosen that specifically lead us to the desired outcomes. The process milestones selected were: 1. P-1 - Establish a performance improvement o ffice to collect, analyze, and manage real-time data and to monitor the improvement trajec tory and improvement activities across the Performing Provider's delivery system. P-1.1 Metric documentation of the establishment of performance improvement office. P-1.2 Documentation that the performance improvement office is engaged in collecting, analyzing, and managing real-time data. 2. P-2 - Establish a program for trained expert s on process improvements to mentor and train other staff, including front-line staff, for safety and quality care improvement. All staff trained in this program should be required to lead an improveme nt project in their department within six months of co mpleting their training. P-2.1 Train-the-trainer program established. P-2.2 Improvement projects led by staff trained through th e train-the-trainer program. 3. P-9 - Participation in face-to -face learning/meetings/seminars at least twice a year with other providers and the RHP to promote collabora tive learning around simila r and shared projects. P-9.1 Participate in semi-annual meetings or seminars The improvement targets selected are: I-7 Milestone: Implement quality improvement data systems, collection, and reporting capabilities. I-7.1 Metric: Increase the number of reports generated through these quality improvement data systems. I-7.2 Metric: Demonstrate how qualit y reports are used to drive rapid-cycle performance improvement. I-8 Milestone: Create a qua lity dashboard or scoreboard to be shared with organizational leadership and at all levels of the organization on a regular basis that includes outcome measures and patient satisfaction measures. I-8.1 Metric: Submission of quality dashboard or scorecard. I-9 Milestone: Demonstrated improvement in x number of selected quality measures. I-9.1 Metric: Improvement in selected quality measures. 192 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Medina Regional Hospital Project Components: To enhance improvement capacity within pe ople we propose to m eet all the required components. d) Provide training and education to clinical a nd administrative staff on process improvement strategies, methodologies and culture. e) Develop an employee suggestion system that a llows for the identifica tion of issues that impact the work environment, patient care a nd satisfaction efficiency and other issues aligned with continuous process improvement. f) Continuous quality improvement is reflected in Milestone 4 [I-7], Metrics I-7.1 and I-7.2 (implementing quality improvement data system s, collection, and re porting capabilities). CQI is also reflected in [I- 7.2] utilizing quality reports to drive rapid cycle performance improvement. Additionally, Milestone 6 [I-9] projects demonstrated improvement in two selected quality measures. Unique community need identificati on numbers the project addresses: Performance improvement is obviously an importa nt factor in improving health outcomes of both RHP 6 and in Medina Count y. A summary of RHP 6 needs includes three which are most relevant to Medina Co unty and they are: CN.1- Texas ranks last in the nation on health care quality. RHP6 is challenged to deliver improved quality and patient satisfaction. CN.2- A high prevalence of chronic disease a nd related health dispar ities require greater prevention efforts and improved management of patients. CN.6-High rates of communicable diseases a nd vaccine preventable diseases in the community. How the project represents a new initiative or significantly enhances an existing delivery system reform initiative: Currently a formal process or methodology for pro cess improvement is not being utilized. This formalized methodology, led by a qualified Qua lity Director, represents a significant enhancement to the evaluation of resources. Pr ocess improvement permeates every aspect of each initiative in RHP6. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): Related Category 3 Outcome Measures Outcome Domain - 12 (Primary Care and Primary Prevention) IT-12.1 Breast Cancer Screening Number of women aged 40 to 69 that ha ve received an annual mammogram during the reporting period. Denominator: Number of women aged 40 to 69 in the patient or target population. Women who have had a bilateral mast ectomy are excluded. IT-12.2 Cervical Cancer Screening 193 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Medina Regional Hospital Number of women aged 21 to 64 that have received a PAP in the measurement year or two prior years. Denominator: Wome n aged 21 to 64 in the patient or target population. Women who have had a complete hysterectomy with no residual cervix are excluded. IT-12.4 Pneumonia Vaccination Status for Older Adults Numerator: Number of adults aged 65 a nd older that have ever received a pneumonia vaccine. Denominator: Number of adults aged 64 a nd older in the patient or target population. Reasons/rationale for selecting the outcome measures: These were chosen because primary screening as we ll as preventative vaccin ations contribute to early detection and prevention, increasi ng health outcomes of individuals. Mammography screening (52%) in Medina County is well below the national benchmark of 74%. According to the Agency for Healthca re Research and Quality's 2011 Report, Texas scored WEAK in preventative measures and AVERAGE on cancer measures. Cancer is a leading cause of death in RHP6. Medina Region al Hospital will utili ze the Category 1 project (Process Improvement) to improve both mammogra phy and cervical cancer screening, as well as pneumonia vaccinations in Medina County. Education and training on process improvement meas ures to front line staff, directors, clinical and non-clinical staff, and the establishment of the employee suggestion process, will position Medina Regional Hospital to evaluate current pl ans and discharge tools to improve preventive measures such as our I-T targets. Relationship to other Projects: This project is a direct link to 1.1.2, \"Expanding Primary Care Staffing\". Process improvement is needed to enhance recru itment/retention efforts. Additionally, an enhanced process improvement methodology will be needed to improve efficiencies in the clinics to improve patient flow and all projects to improve efficiencies and reduce wa ste will be integrated to this project. This project suppor ts the 1115 Waiver and Triple Aim Goals to improve outcomes while containing cost growth. The tools select ed will focus on reducing undesirable variations, which will support Medina Regional Hospital's and RHP 6 goals. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: The Baptist Health System and University Health Science Center have also selected \"expanding quality improvement capacity\" as DSRIP projects. This will facilitate learning collaboratives with other providers in RHP6. Selection Pros/Cons of methodologies can be discussed as well as best practices. Plan for Learning Collaborative: As the anchor for RHP 6, University Health System will promote and facilitate learning collaboratives. Medina Regiona l Hospital will participate with many of the above providers performing similar projects to share ideas, be st practices, challenges and success stories. Working groups will be formed to establish the goals, develop a calendar for meetings, and share ideas. New solutions can be tested. 194 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Medina Regional Hospital Project Valuation: This project touches all aspects of the hospital' s delivery systems. Cost avoidance is a major component of this valuation due to the f act that by improving systems and increasing efficiencies, outcomes can be affected: reduction in mortality, reduction in medical errors, reduction in medication errors, etc. With a fo rmalized department, reporting/benchmarking and process improvements should lead to a happier and healthier comm unity. The project therefore adds much strength to the hospital through: 1) cost avoidance; 2) improvement in patient satisfaction; and 3) hospital efficiencies. As the demand for health care increases (through migration, population growth, aging baby boomers, etc.), demand will use even further, necessitating the need for more efficiencies an d a streamlined resource allocation process. The implementation of a formal process improve ment methodology will assist in addressing a substantial need in the community for increased efficiency, and improvement in the quality of care. 195 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Medina Regional Hospital 133260309.1.2 PASS 2 1.10.1 1.10.1 (A)(B) 1.10.1 Enhance improvement capaci ty within people - Medina Healthcare System Medina Healthcare System (Med ina Regional Hospital) TPI - 212140201 Related tion: Breast Cancer Screening Primary Care and Primary Prevention: Cervical Cancer Screening Primary Care and Primary Prevention: Pneumonia Vaccination Status for Older Adults Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P1]: Establish a performance improvement office to collect, analyze, and manage real-time data and to monitor the improvement trajectory and improvement activities across Medina Regional Hospital's delivery system.

For more than 49 ye ars Methodist has provide d high quality care to patients from San Antonio a nd throughout South Texas. Intervention(s) : Methodist Hospital will deploy telehealth services that will provide instant Telehealth consultations with trained specialists in selected services affiliate d with Methodist Hospital. This will allow patients experiencing barriers to specialty ca re to receive initial care in their home facility. The specia list will evaluate the patient via Telehealth consultation and decide which interventions will benefit the patient. This will allow all members of the healthcare team to monitor the patient's status, treatment plan, and disease management. Need for the project : The goal of this program is to br ing the best of acute diagnosis and treatment recommendations to remote communities , which often do not have specialists and the resources to provide the advanced medical treat ments. Approximately 18% of patients in rural community hospitals are transferred to San Antoni o for specialty care th at could be handled by rural hospitals with availability to specialists. Target population : Target populations are patients that present to Emergency Departments at facilities without specialty physician coverage . Approximately 30% of patients are either Medicaid and/or indigent pati ents and are expected to be nefit from this project. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : This project will increase Telehealth visits to 150 by DY5. This process will significantly increase th e quality of care to the patients by having the specialist see and communicate with the patient in or der to best assess their ability for local care or the need to start therapy and transport to a regional facility. Approxi mately 50 telemedicine visits are estimated during the ba seline period in DY 3. MHS has es timated that the telemedicine visits will be 100 for DY 4 and 150 for DY 5. Met hodist Hospital estimates that approximately 30% of these patient are indi gent and Medicaid patients. Category 3 outcomes: Improve patient satisfaction by 2% in DY4 and 4% in DY5. Percentage increases are in line with the community estimated access rate. Project Description: Methodist Healthcare System will operate a telemedicine network to enhance care for patients in a San Antonio, Texas and surrounding area. We exp ect call to consultation times to decrease and quality of care, due to a virtual consultation, to increase. This program will also align clinical protocols between facilities to enhance care of patients. Devel oping a telemedicine network has proved difficult in the past due to significant costs, both with equipment and with physician specialty coverage. Additionally, only recen tly has the technology improved enough that it is 199 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Methodist Hospital now reasonable to expect it to be able to provi de consistent and reli able connection and the ability for a specialist to have a cl inical interaction with a patient. This telemedicine network will allow facilities to network with our hospital system for specialty coverage that is lacking or non-ex istent. This has the potential to provide significant benefit to families and patients. The five year outcome is expected to increase patient access to sp ecialists in order to improve patient health. This project is aligned with the following Region 6 goals: Triple Aim: assuring patients receive high-quality and patient-centered care, in the most cost effective ways Improve the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of our counties Improve outcomes while containing cost growth No other federal funds will be utiliz ed for the funding of this project. Starting Point/Baseline: This project will be assessed to determine mo st appropriate community need in DY2. Once assessed, the Telemedicine program will be im plemented in DY3. The baseline will be determined in year of implementation. The baseline will be telemedicine vi sits compared to total visits. Rationale: There is currently a shortage of specialists and su bspecialists in near ly every community. Subspecialists are in very s hort supply in Bexar and the su rrounding counties as well. This project brings a specialist to the patient's bedside when needed. Patients will be better served by a virtual consultation in which the specialist is ab le to see and speak to the patient, the family, and the attending doctor and make timely decisi ons on treatment and transfer. This program should allow more patients to stay in their lo cal facility whil e facilitating the transfer and treatment of high acuity pa tients to a facility with a higher level of care. Core Project Components: e. Provide patient consultations by medical and surgical specialists as well as other types of health professionals using telecommunications. f. Conduct quality improvement for project using methods such as rapid cycle improvement. Activities may incl ude, but are not limited to, iden tifying project impacts, identifying \"lessons learned\", oppor tunities to scale all or part of the project to a broader patient population, and identifying key challe nges associated with expansion of the project, including special consider ations for safety-net populations. This project address the Community Needs Assessment for these items: CN.1 - Texas ranks last in the nation on health care quality. RHP 6 is challenged to deliver 200 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Methodist Hospital improved quality and patient satisfaction. CN.2 - A high prevalence of chronic disease and related health dispar ities require greater prevention efforts and improved management of patients with chronic conditions. Leading causes of death in RHP 6 include cardi ovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. CN.3 - Many residents of RHP 6 lack access to me dical and dental care due to high rates of uninsurance and health ca re provider shortages. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-9 Right Care, Right Setting - RHP Outcome ID 094154402.3.1 Category 3 Outcome Measure IT-9.4 Improved access to health care services for reside nts of communities that did not have such services locally before the program. Methodist Healthcare System will measure if th e patient's access to care was improved over baseline visits. The baseline will be determined in DY3. Subsequent years will attempt to improve access to care by the end of waiver. Relationship to other Projects: The telemedicine project will support MH S Project 094154402.1.2- Expand Specialty Care Capacity- Freestanding ED. Tele medicine will be available for consults in the ED where specialty coverage is not available. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Unknown at this time. Plan for Learning Collaborative: Following completion of the RHP plan, University Health System (anchor) will facilitate the formation of working groups of performing provide rs who are pursuing similar projects. These working groups will develop their learning co llaborative structure which may include goals, regular meetings, site visits , conference calls, communication plan development, organizing learning event, and adopt metrics to measure success. The telemedicine program's results and processes w ill be shared with all pa rticipating facilities. Additionally, protocols will be aligned between facilities and our San Antonio hospitals. Feedback on processes, treatments, and metrics will be shared with all partnering facilities. 201 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Methodist Hospital Project Valuation: Methodist's project valuation us ed a method which ranked the importance of each project based on several key factors. First, Methodist considered the extent the project helps further the goals of the Waiver, which are to (a) enhance access to h ealth care, (b) increase the quality of care, and (c) improve the cost-effectiveness of care prov ided in the community. Next, Methodist considered the degree of need for the project in the community as addres sed and identified in the Community Needs Assessment. The size of the re quired investment was also considered, which included considerations of personne l, equipment, time and complexity as well as the cost of the time, effort, and clinical resources involved in implementing the project. Finally, Methodist reflected on the scope of the project: the number of patients that would be affected, including the type of patients; the number of patient visi ts or encounters; how many providers or staff members would be added; the costs that would be avoided as a result of the project; and the ripple effect the project would ha ve on all members of the healthcare system. These factors were weighed against the amount of funding available. We believe this approach is the best methodology available to assess the impact of the project; the investment of the performing provider, and the overall value to the community, to the exte nt community resources are available to help fund DSRIP pr ojects. Final project valuation and funding distribution across categories was then determined based on the va luation provisions in the Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol. In valuing the project, Methodist took into account the extent to which a telemedicine program would potentially meet the goals of the Waiver (improve outcomes while containing costs, improve the healthcare infrastructure), the extent to which it will address the community needs, the population served, and resources and cost necessary to implement the project. The telemedicine project is projected to go live in DY 3. This will provide significant benefit in avoiding unnecessary medical tran sportation costs, family hardsh ip, and enhancing the remote facilities ability to care for patients locally. Additionally, with the live consultation of a specialist, we will be able to administer thera py appropriately and arrange for a higher level of care when necessary. 202 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Methodist Hospital 094154402.1.1 PASS 1 1.7.1 1.7.1 E-F 1.7.1 Introduce, Expand, or Enhance Telemedicine/Telehealth Methodist - 094154402 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 094154402.3.1 3.IT 6.1 Percent improvement over base line of patient satisfaction scores Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P1]: Conduct needs assessment to identify needed specialties that can be provided via telemedicine Metric 1 [P-1.1]: Needs assessment to identify the types of personnel needed to implement the program and hiring of the respective personnel.

For more than 49 ye ars Methodist has provide d high quality care to patients from San Antonio and throughout South Texas. Intervention(s) : Project is to expand specialty care cap acity by locating a Freestanding ED in Westside of San Antonio in a community area of need. Because of the population size of Bexar County (1.8 million) and the CBSA (2.5 million) a nd this projected growth, just about every geographic area of San Antonio is currently and will continue to be underserved by primary care providers and emergency health care services. Ther e is a void of emergent health care services related to continuing and signi ficant population growth, as well as ongoing traffic difficulties from the Westside into the South Texas Medi cal Center. Through 2016 the high risk population growth (65+) will top 39.9% versus Bexar C ounty's overall growth in this age cohort of 24.9%. Furthermore, San Antonio' s Westside population in every age cohort is growing faster than any other area of San Antonio. It is because of this growth, especially in the high risk age cohorts, that there is considera tion for the development of a fr eestanding emergency center to be located in a high traffic area, and with eas y access to all parts of the Westside. Need for the project : San Antonio is experiencing the la rgest population grow th in virtually every geographic area when compared to Texas and other US cities of similar size. Emergency care services that mimic the same type of em ergent services found in a hospital is vitally important to these high growth areas because of current need, future growth and travel difficulties. When looking a population growth pr ojections for 2013 - 2018, the Northeast side will grow by 9% (Texas will grow by 7.9% a nd Bexar 10.5%, Downtown: 4.2%. Even in the slower growing southern geographic areas (Southeast and So uthwest San Antonio), the populat ion growth will just about match the overall growth of Bexar County. Furt hermore, the high risk health population (65+) will grow by double digits in every area of Sa n Antonio. In the San Antonio MSA the current population is 2.17 million and is expected to grow to over 2.56 million by 2021 (18%). Target population : The target population is our patients th at need emergency services in areas demonstrating community need. Approximately 26% of patients are either Medicaid and/or indigent patients, and are expected to benefit fr om this project. These patients will be served equally as any other pa tient presenting to this emergency center. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project seeks to provi de increase emergency room visits in an area of community need by 2,053 visits in DY 3, 4,721 visits in DY 4, and 5,132 visits in DY5. Category 3 outcomes: 3.IT-6.1- Our goal is to increase number of patient surveys by 4% by 205 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Methodist Hospital DY % and reach top 50th percentage of patient satisfaction. Project Description: Project is to expand specialty care capacity by locating a Freest anding ED in Westside of San Antonio. San Antonio is experiencing significan t population growth in a lmost every geographic sector. Because of the population size of Bexa r County (1.8 million) and the MSA (2.17 million) and this projected growth, just about every geographic area of San Antonio is currently and will continue to be underserved by primary care pr oviders and emergency health care services. Furthermore, the delays in travel to local prov iders in the Medical Center (where the bulk of healthcare services are delivered to this populat ion) are more pronounced because of our current population and the continued growth that will be experienced over time. On the Westside of San Antonio there is a void of emergent health car e services related to c ontinuing and significant population growth, as well as ongoing traffic difficu lties from the Westside into the South Texas Medical Center. Through 2016 the high risk po pulation growth (65+) will top 39.9% versus Bexar County's overall growth in this age cohort of 24.9%. Furthermore, San Antonio's Westside population in every age cohort is growing faster than any other ar ea of San Antonio. It is because of this growth, especially in the high risk age cohorts, that there is consideration for the development of a freestanding emergency center to be located in a high traffic area, and with easy access to all parts of the Westside. One challenge that Methodist Hospital will be facing is the shortage of physicians. According to the AMA, Texas has a significan t shortage of physicians and with Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement cuts; physicians are more likely not to service those types of patients. There is also the challenge of recruiting nurses with a Texas nursing shortage. With state funding cuts for nursing education, the shortage for nurses ar e at 22,000 full-time nurses, and this amount expected to increase to 70,000 by 2020. Another ch allenge and goal is to help these patients get engaged in their own healthcare to ensure a good outcome. While these challenges may seem daunting, Methodist has a very aggressive physician recruitment program that addr esses these recruitment challe nges. For instance, in 2012 Methodist credentialed 424 new physicians and recruited from outside of San Antonio an additional 38 physicians to the market. The same can be said about the current Methodist nurse recruitment program. In 2012, Methodist hire d 893 additional nurses, and employs a fulltime nurse recruitment staff to assist in this activity. Methodist also has a long history of wellness and prevention activities targeted to the community at large, as well as area employers. A significant number of our community benefi t activities are directed toward assisting participants in understanding and continually engaging in improving personal health. As an example, in 2012 Methodist offered 2,621 complimentary communiti es wellness and prevention events, with a high percentage of these activit ies targeting those most disen franchised in our community. Core project components: A freestanding emergency facility located on the Westside of San Antonio will be open 24/7/365 206 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Methodist Hospital and staffed with appropriate clinicians , including board certified emergency physicians. Referrals into this center will be mos tly walk-in, as the center will be easy to access because of its location at a major high traffic cr ossroad in the area. This project will mimic a typical emergency center found in any acute care hospital, and will implem ent the same clinical and quality treatment and improvement protoc ols as would be expected in any hospital setting. Furthermore, this center will be open to the entire population rega rdless of their ability to pay for services, as indi cated by Mission of the Methodis t Healthcare System - Serving Humanity to Honor God. Methodist understands that continuous quality improvement is at the heart of this project. Therefore, in the implementation of this projec t, Methodist will endeavor for continuous quality improvement by monitoring the patient volumes and pa tient utilization to ensure that progress is being made towards meeting the project milestones . Additionally, Methodist will ensure that all methodologies used will meet or exceed any applicab le nationally recognized protocol or quality benchmarks. The target population is our pa tients that need emergency se rvices in areas demonstrating community need. Approximately 26% of patients ar e either Medicaid and/ or indigent patients, and are expected to benefit from this project. These patients will be served equally as any other patient presenting to th is emergency center. This project is aligned with the following Region 6 goals (Triple Aim): Assuring patients receive high-quality and pa tient-centered care, in the most cost effective ways Improve the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of our counties Further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system Starting Point/Baseline: Baseline will be determined in DY3 for ED visits. Rationale: San Antonio is experiencing the largest populatio n growth in virtually every geographic area when compared to Texas and other US cities of similar size. Emergency care services that mimic the same type of emergent services found in a hospital are vitally important to these high growth areas because of current need and future growth. Convenience, quality of care, quicker service, and a full compliment of emergent care diagnostics are the goals and metrics of this project. Furthermore, third-pa rty research indicates just a bout every geographic area in San Antonio is currently underserved for this type of service, and will continue to be if new emergency care services are not deve loped (the continued growth of ER visits from every part of San Antonio and to every hospital is witness to the need to increase ED and primary care infrastructure capacity - but cl oser to the neighborhoods and in a less costly construction 207 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Methodist Hospital environment). Project components included in the Freestanding ED: a) Increase service availability with ex tended hours - operating hours are 24 hours/365 days a year b) Increase number of specialty clinic locati ons- increase clinic locat ion in Westside of San Antonio c) Implement transparent, standardized refe rrals across the system - MHS will promote the location, services and hours of opera tion throughout the serv ice area (consumers and physicians) to increase referral s (walk-ins) to the center. d) Conduct quality improvement for projec t - This project will mimic a typical emergency center found in any acute care hospital, and will implement the same clinical and quality treatment and improvement protocols as would be expected in any hospital setting. This project address the Community Needs Assessment for these items: CN.1 - Texas ranks last in the nation on health care quality. RHP 6 is challenged to deliver improved quality and patient satisfaction. CN.3 - Many residents of RHP 6 lack access to me dical and dental care due to high rates of uninsurance and health ca re provider shortages. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): IT6.1 Patient Satisfaction - Unique RHP Outcome ID: 094154402.3.2 Rationale/Evidence: The intent of the HCAHPS initiative is to provide a standardized survey instrument and data collection methodology for measuring patients' perspectives on hospital care. The surveys are designed to produce comparable data on the patient's perspective on care that allows objective and meaningful compar isons between institutions on domains that are important to consumers. Public reporting of the su rvey results is designed to create incentives for institutions to improve their quality of care. Public reporting will serve to enhance public accountability in health care by in creasing the transparency of th e quality of institutional care provided in return for the public investment. Texas ranks last in the nation on health care quality. RHP 6 is challenged to deliver improved quality and patient satisfaction. Relationship to other Projects: The Expand Specialty Care Capacity- Fr eestanding ED will support MHS Project 094154402.1.1- Introduce, Expand, or Enhance Telemedi cine/Telehealth. Telemedicine can be made available for consults in the ED where specialty coverage is not available. 208 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Methodist Hospital Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Baptist Health Services and CHRISTUS Sant a Rosa have begun expanding services in the Westside of San Antonio. Plan for Learning Collaborative: Following completion of the RHP plan, University Health System (anchor) will facilitate the formation of working groups of performing provi ders who are pursuing similar projects. These working groups will develop their learning co llaborative structure which may include goals, regular meetings, site visits , conference calls, communication plan development, organizing learning event, and adopt metrics to measure success. Project Valuation: Methodist's project valuation us ed a method which ranked the importance of each project based on several key factors. First, Me thodist considered the extent th e project helps further the goals of the Waiver, which are to (a) enhance access to h ealth care, (b) increase the quality of care, and (c) improve the cost-effectiveness of care pr ovided in the community. Next, Methodist considered the degree of need for the project in the community as addressed and identified in the Community Needs Assessment. The size of the re quired investment was al so considered, which included considerations of personnel, equipment, time and complexity as well as the cost of the time, effort, and clinical resources involved in implementing the project. Finally, Methodist reflected on the scope of the project: the number of patients that would be affected, including the type of patients; the number of patient visits or encounters; how many providers or staff members would be added; the cost s that would be avoided as a result of the project; and the ripple effect the project would have on all member s of the healthcare syst em. These factors were weighed against the amount of funding availabl e. We believe this approach is the best methodology available to assess the impact of th e project; the investment of the performing provider, and the overall value to the commun ity, to the extent community resources are available to help fund DSRIP pr ojects. Final project valuatio n and funding distribution across categories was then determined based on the va luation provisions in the Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol. The freestanding emergency room will signifi cantly improve access to the highest quality emergency medical treatment to patients that live in areas not geographica lly located close to an existing acute care hospital, or challenged by increas ing traffic issues. This directly addresses the goals by improving the coordinated care delivery system and will address a community need by providing access to emergency servic es closer to the homes of patients that do not currently have an acute care hospital near their home. Met hodist took these factor s into account when determining the incentive value of this project. 209 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Methodist Hospital 094154402.1.2 PASS 1 1.9.2 1.9.2 A-D 1.9.2 Improve access to specialty care METHODIST HOSPITAL TPI - 094154402 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 094154402.3.2 3.IT-6.1 Percent improvement over base line of patient satisfaction scores Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P-1]: Conduct specialty care gap assessment based on community need.

The population for Kerrville (2011) was listed as 22,423 and the population for Kerr County (2011) was 49,783. Kerr County is a total of 1,108 sq miles (45 persons /sq mile) with only 20.3 (1,100.7 persons/sq mile) of that belonging to Kerrville. PRMC provi des healthcare and medical resources to nine surrounding counties with a tota l population of 187,293. Kerr Count y has been listed as a Healthcare Provider shortage area ; this however is magnified by the fact that the majority of surrounding counties is also listed as shortage areas, and/or is unable to provide any healthcare services at all. It was found in our Community Health Need s Assessment held in October of this year that 28% of Kerr County's population is unfunded, which is much higher than the national average of unfunded population which was found to be 16% and the national benchmark 11%. The cost of care for these groups is on the rise,; it is crucial that changi ng our practice to provide efficient, cost effective, high qual ity care is placed at the top of our priority list. Of PRMC's total diabetic population visits, Medica id/Indigent/Self-pay comprised 11%. Intervention(s) : This project will allow PRMC to arrang e a decision support analyst position to write reports from our current data repository as well as manage software modules. The decision support analyst will utilize tools, technology, and a pplications to access clinical, financial, and quality information on a timely basis. The develo pment of an enterprise data repository makes information available to support the hospita ls strategic planning, process improvement management, and decision-making activities. Th is program will allow healthcare providers to acquire knowledge based on real time data from dashboards created permitting them to actively participate in the assessment of healthcare quality at our organization. PRMC plans to use this data being collected and reported to key organizati onal leaders to assess our current processes and implement new and improved process improvement teams. Evidence-based models will be used implementing these process improvement projects su ch as Lean, Six Sigma, or Malcolm Baldrige. Need for the project : Studies by the National Institutes of Standards and Technology have found that organizations adopting qual ity management practices experi ence an overall improvement in employee relations, higher productivity, greater cust omer satisfaction, increased market share, and improved profitability. Current or ganizational leaders are uneducated on the use of data collected and reported, this program will allow for key leaders to be educated and trained on uses of data to improve the care we provide to our patients. This project is also needed to assist us in obtaining the information and data collection we need for our Pass 1 project that we are currently unable to retract from our repository. Rates of diabetes ar e in our community are in creasing rapidly; future organizational operations will be unable to withst and the pressure of treating the flood of obesity- related diseases, newly insured population, and ot her financial tribulati ons at this rate. Consequently, while we search for better and more efficient ways of treati ng diabetes and helping people manage the disease in the outpatient setting so that costly procedures can be prevented, we must find more ways to educat ion people during their hospitalizat ion to make healthy lifestyle choices after they are discharge using parts of the data we plan to collect in our process improvement efforts. The high cost of diabet es complications- their long term effect on the 212 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Peterson Regional Medical Center individuals quality of life, the high treatment costs, the fact that they are largely preventable, and the possibility for a sizable return on investment are all reason we feel this project is important to our organization and our community. Target population : The target population that will be focu sed on is our community's diabetic and un/under-funded populations. Kerr C ounty went from being ranked 196th (out of 254 Texas Counties) in 2011 to 246th in 2012 in the diabetes category. If that alone wasn't ample enough of a reason to target this population in our community, the real ity of how many of our community residents are unfunded/underfunded compounds the comp lexity of being able to care for these patients with any kind of magn itude or degree of quality value extremely difficult. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : This project seeks to incr ease the number of reports generated through quality improvement data sy stems by producing the following reports for PRMC's diabetic patient population: scheduled follow-up appointments post hospitalization, pharmacist coaching to patient/family prior to disc harge, number of encounters with the Discharge Advocate, Emergency Room encounters, follow-up phone calls conducted post acute care discharge, scheduled outpatient diabetic education visits with diabetic educator and 30 day readmission rates. These reports will allow PRMC to focus on areas of needed improvement to drive improved quality of care and reduce healthcare cost within targeted diabetic population group in DY4. In DY5, a quality dashboard wi ll be created and pr esented throughout the organization, demonstration to key leadership on the use of the dashboard to drive rapid-cycle performance improvement efforts. Category 3 outcomes : OD-9 Right Care, Right Setting IT -9.2 Reduce Emergency Department visits for target condition-Diabetes will be ex ecuted in DY4 and DY5. 19% of total diabetic population visits at PRMC were seen in our ED in calendar year 2012. DY4 improvement target is to reduce ED visits as a percen tage of total diabetic population visits by 5%. DY5 improvement target is to reduce ED visits as a percentage of total diabetic population vi sits by 5% for a total of 10%. To reach these goals actionable data will need to be obtained to verify PRMC's Pass I project is operational. Current ly PRMC does not have the res ources or personnel to accomplish these data collection requirements. Project Description: Peterson Regional Medical Center proposes to implement a process using technology to provide actionable data. Organization wide tr aining on the use of that data to drive efficiency, improved quality measure monitori ng, increase patient safety, and enhance patient-centered care activities th roughout the entire system. Peterson Regional Medical Center (PRMC) currently lacks the availability of adequate data extraction and reporting skills to facilitate e ffective decision making for quality and safety improvement initiatives. This project will allow arrangement of a decision support analyst position to write reports from our current data repository as well as manage software modules. The decision support analyst will utilize tools, technology, and applications to access clinical, financial, and quality information on a timely basi s. The development of an enterprise data repository makes information available to suppo rt the hospital's strategic planning, process improvement management, and decision-making activities. Meaningful data can help to proactively a ddress issues, measure progress and capitalize on quality improvement opportunities. It is essential th at healthcare providers acquire the knowledge to actively participate in the a ssessment of healthcare quality. Decision support analysts assist departmental leaders in determining the informa tion necessary to satisfy specific business and 213 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Peterson Regional Medical Center customer demands. PRMC currently contracts with outside sources paying them to write customized reports and to develop data views an d dashboards little and/or fragmented action takes place from the results reported due to a lack of education on how to use the information to make process improvements. Over the past year, PR MC has paid in excess of $50,000 to have reports developed. We have many other n eeds for additional development a nd education that we feel at this time we cannot afford to have done on a c ontract basis. Recruiti ng an experienced decision support analyst will allow PRMC to measure quantitative data against benchmarked standards in order to clarify and verify organizational focus on and progress towards PRMC's strategic goals. Studies by the National Institutes of St andards and Technology (NIST) have found organizations adopting quality management pr actices experience an overall improvement in employee relations, higher productivity, greater cust omer satisfaction, increased market share, and improved profitability. In combination with implementing a data support analyst, PRMC will adopt components of evidence based improvement methodologies such as Lean, Baldrige, and Six Sigma. Once data collection efforts are available, speci alized training to ke y organizational leaders will enhance our ability to effectively utili ze info to make necessary system process improvements. Training will include evidence ba sed process improvement methodologies such as Lean, Six Sigma, and Baldrige. Leaders will then demonstrate use of data and process improvement methodologies to positively impact outcomes. Outcomes to be impacted include: increased patient care quality and safety, health ca re cost reeducation, decr eased waste, efficiency, and improvement of patient-cente red activities. A system will be developed to allow employee input regarding potential or actual identified issues; and a dashboard program will be hardwired within our infrastructure provi ding real-time data acces sibility to all employees throughout the organization. Goals and Relationship to Regional Goals: The goal of this project is to improve the organization's ability to positively affect previously mentioned outcomes through better us e of data and evidence based improvement methodologies. It is critical this project support not simply what is good for the company, but also what is good for its employees, stakeholders, supp liers, partners, collaborators, customers, and community as a whole. Project Goals: Create strategic organizational goa ls that are focused and patie nt centered and to increase the availability of data to s upport data driven decision making Recruitment of an experienced decision support analyst Training for key organization leaders and employees on process improvement methods based on data collected Effective and timely use of data driven process improvement tools and activities Quality dashboard that allows information to be easily shared with organizational leadership at all levels Budgets, policies, practices a nd processes evaluated modified and improved based on valid data and evidence based improvement methodologies Reduce waste and variation in care processes to drive improvement in quality measures and patient care Rates of diabetes are increasing throughout our community rapidly; future organizational 214 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Peterson Regional Medical Center will not be able to withstand the pressure of treating the flood of obesity-related diseases. Consequently, while we search for better and more efficient ways of treati ng diabetes and helping people manage the disease in the outpatient setting so that costly procedures can be prevented, we must find more ways to educat e people during their hospitaliza tion to make healthy lifestyle choices after they are discharged using parts of the data we pl an to collect in our process improvement efforts. This project meets the following Regional Goals : Triple Aim: assuring patients receive high-quality and patient-centered care, in the most cost effective ways Improve the health care infrastructure to bett er serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of our counties; Improve outcomes while containing cost growth Further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system Improve and prepare the health care infrastr ucture to serve a newly insured population Health care information technology to im prove communication and health care Challenges: Quantifying healthcare quality is complex and a challenging process, which exceeds PRMC's current human resource capabilities. Currently, fragmentation of data flow occurs because of multiple collections of data silos. Other challenges PRMC faces are: Limited availability of timely data to guide improvement efforts Questionable validity of cu rrent data collection Duplicated data collection and improve ment efforts across the organization Limited knowledge on effective use of data to prioritize measure and improve clinical, financial, and administrative processes Inability to devote current human resources to data collection and employee training efforts No current evidence based methodology pro cess used effectively throughout the organization Information is not commonly shared with organizational leadership at all levels We suspect that there are extensive gaps betw een the care that patients receive and what the medical community has determined to be the most effective care. Despite unrivaled technological innovation, it is diffi cult to ensure that all patien t care being delivered meets the accepted standards of quality. Gaps in quality are responsible for wasteful, ineffective care, preventable medical complications, avoidable hospita lizations, decreased quality of life, disability, and premature death. As a result, there is a key need for better integration and sharing of data within and across our healthcare system and even within our entire community. To address these challenges PRMC seeks to recruit an experienced a decision support analysts and evidence based process improvement methodologies. Implementation of this project will provide leaders and frontline healthcare provi ders the resources to collecting and reporting health data which will help them to better characte rize the nature of health or process problems in our organization and our community and develop actionable plans based on the findings. To ensure data is accurately and consistently collected and understood, PRMC will provide key leaders and employees from all levels thr oughout the organization, improvement methodology coaching. 5-Year Expected Outcome for Provider and Patients: PRMC expects to see improvements in safet y, quality of care, healthcare outcomes, and reduced healthcare cost based on reliable, timely, and actionabl e data collection findings. 215 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Peterson Regional Medical Center Employees will be trained to use process improveme nt tools (ex: Lean, Six Sigma, PDSA or Rapid Cycle Improvement) teaching them how to read, ev aluate and implement change or improvement based on the use of valid data collection mechan isms. A quality dashboard will be developed to disseminate information across le vels within the organization. Standardizing specific components of data collection and using improvement metho dology tools will create efficiency, drive patient centered care, narrow the focus of needs identifie d which results in improved quality, safety, and patient centered care lead ing to an overall health care cost reduction. Starting Point/Baseline: Currently PRMC data availability is fragment ed with limited ability to extract, aggregate and disseminate data. Leadership and other sta ff members have little training in evidence-based processes such as Lean, Six Sigma or Rapid Cycle Improvement. A decision support analyst position does not exist at PRMC at this time. We currently utilize two outside resources, one for reports and the other to create dashboard views. In the past year, we have had a minimum of 40 reports written for our organization with costs exceeding $50,000. PRMCs baseline diabetic population in calendar year 2012 is a total of 3,719 patients with 12% or 1,226 visits having an inpatient stay. Rationale: Option 1.10.2 was chosen to correct current fr agmented process improvement efforts and inefficient data collection systems. Excessive healthcare cost and errors can occur because of system and process failures. In an effort to im prove operational effectiveness and create a culture of continuous improvement PRMC feels a combin ed approach of designing a reliable data collection process along with adopting process improvement techniques will address current inefficiencies, ineffective care, and preventable errors. Thus, allowing key process improvement personnel to influence quality improvements effo rts and activities throughout the organization. When data is gathered, tracked, and analyzed in a more credible way, it becomes possible to measure progress and success or lack thereof. This project will assist in fostering a culture of change by developing an understanding of identi fied problems through data collection and caring out improvement opportunities by involving key st ake holders, testing change, and continuous evaluation to sustain change. As mentioned before our target group that will be focused on firs t is our community's diabetic population. The high cost of diabetes co mplications\u2014their long term effect on individual quality of life, the high treatment costs, the fact that they ar e largely preventable, and the possibility for a sizable return on investment\u2014provide i nherent incentives for PRMC to assess the diabetes care in our organization and identify opportunities for quality improvement. Performance improvement and reporting capacity is a large component in determ ining the success of our Pass 1 project. The Pass 1 project has identified a n eed for data collection on our target population, which is not readily available today and would be expensive for us to acqui re through contracted agencies. All data collection efforts and report writing is outsourced and is often returned in difficult to read formats or not in cluding all data measurements reque sted within one single report. This makes it incredibly difficult in making anything from the report useful in process improvement efforts. Both the NHQR and IOM's Crossing the Quality Chasm report highlight the importance of improving care for chronic diseases. Diabetes in particular is recognized as one chronic disease for which quality improvement efforts could make great strides. Diabetes has widely respected national guidelines for what constitutes quality care and well-developed national measures of 216 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Peterson Regional Medical Center quality. Despite this fact, the gap between ev idence-based treatment and actual practice and outcomes continues to be wide. There continues to be a large number of complications from diabetes that research demonstrates could have been prevented with high quality care. We anticipate this resulting in better patient care a nd improved patient outcomes. This project option will provide the data collection mechanism to a ddress the current cumbersome and complicated process of collecting baseline-starting points for the Pass 1 Option 2.12.1 project. Project Components: Through enhanced performance improvement a nd reporting capacity th rough technology, PRMC will meet the following required project components: a) Provide training and education to clinical and administrative staff on process improvement strategies, methodologies, and culture - Employment or expansion of an existing position will be evaluated to implement the role of a decision support analyst. The decision support analyst will collaborate with key stakehol ders within our organization to review components of process improvement methods or tools such as PD SA, Six Sigma, and FMEA to be considered for use within our or ganization. Once these methods and tools for improvement have been chosen, in-depth education will be provided to key influential leaders from throughout the organization. Th ese key players will then lead the way by allocating their efforts in educating the remainder of the workforce team. b) Develop an employee suggestion system that allo ws for the identification of issues that impact the work environment, patient care and satisfaction, efficien cy and other issues aligned with continuous process improvement - PRMC currently uses a mechanism similar for employees to use for such reporting called, Bright Idea. They are able to submit a Bright Idea from the Intranet home page, once it has been submitted it is sent to the Quality Improvement Department for review. This appl ication is old and out dated; therefore, the process and application will be reviewed, upda ted, and improved as necessary to meet the need of our employees and the goals of this project. c) Design data collection systems to collect real-time data that is used to drive continuous quality improvement. A dashboard system will be developed allowing centralized accessibility to data collection systems. A centr al data repository will improve visibility of current data collection activity and redu ce duplicated data collection efforts. The unique community need identifica tion numbers the project addresses : CN.1 - Texas ranks last in the nation on health care quality. RHP 6 is challenged to deliver improved quality and patient satisfaction CN.2 - A high prevalence of chr onic disease and rela ted health dispariti es require greater prevention efforts and improved management of pa tients with chronic conditions. Leading causes of death in RHP 6 include cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes How the project represents a ne w initiative or enhances an existing delivery system reform initiative: A new initiative for implementing the position of a decision support analyst will be evaluated. This project will enhance and streamlin e current quality improvement efforts. This project will provide the capability to colle ct needed data in the Pass I initiative. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-9 Right Care, Right Setting 217 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Peterson Regional Medical Center \"The U.S. healthcare system wastes $700 b illion annually on the kinds of systemic inefficiencies that would make a quality mana gement guru cringe,\" sa ys Robert Kelly, Vice President of Healthcare Analytics at Thomson Reuters. This project will provide the ability to capture data needed for setting baseline measur ements for our pass 1 project and other identified system failures in the future. Without valida ted reliable data and pr oven methodology, tools to learn how to turn data into valuable informa tion our organization will remain stagnant. OD-9 Right Care, Right Setting and IT 9.2 (standalone ) was chosen as the projects outcome domain based on 19% of overall diabetic population visits were Emergenc y Department setting. One goal of collecting meaningful data is to identify the frequency a nd cost of care of emergency department visits in PRMC's diabetic populatio n group. Once proper reports are generated we can identify trends which contributed to diabetic patients not seeking the right care in the right setting. Because diabetes can result in expensive long -term complications, investing in diabetes control initiatives can improve health outcomes a nd reduce health care costs. Quality healthcare can be defined as the right care delivered in the ri ght setting to the right person at the right time. Patients who do not understand the importance of the underlying premise that primary care will provide them with continuity and oversight of thei r overall health will look for the most convenient path to care, such as going to Emergency Rooms, and never realize the its consequences. Right care in the right setting offers continuity of care which improved treatment adherence, allows early detecti on of problematic health issues and reduces the risk of these becoming health emergencies. Relationship to other Projects: For Pass 2 PRMC was only required to do one project. However, our Pass 1 project's success will be determined on process improvements and reporting from the outcomes of this Pass 2 project. The pass 1 project has identified a need for data, which is not readily available today. Once data is available, training will enhance our ab ility to effectively utilize information to make system process improvements resulting in improved patient outcomes. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Relationship to other Performing Provider Projects is unable to be determined at this time. Plan for Learning Collaborative: University Health System, as the RHP 6 an chor, will promote and facilitate learning collaborative. Following completion of the RHP Pl an, University Health System will facilitate the formation of working groups of performing provide rs who are pursuing similar projects. These working groups will develop their learning co llaborative structure which may include the following: Identify participants; Establish Lear ning Collaborative goals; Develop a calendar of regular meetings, site visits, and/or conference calls; Develop a plan to communicate ideas, data, and successes across the region and state; Organize a learning event and invite experts and other Performing Providers from outside the region to share knowledge and best practices; Adopt metrics to measure success. Project Valuation: Peterson values each project based on the sp ecific needs of the community, projected impact on community health outcomes, level of advancement to the hea lthcare delivery system, and the time, effort and clinical resources necessa ry to implement each portion of this project. 218 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Peterson Regional Medical Center Evidence from research indicates th at quality improvement is critic al to achieving better health outcomes and closing the gaps between what we know and what we do in health care. In addition, there is growing evidence that investments in diab etes quality improvement can yield a significant return on investment both in terms of cost savi ngs and improved quality of life for people with diabetes. Peterson Regional Medical Center is license d for 125 acute care beds. The diabetic population in calendar year 2012 cons isted of 3719 patients. 11% of the visits were provided for the Medicaid/Indigent/Self-pay subpopulation. Cost a voidance is being limited by data availability and budget constraints on use of external resources. PRMC lacks the availa bility of a ppropriately trained personal to write quality improvement re ports from data collected from within our organization. The true value is establishi ng the capability that will last throughout the organization's history. The implem entation cost of this project is estimated to be $436,636. This project will address the community health care needs by providing the tools to reach Pass 1 data and process improvement goals. In calendar y ear 2012 PRMC's baseline diabetic population group had a total of 3,719 patients with 1,226 inpatient ad missions for a total of $28.8 million in charges. PRMC's Pass 1 initiative estimates an averag e annual community healthcare savings of $2.9 million by reducing the rate of inpatient admissions (as a percentage of the total diabetic population) by 10%. Without pro cess improvement methodologies, the capability to enhance reporting ability and integrity fail ure to meet improvement outcomes is imminent. Components of evidence based improvement methodologies combined with real-time data availability increase the likelihood of desired outcomes. \"The ultimate measure by which to judge the quality of a medical effort is whether it helps patients (and their fa milies) as they see it. Anything done in health care that does not help a patient or family is, by definition, waste, whether or not the professions and their associations traditionally hallow it\" (Don Berwick, 1997). 219 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Peterson Regional Medical Center 127294003.1.1 PASS 2 1.10.2 1.10.2.A-C E NHANCE PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT AND REPORTING CAPACITY Peterson Regional Medical Center TPI - 127294003 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 127294003.3.4 IT-9.2 Reduce Emergency Department vi sits for target condition - Diabetes (Standalone) Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P-5]: Enhance or expand the organizational infrastructure and resources to store, analyze and share the patient experience data and/or quality measures data, as well as utilize them for quality improvement.

RHP 6 encompasses 20 counties and covers 24,734 square miles, comprising about 9.5% of the total land area of Texas. Intervention(s) : Southwest General Hospital proposes to deve lop and implement a Gestational Diabetes program to educate and monitor patients through out their pregnancy, therefore improving fetal outcomes. The project will provide specialty care services and providers to better accommodate the high demand for peri-natal services and thus have increased access to services. The project will include a structured program that involves bo th Obstetricians and Maternal Fetal Medicine physicians, perinatal nurses, and a diabetic e ducator. The program will include a process to ensure transparent, standardized referrals across the continuum of care. Need for the project : RHP 6 pregnant women currently have limited a ccess to resources to care for at risk or diagnosed with gestational diabetes. The program will seek to enhance ease and availability of care resources. Bexar County, which has the highest number of bi rths in the state of Texas, has a higher adolescent (ages 13-17 years) pregnancy rate than Texas, with an average of 30.6 per 1000 women compared to 26.1 for the state. Th is project will assist with meeting a serious healthcare gap in RHP 6. Women of Hispanic origin have a 5-8% ch ance of developing ge stational diabetes compared to a 1.5-2% risk in non-Hispanic white women. Approxi mately 54% of the population in RHP 6 is of Hispanic origin. This differs from the state as a whole, which is 46% Anglo and 38% Hispanic. With proper diet, medication and monitoring, complications from gestational diabetes ca n be controlled. A st rong referral network will support achieving this program goal. Of the 36,000 live births in RHP 6 in 2008, only 59% of mothers recei ved prenatal care within the first trimester, leading to th e assumption, access to medical care remains difficult regardless of clinic resources. The high percentage rate of stillbirths, premature deliveries and low birth weight babies, preterm labor, and birth trauma related to di abetes in pregnancy presents a need for these services. The Gestational Diabetes Program will assist with improving the health care delivery infrastructure to better serve the Medi caid and uninsured residents of South San Antonio and surrounding areas. At Southwes t General Hospital currently, 89.4% of obstetrical patients are Medicaid an d uninsured mothers and babies. 222 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Southwest General Hospital The program will build on an existing Maternal Fetal Medicine program which is comprised of Obstetricians, Maternal Fetal Medicine Physicians, Diabetes Educators, and Perinatal Nurse Practitioners. Outreach e fforts will serve to identify and reach key rural areas currently experiencing difficulty with access to care. Target population : The target population will be pregnant teens and women at risk for or diagnosed with gestational diabetes in RHP 6. Currently, Southwest is seeing approximately 620 mothers annually for care related to Gestational Diabetes. The focus will be on the first trimester of pregnancy with an added focus on Hispanic adolescents and women. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : To provide a specialty gestational diabet es outreach center with an established associated maternal fetal medicine program. To decrease the percentage of low birth we ight babies resulting from undiagnosed or untreated gestational diabetes. To increase the total volume of patients seen at the specialty clinic by 6% from baseline DY 3 to DY4. Category 3 outcomes: Our goal is to reduce the number of babies weighing less than 2500 gram s at birth by 5% in year 4 and by 7% in year 5 by screening, ear ly identification, inte rvention, treatment and provision of preventive care for the pre gnant women with gestational diabetes. Project Description: Southwest General Hospital proposes to develop and implement a Gestational Diabetes program to educate and monitor patients throughout the pr egnancy, therefore improving patient outcomes. The project for Southwest General Hospital is designed to increase the capacity to provide specialty care services and the availability of targeted specia lty providers to better accommodate the high demand for services and thus have incr eased access to services. Southwest General Hospital will develop and implement a Gestatio nal Diabetes program to educate and monitor patients, therefore, improving fetal outcomes. We propose providing a structured program that involves referrals to both Obstetricians and Matern al Fetal Medicine physic ians, perinatal nurses, and a diabetic educator. Through the goal of improving access to specialty care, the project will impact the following: Clinic hours will be established to meet n eeds through flexibility of hours (early am and evening) as well as routine hour visits Gestational diabetes clinics will be establ ished in one additional area of RHP 6 with highest pregnancy rate Quality improvement efforts will focus on us e of rapid cycle improvement methodologies 223 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Southwest General Hospital to identify and quickly address project barriers and/or implementation barriers Goals and Relationship to Regional Goals: The goal of this project is to increase the capacity to provide specialty care services and the availability of targeted specia lty providers to better accommoda te the high demand for services and thus have increased access to services. A structured education program and ongoing patient monitoring will have as a goal the improvement in clinical outcomes for women with Gestational Diabetes. Project Goals: Provide a Gestational Diabetes Program for the RHP 6 region Increase access to care for RHP 6 pregnant women at risk for or diagnosed with gestational diabetes Decrease the percentage rate of stillbirths, premature delivery and low birth weight babies, preterm labor, and birth trauma related to diabetes in pregnancy This program meets the following regional goals: The Gestational Diabetes Program will cont ribute to assuring patients receive high- quality, patient centered care with the goal of improved outcomes for mother and baby The Gestational Diabetes Program will assist with improving the health care delivery infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninjured residents of South San Antonio and surrounding areas. At Southwest Genera l Hospital currently, 89.4% of obstetrical patients are Medicaid and unins ured mothers and babies. The program will build on an existing Maternal Fetal Medicine program which is comprised of Obstetricians, Maternal Fetal Me dicine Physicians, Diabetes Educators, and Perinatal Nurse Practitioners. Outreach efforts will serve to identify and reach key rural areas currently experiencing difficulty with ac cess to care. The Birthplace at Southwest General Hospital has provided care to women, including teens, with gestational diabetes with excellent outcomes. We have the ability and knowledge to provide outlying communities with the resources needed to ma nage patients with Gestational Diabetes. The establishment of standardized referral a nd work up guidelines is critical to program success. Challenges/Issues Faced By Provider: Of the 36,000 live births in RHP 6 in 2008, only 59% of mothers recei ved prenatal care within the first trimester, leading to th e assumption, access to medical care remains difficult regardless of clinic resources 1 Difficulties with the Medicaid authorization processes may lead to physicians to drop many Medicaid patients 5-year Expected Outcome: Through an increase in access, the Birthplace at Southwest General Hospital will improve clinical outcomes for pregnant women with Gesta tional Diabetes, therefore, anticipate decreasing 224 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Southwest General Hospital the rate of stillbirths, premature delivery and low birth weight babies, macrosomia, preterm labor, and birth trauma related to diabetes in pregnancy. 1 RHP 6 Community Needs Assessment, September 2012. Starting Point/Baseline: The baseline for the program will serve as the foundation to further develop and grow the Maternal Fetal Medicine Program at Southwest General Hospital to care for local and outlying regions of RHP 6 with a high quality gestational diabetes specialty care service line. The baseline number of participants as well as the number of providers begins as 0 for both in DY2. The Birthplace at Southwest Gene ral Hospital has provided care to women, including teens, with gestational diabetes with excel lent outcomes. We have the ab ility and knowledge to provide outlying communities with the resources needed to manage patients with Gestational Diabetes. Baseline number of available appointment for Ge stational Diabetes patie nts is at capacity in existing care delivery model and is limited by sp ace and time. The ability to establish outreach clinics served by specialty consultants in key ne ed areas will provide improved access to mothers requiring screening, care, and management of diab etes, as required. The establishment of these clinics will also reduce waiting time for routin e appointments and foster improved participation and compliance with treatment plans for diabetes and pregnancy management. Currently, Southwest is seeing 620 mothers annually fo r care related to Ge stational Diabetes. Rationale: Of the 36,000 live births in RHP 6 in 2008, only 59% of mothers received pr enatal care within the first trimester, leading to the assumption, access to medical care remains difficult regardless of clinic resources2. It is estimated that between 2.5 pe rcent and 4 percent of women in the United States will develop gestational diabetes during pregnancy. Gestational diabetes place these women at a greater risk for pregnancy co mplications including pree clampsia, respiratory difficulties, neonate hypoglycemia, birth injury and st illbirth. According to the Texas Department of Human Services, in 2007, 50.3% of the pr emature births were from Hi spanic mothers. Women of Hispanic origin have a 5-8% chance of developi ng gestational diabetes compared to a 1.5-2% risk in non-Hispanic white women. Approximate ly 54% of the population in RHP 6 is of Hispanic origin3. This differs from the state as a whol e, which is 46% Anglo and 38% Hispanic4. With proper diet, medication and monitoring, comp lications from gestational diabetes can be controlled. According to the Regional Healthcare Partners hip 6 Community Needs Assessment (September 2012), Diabetes is one of the major causes of prem ature death in the U.S. and disproportionately affects some racial and ethnic populations. The percentages of low birt h weight babies and diabetes among adults are similar for the region and Texas, with an average between 8% and 10%. Bexar County, which has the highest number of births, has a higher adolescent (ages 13-17 years) pregnancy rate than Texas, with an average of 30.6 per 1000 women compared to 26.1 for the state 5. This project will assist with meeti ng a serious healthcare gap in RHP 6. The Birthplace at Southwest Gene ral Hospital has provided care to women, including teens, with 225 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Southwest General Hospital gestational diabetes with excel lent outcomes. We have the ab ility and knowledge to provide outlying communities with the skil ls, knowledge, and clinically competent resources necessary to manage patients with Gestat ional Diabetes and for patients to manage self through outreach services in collaboration with ru ral healthcare teams. All pregnant women should be screened for gestational diabetes because of its serious risks; however, a recent study has found that only 68 percent of all pregnant women were screened6. With proper diet, medication, and monitoring, complications from gestational diabetes can be controlled. Unique community need identification number the project addresses: CN.5 -Lack of interconceptional and prenatal care for women and preventative pediatric care results in poor maternal and child health outcomes As stated previously, Southwest General has provided a Maternal Fetal Medicine program for the last 12 months. The expansion of the program to RHP 6 areas of acute need will be a new initiative requiring space as well as human and material resources. The ability to model the existing program is an asset in development and implementation of the project. 2RHP 6 Community Needs Assessment, September 2012. 3 United States Census County Quick Facts. ht tp//: quickfacts.census.co m /qfd/states/48000.html, accessed September 10, 2012. 4Texas Department of State H ealth Services.2010.

Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-8 Perinatal Outcome: IT- 8.2 Percentage of Low Birth-weight births Of the 36,000 live births in RHP 6 in 2008, only 59% of mothers received pr enatal care within the first trimester, leading to the assumption, access to medical care remains difficult regardless of clinic resources2. The potential for gestational diabetes going unidentified is extremely high in the region. The screening, identifi cation, education and provision of prenatal care are critical to impact the above outcome measures. According to the Texas Department of Human Se rvices, in 2007, 50.3% of the premature births were from Hispanic mothers. Women of Hispan ic origin have a 5-8% chance of developing gestational diabetes compared to a 1.5-2% ri sk in non-Hispanic white women. Approximately 54% of the population in RHP 6 is of Hispanic origin6. This differs from the state as a whole, which is 46% Anglo and 38% Hispanic3. With proper diet, medication and monitoring, complications from gestational diabetes can be controlled. The monitoring of the above metric will serve to evaluate the outcomes associated with education related to proper diet, medication management, and complication prevention provid ed through a gestational diabetes program focused on screening and identification of actual and potential and potenti al residents in RHP 6 with gestational diabetes. The monitoring initiative is new to Southwest General Hospital; however, the outcome measure 226 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Southwest General Hospital of low birth weight is cr itical to evaluation of the program ou tcomes as well as evaluation of the entire population served by the facility. The m onitoring and evaluation outcomes will serve to further develop the diabetes program and will serve as the basis for identification of additional clinical care programs. Relationship to other Projects: The development of a Gestationa l Diabetes program service li ne would inter-relate to the following projects: 1.9: Diabetes service line expansion to a ddress the specialty problem of gestational diabetes; 2.6: Implementation of evidence-based health promotion and disease prevention program for gestational diabetes; 2.12: The implementation of a comprehensive care transition program for Post Partum follow-up and disease follow-up and monitoring. The project aligns with Category 4 Population focused measures wh ich are the following: RD-1 Potentially Preventable Admissions related to Diab etes. Diabetic short term complications of patients cared for in program and post delivery require admission for short term diabetic complications. Through the identific ation of barriers and facilitators of post partum follow up in women with recent gestational diabetes, the incidences requi ring admission are hypothesized to be minimal post participati on in SWGH proposed program. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Potential members of learning collaborative based on early review and iden tification of projects. Further detail required to assess comparab ility and potential for collaboration. 1.

The potential for collaboration with above identifi ed projects and providers is critical to best practice identification and performance improvement projects. 227 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Southwest General Hospital Project Valuation: Achieve Waiver Goals: \"Initiatives under the DSRIP program are designed to provide in centive payments to hospitals and other providers for investments in delivery system reforms that increase access to health care, improve the quality of care, and enhance the health of patients and families they serve\". Southwest General will develop the gestational diabetes progra m, provide qualified members of the Healthcare team, to include Obstetricians and Maternal Feta l Medicine providers, to support patient education and care, and allocate space, equipment, and resources to recruit program participants. Addresses Community Needs: As previously outlined the community and the RHP as a whole are critically challenged to provide timely prenatal care a nd reduce the incidence of gestational diabetes. Of the 36,000 live births in RHP 6 in 2008, only 59% of mothers receiv ed prenatal care within the first trimester, leading to the assumption, access to medical car e remains difficult regardless of clinic resources 7. The potential for gestational diabetes going unidentified is extremely high in the region. The screening, identifica tion, education and provision of pr enatal care are critical to impact the above outcome measures. 7RHP 6 Community Needs Assessment, September 2012. Project Scope: Southwest General Hospital has a known reputation on the Southsid e of San Antonio related to obstetrical care. In late 2011, th e organization launched a maternal fetal medicine program which has enhanced the ability to reach outlying re gions and establish a pr ogram to identify and manage gestational diabetes in a manner whic h demonstrates practices based on evidence and supported by clinical outcomes. The expansion of the program to outlying communities will further enhance care but also ex tend high quality preventive care and education for the region. The program framework is developed and requir es the expansion and planning to serve and identify a larger patient base and establish outreach programs to impact care for the patient population. Project Investment: Many of the resources required to support the physician component of the proposed project is in place. The major investment centers on midlev el care provider recruitment and salaries. Additionally, support staff, space, additional equipm ent needs, travel, marketing, and educational materials will require hospital dollars to suppor t program implementation and sustainability. 228 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Southwest General Hospital 136491104.1.1 PASS 1 1.9.2 1.9.2 (A,B,D) 1.9.2 Improve Access to Specialty Care: Improve Outcomes for Diabetic Pregnancies Southwest General Hospital TPI - 136491104 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 136491104.3.1 3.IT-8.2 Percentage of Lo w Birth Weight Births Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 (P-1) Conduct a specialty care gap analysis as a means to describe the community need for a Gestational Diabetes program P1.1.

It serves as the primary teaching hospital for the University of Texas Health Science Ce nter San Antonio, and the lead Level I Trauma Center and safety net provider for the estimat ed 2 million residents of Bexar County and South Texas. Over the past two decades University Health System has expanded access to primary, specialty and preventive health care services, and currently operates 19 health centers and clinics throughout Bexar County. Intervention(s) : The Health System will partner with Federally Qualified Health Centers to increase access to women's health services for residents of Bexar County, Texas by establishing clinical sites and increasing number of primary car e visits to enhance acce ss to early preventive care. Combined, these practices can encourag e and empower individuals to make healthy decisions that can lead to improved health outc omes in the area of maternal, infant and child health. Need for the project : Rapid population growth alongside c oncentrations of low-income, under and uninsured residents underscore the importa nce of improving access to preventive health services that respond to the h ealth service needs of the popula tion. Focusing on maternal, child and infant health is considered an important oppor tunity to identify existi ng health conditions in women such as diabetes, hypertension, poor nutriti on and to prevent future health problems for women and their children. Factors that can impact maternal and child health include living in poverty, limited access to prenatal care, nutrition and age. The rate of uninsured in Bexar County is 23% further highlighting the need for increased access. Target population : The target population includes Medicai d-funded (19%) and uninsured (43%) individuals who represent 62% of the patient population served by the Health System. In addition focus will be placed on residents located in rapidly gr owing areas of Bexar County and in particular the central Northern sector of the county where al most four out ten individuals have no usual source of medical care or have not received a medical ch eckup in the past year. This area also has a number of a high number of low income, uninsured, minority residents who suffer from multiple chronic conditions Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The anticipated 5 year goal is to increase primary care encounters by 20% over baseline (or 7,524 encounters) by enhanci ng access to preventive health care targeting improved birth outc omes in both mother and child.

Combined, these practices can encourag e and empower individuals to make healthy decisions that can lead to improved health outc omes in the area of maternal, infant and child health. In Bexar County, as elsewhere, lo w income, uninsured, minority populations have multiple chronic conditions. Without regular prim ary care, chronic conditions are likely to become acute episodes, putting patients at risk for disability and premature death. Extended delays in appointment scheduli ng and long wait times have a significant negative impact on patient and provider satisfaction a nd quality of care, and discourage people from using health care proactively. Recruitment of providers to serve a medically compromised population will also be challenging. The 5 year goal is to e xpand delivery of women's preventive service and thereby create access to primar y care services for high risk populations translating into additional 7,524 patient encounter s. Establishing a new clinic location that provides much needed women's preventive health services addr esses many of the challenges faced by patients including delays in scheduling appointments, long wait times and overall access to healthcare. The project addresses th e following regional goals: Further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system Starting Point/Baseline: As of September 30, 2012, there are 0 patient enc ounters at this new lo cation for base year. Rationale: In the United States, safety-net hospital systems remain essential to providing access to health services for over 50 million uninsured American s as well as other underserved populations. In the era of healthcare reform, safety-net hospi tals will remain critic al to responding to the mandate of providing medical care that is acce ssible, integrated, and patient-centered. In addition, the evidence makes clear that carefully tailo red health services inte rventions can lead to the establishment of a usual source of care, impr ove adherence to clinical care and treatment, and strengthen evidence-based clinical preventive service delivery to ec onomically vulnerable, uninsured or underinsured populations. In Bexar County, Texas, rapid population growth alongside concentrations of low-income, under and uninsured residents underscore the importan ce of improving access to preventive health services that respond to the h ealth service needs of the populat ion. Focusing on maternal, child and infant health is considered an important oppo rtunity to identify existi ng health conditions in 233 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital women such as diabetes, hyperten sion, poor nutrition and to preven t future health problems for women and their children. Factors that can impact maternal and child health include living in poverty, limited access to prenatal care, nutrition and age. The rate of uninsured in Bexar County is 23% further highlighting the need for increased access. To combat these disparities and increase healthca re access, University Health System; the major safety-net hospital for South Central Texas pr oposes to expand its pa tient-centered medical home. This is considered an integrated model of health service delivery that focuses on providing high quality, affordable, accessible care alongside a cl inical practice that is efficient, evidence- based and utilizes inter-operable information sy stems to address primary, urgent and specialty care needs. This project addresses CN.3. Specifically, the local identified need of increased access to medical health services due to hi gh rates of uninsured and a shortage of health care providers is being addressed. This program strengthens heal thcare linkages with local community partners enhances access to health care services by expand ing clinical services and increasing the number of healthcare providers. No add itional federal funds will be util ized for this project due to partnership with FQHC. This will be a partne rship of co-location with a lease agreement involved. The primary project component is to improve geogr aphical coverage and ac cess to clinical sites and increase number of primary care visits to enhance access to early preventive care with particular focus placed on addr essing maternal and child healt h. This evidence-based model of care shifts focus from clinical service provision to the patient, their families, and their community. Establishing a long-term, trusting rela tionship assures patients receive the right care, including recommended clinical pr eventive services, at the right time, in the right setting. Implementation of this program will ensure patients have access to continuity of primary and preventive care services. Stra tegies include redesi gning our clinical workflow to reduce wait times, assure timely scheduling of appointment s, deliver clear communication and messaging between patients and health care teams, provi de data systems to support population health management, establish effective case manage ment and care coordination, and support patient self-care, development, and accountability, and develop performance reporting and improvement plans using LEAN concepts to reduce waste. Measures of performance will include both proce ss and outcomes measures that assess progress towards implementation milestones. These incl ude: 1) measures of clinical expansion (establishment of patient-centered medical home site), 2) integr ation and access (expanded services that address ta rget population needs), and 3) quality of care and co st-effectiveness. In summary, establishing this patien t-centered, clinical preventive model of care strengthens the our mission and responds to national health ai ms of delivering high quality care, improving population health and reduc ing healthcare costs.

In addition, the delivery of postnatal care primarily through preventive screening conducted at specific developmental milestones can he lp reduce maternal death or disability as a result of undiagnosed conditions (Healthy People 2020).

It tracks 235 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Medicaid enrolled women who had live births during th e past year to determine the percentage of recommended prenatal visits they had. Complications can aris e at any time during pregnancy. For that reason, continued monitoring thr oughout pregnancy is necessary. Frequency and adequacy of ongoing prenatal visits are importa nt factors in minimizing pregnancy problems. The American College of Obstetricians and Gyneco logists recommends that prenatal care begin as early as possible in the first trimester of pregnancy. Visits s hould follow a schedule. Every 4 weeks for the first 28 weeks of pregnancy Every 2 to 3 weeks for the next 7 weeks Weekly thereafter until delivery IT8.2 Percentage of low birt h weight (CHIPRA/NQF#1382) a. Numerator: The number of babies born weighing <2,500 grams at birth) b. Denominator: All births c. Data Source: EMR, Claims d. Rationale/Evidence: Wo men who receive prenatal care are mo re likely to have 1) access to screening and diagnostic tests th at can help identify problems early; 2) services to manage developing and existing problems; and 3) education, counseling, a nd referrals to reduce risky behaviors like substance use and poor nutrition (Healthy People , 2020, March of Dimes, 2010). National studies demonstrate that a lmost 1 out of 4 women still do not receive the full benefits of prenatal care (PNC). For example, betw een 1980 and 2001, the proportion of women who received PNC in the first trimester increased only moderately from 76% to 83% while a more recent investigation found that in 2003 and 2004 the percentage of women who reported receiving PNC (84% ) remain unchanged (Martin et al., 2002). Studies also demonstrate an association between late entry into PNC a nd impact on birth outco mes including low birth weight, preterm birth and infant mortality. In 20 06, as in previous years, non-Hispanic black and Hispanic women were more than twice as likely as non- Hispanic white women to receive care late (beginning in the 3rd trimester) or to receive no care at all (March of Dimes, 2010).

Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: 92414401.1.1 Expand training of the primary care workforce Training future providers in prim ary care will assist with filling the need to create more access for patients and having newly trained providers to staff additional clinical sites Plan for Learning Collaborative: This project lends itself to part icipation in a learning collaborativ e as other Performing Providers in RHP6 seek to develop primary care services in other parts of the region for similar patient populations. Processes and techniqu es developed and implemented during this project will be documented by the project team. Successes as we ll as lessons learned will be shared with regional collaborators who are also work ing to improve primary care access. Project Valuation: The project achieves the waiver goal and meets community needs by expanding primary care in a predominantly Hispanic, underserved area of Bexar County. This program strengthens healthcare linkages with local comm unity partners and enhances acce ss to health care services to a target population who struggle with poverty, re ceive acute or emergency healthcare services only, and do not have usual providers. Review of maternal indicators by funding type for 2010 shows Medicaid births have multiple risk factors associated with pr eterm or low birth wei ght deliveries. Total births in 2010 were 25,680 for Bexar County; 48% were Medicaid births , 34% Private insurance, and 18% self pay. Medicaid births had the highest proportion of single mothers (70 %), Hispanic mothers (77%) and teen mothers (<18years) 8%, as well as low bi rth weight babies (<2500 g) (10%), premature babies (13%), and no prenatal care during the first trimester 31%. All these factors are significantly associated w ith higher risk births. In addition, many in the target population have chronic disease; with no primary care access these condition will become far more complicated and costly to treat. Access to a primary care medical home been has shown to improve health, improve health care, and lower care costs. 237 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital 136141205.1.1 PASS 1 1.1.1 N/A 1.1.1 Establish more primary care clinics: University Hospital University Hospital TPI - 136141205 3.IT-8.2 Timeliness of Frequency of ongoing prenatal care Percentage of low-bi rth weight births Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 P.1 Establish additional primary care clinics Metric 1 [P:1.1]: Number of additional clinics Baseline: 0 primary care clinics in collaboration with local FQHC Goal: to have 1 clinical site Data Source: Provider schedule IDX at new location Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $4,479,877 Milestone 2 I:12 Increase primary care clinic/women's health services volume of visits and evidence of improved access for patients seeking services Metric 1: [I:12.1]: Baseline: 0 primary care encounters September 2012 baseline year.

It serves as the primary teaching hospital for the University of Texas Health Science Ce nter San Antonio, and the lead Level I Trauma Center and safety net provider for the estimat ed 2 million residents of Bexar County and South Texas. Over the past two decades University Health System has expanded access, through Community Medicine Associates (CMA) to pr imary, specialty the preventive health care services, and currently operat es 19 health centers and c linics throughout Bexar County. Intervention(s) : The Health System will increase access to primary care for residents of Bexar County, Texas by enlarging primary care clinic sp ace, expanding hours of operations at primary care clinic sites and adding more clinical staff. Need for the project : The demand for primary care visits in the Health System's service area has been growing at a rapid rate. The majority of low-income, under and uninsured residents are concentrated in sectors where access to primary care and social services are limited. The rate of uninsured in Bexar County is 23% highli ghting the need for increased access. Target population : Medicaid-funded (19%) and uninsured (43%) individuals represent 62% of the patient population serv ed by the Health System. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The Health System will improve access for primary care services by demonstrating an increase in volume of services provided in DY2 through DY5. For the baseline year beginning October 1st, 2011 and ending September 30th, 2012, there were 244,382CMA adult primary care encounters. Th e secondary goals are to enhance care coordination and reduce emergency room visits, hospital admissions and hospital re-admissions. DY2 - Increase CMA primary care encounter s by 2% over baseline; 249,270 expected adult primary care encounters. DY3 - Increase CMA primary care encounter s by 4% over baseline; 254,157 expected adult primary care encounters. DY4 - Increase CMA primary care encounter s by 6% over baseline; 259,045 expected adult primary care encounters. DY5 - Increase CMA primary care encounter s by 8% over baseline; 263,933 expected adult primary care encounters. Category 3 outcomes: IT-9.2 - The goal is to reduce emergency center visits.

Project Description: Our goal is to increase access to quality pr imary care in Bexar County. We will accomplish by expanding existing primary care clinic space, expanding hours of operations at primary care clinic sites and expanding the primary care clinic staffing. In Bexar County, as elsewhere, low income, uninsured, and minority populations have multiple chronic conditions. Without regular primary care, chronic conditions ar e likely to become acute episodes, putting patients at risk for disability and premature death. Extended dela ys in appointment scheduling and long waiting times have a significant negative im pact on patient and provider sa tisfaction and quality of care, and discourage people from using health care pro actively. Recruitment of providers to serve a medically compromised populati on will also be difficult. The Health System will monitor, evaluate, and adjust the project based on quality improvement activities throughout th e development and implementation phase s, offering \"lessons learned\" to our partners in RHP6 through the appropriate Learning Collaborative to be established. Relationship to Regional Goals This project will further achievement of th e regional goals of the Triple Aim; improved health care infrastructure to better serve Medicaid and currently uninsured residents in RHP 6; reduce health disparities; further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system; and improve outcomes while containing cost growth. 5 Year Expected Outcome for Provider and Patients: University Hospital expects to see improvements in clinical outcomes and in reduced utilization of the ER for patients served in this model. The anticipated 5 years goal is to increase primary care access and enhance coordi nation of care to reduce emer gency room visits, hospital admissions and hospital re-admissions. Starting Point/Baseline: As of baseline year end September 30th, 2012, CMA provided 244,382 adult primary care encounters. Primary care encounters include: CMA primary car e network (Main clini cal home, PHC, all locations that provide prim ary and preventive services) Rationale: The demand for primary care visits in Universi ty Hospital's primary service area has been growing at a rapid rate. Primary care capacit y, resources, infrastructu re, and technology are severely limited. Our goal is to increase primary care encounters throughout University Hospital/Community Medicine Associates (CMA ) primary care network. In order to provide more preventive, primary, and chronic care in th e primary care setting, it is critical to expand primary care capacity. According to the 2010 H ealthcare Collaborativ e reports, the current population of Bexar County increased by 15% between 2000 and 2008 (1.59 million). Racial/ethnic diversity varies greatly within sectors of Bexa r County. In 2000, over 80% of the population in South and West Bexar County were Hispanic, while fewer than 30% of North Central and Northeast Bexar County were Hispanic . The proportion of African Americans varies 241 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital from under 1% in South Bexar to over 15% in S outheast Bexar. Educational attainment is not distributed equally across Bexar County sub-sector s. Nearly one-third to a half of the population in the South (45.5%), West (42.2%), and Southe ast (35.7%) do not have a high school diploma, compared to 6.9% of the population in North Central. This project addresses CN.3 - Lack of access to medical and dental care due to lack of insurance and provider shortages. Currently, the demand for primary care services within University Health System exceeds the supply. New initiatives for providing primary car e access to the underserve d of Bexar county is critical. Our new initiatives will seek to renovate specific clinic locations to provide additional capacity, extend hours of operations to include nights and weekends a nd hire additional providers to expand patient panel sizes. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): IT9.2 ED appropriate utilization (Standalone measure) Reduce all ED visits (including ACSC) Reduce pediatric Emergency Department visits (CHIPRA Core Measure) Reduce Emergency Department vi sits for target conditions: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Behavioral Health Diabetes Asthma Reason/rationale for selec ting the outcome measure: High emergency room (ER) utilization is a considerable concern for the increasing cost of health care. Frequent and inappropriate use of hospita l ERs is extremely costly and care could be provided in a less expensive sett ing. Patients, when possible, s hould be treated by their primary care provider for non-emergency conditions in or der to promote consistent, quality care. The targeted population will be the CareLink members a ssigned to University Health System patient centered medical homes. CareLink is a financial assistance program for uni nsured residents of Bexar County. The program was created in 1997 to help address the needs of Bexar County residents without health care cove rage who were not eligible fo r Medicaid or other public or private funding. While CareLink is not an in surance product per se, it has many similar advantages in terms of promoting access to preven tive health services, en couraging a long lasting relationship with a primar y care provider, and instilling a sens e of shared responsibility between member and staff for the member's health . As of December 31, 2011, there were 54,256 members enrolled in CareLink.

Project Valuation: The project achieves the waiver goal and meets community needs by expanding primary care in a predominantly Hispanic, underserved area of Bexar County. The demand for primary care has been growing at a rapid rate in Bexar County, and necessitates expanding resources to meet the needs of the population. By expanding clinic sp ace, increasing the number of primary care providers, and expanding clinic hours, this progr am strengthens healthca re linkages with local community partners and enhances access to hea lth care services to a target population. This population struggles with poverty, utilize acute or emergency healthcare services, and do not have usual providers. In addition, many in the ta rget population have chronic diseases; with no primary care access these condition will become far mo re complicated and costly to treat.

It serves as the primary teaching hospital for the University of Texas Health Science Ce nter San Antonio, and the lead Level I Trauma Center and safety net provider for the estimat ed 2 million residents of Bexar County and South Texas. Over the past two decades University Health System has expanded access to primary, specialty the preventive health care services, and currently operates 19 health centers and clinics throughout Bexar County. Intervention(s): This project will improve patient care quality by developing and utilizing a master chronic disease manageme nt registry that will allow providers to more efficiently monitor a patient's disease status, adherence to treatment plans, medication management as well as tailor delivery of appropriate cl inical/care coordination interventions. Need for the project: The design and utilization of chronic disease registries are considered the first step in providing a population- based approach to fully evaluate quality of care delivered, coverage of clinical preventive services and their impact on condition-specific outcomes for patients with chronic health conditions. Target population: The target population will include all patients with ch ronic conditions with a specific focus on adults and children with asth ma and COPD. These individuals cost the system about $20 million/year in EC and inpatient visit cost. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits: The project seeks to enroll patients from the largest pediatric sites and pulmonologist/all ergy specialist sites into the re gistry. Registry functionality will be available to the three designated specialt ies by the end of DY3. Patients will be enrolled during DY4, with a goal of approxi mately 70% of patients with a diagnosis of asthma in the three target clinic sites enrolled by the end of DY5. Category 3 outcomes: 136141205.3.5 3.IT-9.2: ED appropriate utilization DY4 - Reduce Emergency Department visits by 5% (300 visits/yr) for adult and pediatric asthma/COPD registry patients assigned to three target specialties. DY5 - Reduce Emergency Department visits by 15% (1500 visits/yr) for adult and pediatric asthma/COPD registry patients assigned to three target clinics. Project Description: This project proposes to develop and use a chro nic disease management registry specifically targeting University Hospital' s Medicaid and uninsured pati ent population diagnosed with asthma/COPD. Providing excellent care to th e residents of Bexar County requires reliable, transparent, time-sensitive data. The goal of University Hospital' s Population Health 247 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Infrastructure Initiative (PHII) is to establish a meaningful plat form for medical providers to review clinical information with their medical teams and produce bett er patient outcomes in both inpatient and outpatient settings. According to the Bexar County Health Colla borative 2010 Health Asse ssment, prevalence data for asthma in Bexar County reveal an average ( 13%) comparable to th e state's (12%) and the nation's (14%). Disparities, however, are found by gender, ethnicity, and locale: Females, African-Americans, and residents of the west an d northeast parts of the county are more likely to have asthma. The highest prevalence (16%) am ong the variables studied is found in residents of the Westside. Implementation and enhanced utilization of Health Information Exchange (HIE) and the Health System's data warehouse will provide opportunity for accurate, secure patient health care information to be readily ac cessible to the appropria te providers with the ability of reports being gene rated for like populati on through analytic software, enhancing information for clinician decision with respect to patient care. The Texas Health and Human Services Co mmission (HHSC) published various reports related to potentially prev entable hospitalizations and readmissions. Between 2005 and 2010, HHSC that RHP 6 had 125,090 potentially preventable hospi talizations, about 8.5% of the entire state. The nine conditions studied included asthma. The hospitalizations are considered \"potentially preventable\" because \"if the individual had access to and cooperated with appropriate outpatient hea lth care, the hospitalization w ould likely not have occurred.\" These hospitalizations amounted to $2.9 billion in hospital charges, roughly $1,700 per adult living in the region's 20 counties. Specifically, at UHS, when a pplying national benchmarks to cost, patients with asthma or COPD who were ad mitted to EC or Inpatient Unit cost the system $19,810,000 last year alone. By tracking key patient information, a disease registry for asthma can help physicians and other members of a patient 's health care team to identify and reach out to patients who may have gaps in their care to prevent complications, which often lead to more costly interventions. Implementation of th e registry could save 30% -50%/year of EC/Observation and Inpatient co st of compliant patients. Goals and Relationship to Regional Goals This project specifically addre sses the regional waiv er goals of improving the health care infrastructure to better serve Medicaid and currently uninsured residents in RHP 6, reduce health disparities, and further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system. Project Goals: Develop a plan to implement/complete the regist ry to track and assist adult and pediatric patients with asthma/COPD to reduce ED visits. Develop and implement a cross-functional team to evaluate registry program. Demonstrate registry automated reporti ng ability to track and report on patient demographics, diagnoses, patients in need of services or not a goal, and preventive care status. Implement/ expand a functional disease management registry. Increase the percentage of patie nts enrolled in the registry Train provider and provider staff to unde rstand and utilize inte ractive Registries Challenges: Challenges to developing a chronic disease ma nagement registry for asthma during this wider process include locating appropriately trained and expe rienced personnel, implementing 248 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital new applications, training current staff a nd executing change management for multiple applications being inserted into the current environment. The end result of the PHII's asthma/COPD registry project will be a central ized system for data validation, reporting, and analysis. The PHII will require considerable resources for analysis, design, and implementation into Health System facilities. Th e Health System will undergo application infrastructure development to efficiently align current applications with new re sources to validate synergy of all applications. After development, implementati on will ensue at all University Health System sites including the ambulatory network. Traini ng will proceed during and post implementation of applications. Testing applications will fo llow implementation and precede pilot and go-live stages. The program will establish a platform for providers, medical staff, administrative executives, service-line personnel to view th e same accurate information synthesized through various standardized reports to improve deci sion-making. The Health System will monitor, evaluate, and adjust the pr oject based on quality improve ment activities throughout the development and implementation phases, offering \"l essons learned\" to ou r partners in RHP6 through the appropriate Learning Colla boratives to be established. 5-Year Expected Outcome for Provider and Patients: University Hospital expects to have a fully f unctional disease-specific registry tailored to meeting the health services needs of its economically underserved population. Further, the registry will assist the health care team in managing patients with asthma/COPD by a) prompting physicians and their teams to conduct appropriate assessments and deliver condition- specific care; b) identifying patie nts who have missed appointmen ts, are overdue for care, or are not meeting care management goals; c) prov iding reports about how well individual care teams and the health System are doing in deli vering recommended care to their asthma/COPD patients; and d) stratify ing patients into risk categories to target interventions toward patients with the highest needs. Ultimately, by the end of DY5, data on emergency department use by adult and pediatric asthma/COPD patients will be reduced, reflecting th e contributions of the registry to the overall outcome goal, Right Care, Right Setting (OD-9). We anticipat e a 30% reduction in EC and inpatient visits. In addition, fo r health care executives in operati ons and finance, this initiative will provide transparency of information fo r enhanced decision-making at executive and service-line levels, which will lead directly to cost-saving opportunities and more efficient processes. Rationale: Timely, accurate information is critical to improving health care outcomes. The Population Health Infrastructure Initiative not only esta blishes the functionalitie s of a chronic disease management registry, it enhances the data processes relative to a registry, making it a central hub of accurate health system data and information. Project Components: For the medical care teams on this pr oject, the registry's asthma/COPD module will enable them to a) enter patient data into a uni que chronic disease registry; b) actively manage patients using registry data to proactively contac t, educate, and track patients by disease status, risk status, self-management stat us, and community and family 249 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital need; c) use registry reports to develop and impl ement a QI plan targeted to asthma/COPD management; and d) conduct quality improvement activities such as rapid cycle improvement, among others. Milestones and metrics as presented in the followi ng table take the creation of the registry from developing the cross-functional team to evaluate and document the registry's capability to address the Medicaid and currently uninsure d adult and pediatric asthma/COPD patient population, as well as future community needs, through establishing the data elements required for the registry, to implementing the reporting an d notification functions necessary to manage individual patients' care. This project uniquely targets CN.2 - Address the high prevalence of chronic disease and related health disparities in the community through grea ter prevention efforts that focus on addressing chronic disease. Historically, data warehouses have been ex tremely inflexible and difficult to manage, particularly with regard to sharing data among providers or tracking individual patients. University Hospital's implementation of its El ectronic Medical Record (EMR), with funding assistance from HITECH, positions the organization to enhan ce and expand the Population Health Infrastructure Initiative (PHII) to establish a meaningful platform for medical providers to review clinical information with their medi cal teams and produce bett er patient outcomes in both inpatient and outpatient setti ngs. This platform also provides business intelligence tools to identify opportunities for cost savings and redu ce waste. Given the health care disparities among and within the RHP 6 counties, including the prevalence of asthma due to poverty and environmental conditions, the opportunity to gath er and share data acro ss performing providers in the region will advance access, reduce dispar ities, and enhance management of chronic conditions. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-9 - Right Care, Right Setting: IT-9.2 ED Appropriate Utili zation (Stand Alone Measure) Reduce Emergency Department visits for target conditions o Congestive Heart Failure o Diabetes o End Stage Renal Disease o Cardiovascular Disease /Hypertension o Behavioral Hea lth/Substance Abuse o Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease o Asthma Reasons/Rationale for select ing the outcome measures: Local, state, and national data for Medicaid re cipients and the uninsured are unequivocal in showing the lack access to care and subsequent coordination of care for these populations. RHP 6 presents a challenge in this regard as funding sources for pe rforming providers is uneven at best and the disparities in res ources are very apparent to pa tients and provider, alike. The asthma/COPD registry project proposed here will be a powerful tool in the hands of physicians and their health care teams to let them see a tr uer picture of a patient' s status in terms of medication compliance, appointments kept, latest lab values, among other variables. Studies 250 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital into ED use almost always contain a heavy beha vioral component, and broad efforts to educate patient populations and to steer them away fr om EDs have had no effect. An asthma/COPD registry will prompt the provider to engage in face-to-face education and inquiry into an individual's ED utilization behavi or to manage his/her chronic c ondition. Given the health care disparities among and within the RHP 6 counties, including the prevalence of asthma due to poverty and environmental conditions, the opport unity to gather and share data across performing providers in the region will advance access, enhance management of the chronic condition, and contribute to a reduction in ED utilization. Relationship to other Projects: The overall Population Health In frastructure Initiative suppor ts all Health System DSRIP projects through enhanced data collection, centralized reporting, and produc tion of data into accurate information for health care professiona ls to employ in the areas of telemedicine /telehealth and chronic di sease care management.

We will collaborate on their project to the extent our two overlap, share lessons learned and best practices about registries in general, and support a learni ng collaborative should one be formed on this topic. 92414401.1.1 - Expand training of primary workforce. All new primary care providers and care manager staff will be trained on the use of the ch ronic disease registry, and establish a platform for new providers to view the same accurate information synthesized through various standardized reports to improve decision-making, and patient care. Plan for Learning Collaborative: This project naturally lends itself to participa tion in learning collaborati ves as other Performing Providers seek to establish their own registries or seek to reduce ED utiliz ation in other parts of the region. Project Valuation: 1. This project achieves the Waiver goals by a) improving the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured resident s of the county; b) further developing and maintaining a coordinated care delivery system; c) contributing to patients' receiving high- quality, patient-centered care in the most cost-effective way; and serving as a powerful tool to help providers improve outcomes and redu ce ED utilization (containing cost growth). 2. This project addresses community needs by im proving access to care fo r populations with a high prevalence of chronic conditions and re ducing disparities in care by providing the 251 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital business intelligence tools to improve progr ammatic decision-making by locale, ethnicity, gender, or other variables. A significant impact on utilization costs sta nds to be gained. As noted earlier, asthma was identified by the Texas HHSC as a condition for which potentially preventable hospitalizations and readmissions were observed. 3. When fully implemented - beyond DY5 - which includes developing registries for other highly prevalent chronic conditions , such as diabetes and CHF, as well as eventually sharing the technology among the region's Performing Pr oviders, the large scope of the project will impact outreach efforts to both physicians and their Medicaid and uni nsured patients; will improve proper utilization in the form of increased routine a nd follow-up patient visits and encounters; will attract and retain physicians in the Health System through; and will promote savings through appropriate ED utilization. 4. This project requires a very la rge investment as it fits w ith and enhances federal HIE activities already under way. The hardware, so ftware applications, human resources and time to implement are of the highest organizatio nal priority for the Health System. This particular project targets asthma/COPD, but the scope of utilization for other chronic diseases and in other health ca re settings is potentially huge. 5. Providers will work with regist ries to make system of care more efficient and provider time more effective 6. Registry can dramatically improve emerge ncy department providers and primary care provider communication.

It serves as the primary teaching hospital for the University of Texas H ealth Science Center San Antonio, and the lead Level I Trauma Center and safety net provider for the estimated 2 million residents of Bexar County and South Texas. Over the past two de cades University Health System has expanded access to primary, specialty the preventive health care services, and currently operates 19 health centers and clinics th roughout Bexar County. Intervention(s ): This project will employ telemedicine services to improve access to specialty care for patients experiencing barriers to such care. With enhanced access and improved care coordination, the telemedicine visits will allow specialists and other members of the health care team to more efficiently monitor a patient's di sease status, adherence to treatment plans, and medication management. Need for the project : Telemedicine technology has become in creasingly availa ble to clinical practitioners and holds the promise of providing electronic health care services to increase patient access to care. Vulnerab le populations that include ec onomically underserved, minority, and uninsured individuals are less likely to e ither seek or have access to timely clinical interventions and treatment, resulting in emer gency room visits and hospital admissions. In Bexar County, as elsewhere in RHP 6, there is a disproportionate popul ation of low-income, uninsured, and minority indivi duals, who experience chroni c conditions. Without regular primary care and timely access to specialists, these chronic conditions are likely to become acute episodes, resulting in prev entable hospital admissions. Target population : The target population will include all patients with chronic conditions with a specific focus on adults with diabetes. Medi caid-funded (19%) and uninsured (43%) persons represent 62% of the patient population served by the Health System. According to data provided by the Texas Department of State Health Services, there were 8,863 adult hospitalizations for diabetes long-term complications in Bexar county from 2006 - 2010. University Hospital ranked s econd in number of admissions. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : In DY4, 10% of adult patient s with diabetes referred to specialists from three designated clinics will have received telemedicine visits. By the end of DY5, adult patients with diabetes will be receiving specialty telemedicine visits from five designated clinics and clinics wi ll be performing at least 10 te lemedicine visits per month.

DY5 - Reduce Diabetes Long-term Complica tions Admission Rate by TBD% for adult diabetes patients. Project Description: University Hospital proposes to employ telemedi cine services to the Medicaid and uninsured adult diabetic patient populati ons in the ambulatory setting. The Health System's goal is to increase our ab ility to provide both primary care and specialty care services to communities currently underserve d, with a focus on providing appropriate care, at the right time, in convenient locations. The five-year target goa l is to substantially improve primary medical care capacity for Be xar County and the region by employing telemedicine/telehealth technology. This project proposes to employ telemedicine in service to the Health System's adult diabetic patient popul ation. We want to incr ease the overall use of telemedicine for consults for specialty areas in the Health System's Medicaid and uninsured patient populations, such as endocrinology, cardiol ogy, stroke care, and em ergency medicine. In Bexar County as elsewhere, there is a dispr oportionate population of low-income, uninsured, and minority individuals, who often have chro nic conditions. Without regular primary care, these chronic conditions are likely to become acute episodes, putting patients at risk for disability and premature death. Extended delays in appointment schedu ling and long wait times have a negative impact on patient satisfaction a nd quality of care, which ultimately discourages this population from using health care proactiv ely. The Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) has publishe d various reports related to potentially preventable hospitalizations and readmissions. Betw een 2005 and 2010, HHSC that had 125,090 potentially preventable hosp italizations, about 8.5% of th e entire state. The nine conditions studied included diabetes. The hos pitalizations are cons idered \"potentially preventable\" because \"if the individual had acces s to and cooperated with appropriate outpatient health care, the hospitalization would likely not have occurred.\" These hospitalizations amounted to $2.9 billion in hospital charges, r oughly $1,700 per adult living in the region's 20 counties. With expanded capacity to provide care through telemedicine, mo re patients will have access to care, particularly speci alty care, which will increase opportunities to prevent disease and avoid hospitalizations, emergency room visits , and re-admissions. In the course of five years, we anticipate a ripple effect of quality of care for the patient and providers, as well as cost savings throughout our health system. Project Goal The first year's goal is the acquisition, development, and evaluation of telemodalities, to include robots, teleconferencing software, and telepresence hardware. Multiple pilots in varied settings will allow us to evaluate these technologies. Th e pilot facilities will em ploy this equipment to care for the underserved populati on by providing patients the ab ility to conference with a provider at a remote, central location. This w ill enable one provider to service several low- volume clinics in locations throughout Bexar County. An infrastructure environment will be established to support the telemodalities. Nurse a nd Physician Champions will be established to identify the best candidates for these pilot projec ts. Maintaining convenient, local, virtual clinics will allow us to extend our reach and provide care to members of the community that might 258 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital otherwise not be served, or served at a much hi gher cost and acuity of care. Expansion of this project to all the Health System's \"hub\" clin ics, specialty clinics, and eventually, the surrounding counties in partnership with rural hospitals, is the long-term goal for this project beyond the five year plan. Relationship to Regional Goals This project will further achievement of the regi onal goals of the Triple Aim; improved health care infrastructure to better serve Medicaid and currently uninsured residents in RHP 6; reduce health disparities; further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system; and improve outcomes while containing cost growth. Specificall y, this project will implement a telemedicine program to provide or expand primary care and speci alist referral services initially to the health system's Medicaid and uninsured patients and even tually, to areas identified as needed to the region. The Health System will monitor, evalua te, and adjust the project based on quality improvement activities throughout the develo pment and implementation phases, offering \"lessons learned\" to our partne rs in RHP6 through the appropriat e Learning Collaboratives to be established. Starting Point/Baseline: Currently, a telemedicine program does not exist at the Health System's primary care locations. Therefore, the baseline for the number of partic ipants, as well as number of consults achieved through telemedicine, begins at 0 for DY2. Rationale: One of the greatest challenges facing the U.S. health care system is to provide quality care to the large segment of the population, which does not have access to specialty physicians because of factors such as geographic limitations or soci oeconomic conditions. The use of technology to deliver health care from a distance, or telemedici ne, has been demonstrated as an effective way of overcoming certain barriers to care, particularly for communities located in rural and remote areas. In addition, telemedicine can ease the gaps in providing crucial care for those who are underserved, principally becau se of a shortage of sub specialty providers. The use of telecommunications technologies an d connectivity has impacted real world patients, particularly for those in remote communities. This work ha s translated into observable outcomes such as improved access to specialists; increased patien t satisfaction with care; improved clinical outcomes; reduction in emergency room utiliza tion; and cost savings. Nowhere are these benefits more evident than in Texas. Moreover, public and private funding to subsidize care in the state remains inadequate, despite growing comm unity needs associated with increases in the uninsured and aging populations. Consequently, many people are left to seek care in emergency rooms, often as a last resort, in an unmanage d and episodic manner. The costs of such care are borne by care giving institutions, local governments, a nd, ultimately, taxpayers, many of whom are already burdened with th e costs of meeting health related costs of their own. This project will address the core components of 1.7.1 by empl oying telemedicine technology in three of the Health System's clinics to a) provide patient cons ultations by medical and surgical specialists, as well as other types of health professional using telecommunications and b) conduct quality improvement for the project using methods such as rapid cycle improvement. Activities may include, but are not limited to, identifying proj ect impacts, identifying \"lessons learned,\" 259 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital opportunities to scale all or part of the projec t to a broader patient population, and identifying key challenges associated with expansion of th e project, including spec ial considerations for safetynet populations. Implementing and expanding telemedicine/telehea lth capabilities will allow providers, both in primary care and specialty care, to deliver excellent medical care to our target patient populations throughout RHP 6. Teleme dicine/telehealth allows providers to reach into rural areas to provide virtual face-to-face care, while reducing costs and improving patient satisfaction. Milestones and metrics as presente d in the following table begin with a needs assessment and identification of specialties to be provided within the project based on regional and community need, while evaluating the tech nology for upgrades and improvements, followed by implementation in three Health System clin ics to address the Medicaid and currently uninsured adult diabetic patie nt population. Ultimately, by the end of DY5, data on admission rates will show reduced u tilization, reflecting the contributions of telemedicine to the overall outcome goal, Potentially Preventable Admissi ons (OD-2). The RHP Planning Protocol very specifically states HHSC's goals for employing te lemedicine/telehealth: \"Specifically, we hope to achieve the following goals for the state's Medicaid population: incr ease patients' timely access to specialty care and re duce geographic barriers; improve efficiency in the referral process by letting specialists dive rt unnecessary referrals and decr easing the wait time for urgent referrals.\" This project is intended to assist the state in these goals. This project addresses CN.2 - Address the high prevalen ce of chronic disease and rela ted health disparities in the community through greater prevention efforts that focus on addressing chronic disease and CN.3 - Address the lack of medical and dental health services in the community due high rates of uninsurance and provider shortages As noted above, diabetes was identified by the Texas HHSC as a condition for which potentially preventable hospitalizations and readmissions were observed. University Hospital is already a partner in em ploying telemedicine in the Bexar County Adult Detention Center, reaching a population that is both literally and figurativ ely difficult to reach. The experience gives us confidence that expanding this capability to our current clinic patient population and in partnership with the other perf orming providers in RHP6 will vastly improve management of diabetes and eventually, other chronic conditions, such as CHF, as well as expand access to primary and preventive care. No other sources of federal funding are used for this project. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-2 - Potentially Preventable Admissions IT-2.8 - Diabetes Long Term complications Admission Rate-PQI3 (Standalone measure) Reasons/rationale for select ing the outcome measure: Local, state, and national data for Medicaid re cipients and the uninsured are unequivocal in showing the lack of access to care and subseque nt coordination of care for these populations. RHP 6 presents a challenge in this regard as funding sources for performing providers is uneven at best and the disparities in primary care a nd specialty resources are very apparent. The telemedicine project proposed here will help address these i ssues by providing quality health 260 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital care in a cost-effective manner. Engaging a pa tient face-to-face through technology offers the opportunity for education and inquiry into an in dividual's management of his/her diabetes. Given the health care disparities among and w ithin the RHP 6 counties, including the prevalence of diabetes, the opportunity to in teract with hard-to-reach patient s will advance access, enhance management of the chronic condition, and cont ribute to a reduction in hospital admissions. Relationship to other Projects: This project supports multiple projects and in terventions of the Health System's DSRIP program. Establishing a presence in telemedi cine throughout the regi on will assist in the expansion of access to primary and specialty care. In addition to that, this project will provide a significant resource to managing our populations by linking this re source with care coordination and other service lines that can contribute to improved outcomes. Related projects: 92414401.2.2 - Enhance/expand the medical homes Telehealth will expand the medical home concept by offering services that would otherwise be unavailable. These services in clude, but are not limited to, tele medicine, tele-case management, and tele-patient education. 136141205.2.7 - Implement evidence-based disease prevention programs Education offered individually or in group visits will be evidence-based. 136141205.2.2 - Redesign to improve patient experience Research has proven that patient satisfaction will in crease as a result of the implementation of a Care Management Model which is enhanced by te lemedicine and telehealth. The expectation will also be improved provider satisfaction wi thin our ambulatory clinics. A recent study completed with the Affinity Health System show ed an increase in provider satisfaction and patient compliance. 136141205.2.4 - Establish/expand a patient care navigation program Telemedicine/Telehealth can support care ma nagement model through patient access to navigation. This allows patient access thr oughout the health ca re continuum while simultaneously addressing chronic conditions identified by the pa tient's provider. Category 4 measures include potentially preven table admissions in RD-1 and patient-centered health care, including patient satisfac tion and medication management in RD-4. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: 1.7.1: Introduce, Expand, or E nhance Telemedicine/Telehealth 094154402.1.1 - Hospital (Pass 1) 085144601.1.15 - UTHSCSA (Pass 2): UTHSCSA is the Health System's partner in delivering care to th e county's Medicaid and currently uninsured populations. We will attemp t to collaborate with the medical school and Methodist Hospital on their projects, share lessons learned and best practi ces about telemedicine, and support a learning collaborative shoul d one be formed on this topic. 261 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Plan for Learning Collaborative: This project naturally lends itself to participa tion in learning collaborati ves as other Performing Providers seek to employ telemedicine/telehea lth to increase access to primary and specialty care, erase disparities in care, and reduce ED utilization in ot her parts of the region. We will attend meetings and share data related to the efficacy of this project. Project Valuation: 1. This project achieves the Waiver goals by a) improving the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured resident s of the county; b) further developing and maintaining a coordinated care delivery system; c) contributing to patients' receiving high- quality, patient-centered care in the most cost-effective way; and serving as a powerful tool to help providers improve outcomes and reduce hospital admissions (containing cost growth). 2. This project addresses community needs by im proving access to care fo r populations with a high prevalence of chronic conditions and reduci ng disparities in care by allowing access to primary, and particularly specialty, care pr oviders which may be in short supply. A significant impact on health outc omes and utilization costs stands to be gained. As noted earlier, diabetes was identified by the Texa s HHSC as a condition for which potentially preventable hospitalizations and readmissions were observed. 3. When fully implemented - beyond DY5 - which in cludes telemedicine in itiatives for other highly prevalent chronic conditions, such as CHF, as well as eventually sharing the technology among the region's Performing Provider s, the larger scope of the project will impact outreach efforts to both physicians and their Medicaid and uni nsured patients; will improve proper utilization in the form of increased routine a nd follow-up patient visits and encounters; will attract and retain physicians in the Hea lth System; and will promote savings through appropriate ED utilization. 4. This project requires a very large investment as it fits with HITECH funding goals. The hardware, software applications, human resour ces, and time to implement are of the highest organizational priority for the Health System. This particular projec t targets diabetes, but the scope of utilization for ot her chronic diseases and in ot her health care settings is potentially huge. 262 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital 136141205.1.4 PASS 1 1.7.1 1.7.1 (A-B) 1.7.1 IMPLEMENT TELEMEDICINE PROGRAM TO PROVIDE OR EXPAND SPECIALIST REFERRAL SERVICES IN AN AREA IDENTIFIED AS NEEDED TO THE REGION : UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL TELEMEDICINE PROGRAM University Hospital TPI - 136141205 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 136141205.3.6 3.IT-2.8 Diabetes Long Term Complicat ions Admission Rate - PQI3 (Standalone measure) Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P-1]: Conduct needs assessment to identify needed specialties that can be provided via telemedicine as related to Diabetes Metric 1 [P-1.1]: Needs assessment to identify types of personnel needed to implement the program and hiring of the respective personnel.

It serves as the primary teaching hospital for the University of Texas Health Science Ce nter San Antonio, and the lead Level I Trauma Center and safety net provider for the estimat ed 2 million residents of Bexar County and South Texas. Over the past two decades University Health System has expanded access to primary, specialty and preventive health care services, and currently operates 19 health centers and clinics throughout Bexar County. Intervention(s) : This project will increase access to behavioral health specialty care by adding/increasing behavioral health providers at primary care clin ics and having patients receive behavioral health services through integrated patient-c entered medical home/neighborhood clinics (PCMH). The PCMH is an innovative, evid ence-based program to improve primary care. Adding behavioral health capacity in this in frastructure will provide seamless referrals and increase access to specialty care. Need for the project : According to the Bexar County Health Status Report Ba sed on Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance (BRFSS) Data Collect ed in 2008, 33% of survey respondents said their mental health was not good for one or more days over the past month and 18% reported five or more days of poor mental healt h. Depression, drug and alcohol use, and lack of access to mental health services were c ited as the most frequent mental h ealth issues. Some respondents shared that mental health care is difficult to acqui re due to a lack of insurance coverage. Respondents also mentioned that many Bexar residents do not access care at all because they do not know what mental health serv ices are available. Lack of awareness of services and social stigma around mental health disorders were tw o major challenges in this area. Education campaigns were suggested as a way to inform Be xar residents about the av ailable mental health services in the community. Target population : The target population will be those w ho receive primary care services within University Health System primary care clinics, and who fall into either Quadrant I or III regarding behavioral health needs. Medica id-funded (19%) and unins patient popu lation served by the Health Sy stem. (Ref. for Quadrant Model: National Council for Community Behavioral Healthcare , 2003). These patients will benefit from increased access to behavioral health services in the primary care setting. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The Health System will improve access for behavioral health services by demonstrati ng an increase in volume of se rvices provided in DY2 through DY5. DY2 - Increase behavioral health pati ent encounters by 2% over baseline; 12,186 expected behavioral health encounters. DY3 - Increase behavioral health patien t encounters by 4% over baseline; 12, 425 266 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital expected behavioral health encounters. DY4 - Increase behavioral health patien t encounters by 6% over baseline; 12, 664 expected behavioral health encounters. DY5 - Increase behavioral health pati ent encounters by 8% over baseline; 12,903 expected behavioral health encounters. Category 3 outcomes: IT-1.18 - The goal is to i ncrease access to follow up appointments post discharge for mental illness. DY4 - Increase by TBD% over baseline the number of patients securing outpatient mental health appointments within 7 da ys and within 30 days post discharge. DY5 - Increase by TBD% over baseline the number of patients securing outpatient mental health appointments within 7 da ys and within 30 days post discharge. Project Description: In the United States, safety-net hospitals remain essential to providing ac cess to health services for over 50 million uninsured Americans as well as other underserved populations. The passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 marked an important legislative commitment to addressing rising health care costs and improved access to qualit y healthcare for all Americans. In the era of healthcare reform, safety-net hospitals will theref ore remain critical to responding to the mandate of providing primary and specialty medical car e that is accessible, integrated, and patient- centered. University Hospital proposes to increase access to specialty care by expanding its provider base and having patients receive behavior al health services through its integrated patient-centered medical home (PCMH). The PCMH is an inno vative, evidence-based program to improve primary care. Adding behavioral health capacity in this infrastructure will provide seamless referrals and increase access to specialty care. This project will increase access to behavioral health within the University Health System medical homes which will be accomplished by adding behavioral health providers (which may include psychiatrists, psychiatri c nurse practitioners, ps ychologists, behavioral therapists, and/or licensed chemical dependency counselors, as de termined by demand) to these settings and thereby leading to increased accessibility. The target population will be those that receive primary care services within University Health System primary care clinics, and who fall into Quadrant I or III regarding behavioral health needs- typically those most likely to be appropriately cared for in primary care settings with co-located behavioral health practitioners. (Ref. for Quadrant Model: National Council for Commun ity Behavioral Healthcare , 2003). Texas currently ranks 50 th in per capita state funding for be havioral health treatment, and persons in RHP 6 experience barriers to accessing behavioral health care. In addition, Bexar County ranks in the top 10 in Texa s in terms of least funded Local Mental Health Authorities. Funding for clinical care is restri cted to certain mental illness diagnoses, leaving a large segment of persons with a mental illness (including thos e most commonly seen in primary care settings) without access to appropriat e care and treatment. Community Medicine Associ ates (the University Health Syst em owned provider group) is the primary care access point for University Health Syst em patients, and there is currently a need for 267 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital behavioral health specialty pr oviders for the population served to enhance the medical home model and expand behavioral heal th care to additional sites. Goals and Relationship to Regional Goals Project goals are to expand access to behavioral healthcare within the primary care setting and thereby address the regional goals of filling gaps in access to behavioral health for economically underserved populations. Project Goals: Increase the number of be havioral health providers. Increase the percentage of patient-centered behavioral health specialty visits Improve accessibility to appointments post-hos pital discharge in target population. Challenges A primary challenge will be recruiting and retain ing psychiatric provider s since Texas currently has a workforce shortage of psychiatrists. For example, based on the national ratio of 13.9 psychiatrists/100,000 population, San Antonio needs an additional 49 psychiatrists to provide care. If based on the University of Te xas Medical Branch recommendations of 25.9 psychiatrists/100,000 population, San Antonio need s an additional 294 psychiatrists. (Ref: Methodist Health Care Ministries Mental Health Services Project , San Antonio, July 2010). Recruiting and retention challenges will be overcom e by designation of Health Provider Shortage Areas (HPSAs) as designated by HRSA of some pr imary care clinic sites as underserved areas as relates to behavioral health care which then allow Medica re designated bonus payments. 5-Year Expected Outcome for Provider and Patient University Health System expects to have improved access to specialty care alongside an expanded provider base and a percenta ge increase in patients receiv ing behavioral health services through its integrated patient-centered medical ho me. The result of these efforts will be both an improvement in follow-up post hospitalizati on for a mental illness diagnosis and reduce emergency room visitation for preventable conditions. Starting Point/Baseline: Currently there is one FTE psychiatrist, one F TE psychiatric nurse practitioner, and five FTE therapists who provide specialty behavioral health services at one clinical location. During the baseline year ending September 30th, 2012 (DY1), the University Health System's owned primary care clinic sites had 11,947 behavi oral health provider encounters. Rationale: Currently, the demand for behavioral health treatment of patients with behavioral health needs primarily in the areas of the ci ty that have been identified as economically underserved.(low behavioral health co-morbid with low to high phy sical health needs) within the community has outstripped available outpatient re sources. For example hospitalizati on data for mental illness is more pronounced in the southern and western sect ors of the County and is considered a direct result of having limited clinical care and treatment resources. 268 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Further, state funding for mental health treatment is restricted to certain mental health diagnoses, thus excluding a large percentage of persons with other mental illnesses, e.g., anxiety disorders, mild to moderate depressive disorders, attent ion-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, bereavement, adjustment reactions, etc. Focusing on Quadrant I and III includes those diagnoses most likely to be encountered in the primary care setting. Population forecasts for the Bexar County primary service area predict an increase by 9% in the demand for behavioral health services by 2019, including the need for pharmacologic management. (Ref: Methodist Health Care Ministries Mental Health Services Project , San Antonio, July 2010). The cost benefit of providing integrated care fo r treating common mental health disorders is similar to the benefit achieved in tr eating other chronic conditions (Ref: Connecting Body and Mind: A Resource Guide to Integrated Health Care in Texas and the United States , Hogg Foundation for Mental Health). Th is project is selected to enha nce integration of behavioral health care for those patients served by University Health System's patient-centered medical home. It addresses the need for specialty behavior al health services for those patients who cannot access services because of diagnosti c restrictions, lack of funding, or lack of access to behavioral health providers accepting Me dicaid and/or Medicare. Patients, particularly those in ethnic minority gr oups, often do not adhere to their primary care provider's referral to specialty mental health care. (Ref: Takeuchi DT & Cheung MK: Coercive and Voluntary Referrals: How Et hnic Minority Adults Get Into Mental Health Treatment. Ethnicity and Health , 3, 149 - 153.) Additionally, in Texas, RHP 6, and San Antonio/Bexar County, primary care providers are often unable to locate mental h ealth providers and/or psychiatri sts to refer patients leading to disparate care and further exacerbating the health inequalities among these vulnerable populations. Screening for mental health diso rders leads to improved patient outcomes only when appropriate care follows detection. (Ref: Connecting Body and Mind: A Resource Guide to Integrated Health Care in Texas and the United States , Hogg Foundation for Mental Health). Patients with mental illness at times require as sessment by a behavioral health provider in order to unburden primary care providers of disease acuity requiring speci alty consultation, to improve the comfort level of primary care providers in managing co-morbid behavi oral health conditions, and to improve the overall quality of life of patients by addressing the patient's needs holistically and in a manner that is coordinated. This project addresses community health need CN.4 - Address the shortage of high quality integrated mental and behavioral he alth services in the community. In terms of system redesign, this project represents an initiative to integr ate behavioral health treatment for patients served by University H ealth System's patient-centered medical home by providing care in the right setti ng and at the right time for patient s who historically have been unable to access outpatient behavi oral health care, by providing ea rlier detection and treatment and potential cost avoidance of unnecessary hospita lizations and/or ER vis its due to preventable conditions that include appropr iate and timely treatment mental illness, coordinated outpatient post-discharge follow-up. 269 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital This project addresses the following Core Components: a) Increase service availability with extended hour s: University Health System anticipates expanding clinic hours during the project, after determining when and where the additional hours woul d be beneficial. b) Increase number of specialty clinic locati ons: University Health System anticipates adding behavioral health care at additional community clinic sites in DY2, which is reflected in milestone 1. c) Implement transparent, standardized referra ls across the system: University Health System has already implemented this component and does not need to further address at this time. d) Conduct quality improvement for project using methods such as rapid cycle improvement. Activities may include, but are not limited to, identifying project impacts, identifying \"lessons learned,\" oppor tunities to scale all or part of the project to a broader patient population, and identifying key challe nges associated with expansion of the project, including special considerations for safety net populations. University Health System anticipates addressing access to services by those patients falling out of the target population or addressing care tr ansition with high risk fo r hospitalization patients. University Health System al so anticipates engaging in face-to-face biannual meetings with other providers and the RHP to Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): IT1.18 Follow Up After Hospitalization for Mental Illness NQF 0576236 (Standalone measure) a.

Data Source: EHR, Claims d. Rationale/Evidence: This measure assesses the percentage of discharges for members 6 years of age and older who were hospitalized for treatmen t of selected mental health disorders and who had an outpatient visit, an intensive outpatient encounter or partial hospi talization with a mental health practitioner. Tw o rates are reported. Rate 1. The percentage of members who received follow up within 30 days of discharge Rate 2. The percentage of members who received follow up within 7 days of discharge. Reasons/Rationale for selecting the outcome measures: The selection of this out come measure underscores the importan ce of addressing the triple aim in healthcare which includes improving quality of care, improving population health in a cost- effective manner. Additional milestones and metrics were selected to reflect an increase in behavioral health providers and their integrat ion within additional primary care sites. Relationship to other Projects: The project focus on behavioral health expansi on and integration into the medical home also fully supports related DSRIP projects that target disease management, expansion of primary care capacity and redesign of patient experience.

Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: 92414401.1.1 Expand training of the primary care workforce Training future providers in primary will assist w ith filling the need to create more access for patients and having newly trained provider s to staff additional clinical sites Plan for Learning Collaborative: This project lends itself to part icipation in learning collaborativ es as other Performing Providers in RHP6 seek to develop or enhance behavioral health services in othe r parts of the region for similar patient populations. Processes and tech niques developed and implemented during this project will be documented by th e project team. Successes as well as lessons learned will be shared with regional collaborators who are al so working to improve primary care access. Project Valuation: Project valuation for enhancing access to behavioral health services direct ly responds to waiver goals including the triple aim a nd improving the health delivery infr astructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of the community and region. This includes providing care in the right setting at the right time and enhancing the ability to treat mental health disorders earlier in the course of illness, both of which may c ontribute to avoidance of unnecessary admissions and ER visits that might be due to untreate d mental illness. The project also addresses community need by responding to gaps in delivery of behavioral health services. The Bexar County Mental Health Consortium, a broad represen tation of mental health agency stakeholders, has identified access to outpatient mental health care as a major need in the community, including enhancing availability of these serv ices within the medical home. Additionally, treatment of chronic mental illnesses shows improve d outcomes just as those seen with treatment of chronic physical illnesses, and coordinated care of co-morbi d behavioral and physical illness diagnoses in an integrated fashion tends to im prove outcomes of both. The project is considered large in scope as it looks to increase outreach to the targeted populati on and thereby increase the number of patients with beha vioral health needs thereby reducing cost and avoidable 272 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital hospitalizations. Relative to othe r projects, the proposed efforts ar e large in scale and will require investment in human resources, technology and organizational priorities that strengthen the opportunity to deliver integrated and acces sible care to the target population. 273 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital 136141205.1.5 PASS 1 1.9.2 A-D 1.9.2 Expand Access to Specialty Care (Behavioral Health) University Hospital TPI - 136141205 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 136141205.3.7 tion for 0576 (Standalone measure) Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 (P-11): Expand /launch specialty care clinic (psychiatry) Metric 1 (P-11.1a): Number of patients served by specialty care clinic.

It serves as the primary teaching hospital for the University of Texas Health Science Ce nter San Antonio, and the lead Level I Trauma Center and safety net provider for the estimat ed 2 million residents of Bexar County and South Texas. Over the past two decades University Health System has expanded access to primary, specialty the preventive health care services, and currently operates 19 hea lth centers and clinics throughout Bexar County. Intervention(s) : The Health System will expand prim ary care access through development and implementation of a school-based health center/m obile clinic based program to link children and adolescents of Bexar County, Texas with clinical preventive care. This project will expand primary care access by developing and implementi ng school-based health centers alongside mobile screenings in order to more effectiv ely link students with cl inical preventive care services. This will occur by establishing school-bas ed health centers at or near a school campus, and/or having a mobile health clinic visit th e school and/or provide these services by having students transported to a regiona l medical home located with th e Health System ambulatory network of care to receive preven tive screenings and immunizations. Need for the project : Studies find that economically vulne rable populations including minority children are much less likely to have access to tim ely and appropriate health care. The rate of uninsured in Bexar County is 23% highlighting the need for increased access. In addition, access to timely clinical preventive screenings can prev ent and detect illnesses and diseases in their earlier, more treatable stages, which can lead to reduced risk of illness, disability, early death, and medical care costs. Target population : Economically vulnerable children and adolescents in need of evidence-based clinical preventive screening and primary care ac cess that reside within the Health System service area. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The anticipated 5 year goal is to establish three fully- operational school-based/mobile heath clinics progr ams to expand delivery of preventive care to underserved populations. The secondary goal is to support coordination of services that improve timely access to related United Stat es Preventive Services Task Force (USPTF) preventive screenings that incl ude obesity in children, adolescents, visual and hearing, lead levels and behavioral health that has demonstrat ed to reduce risk of illness, disability, early death, medical care costs.

These goa ls aim to improve delivery of high quality evidence-based clinical preventive services to special popula tions that consist of screening and immunizations that can prevent diseases and reduce mortality associated with chronic disease and can encourage hea lthy behavior from a very young age. Delivery of evidence-based clinical, community preventive services (i.e., immunizations, screenings), and the inte gration of these activities within a school-based setting are central to improving and enhancing the health status of ch ildren and adolescents of Bexar County, Texas. Establishment of a school-based clinic can support implementation of community-based preventive services and enhance linkages with clinical care as well as reduce barriers to accessing clinical and community preventive servi ces, especially among populations at greatest risk. Community Medicine Associates, the provider network for Universi ty Hospital, will partner with the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio and lo cal school districts to establish a model of care that is accessible, c oordinated, comprehensive and patient-centered for 277 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital students. The primary emphasis will be placed on expanding health care services within major urban school districts such as the San Antonio Independent School District which has a current enrollment of 54,000 students of which more than eight out ten (86%) are economically disadvantaged. This will occur by leveraging re sources with community -based educational service providers (i.e., Headstart, San Antonio ISD, Edgewood ISD among other s) alongside accessibility to a mobile health and wellness unit that will provid e timely access to school-based immunization and screening services. Provision of clinical preven tive services will be made possible via a mobile health and wellness program alongside the establishment of a free standing school-based health clinic in areas that enco mpass both a large student population and that remains medically underserved. Clinical prev entive menu of screeni ng and related health services will include: physicals, primary care, immunizations, Texas Health Steps, health education, minor illness, a nd referrals to specialty . Relationship to Regional Goals: This project will further the achievement of th e regional goals of the Triple Aim; improved health care infrastructure to be tter serve Medicaid and currentl y uninsured residents in RHP 6; reduce health disparities; further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system; and improve outcomes while containing cost growth. Specifically, this project will expand a mobile health clinic within major urban school districts. Creating a cl inical linkage and establishing a usual source of care through a school-based/mob ile health program center can strengthen adherence to preventive care and healthy decision-making thus tr anslating into lives saved and cost-savings to both the healthcare deliv ery system and the local community. The Health System will monitor, evaluate, and adjust the project based on quality improvement activities throughout th e development and implementation phase s, offering \"lessons learned\" to our partners in RHP6 through the establishmen t of an appropriate Learning Collaborative Five year expected outcomes fo r provider and patient: University Hospital expects to have a series of fully established school-based/mobile hea lth centers tailored to meeting the health services needs of children and a dolescents and their caregivers enrolled in major urban school districts within Bexar County, Texas. Further, implementation and expansion of these school- based clinics primarily leveraged through the ex isting network of University Health System preventive health clinics will directly maximize the opportunity to improve delivery of high quality evidence-based clin ical preventive services to special populations. These will consist of screenings and immunizations th at can prevent disease and redu ce mortality associated with chronic conditions and that encourage h ealthy behavior from a very young age. Ultimately, by the end of DY5, data will demonstrate the proportion of the target population that received age and sex appropriate clinical prev entive care including sc reening for obesity in children and adolescents, screening for major depr essive disorders in adolescents and delivery of the meningococcal conjugate vaccine to adolescent s are defined as the primary health outcomes of interest (Primary Care and Primary Prevention OD-12). This will occur by ensuring that process and improvement milestones are me t throughout the life of the project. 278 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Starting Point/Baseline: Based on the current community outreach m odel the starting point/baseline is 0 Rationale: Adherence to clinical preventive services, such as routine disease sc reening and scheduled immunizations, are key to reducing death and disability is in li ne with national health goals. There is clear evidence that clinic al preventive services can both prevent and detect illnesses and disease that range from the flu to cancer that if caught in their earlier, more treatable stages, can significantly reducing the ri sk of illness, disability, early death, and health care costs. For example, on average, 42,000 deaths per year are prevented among children who receive recommended childhood vaccines. Yet, despite this evidence and such services are now covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and many pr ivate insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), large segments of the U.S. population which transl ate into millions of children, adolescents, and adults go without clinical preven tive services that could protect them from developing a number of serious diseases or help them treat certa in health conditions before they worsen. This project specifically addresse s community need three (CN.3): CN.3 - Address the lack of medical and dental health serv ices in the community due to high rates of uninsurance and provider shortages. Th e current project is a system redesign that enhances the current delivery of care model by leveraging the ne twork of University Health System Preventive Health Clinics in the communit y. Specifically, these preventive health clinics will help to establish a us ual source of care in the popul ation through integration and maintenance that is accessible, coordinated, co mprehensive and patient-centered for children and adolescents that attend school within the distri ct. These efforts will therefore serve to reduce health inequities that addre ss the triple aim of providing high quality care, improving population health and reducing the per capita cost of hea lth care; University Hospital will engage in population-based interventions that are coordi nated, comprehensive and multi-component to more effectively address the health needs of the 1.7 million residents of this major urban Texas region. With particular emphasis placed on th e adolescent population, this will occur by implementing evidence-based strategies that en courage healthy lifestyle s through delivery of clinical preventive services. Such efforts will also coincide with Healthy People 2020 , The National Prevention Council's National Prevention Strategy to engage and empower individuals, promote healthy and safe communities and ali gn with clinical and community preventive services to reduce disp arities in health. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD - 12 Primary Care and Primary Prevention: IT-12.5 Other USPTF-endorsed screening outc ome measures (Screening for obesity in children and adolescents) Rational/Evidence: Since the 1970s, childhood and adolescent obesity has increased three to six-fold. Approximately 12% to 18% of 2- to 19-year-old children and adolescents are obese (defined as having an age- and gender-specific BMI at 95th percentile).The USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen children aged 6 years and older for obesity and offer them or 279 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital refer them to comprehensive, intensive behavi oral interventions to promote improvement in weight status. The USPSTF found that effec tive comprehensive weight-management programs incorporated counseling and other interventions that targeted diet and physical activity. Interventions also includ ed behavioral management techniques to assist in behavior change. Interventions that focused on younger children incorporated parental involvement as a component. Moderate- to high-intensity prog rams involved >25 hours of contac t with the child and/or the family over a 6-month period and showed results including improved weight status, defined as an absolute and/or relative decrease in the BMI 12 months after the beginning of the intervention. Most participants were obese, a nd it is not known whether these results can be applied to children who are overweight but not obese. In addition, evidence was limited on the long-term sustainability of BMI changes achie ved through behavioral in terventions and on the trajectory of weight gain in ch ildren and adolescents. Interv entions generally took place in referral settings, and the results can only be generalized to children who follow through on treatment. Low-intensity interventions, defined as 25 contact hours over a 6-month period, did not result in significant impr ovement in weight status. Numerator: Number of children ages 6 years and olde r screened and referred to comprehensive behavioral interventions to promote weight status. Denominator: Number of children ages 6 and older from the target population. Data Source: EHR, Claims IT - 12. 5 Other USPSTF-endorsed scr eening outcome measures screening of adolescents (12- 18 years of age) for major depressive disorder (MDD) when systems are in place to ensure accurate diagnosis, psychotherapy (cognitive-be havioral or interpersonal), and follow-up. Rationale/Evidence: Depression among youth is a relativel y common, disabling condition that is associated with serious long-te rm morbidities and risk of suic ide. The majority of depressed youth, however, are undiagnosed and untreated, de spite opportunities for identification in settings such as primary care. A synthesis of the evidence suggest that primary care screening tools may be accurate in identifying depre ssed adolescents, and treatment can improve depression outcomes. Specific tr eatment should be based on the individual's needs and mental health treatment guidelines (USPSTF, Systematic Review, 2009). Numerator: Number of adolescents ages 12 to 18 year s screened for major depressive disorder. Denominator: Number of adolescents ages 12 to 18 from the target population.

This project achieves the Waiver goals by a) improving the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsure d residents of the county; b) further developing and maintaining a coordinated care delivery system; c) contributing to patients' receiving high-qualit y, patient-centered care in th e most cost-effective way; and serving as a powerful tool to help providers improve outcomes and reduce ED utilization (containi ng cost growth). 2. This project addresses community needs by improving quality of healthcare delivery and patient experience, enhanc ing access to health services and expanding prevention efforts. 3. The large scope of the project that includes expansion acros s the 14 school districts in Bexar County, Texas is critical to ensuring a healthy population (children, adolescents, caregivers a nd the surrounding areas). 4. This project requires a very large investment in terms of personnel, technology and infrastructure to ensure a coordinated approach to clinical preventive case is taken across the various major urban school district s. The hardware, software applications, human resources and time elements require d to implement this project are of the highest organizational priority for Univers ity Health System. This particular project targets the adolescent population, but the scope is also expansive in that it addresses both the current and future h ealth needs of the population. 282 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital 136141205.1.6 PASS 1 1.1.3 N/A 1.1.3 Expand school -based/mobile health clinics University Hospital 3.IT-12.5 Other in children and adolescents Other USPSTF- Screening for MDD in adolescents Other USPSTF- Screening/Immunization of MVC-1 in adolescent Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P-2] Implement a school-based clinic program Metric 1 [P-2.1.] Number of additional clinics or expanded hours Baseline/Goal: Baseline: October 1, 2011 to September 30, 2012 (0) Goal: One (1) fully operational school-based health center/mobile-health program in one (1) major urban school district.

It serves as the primary teaching hospital for the University of Texas Health Science Ce nter San Antonio, and the lead Level I Trauma Center and safety net provider for the estimat ed 2 million residents of Bexar County and South Texas. Over the past two decades University Health System has expanded access to primary, specialty the preventive health care services, and currently operates 19 hea lth centers and clinics throughout Bexar County. Intervention(s) : This project will enhance awareness and establish an integrated interpretation service in order to ensure that health informati on is provided in a manner th at is appropriate to a patient's linguistic and cultural orientation. This will include enhancing awareness of and access to timely oral interpretation services for patien ts and family members, in order to improve communication and foster understanding betw een healthcare professionals and their patients/caregivers with limited English language proficiency. Need for the project : Pronounced demographic shifts in the ra cial and ethnic make-up of the U.S. population illustrate the need for health systems to proactively find ways to deliver high quality care in a manner that is responsive to the cultur al beliefs, language and behavior of an ever diverse patient population. According to the U.S. Census, 43% of Bexar County residents speak a language other than English (p rimarily Spanish) in the home, compared to 34% across the state. The ability of University Health System (UHS) to provide effectiv e care to linguistically diverse populations will be de pendent upon staff capacity (skills, knowledge and awareness) to demonstrate culturally competent care. In 2011, ve ndor-contracted interpre ters were called to come to University Health System locations 1,327 times. Through the use of bi-lingual staff members, who have volunteered to interpret in their work areas and successfully completed a comprehensive interpretation course, UHS aims to significantly reduce the need for contracted interpreters for Spanish-speaking patients. Target population : The target population will include the Medicaid funded and uninsured patients who comprise 62% of UHS patients. This will also include the broader UHS service catchment area of Bexar County and South Texa s where large segments of the population are economically underserved, uninsured, with a primar y language that is other than English. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : This project will conduct a gap analysis to assess gaps in language access and delivery of culturally co mpetent care in DY 2. This will be followed by development and implementation of a 24/7 web-ba sed video interpretation program and staffing capacity in DY 3 and DY 4 result ing in a total of 150 trained volunt eer staff interpreters and an established standard document translation process by DY5. This will promote timely oral interpretation/ written translation services, improve exchange of health information and increase patient confidence in adherence to clinical care and treatment. 286 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Category 3 outcomes: 136141205.3.19 IT-6.1 - 3.IT.6.1 Percent improvement over baseline of patient satisfaction scores DY4 - Increase Patient Satisfaction Scores by TBD% over established baseline of patient satisfaction scores.

University Health System ther efore proposes to strengthen access to culturally competent patient-centered care through stra tegies that promote timely or al interpretation/translation services, improve the fluid exchange of hea lth information between patients and healthcare professionals and promote opportunities for patient to adhere to prescrib ed clinical care and treatment regimens. Goals and Relationship to Regional Goals Project goals are to enhance awar eness of translation services in order to ensure that health information is provided in a manner that is appropriate to a patient's linguistic and cultural orientation. This will include e nhancing awareness of and access to timely oral interpretation services for patients and family members, in order to improve communication and foster understanding between healthcare professionals and their pati ents/caregivers with limited English language proficiency. This will also include incorporating strategies that improve the quality of written and oral translation services (English to Spanish) to ensure patients can receive important healthcare information in their preferred language, improve understanding and adhere nce to instructions, while reducing the cost of outsourcing document tr anslation services. Specific project goals are in line with the project option's core component s (1.4.1, a-d), which therefore are as follows: Project Goals Conduct an analysis to determine gaps in lin guistic diversity, translation and culturally competent care. Train a cadre of volunteers refl ective of the gap analysis and assessment to ensure that an appropriate level exists both in terms of capacity and competency. 287 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Develop a plan to establish a 24/7 web-ba sed video interpretation program alongside recruitment of a manager to oversee this initiative. Expand the number of video conferencing terminals with access to healthcare interpretation technology. Hire and train certified transl ation staff to better enable tr anslation of written documents alongside provision of web-based vi deo interpretati on services. Increase the number of in terpreter encounters per mont h as a measure of improving language access to the patient population. Participate in face-to-face learning as a qua lity improvement process that promotes lessons learned, solutions, and opportuni ties with other providers in region. In 2012, University Health System began the pro cess of implementing an integrated interpreter education and competence assessment program. Th is 40-hour training program is for bilingual University Health System staff to provide hea lthcare interpretation services within their own clinical or administrative areas. The training includes: modes of interpretation, the role of the interpreter, code of ethics and confidentiality, medical termi nology, and practice. Successful completion of the program requires regular class attendance, passing the final written exam, and a final demonstration of competence in an interpreting skills pr actice situation. To date, University Health System has traine d 108 interpreters thr ough this program. 106 of these individuals serve as English/Spanish language interpreters. The remaining two are English/German interpreters. Challenges While this program marks a significant improveme nt over University Health System's previous model of depending exclusively on costly contract ed vendors to provide telephonic interpreters and onsite interpretation services at our locati ons, there continues to be challenges. These include: 1) Having a limited menu of language-specific in terpretation services th at are available through the in-house program. For example, there is signifi cant and often emergency need for interpreters of languages of lesser diffusion, including Fars i, Arabic, Russian, Vietnamese and Karen 2) The limited capacity that exists for trained st aff interpreters to suppor t other units within the hospital, or at another University Health Sy stem location due to sc heduling and primary job responsibilities and requirements. 3) Disparate distribution of inte rpreters by shift offers limited av ailability for after hours and weekend interpretation services 4) In situations in which pre-scheduling is not pos sible, such as emergencies, the time for a staff interpreter or an outside vendor to arrive onsite can often impact timeliness of care (arrival time can be greater than one hour). 5-Year Expected Outcome for Provider and Patient University Health System expects to strengthen access to culturally competent patient-centered care through a fully established language interpretation progra m marked by an increase in training staff (150), implementation a 24/7 web-based interpreta tion technology and an established standard document translation process that promot es timely oral and written interpretation/translation services, improves excha nge of health information between patients and 288 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital healthcare professionals and increases patient confidence in adherence to clinical care and treatment. Starting Point/Baseline: Currently, there are 108 certified medical interpreters at Univer sity Health System. The most recent available interpreter support services data report that in 2011 there were approximately 82,984 minutes of telephonic interp retation, 1,702 on-site contract interpretation encounters and 205 documents translated in Spanish. Rationale: In the United States, safety-net hospitals remain essential to providing ac cess to health services for over 50 million uninsured Americans as well as other underserved populations. These populations are considered diverse both in te rms of ethnicity, language and cultural background. Therefore expanding access to written and oral in terpretation services firmly coincides with University Health System strategic imperative and national health care aims of providing high quality care, improving population health and providing that care in a cost-effective manner; University Health System will primarily focus on developing and implementing an, \"infrastructure of culturally competent care.\" This will include increasing the number of trained staff interpreters to 150 by the end of 2013 to pr ovide greater in-house in terpretation coverage. This will be enhanced by utilizing new and emerging web-based vide o technologies alongside development of a 24-hour Healthcar e Interpreter Service within Un iversity Health System. The development of the in-house Healthcare Inte rpreter Service will occur in 2013, with the recruitment of a manager and the development of objectives and metrics for the program. In 2013, University Health System will evaluate ava ilable web-based video interpretation programs, with implementation to follow in 2014. By th e end of 2014, University Health System's Healthcare Interpreter Service will be to full capacity (4.5 FTEs) and operational thus providing 24/7 service. There is also considerable need to improve the clarity and quality of instructions, letters, signs and other important health information and edu cation documents. Assuring they are written at the appropriate grade level and are consistent w ith University Health System's commitment to patient centered care and cultural sensitivity is a high priority. Universi ty Health System will utilize the new Healthcare Interpreter Service team to reduce written translation expense and enhance the document translation process. The pers ons hired into these positions will be certified healthcare translators so, during those times wh en they are not interpreting, they can be translating documents from English to Spanish. Th e process will be standardized to assure all patient information requiring translation is fi rst assessed by a communica tions professional for clarity, cultural sensitivity and appropriate grade level, and the translated documents are then evaluated by the volunteer bi- lingual University Health Sy stem Translation Committee for quality control purposes. This project uniquely addresses community health need (CN.1) Improve quality of healthcare delivery and patient experience and (CN.2) addr ess the high prevalence of chronic disease and related health disparities in the community th rough greater prevention efforts that focus on addressing chronic disease. In terms of system redesign, this project repres ents an opportunity to develop effective methods 289 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital of translation and communication which are cons idered critical to delivering safe, timely and effective health care, and ensuring open communication between patients, families and healthcare team members. Communication is also directly linked to adherence to medication regimens, provider recommendations, and hospital discharge instructions . Communication that is respectful of a patient's cultu ral orientation can result in be tter health outcomes and reduced readmission rates. Conversel y, inadequate interpretation se rvices and/or culturally or linguistically inappropriate health education ma terials can lead to pa tient dissatisfaction, poor comprehension and adherence, and uncoordinated low-quality care. To attain the highest level of communication a nd cultural competence, healthcare providers must be aware of the impact of cultu ral factors on their patients' hea lth beliefs and behaviors, and have the tools and skills needed to communicat e effectively and appropriately with a diverse population of patients. At the same time, patients must be empowered to be an active partner in this process. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD- Patient Satisfaction IT6.1 Percent improvement over baseline of patient satisfaction scores ( all questions within a survey need to be answered to be a standalone measure) Percent improvement over baseline of patient satisfaction scores, among non-English speaking patients, for one or more of the patient sati sfaction domains that the provider targets for improvement utilizing the HCAHPS survey. a Numerator: Percent improvement in targeted patient satisfaction domain b Data Source: Patient survey c Denominator: Number of patients who were administered the survey Reasons/Rational for Select ing the outcome measures: The patient satisfaction outcome measure was select ed due to its consider ation as a valid self- report rating by the patient in regards to the qual ity of care received during their most recent appointment. Further, the intent of the HCAHPS initiative is to provide a standardized survey instrument and data collection methodology for measuring patients' perspectives on hospital care. The surveys are designed to produce comparable data on the patient's perspective on care that allows objective and meaningful compar isons between institutions on domains that are important to consumers. Public reporting of the su rvey results is designed to create incentives for institutions to improve their quality of care. Public reporting will serve to enhance public accountability in health care by in creasing the transparency of th e quality of institutional care provided in return for the public investment. With a service catchment area of 1.7 million reside nts, University Health System is the major safety-net hospital for Bexar County, Texas. En suring that timely, efficient, equitable, high quality care is delivered to the population wi ll be strengthen by ta king into account and measuring the patient perspective thus transla ting into better health for the community. Further, effective communication impacts the pa tient's perception of every dimension of care included in the CAHPS surveys. How they rate their experience in a hospital or outpatient 290 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital facility starts with understanding what their docto r, nurse or other hea lthcare worker said to them. How these professionals rela te to their patients (e.g. demons trating respect for a different culture) is critical to improving patient satisf action scores and directly linked to patient adherence to treatment plans and medication regimens. Developing a culture in which competent healthcare interpreters are utilized in all situations in which the patient and provider speak different languages is an important wa y to reduce patient anxi ety, foster understanding between the entire healthcare t eam (with the patient as its central member), and improve the patient experience. What is best for patients is the most important rationale for selecting this project and for measuring its success through CAHPS scores.

Data Source: HCAHPS296 Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Plan for Learning Collaborative: University Health System is alre ady actively engaged with peer or ganizations in an interpretation services learning collaborative through the Teac hing Hospitals of Texas. This demonstration project will further the work of this learning community and expa nd its ability to share ideas and challenges with providers across the state. University Health System looks forward to developing a plan to communicate lessons learned from this proj ect across RHP 6 and organize learning events within the region to bring inte rpretation/translation co mmunications experts in from outside the region to share knowledge and best practices around this important issue. Project Valuation: This project, to improve communication and fost er understanding betwee n healthcare providers, patients and families, is directly tied to the Waiv er's Triple aim to assure patients receive high quality and patient-centered care, in the most cost effective ways. Project valuation for strengthe ning access to culturally compet ent patient-centered care through strategies that promote timely or al interpretation/translation servi ces, improve exchange of health information between patients and healthcare prof essionals and increase patient confidence in adherence to clinical care directly responds to waiver goals including the triple aim and improving the health delivery infrastructure to better serve the uninsur ed residents of the community and region. This includes providing care in the right setti ng at the right time and in a manner that enhancing the provider's ability to a ddress patient adherence to treatment, clinical preventive care and discharge instructions, bo th of which may contri bute to avoidance of unnecessary admissions and ER visits that might be due to untreated mental illness. 292 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital The project also addresses community need by responding to efforts that improve quality of healthcare delivery and patient experience as we ll as reducing the high pr evalence of chronic disease and related health di sparities in the community. This project is considered is a ppropriate in scope (Scal e Rating: 4) with the potential to make a large impact as it looks to enhance an infrastr ucture that is coordina ted and improves patient outcomes, as these objectives cannot be attained without effective interpersonal communication. Relative to other projects, the proposed efforts is in scale and will require investment in human resources, technology and organizati onal priorities that strengthen the quality and value of care delivered to the target population. 293 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital 136141205.1.7 PASS 2 1.4.1 A-D 1.4.1 Expand Access to Written and Oral Interpretation Services University Hospital TPI - 136141205 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 136141205.3.19 3.IT-6.1 Percent improvement over baseline of patient satisfaction scores Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P-1]: Conduct an analysis to determine gaps in language access and culturally competent care.

It serves as the primary teaching hospital for the University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio, and the lead Level I Trauma Center and safety net provider for the estimated 2 million residents of Bexar County and South Texas. Over the past two decades University Health System has expanded access to primary, specialty the prev entive health care se rvices, and currently operates 19 health centers and clinics throughout Bexar County. Intervention(s) : Increase pediatric primary care (includi ng pediatric urgent care) clinic visit volume and provide evidence of improved access for patients seeking services. Accomplish this intervention through hiring more pediatricians and mid-level providers to enhance access for pediatric patients. Need for the project : Our goal is to increase access to quality pediatric care in Bexar County, Texas. This will be accomplished by expanding the existing health service model of care to more fully support delivery of pediatri c health services incl uding expanding hours of operations at primary care clinic sites and incr easing number of pediatri c clinicians to more fully support segments of the pediatric population in need of preventive care and treatment. Studies find that economically vulnerable populations includi ng minority children are much less likely to have access to timely and appropriate health care. Target population : The target population will include pediat ric patients in either an indigent or Medicaid-qualifying status in Bexar County who are in need of accessible primary care in areas of the city convenient to where they live. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : We anticipate that this project will produce the following benefits for the targeted population: Provide more timely access to clinical prev entive services and screening in order to prevent and detect disease Addresses community need three (CN.3), lack of medical and dental health services in the community due high rates of uninsurance and provider shortages Serve to reduce health inequities and addr ess the triple aim of providing high quality care, improving population hea lth and reducing the per capita cost of health care. The University Health System will improve access for pediatric primary care and pediatric urgency care services by demonstrating an incr ease in volume of se rvices provided in DY2 through DY5. For the baseline year beginning October 1st, 2011 and ending September 30th, 297 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital 2012, there were 66,435 CMA pediatric primary care and pediatric acute care encounters. DY3 - Increase CMA pediatric primary and acute care encounters by 2% over baseline; 67,764 expected encounters. DY4 - Increase CMA pediatric primary and acute care encounters by 4% over baseline; 69,092 expected encounters. DY5 - Increase CMA pediatric primary and acute care encounters by 6% over baseline; 70,421 expected encounters. Category 3 outcomes: IT-9.3- Adult Asth ma Emergency Department Visits - NQF 1381 (Standalone measure). Reduc tion of pediatric and young adult asthma emergency department visits by TBD% by the ends of both DY4 and DY5 for the target population Project Description: Our goal is to increase access to quality pedi atric care in Bexar Count y, Texas. This will be accomplished by expanding the existing health service model of care to more fully support delivery of pediatric health se rvices including, expanding hours of operations at primary care clinic sites and increasing number of pediatric clinicians to more fully support segments of the pediatric population in need of preven tive care and treatment. These goals aim to improve delivery of high quali ty evidence-based clinical pr eventive services to special populations that consist of screening and im munizations that can prevent disease and encourage healthy behavior and adherence to preventive care from a very young age. It is estimated that 22 million children lack ac cess to medical care due to provider shortages (Patient Protection and Affordable Act, 2012). Di sparities in access to health care services are also due to the high cost of care as well as the result of being uninsured. These factors can have a deleterious effect on the health status of individuals such as delays in seeking care or treatment, the inability to receive timely clinical preventive care (immunizations) and screening (obesity, asth ma) for conditions that untreated can consequently result in admissions to the emergency room (Healthy People 2020). Studies find that economically vulnerable populations including minority childre n are much less likely to have access to timely and appropriate health care. This occurs at a time when minorities are contributing to a major demographic shift in this nation. For example, minority children account for almost half (46%) of the population under 18 (Annie E. Casey Foundation, 2011). Within the past decade, Hispanic children grew by 4.8 million (o r 39 percent). Local data for Bexar County, illustrate similar trajectories in racial/et hnic minority growth. For example, a recent demographic assessment estimates that almost one third of the population will be 18 years of age or younger, with 9 out 10 being of Hispanic origin. Delivery of evidence-based clinical preventive services (i.e., immunizat ions, screenings), and the integration of these activities within a pr imary care setting are central to improving and enhancing the health status of children in Bexar County, Texas. Enhancing access to pediatric health services support implementa tion of community-based preventive services and enhance linkages with clinical care, especially among populat ions at greatest risk for disease and injury. 298 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Specific Project Goals This project will increase and expand access to pediatric health care within the University Health System medical home model of care by collaborating w ith both current and planned community health service interventions that will take place within the geographic service catchment area of University Health System, resu lting in expansion of services. Specifically this project will: Reduce disparities in access to preven tive pediatric health services in underserved populations Increase pediatric care provider capa city to ensure tim ely, accessible and integrated care to underserved pedi atric populations in Bexar County, Texas Increase aware among target population on the importance of adherence to clinical preventive care in reduci ng risk for disease and injury. This undertaking will be made possible by le veraging the University Health System ambulatory network of clinical and preventive health clinics that ar e located in both high- growth and high-need areas delineated prim arily by economically vu lnerable populations that include minority individuals with multip le chronic conditions with limited and non- existent health insurance coverage. For exampl e project efforts will coincide with University Health System initiatives to partner with FQHC s to expand primary care capacity and access, oral health services, establis h school-based clinics in major urban sectors of the city and health promotion efforts that enhance awareness of preventive care at all life stages to further help establish linkages between communities and preventive care. The Health System will monitor, evaluate, and adjust the project based on quality improvement activities throughout the develo pment and implementation phases, offering \"lessons learned\" to our ners in RHP6 through the approp riate Learning Collaborative to be established. Relationship to Regional Goals This project will further achievement of the regional goals of the Triple Aim; improved health care infrastructure to better serve Medi caid and currently unins ured residents in RHP 6; reduce health disparities; further develop a nd maintain a coordinate d care delivery system; and improve outcomes while containing cost growth. Challenges Challenges to this project will be the timely expansion and care coordination of pediatric health services to (1)ensure timely receipt of care by patients, (2 ) ensure appropriate infrastructure (electronic medical record systems), (3) the coordination and capacity (providers, hours of operation and clinical space) to appropr iately accommodate increased volume from newly established referral pathways. In an effort to proactively address these challenges strategic planning and assessment effort s will be undertaken that includes meeting with key stakeholders to ensure that a balance is maintained between resources, capacity and projected demand. This is considered essential to providing care at th e right time and in the 299 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital right setting. 5 Year Expected Outcome for Provider and Patients: University Health System expects to see impr ovements in clinical li nkages (integration and coordination of health services), as well as a fully expanded pediatric h ealth service model of care between University Health System and target populatio n. The anticipated 5 year goal is to reduce the proportion of Pe diatric/Young Adult Asthma Emer gency Department Visits. Starting Point/Baseline: Baseline will include 2011 annual number of pediatric primary care and urgency primary care encounters seen at Community Medical Asso ciates Primary Care and Urgent Care sites (encounters include CMA primary care network (Main c linical home, PHC, all locations that provide primary and preventive services). During the baseline year ending September 30 th, 2012, there were 66,435 CMA pediatric primary care and pediatric acute care encounters. Rationale: Studies find disparities in health and well-being often begin in early in life. The etiology of adverse health events are often a reflection of gaps in access to services that lead unequal treatment, adverse congenital hea lth conditions, as well as early exposure to distressed social and economic conditions (i.e., poverty). Expand ing access to pediatric services especially among economically underserved population is cen tral to increasing adherence to clinical preventive services, such as routine disease screening and scheduled immunizations, which is key to reducing death and disabi lity. These strategies are im portant and strongly coincide with interventions that see to improve th e nation's health (Hea lthy People 2020, National Prevention Strategy, 2011). There is clear evidence that timely access to cl inical preventive services and screening can both prevent and detect illnesses and disease that range from th e flu to cancer that if caught in their earlier, more treatable stages, can sign ificantly reducing the risk of illness, disability, early death, and health care costs. For exam ple, on average, 42,000 deaths per year are prevented among children who receive recommended childhood vaccines. Yet, despite this evidence and such services are now covere d by Medicare, Medica id, and many private insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), large segments of the U.S. population which translate into millions of children, adolescents, and adults go without clinical preventive services that could protect them from developing a number of serious diseases or help them treat certain health conditions before they worsen. This project addresses the following Core Components: a) Expand primary care clinic space: Universi ty Health System anticipates obtaining new space in a location to be selected in the baseline assessment phase. Milestone 2 was chosen to address this component. b) Expand primary care clinic areas: We also an ticipate adding hours of service in at least one clinic site, potentially more , based on a demand study conducted during the baseline assessment phase, which is reflected in milestone 3. 300 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital c) Expand primary care clinic staffing to tw o or more clinic locations and will determine in the baseline assessment phase where the greatest impact will be for the growing patient population. This com ponent is initially addressed with milestone 1. This project specifically addr esses community need three (CN.3) : Address the lack of medical and dental health services in the community due high rates of uninsurance and provider shortages The current project is a system redesign that enhances the current delivery of care model by leveraging the network of University Health System Preventive Health Clinics in the community. Specifically, these prev entive health clinics will help to establish a usual source of care in the population through in tegration and maintenance that is accessible, coordinated, comprehensive and patient-centered for children and adolescents. These efforts will therefore serve to reduce heal th inequities and address the triple aim of providing high quality care, improving population h ealth and reducing the per capita cost of health care; University Health System will engage in population-based interventions that are coordinated, comprehensive and multi-component to more effectively address the health needs of the 1.7 million residents of this major urban Texas region. With particular emphasis placed on children with health servic e needs residing in economically underserved areas of Bexar County, this will occur by implementing evidence- based strategies that encourag e healthy lifestyles through deli very of clinical preventive services. Such efforts coincide with Healthy People 2020 , The National Prevention Council's National Prevention Strategy to engage and empower individuals, promote healthy and safe communities and align with clinical and community preventive services to reduce disparities in health.

Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: TPI Pending 1.1.1 - Establish more primary care clinics: Primary Care Expansion Program (Children's Hospital of San Antonio) Plan for Learning Collaborative: This project lends itself to participation in a learning coll aborative as other Performing Providers in RHP6 seek to deve lop and expand pediatric care se rvices in other parts of the region for similar patient populations. Processe s and techniques developed and implemented during this project will be documented by th e project team. Successes as well as lessons learned will be shared with regional collaborato rs who are also working to improve access to pediatric health services. Project Valuation: The project achieves the waiver goal and m eets community needs by expanding pediatric care capacity in a predominantly Hispanic, unde rserved area of Bexa r County. This program strengthens healthcare linkages with local commun ity partners and enhan ces access to health care services to a target popul ation who struggle with poverty, receive acute or emergency healthcare services, and do not have usual pr oviders. In addition, many in the target population often with no or limited access to qu ality pediatric care are unaware of being at risk or are not diagnosed with conditions which can become far more complicated and costly to treat. Access to coordinated and timely pedi atric health services has shown to improve health, improve health care, and lower care costs. 302 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital 136141205.1.8 PASS 3 1.1.2 1.1.2 A-C 1.1.2 Expand existing primary care capacity: Patient- centered pediatric care University Hospital TPI - 136141205 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 136141205.3.25 IT-9.3 Pediatric/Young Adult Asthma Emergency Department Visits (Standalone measure) Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P-5]: Train/Hire additional pediatric care providers and staff and /or increase the number of pediatric care clinics for existing providers Metric 1 [P5.1]:Documentation of increased number of pediatric providers Baseline: Number of providers in CMA at September 30, 2012 Goal: add 2 additional providers throughout primary care CMA network Data Source: provider templates, HR new hire documentation Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $1,762,829.50 Milestone 2 P-1 Expand Existing pediatric primary care clinics Milestone 3 [P-1]: Establish additional/expand existing/relocate primary care clinics Metric 1 [P-1.1]: Number of expanded hours Baseline: baseline year of December 31, 2011 primary care hours Goal: add 1 additional 4 hour session at one clinical site Data Source: Provider templates Milestone 3 Estimated Incentive Payment: $2,121,032.5 Milestone 4 I-12 Increase pediatric primary care (including pediatric urgent care) clinic volume of visits and provide evidence of improved access for patients seeking services Metric 1: [I-12.1]: Documentation of increased number of visits Milestone 5 [I-12]: Increase pediatric primary care (including pediatric urgent care) clinic volume of visits and provide evidence of improved access for patients seeking services Metric 1: [I-12.1]: Documentation of increased number of visits Baseline: During the baseline year ending September 30 th, 2012 there were 66,435 pediatric primary care and acute care encounters.

It serves as the primary teaching hospital for the University of Texas H ealth Science Center San Antonio, and the lead Level I Trauma Center and safety net provider for the estimated 2 million residents of Bexar County and South Texas. Over the past two de cades University Health System has expanded access to primary, specialty the preventive hea lth care services, and currently operates 19 health centers and clin ics throughout Bexar County. Intervention(s) : This project proposes development and expansion of a psychiatric emergency service with capacity to accommodate voluntary and involuntar y patients with mental illness and in acute crisis. It offers an alternative to medical emergency rooms for those patients not requiring emergent/urgent evaluation and stab ilization of physical medical conditions. Partnering this effort with other i nventions, like a crisis intervention unit, is critical in order to prevent psychiatric crises and to intervene effectively when they do arise. Need for the project : A study of the Bexar County Mental Health System identified the following problems: stacking in the ER, increase in emergency detention patients (brought in by law enforcement), lack of psychiatrists, and increase use of the criminal justice system by these patients. During a six-month peri od (July 1 - December 31, 2009), 2,580 indigent patients with mental health diagnoses were ev aluated in emergency r ooms across San Antonio (accounted for 37.5% of total emergency room patients with mental illness diagnoses) at a total cost of $2.1M. Of those evaluated, 7 % we re return visits during the same period. As indicated in the RHP 6 Community Needs Assessme nt this project meets the regional goal to increase access to outpatient care for adults with moderate acuity behavioral health needs in order to mitigate readmissions for acute care se rvices and the inappropriate use of emergency departments. Target population : Patients in Bexar County who traditionally access the emergency department for behavioral health care interven tions. Bexar County has a significant number of low income, uninsured and minority reside nts who suffer from multiple chronic conditions. The majority of our patients are either Medicaid eligible, und erinsured, or indigent. Patients will benefit from this project by receiving quality care in the most appropriate setting. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : This project will assure that the right care is being provided in the right setting (OD-9.3.1) and includes the following components: Expand the system of care by creating a psychiatric emergency service (PES) Increase access to an underserved patient population by hiring addi tional psychiatrists and psychiatric nurse practitioners to provi de evaluations urgen tly and emergently 305 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Treating patients in the safest and most a ppropriate setting with access to psychiatric expertise We anticipate a patient benefit through provision of an estimated number of PES visits of 1,200 during DY4 and 2,400 in DY5. Category 3 outcomes: IT 3.8 The goal is to reduce Behavioral Health/Substance Abuse ED visits in the medical ED DY4 - Reduce readmission rates by TBD% DY5 - Reduce readmission rates by TBD% Project Description: In March, 2011, a study of the Bexar County Ment al Health system was conducted by U.S. Army Department Army-Baylor Program Intern, Major Samantha S. Hinchman, often referred to in the community as the \"Hinch man Study\" and focused on indigent care for behavioral health patients pr esenting to local hosp ital emergency rooms. The study identified the following problems: stacking in the ER, incr ease in emergency detention patients (brought in by law enforcement), lack of psychiatrists, an d increase use of the criminal justice system by these patients. During a six-month period (July 1 - December 31, 2009), 2,580 indigent patients with mental health diagnoses were ev aluated in emergency r ooms across San Antonio (accounted for 37.5% of total emergency room patients with mental illness diagnoses) at a total cost of $2.1M. Of those evaluated 7 % were return visits during the same period. During 2011, University Hospital provided em ergent psychiatric evaluations for 3,127 patients, 50% of whom were brought in by law enforcement. The length of stay for those patients deemed voluntary was 16 hours, and fo r those needing involuntary admission was 37 hours (average 18 hour LOS). Because of the volume of patients a nd length of stay, a back log in the medical emergency room is experienced by patients with and without psychiatric conditions. In addition, stabilizati on of crises occurs more readily in a site where psychiatric providers are readily available, thus potenti ally avoiding unnecessary inpatient admissions. This project proposes to expand on that asse ssment of community need and develop and expand a psychiatric emergency service w ith capacity to accommodate voluntary and involuntary patients with mental illness and in acute crisis. This solution would offer an alternative to medical emergency rooms for t hose patients not requ iring emergent/urgent evaluation and stabilization of physical medical conditions. Th e capacity would be 16 beds. This project will assure that the right care is being provided in the ri ght setting (OD-9.3.1) and includes the following components: Expand the existing system of care by creati ng a psychiatric emergency service (PES) Increase access to an underserved patient population by hiring addi tional psychiatrists and psychiatric nurse practitioners to provi de evaluations urgen tly and emergently Treat patients in the safest and most appr opriate setting with access to psychiatric expertise Anticipated challenges include fi nancial sustainability and recr uitment of psychiatrists and 306 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital mid-level behavioral health providers . From a financial perspective this project addresses the underserved needs of indigent be havioral health patients in th e San Antonio community. The lack of treatment resources for the indigent mental health patient is a community problem which we hope to significantly address through this project. Multi-yea r expected outcomes include the PES (and its sister project the Cris is Intervention Unit, CIU) becoming integrated within a community-wide behavioral health syst em of care with seamless transitions between hospital-based services (ER's and inpatient units) to commun ity outpatient settings. The project goal is to enable immediate access for patients to urgent/emergent care with interdisciplinary expertise, and stabilization of crises in a mo re appropriate setting than a hospital inpatient unit. Another challenge is the ability to recruit psychiatrists to our community since that specialty is under-represented already. Thus we anticip ate using a staff mode l of some employed psychiatrists and mid-level providers, supplem ented by providers contracted hourly, and those made available through telemedicine. As indicated in the RHP 6 Community Needs A ssessment this project m eets the regional goal to increase access to outpatient care for adults with moderate acuity behavioral health needs in order to mitigate readmissions for acute care se rvices and the inappropriate use of emergency departments. Starting Point/Baseline: The annual number of admits to the Hospital's psychiatric emergency se rvice is 3,127 (2011). We hope to increase this number to include those patients who now would present to an emergency room not having psychiatric evaluation capability. We anticipate that once the psychiatric em ergency service is opened and community education to EMS, health care systems, and law enforcement, is completed, that volume of services will increase fairly quickly. Ongoing data collection should include: Number of patient visits Number of unduplicated patients evaluated Number of patients brought in by law enforcement (emergency detention or otherwise), EMS, walk-in, or transferred Identification of frequent ut ilizers of th ese services Payer mix Length of stay Final disposition: including # admitted to University Hospital psychiatry inpatient unit or other unit, # referred to other crisis st abilization services, # referred to outpatient treatment Quality indicators 307 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Rationale: This project was selected due to the critical need for emergency psychiatric care for patients that do not otherwise need medical treatment for a physical condition. Providing psychiatric emergency services will facilitate care for ps ychiatric patients in the most appropriate treatment setting. In addition it will decrease emergency room tr affic in medical care settings for those with primary psychiatric diagnoses who can be appropriately served in other settings thereby enhancing throughput in th at setting for medical patients. Finally, with availability of psychiatric staff and other s upport staff, unnecessary admission s can be avoided by providing crisis intervention in a setting more appropriate than a medical emergency room without such support and facility struct ure conducive to stabiliz ing psychiatric crises. It is responsive to Community Need #4 (CN4 ): Address the shorta ge of high quality integrated mental and behavioral he alth services in the community. This project significantly enhances the way we will provide care to patients seeking emergent or urgent psychiatric services. It allows patients to be seen in the most appropriate setting by the most appropriate health professional. It o ffers an alternative to medical emergency rooms for those patients not requiring emergent/urg ent evaluation and stab ilization of physical medical conditions. The following core components will be addressed: a) Convene community stakeholders who can s upport the development of crisis stabilization services to conduct a gap analysis of the cu rrent community crisis system and develop a specific action plan that identifi es specific crisis stabilization services to address identified gaps (e.g. for example, one community with hi gh rates of incarcerati on and/or ED visits for intoxicated patients may need a sobering unit while another community with high rates of hospitalizations for mild exacerbations mental illness that could be treated in community setting may need crisis residential programs). b) Analyze the current system of crisis stab ilization services available in the community including capacity of each serv ice, current utilization patter ns, eligibility criteria and discharge criteria for each service. c) Assess the behavioral health n eeds of patients cu rrently receiving crisis services in the jails, EDs, or psychiatric hospitals. Determine the t ypes and volume of services needed to resolve crises in community based settings. Then conduct a gap analysis that will result in a datadriven plan to deve lop specific community based crisis stabilizatio n alternatives that will meet the behavioral health needs of the patien ts (e.g. a minor emergency stabilization site for first responders to utilize as an alternative to costly and time consuming Emergency Department settings) d) Explore potential crisis alternative servic e models and determine acceptable and feasible models for implementation. e) Review the intervention(s) impact on access to and quality of behavioral health crisis stabilization services and identi fy \"lessons learned,\" opportunities to scale all or part of the intervention(s) to a broader pa tient population, and identify ke y challenges associated with 308 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital expansion of the intervention(s), incl uding special considerations for safety net populations Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): IT9.2 ED appropriate utilization (Standalone measure) Reduce Emergency Department visits for target conditions o Behavioral Hea lth/Substance Abuse A literature review of high utilizers of emerge ncy room services for psychiatric services indicates that frequent users typi cally have clinical conditions such as alcohol or drug use. In addition, significant social barriers such as housing, lack of health insurance, poor social support and lack of trans portation were identif ied. This project serves to evaluate patients in psychiatric crisis and to stabilize the crisis w ithin a psychiatric emergency service in order to avoid clogging hospital medical em ergency departments, to dive rt to crisis stabilization services outside of a hospital decreasing the length of stay in University Hospital's ER. The American Psychiatric Association's Task Force on Psychiatric Emergency Services (PES) and its publication Report and Recommendations Regarding Psychiatric Emergency and Crisis Services: A Review and Model Program Descriptions (2002), asserts that \"many psychiatric crises are a function of a transient mental state that occurs in the setting of a personality disorder or substa nce abuse episode.\" Serial obs ervations over a 24-hour period are critical to assess whether or not the crisis resolves thereby avoidi ng unnecessary inpatient admissions. A psychiatric emergency service affords such observation and evaluation by a trained staff. Multiple studies (Breslow et al: Crisis Hospitalization in a Psychiatric Emergency Service. The Growth and Specialization of Emergency Psychiatry , Ed. M Allen, 1995. Ianzito et al: Overnight Admission for Psychiatry Emergencies. Hospital and Community Psychiatry , 1978. The Psychiatric Emergency Service Holding Area: Effect on Utilization of Inpatient Resources. American Journal of Psychiatry , 1989. Kane et al: Implementing an Extended Crisis Evaluation Un it in the Emergency Department in Response to New Jersey Screening Law. Journal of Emergency Nursing , 1993.) lend support to the psychiatric emergency service (PES) as an evid ence-based setting, particularly when 23-hour observation is part of the evaluation and treatm ent modalities. A PES takes advantage of the rapid resolution of many crises and can limit the need for predictably short inpatient admissions for those who might be misdiagnosed. This evidence provides support for why we feel that that project proposed will produce the outcomes targeted through the project. The outcomes targeted in this project are a prio rity for the regional health partnership due to the potential impact on effective operations of emergency departments in the community for the benefit of all populations served ther e, including low-income populations. These outcomes also improve health delivery both fo r those patients with medical, non-behavioral health diagnoses and those patients with be havioral health diagnoses as both patient populations are treated in a setti ng appropriate to their condition. Relationship to other Projects: The two projects for RHP 6 that relate to this project applying to the same population and geography are: 136141205.2.1 2.12.1 Develop, implement, and evaluate standardized clinical 309 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital protocols and evidence-based care deliv ery model to improve care transitions.

With increased timely access to outpatient services, particularly post hospital discharge, use of hospital-based emergency and inpatient services is reduced. (University Health System) 1.13.2 Crisis Intervention Unit and Intens ive Outpatient Program Development (Development of Behavioral Health Crisis Stabilization Services as Alternatives to Hospitalization). Access to these services may also mitigate unnecessary emergency room evaluations. (University Health System) Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Camino Real Community Services proposes the de velopment of a behavioral health crisis stabilization service with a ta rget population outside of Bexa r County; however, sharing of experiences could serve to support a learni ng collaborative focused on this type of intervention to share ideas, lessons learne d, and implementation st rategies, successes and barriers. Plan for Learning Collaborative: This project is proposed through the same performi ng provider that serves as the anchor of the RHP6. Thus we are very invested in deve loping and supporting lear ning collaboratives. Camino Real Community Services is proposing a similar project, thus creating a natural learning collaborative opportunity between our two organizations. In addition, the Bexar County Commissioners Court Mental Health Cons ortium identified that the unavailability of crisis services is a gap in Bexar County. Th erefore, the Consortium offers an already identified group of stakeholders who would be w illing to participate in the sharing and testing of new ideas and solutions with regard to implementation and sustainability. Project Valuation: This project achieves the Waiver goals by a) impr oving the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsur ed residents of the county; b) further developing and maintaining a coordinated care delivery system; c) contributing to patients' receiving high- quality, patient-centered care in th e most cost-effective way; and serving as a powerful tool to help providers improve outcomes and reduce ED utilization (containi ng cost growth). This project addresses community needs by impr oving access to care for persons with mental illness in crisis and who need immediate acces s to medical and psychiatric evaluation and subsequent stabilization in a setting outside of inpatient hospital se tting when appropriate This project is based on a 16 bed psychiatri c emergency service (PES). The project is designed to provide services to individual's age 18 years a nd above with <24 hour LOS. Populations served will include individuals with mental h ealth and/or substance abuse diagnosis. The model is based on expanding me ntal health resource s in our community. Operating assumptions include a sta ffing model similar to the following: 310 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital PES (for 16 bed capacity): RN 2 per shift 24/7 = 9 FTE MHT 2 per shift 24/7 = 9 FTE Social Worker = 1.5 FTE MD (psychiatrist): Monday - Sunday 16 hours per day = 2.8 FTE MD Psychiatric Medical Dir ector Admin Time = 0.2 FTE (NOTE : If PES is not co-located with CIU, and is free-standing, then 24/7 MD coverage is needed for restraint orders = 4.7 FTE) NP: 1 FTE 24/7 + 1 additional NP during hours MN-8am Monday - Sunday = 6 FTE's NOTE: NP + MD coverage provi des for 2 providers 24/7 Unit Secretary 1 per shift 24/7 = 4.5 FTE Nurse Manager = 1 FTE Volume assumptions were projected based on historical data for peak hours between 10 am-11 pm which captures 75% of the patients evaluated in UHS emergency department annually. Supplies (pharmaceuticals, meals, linens, et c) estimated to be $36-$46 per patient day Leased space estimated at between $1,000,000 and $1,600,000 per year Insurance estimated to be $5,000 to $15,000 per year PES Volume Calculation 6,886 cases in the community/6 months (Hinchman Study) of which 50% are discharged without admission 6,886 cases X 18 hours (average LOS in PE S 2011) =123,948 total hours for 6 months or 247,896 hours annualized Estimate that we would attract half of the cases in the city, thus 123,948 hours annualized for patients that would arrive at this unit. Based on a 24 hour service in the unit and an 18 hour average length of stay our estimated average daily census is 14 patient s (assuming efficient turn-over of beds) 311 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital 136141205.1.9 PASS 3 1.13.1 A-E 1.13.1 Develop and implement cris is stabilization services to address the identified gaps in the current community crisis system Psychiatric Emergency Services (PES) University Hospital TPI - 136141205 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 136141205.3.26 IT-9.2 ED appropr iate utilization (Standalone measure) (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 P-1.

It serves as the primary teaching hospital for the University of Texas Health Science Ce nter San Antonio, and the lead Level I Trauma Center and safety net provider for the estimat ed 2 million residents of Bexar County and South Texas. Over the past two decades University Health System has expanded access to primary, specialty and preventive health care services, and currently operates 19 health centers and clinics throughout Bexar County. Intervention(s) : Creation of a crisis intervention unit that can provide care in a safe environment for those patients who do not require acute ca re admissions. By providing them with case management service in the least restrictive envi ronment acute inpatient beds are preserved for more appropriate admissions. This will increas e emergency room through-put for medical as well as mental health patients. By expanding access and providing clinic al consultation, patients will be evaluated and dispositioned in a timely manner. Need for the project : A gap analysis conducted in 2011 by a joint task force between University Health System (UHS), Methodist Healthcare Mi nistries (MHM), The Center for Health Care Services (CHCS), The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio Department of Psychiatry and Methodist HealthCare System of San Antonio (MHS) identified gaps in the current crisis system & community that are resu lting in emergency rooms being inundated with psychiatric patients. In 2011, University Hospital 's Psychiatric Emergency Services evaluated 3,127 patients, and of those, 1,332 (42.6%) were rele ased home. As indicated in the RHP 6 Community Needs Assessment this project m eets the regional goal to increase access to outpatient care for adults with moderate acuity behavioral health needs in order to mitigate readmissions for acute care services and the inappropriate use of em ergency departments. Target population : Per the 2009 Hinchman study, 3346 indigent i npatients with psychiatric diagnoses were treated in the community for that calendar year. UHS anticipates diverting 25% of those from inpatient stay s through this project. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : This project will assure that the right care is being provided in the right setting (OD-9.3.1) and will serve patients through: Offering crisis stabilizati on services outside of the ED and inpatient settings We intend to positively impact the current year population equivalent of the 3,346 indigent populations present in the community during 200 9 through offering a crisis intervention unit service that doesn't exist in the community t oday. Through this service delivery vehicle, in concert with the community-based psychiatric emer gency service, we intend to materially reduce visits to the traditional emergency department a nd then to materially reduce readmissions to the 314 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital hospital after inpatient admissions . We will quantify this opport unity in an updated estimate of CIU visits in the community. Category 3 outcomes: 3.IT-3.8: Behavioral Health/Substa nce Abuse 30 day readmission rate DY 4: Reduction of readmission rate by TBD for the target population DY 5: Reduction of readmission rate by TBD for the target population Project Description: A gap analysis conducted in 2011 by a joint task force between University Health System (UHS), Methodist Healthcare Mini stries (MHM), The Center for Health Care Services (CHCS), The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio Depart ment of Psychiatry (UTHSCSA) and Methodist HealthCare System of San Antonio (MHS) identified gaps in our current mental health crisis stabilization syst em which result in hospital emergency rooms being inundated with psychiatric patients. The primary gaps identified included the lack of adequate outpatient services, the lack of adequate numbers of psychiatrist s providing psychiatric inpatient care, and insufficient inpatient beds for the co mmunity (both in community hospitals and state hospitals). The recommendations made were for de veloping a unit to provid e crisis stabilization, expansion of outpatient services , creation of an intensive outpatient treatment program, and creation of a discharge clinic. Th is project addresses one of these areas (crisis stabilization). In 2011, University Hospital's Psychiatric Emergenc y Services evaluated 3,127 patients, and of those, 1,332 (42.6%) were released home. This latter group represents patients who might have been more appropriately evalua ted in an alternative setting to the emergency room. Other communities have created units providing crisis stabilization for those patients who do not require the more expensive and le ss desirable setting of an emergency room or inpatient hospital admission for resolving crises. In addition, movi ng patients out of the hospital-based emergency room setting when such level of care is not needed diminishes overcrowding and provides more timely evaluation of those who DO requi re a hospital-based level of care. This project is designed to address the needs of adult (> 18 years of age) psychiatric patients in Bexar County emergency departments by expandi ng access to alternative behavioral health treatment settings. This project will assure that the right care is being provided in the right setting (OD-9.3.1) and includes the following components: Increase access to an underserved patient population by hiring addi tional psychiatrists, psychiatric nurse practitioners and other support staff to pr ovide evaluations emergently with subsequent short term stabilization Treat both voluntary and invol untary patients in the safest and most appr opriate setting by creating a Crisis Intervention Unit (CIU) Anticipated challenges include recruitment of psychiatrists and mi d-level psychiatric practitioners and financial sustainability . From a financial perspective this project addresses the underserved needs of indigent be havioral health patients in th e San Antonio community. The lack of treatment resources for the indigent me ntal health patient is a community problem and the burden of providing care shou ld not be the responsibility of any one health system. Developing funding streams which distribute th e financial burden among other healthcare 315 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital systems in the San Antonio are essential to maintaining this service in the future. Another challenge is the ability to recruit psychiatrists to our community since that specialty is under-represented already. Thus we anticip ate using a staff model of some employed psychiatrists and mid-level providers, suppl emented by contracted hourly providers, and contracted providers availa ble through telemedicine. As indicated in the RHP 6 Community Needs Asse ssment this project meets the regional goal to increase access to outpatient care for adults with moderate acuity behavioral health needs in order to mitigate readmissions for acute care se rvices and the inappropriate use of emergency departments. By the end of DY5, an increase in crisis stabil ization services will be provided to patients currently not receiving such services. There is currently no crisis stabilization service in Bexar County for indigent patients. Starting Point/Baseline: A baseline does not exist for this project as a cr isis intervention unit for indigent patients does not exist in the community today. We anticipate that once the Crisis Intervention Un it is opened and community education to EMS, healthcare systems, and law enforcement is comp leted, the volume of services will increase fairly quickly. We plan to compile baseline demographic data for the first six months in reporting systems to be built with the development of this new service. Data collected should include the following: Number of patient visits Number of unduplicated patients evaluated Number of unduplicated patients admitted to University Hospital's inpatient psychiatry unit Number of patients re-admitted within 30 days of discharge from University's inpatient psychiatry unit to any University Hospital inpatient unit Identification of frequent uti lizers of inpatient services w ho have primary or secondary behavioral health diagnoses Payer mix Length of stay Average daily census Disposition at release Quality indicators Rationale: The Mental Health Care Services Project conducted by Methodist He althcare Ministries in July, 2010 indentified a psychiatric shortage in San Antonio. Based on projected population growth and the national ratio of 13.9 psychiatrist/100,00 0 population, San Antonio currently needs 49 additional psychiatrists. In a ddition, psychiatrists are trending toward working in outpatient settings rather than in hospital inpatient units. Given both of these factor s, local health systems have challenges providing 24/7 acute stabiliz ation services. Development of a Crisis Intervention Unit accessible to the communit y, would allow for more efficient use of psychiatrists and psychiatri c nurse practitioners. 316 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital In 2011, University Hospital had 987 total admissions (unduplicated) to the inpatient psychiatric unit. Of those, 172 (unduplicated) were readmitte d to any service within 30 days (17%). By creating an alternative to inpatient admission for those appropri ate but needing crisis intervention beyond the evaluation and stabilization provided within an emergency room, the inpatient readmission rate should decrease ps ychiatric services outside of th e hospital will facilitate care for psychiatric patients in the most appropriate treatment setting. This project model is based on adding to and ex panding existing mental health resources and not in lieu of existing mental health services and programs in our community. Less than 33% of the state's 48,700 practicing physicians accept Medicaid patients. That, along with the mental health provider shortage, leads to increasing the inappr opriate use of emergency rooms and criminal justice systems. (RHP pg. 14) This project is responsive to Community Need #4 (CN4) - Address the s hortage of high quality integrated mental and behavioral health services in the community. This is a new initiative for our Health System as the service doesn't exist now. The following core components will be addressed: a) Convene community stakeholders who can s upport the development of crisis stabilization services to conduct a gap analysis of the current community crisis system and develop a specific action plan that identifies specific crisis stabilization services to address identified gaps (e.g., one community with high rates of incarceration and/or ED visits for intoxicated patients may need a sobering unit while another community with high rates of hospitalizations for mild exacerbations mental illness that could be treated in community setting may need crisis residential programs). b) Analyze the current system of crisis stab ilization services available in the community including capacity of eac h service, current utilization patterns , eligibility criteria and discharge criteria for each service. c) Assess the behavioral health n eeds of patients cu rrently receiving crisis services in the jails, EDs, or psychiatric hospitals. Determine the t ypes and volume of services needed to resolve crises in community based settings. Then conduct a gap anal ysis that will result in a data driven plan to develop specific community based crisis stabilization alte rnatives that will meet the behavioral health need s of the patients (e.g., a minor emer gency stabilization site for first responders to utilize as an alternative to co stly and time consuming Emergency Department settings) d) Explore potential crisis alternative servic e models and determine acceptable and feasible models for implementation. e) Review the intervention(s) impact on access to and quality of behavioral health crisis stabilization services and identi fy \"lessons learned,\" opportunities to scale all or part of the intervention(s) to a broader pa tient population, and identify ke y challenges associated with expansion of the intervention(s), incl uding special considerations for safety net populations 317 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): IT-3.8 Behavioral Health/Substance Abuse 30 day readmission rate a. Numerator: The number of readmissions, for pa tients 18 years and older, for any cause, within 30 days of discharge from the inde x behavioral health and substance abuse admissions is indicated as either the prim ary or secondary diagnosis. If an index admission has more than 1 readmission, only the first is counted as a readmission. b. Denominator: The number of admissions, fo r patients 18 years and older, for patients discharged from the hospital with a princi pal or secondary diagnosis of behavioral health and substance abuse and with a comple te claims history for the 12 months prior to admission. According to a 2009 American Hospital Associa tion report approximately 18% of Medicare patients are readmitted within 30 days costing th e Medicare program approximately $15 billion a year. Legislators and regulators at all levels of government ar e exploring options for increasing quality and reducing health care costs. While not all readmissions are avoidable, understanding what is causing them and the development of stra tegies to reduce them should be implemented. A literature review of high utilizers of emergenc y room services for behavioral health related issues indicates that freq uent users typically have clinical conditions such as alcohol or drug use. In addition, significant social barriers such as housing, lack of health insurance, poor social support and lack of trans portation have been identif ied. One of the components of this project is the creation of a Crisis Intervention Unit that ca n provide care in a safe environment for those patients who do not require acute care admissions . By providing these services in the least restrictive environment acute inpatient beds ar e preserved for more appropriate admissions.

(University of Texas Health Science Center) 1.13.2 Development of Psychiatric Emergency Services (University Health System). Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Camino Real Community Services proposes the de velopment of a behavioral health crisis stabilization service with a target population outside of Bexar County (121990904.1.1, 1.13); however, sharing of experiences could serve to support a learning collaborative focused on this type of intervention to share ideas, lessons le arned, and implementation strategies, successes and barriers. Plan for Learning Collaborative: This project is proposed through the same performi ng provider that serves as the anchor of the RHP6. Thus we are very invested in devel oping and supporting learning collaboratives. Camino Real Community Services is proposing a similar project, t hus creating a natural learning collaborative opportunity between our two or ganizations. In addi tion, the Bexar County Commissioners Court Mental Health Consortium id entified that the unavailability of crisis services is a gap in Bexar Count y and thus offers an already identified group of stakeholders who would be willing to participate in the sharing and testing of new ideas and solutions with regard to implementation and sustainability. Project Valuation: This project achieves the Waiver goals by a) impr oving the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of the county; b) fu rther developing and maintaining a coordinate care delivery system; c) contributin g to patients' receivi the most cost-effective way; a nd serving as a powerful tool to help providers improve outcomes and reduce ED utilizat ion (containing cost growth). The project addresses community needs by impr oving access to care for patients in a mental health crisis who can be stabilized outs ide of an inpatient hospital setting. This project is based on a 20 bed crisis interv ention unit (CIU). The project is designed to provide services to individual's age 18 year s and above. Populations served will include individuals with mental health and/or substance abuse diagno sis. The model is based on expanding current mental health resources in our community. 319 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital 136141205.1.10 PASS 3 1.13.1 A-E 1.13.1 Develop and implement cri sis stabilization services to address the identified gaps in the current community crisis system: Crisis Intervention Unit (CIU) University Hospital TPI - 136141205 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 136141205.3.27 3.IT-3.8 Behavioral Health/Substa nce Abuse 30 day readmission rate Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 P-1.

It serves as the primary teaching hospital for the University of Texas Health Science Ce nter San Antonio, and the lead Level I Trauma Center and safety net provider for the estimat ed 2 million residents of Bexar County and South Texas. Over the past two decades University Health System has expanded access to primary, specialty and preventive health care services, and currently operates 19 health centers and clinics throughout Bexar County. Intervention(s) : Establish an affiliated/integrated dental health services program that incorporates patient navigation within the medical home model of care by partnering w ith Federally Qualified Health Centers. These efforts will result in timely, accessible, integrated, and patient-centered preventive dental health care services for ec onomically underserved populations with diabetes residing in Bexar County, Texas. Need for the project : Oral diseases ranging fr om dental caries (cavities) to oral cancers cause pain and disability for millions of American s (Healthy People 2020). Studies link oral health, particularly periodontal (gum) diseas e, to several chronic diseases that include diabetes and heart disease. Such conditions may be prevented in part with regular preventive visits to the dentist. Economically vulnerable populations that include minority adults, pe rsons with a chronic disease are also significantly less likely to have access to oral health care compared to their non-poor and non-minority peers. For example, a recent survey conducted on leading oral health indicators found that less than half (44.5%) of eligible individuals have had a dental visit within in the past 12 months.(Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, Agency for Hea lthcare Research and Quality, 2007). In Bexar County, Texas, 22% of the 1.7 million re sidents live at or below the poverty level ($22,557), 17% receive no medical care due to cost, and 21% have no form of health insurance coverage. Recent health assessments of the popula tion find that residents with less than a high school education and an annual household inco me of less than $15,000 are significantly less likely to rate their oral health status as good to excellent (25% and 20%, respectively). In addition, Hispanics and African-Americans and indi viduals living in the Southeast and Southern regions of the county were less li kely to rate their oral health status good to excellent or report having adequate dental health coverage (B exar County Health Collaborative, 2010). Target population : Our target population will be Carelink en rollees diagnosed with diabetes that seek services at UHS including patient centered medical homes a nd or who receive services at our FQHC partner sites. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : This project seeks to provide the following components: 323 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Reduce/close disparities in acce ss to preventive dental health services in underserved populations Increase awareness among the target populat ion on the importance of oral health to overall health and well-being Category 3 outcomes: IT7.8 Chronic Disease Patients Accessing Dental Services: Percentage of patients with chronic disease condit ions accessing dental services ( Standalone measure ) DY4: Improvement Target: Increase in chronic disease patients who access dental health services TBD% from baseline DY5: Improvement Target: Increase in chronic disease patients who access dental health services TBD% from baseline Project Description: In the United States, safety-net hospitals remain essential to providing ac cess to health services for over 50 million uninsured Americans as well as other underserved populations. The passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 marked an important legislative commitment to addressing rising health care costs and improving access to qual ity healthcare for all Am ericans. To ensure implementation of healthcare reform, safety-net ho spitals will remain critical to responding to the mandate of providing preventive health care services to economically vulnerable populations within a model of healthcare delivery that is accessible, integrated, and patient-centered. University Health System (UHS) proposes to partne r with local safety net providers that include Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) to establish timely, accessible, integrated, and patient-centered preventive dental health care services for economically vulnerable populations residing in Bexar County, Texas. This project will increase and expand access to preventive oral health care within the UHS medical home model of care by coll aborating with FQHCs alongside pa tient navigation to ensure that patients adhere to their r ecommended dental treatment plan. This collaboration will result in th e establishment of dental health services at the Texas Diabetes Institute, which is one the nation's largest and mo st comprehensive centers, entirely dedicated to diabetes prevention, treatmen t, education and research. In an effort to strengthen delivery of patient-cen tered care for persons with diabetes, delivery of preventive dental health serv ices will be made possible by ha ving a patient navigator work closely with board-certified e ndocrinologists and or their prim ary care provider and related diabetes specialists to ensure timely receipt of this service. These services will compliment in what is considered to be a firm ly robust clinical treatment and pr evention model of diabetes care that includes: family physicians, endocrinol ogists, renal specialists, orthopaedists, ophthalmologists, dermatologists, pod iatrists, and wound care specialists. Expansion of preventive dental health servic es will also occur thr ough development of an additional two (2) sites at FQHC partner locations. A patient navigation model will also be incorporated within this preven tive dental health care delivery design to ensure that patients adhere to receive care in a timely manner. 324 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital The primary patient population includes individu als diagnosed with diabetes and enrolled in CareLink; a financial assistan ce program for uninsured resident s of Bexar County. The program was created in 1997 to help address the needs of Bexar County resident s without health care coverage who were not eligible for Medicaid or other public or private funding. While CareLink is not an insurance product per se, it has many similar advantages in terms of promoting access to preventive health services, encouraging a long lasting relationshi p with a primary care provider, and instilling a sense of shared responsibility between member and staff for the member's health. As of December 31, 2011, ther e were 54,256 members enrolled in CareLink. Community Medicine Associates (the UHS ow ned provider group) is the primary care access point for University Health System patients, and th ere is currently a need for establishing clinical linkages that reduce disparities in oral health care by expa nding dental health services infrastructure that currently reside within partner safety net providers (FQHCs). This will primarily occur by establishing a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to expand timely access to preventive dental health services and estab lish a dental health serv ice referral process. Goals and Relationship to Regional Goals Project goals are to strengthen the health care infrastructure of the region by enhancing access to preventative oral health services and thereby ad dressing the regional goal s of reducing gaps in access to care. Further, project goals will strongly coincide with regional goals as followed: improve health care infrastructure to better se rve both Medicaid and unins ured residents of RHP 6, reduce healthcare disparities, further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system, and improve outcomes while containing cost growth. Specific Project Goals: Reduce/close disparities in acce ss to preventive dental health services in underserved populations with diabetes Increase awareness among the target populat ion on the importance and relationship of oral health to overall health and well-being Challenges Challenges to this project will be the integrat ion and coordination of preventive oral health services between University Health System a nd partner safety net pr oviders (FQHCs) to (1) ensure timely receipt of care by pa tients, (2) ensure appropriate infrastructure (electronic medical record systems), (3) the coordination and capac ity (providers, hours of operation and clinical space) to appropriately accomm odate increased volume from newly established referral pathways, including CareLink. In an effort to pr oactively address these challenges strategic planning and assessment will be undertaken that includes meeting with key stakeholders to ensure that a balance is maintained between re sources, capacity and projected demand. This is considered essential to provi ding care at the right time and in the right setting. 5-Year Expected Outcome for Provider and Patient University Health System expects to see impr ovements in clinical li nkages (integration and coordination of health services), well establis hed referral pathways (p rimary care to dental provider) and an established infrastructure deliv ery of oral health serv ices between UHS, FQHCs and the target population. The anticipated 5 year goal is to incr ease the proportion of 325 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital economically vulnerable individual s with diabetes that access quali ty dental health services following a referral from a prim ary care/medical provider. Starting Point/Baseline: Currently, an affiliated/integrated dental health services program with partner FQHCs does not exist for patients at University Health System. Th erefore, the baseline for number of participants as well as the number of partic ipating dental providers ending on September 30, 2013 is zero (0). Rationale: The National Institute of Medici ne's Committee on Access to Oral Health Services finds that almost half of all Americans do not a visit a dentis t each year and nearly one-third lack access to basic preventive and primary oral health care serv ices. Published studies on disparities in access to oral health care also find that individuals who are least likely to access preventive oral health care are more likely to have higher rates of oral disease. In particular , economically vulnerable populations, including minority children, are signifi cantly less likely to have access to oral health care compared to their more affluent and non-minor ity peers. Disparities in access to preventive and primary oral health care are primarily asso ciated with factors such as education level, income, race and ethnicity, the high costs of car e, and the uneven geographic distribution of dental providers (Committee on Oral Health Ac cess to Services; Instit ute of Medicine and National Research Council, Ju ly 2011; Healthy People 2020). The Patient Protection and Afford able Care Act (ACA) aims to expand delivery of preventive care to large segments of the population through expansion of healthcar e coverage and cost- reduction measures that will make access to preventive oral health more accessible and affordable. Expansion of preventive care through ACA also coincides with national oral health goals for Americans that include: increasing awarene ss of the importance of or al health to overall health and well-being, increasing acceptance and adoption of eff ective preventive interventions, and reducing disparities in access to effective preventive and dent al health services (Healthy People 2020). In Bexar County, Texas, 22% of the 1.7 million re sidents live at or below the poverty level ($22,557), 17% receive no medical care due to cost, and 21% have no form of health insurance coverage. Recent health assessments of the popula tion find that residents with less than a high school education and an annual household inco me of less than $15,000 are significantly less likely to rate their oral health status as good to excellent (25% and 20%, respectively). In addition, Hispanics and African-Americans and indi viduals living in the Southeast and Southern regions of the county were less li kely to rate their oral health status good to excellent or report having adequate dental health coverage (B exar County Health Collaborative, 2010). Demand in access to timely preventive and primar y oral health care in the population will be driven by demographic changes with respect to race/ethnicity, educationa l attainment, and age. The Bexar County population is relatively young (med ian age of 32 years) in comparison to the national average (median age of 37 years) and is considered a minority-majority county; 59% of county residents are Hispanic, of which 80% are of Mexican descen t. It is projected that the Hispanic population in this area will grow by 45% by the year 2040 (Office of the State 326 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Demographer, 2012, U.S. Census Bureau, 2012). This project directly addresses: CN. 1 - Improve quality of healthcare delivery and patient experience CN.3 - Address the lack of medica l and dental health services in the community due to lack of health insurance and provider shortages The current health service infrastructure does not fully allow for timely access to preventive oral health services. This newly proposed initiative w ill invest in the expans ion and enhancement of infrastructure to provide quality preventive oral health care access to th e underserved of Bexar county. Proposed efforts are considered a new health system initiative that will seek to leverage existing resources with FQHCs part ners to increase, expand, and e nhance clinical capacity that reduce gaps in access to dental hea lth services and help to improve the health status of residents of Bexar County, Texas. Continuous quality improvement strategies will include assessing our cl inical workflow to reduce wait times, assure timely scheduling of appointments, provide data systems to support population health management, establish effec tive navigation coordina tion, and support patient self-care, development, and accountability, and develop performance reporting and improvement plans using LEAN concepts to identify and reduce waste.

In particular , economically vulnerable populations that include minority adults and childr en are significantly less likely to have access to oral health care compared to their non-poor and non-minority peers. Studies on adherence to preventive oral health services fi nd that patients are more likely to seek dental services when the importance of need is documented by a formal referral being made. Relationship to other Projects: No other projects proposed by University Health System currently. Relationship to Other Perf orming Providers' Projects in the RHP: This Project is Related to the Followin g Other Performing Providers' Projects: 327 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital 085144601.1.12 - Increase, Expand, and Enhance Dental Services (UTHSCSA): Establish an emergency dental clinic for trea ting patients presenting with urge nt dental conditions, including oral infections, abscesses, pain and fractured dental restorations. 0913089-02.1.1 - San Antonio Metropolitan Health District: Expand Community-Based prevention programs that provide access to early diagnosis, fluoride varnish and dental sealants to serve additional children with unmet dental needs. Plan for Learning Collaborative: This project fully lends itself to participation in an RHP-wide learning collaborative with other Performing Providers in RHP6 to develop or enhance preventive oral health/dental health services in other parts of the region for sim ilar patient populations. Processes and techniques developed and implemented during this project will be documented by the project team. Successes as well as lessons learned will be shar ed with regional collaborators who are also working to improve dental care access. Project Valuation: Project valuation for enhancing access to preventative oral health/dental health services directly responds to waiver goals includi ng the triple aim and improving the health delivery infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured resi dents of the community and region. This includes providing care in the right setti ng at the right time and enhanci ng the ability to prevent and/or treat disease earlier in the course of illness, both of which may cont ribute to avoidance of unnecessary admissions. The project also addresses community need by re sponding to gaps in delivery of basic medical and dental services due a high percentage of the population being uninsured and limited access to providers. Additionally, pertaining to oral he alth, studies have found that certa in chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity and stro ke, are associated with dental disease after controlling for common risk factors (Griffin et al., 2009). Therefore, providing timely access to vulnerable/undeserved populations in a coordinated and integrated method can improve health status, experience, and overal l quality of care delivered. The project is considered large in scope as it looks to increase outreach to the targeted population and thereby increase the number of patients who receive needed pr eventive oral health care, thus reducing cost and avoida ble hospitalizations. Relative to other projects, the proposed efforts ar e large in scale and will require investment in human resources, technology, and organizational priorities that strengt hen the opportunity to deliver integrated and accessible care to the targ et population. 328 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital 136141205.1.11 PASS 3 1.8.6 N/A 1.8.6 Increase and expand oral health services University Hospital TPI - 136141205 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 136141205.3.28 3.IT-7.8 Chronic Disease Patien ts Accessing Dental Services 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 (P-X): Conduct assessment that incorporates community needs, review of best practice and strategies to ensure that intervention is tailored to local context.

Intervention(s) : This project will increase primary car e capacity while decreasing potentially preventable readmissions by recruiting new prim ary care physicians a nd by training community health workers. Need for the project : Currently there only 9 primary care phys icians serving our 5 county service region. 32% of residents within these counties are uninsured. Our current primary care provider shortage combined with our hi gh percentage of uninsured has caused our ED volume to steadily increase. This problem is exacerbated by 30 da y readmissions and ED \"frequent flyers\". Target population : The target population includes: ED patients with non-emergent conditions, patients discharged with a high risk for readmi ssion, patients without a primary care provider, and patients in need of enhanced follow-up post discharge. Our hospital operates with a Medicaid inpatient utilization rate higher than 50% and a low income utilization rate also higher than 50%. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project seeks to recruit at least 4 new primary care providers to our service region. At the end of DY 4, the combin ed patient panels of primary care providers recruited in DY 2, 3 and 4 is expected to at least total 2,600 pati ents. This should result in between 5,200 and 7,800 combined patient visits . With the conclusion of DY 5, the combined patient panels of new primary car e providers is expected to at least total 4,600 patients. This should result in between 9,200 and 13,800 combined pa tient visits. Also, the project aims to train 8 new community health workers (CHWs) by the end of DY 5. In DY 4 and DY 5, CHWs trained and selected for empl oyment at UMH will ensure that 100 (DY 4) and 150 (DY 5) additional patients receive care under the Chronic Care Model for targeted chronic diseases or for MCC. The will achieve this by working alongside and communicating with RNs, case managers and physicians. These CHWs will enha nce the continuum of care while assisting primary care providers and case managers to redu ce preventable readmissions and ED visits for target conditions. Category 3 outcomes: IT-9.2 Our goal is to reduce ED visits for target conditions (CHF, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Dis ease/Hypertension, and Chronic Ob structive Pulmonary Disease). Percent reduction TBD in DY 3. IT-3.1 Our goal is to reduce the all cause 30- day readmission rate. Per cent reduction TBD in DY 3. 333 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Uvalde Memorial Hospital Project Description: Uvalde Memorial Hospital proposes to improve access to primary care within our rural service region through expanding capacity and a co mmunity health worker training program. The need for additional primary care prov iders, who serve our low income border county population (70% Hispanic), has never been more pressing. Most, if not al l of the local PCPs within our 5 county service region, are not accepti ng new patients. This has resulted in a high volume of patients who rely on the UMH emer gency department for primary care. A high volume of patients with non-emergent conditions strains Emergency Department (ED) staff and physicians whose primary role is caring for acute, emergency conditi ons. In addition, many patients without a primary care physician delay tr eatment until their health has deteriorated substantially. When the appropriate level of care is matc hed to the appropriate se tting, high quality health care is more likely to occur. An emergency room is not the appropriate setting within which to treat patients in need of primary care. Improving rural access to primary care will alleviate this burden placed on ED staff and physic ians while reducing cost to th e patient, the payer and the hospital. Most importantly, it will result in a higher quality of care for patients. UMH will improve rural access to primary care in our service area by combining two approaches. First, UMH will conduct a primary care gap analysis to determine workforce shortage areas. UMH will expand local primary care capacity by recruiting at least 4 new primary care physicians (1 per year) and/or 4 new mid-level providers (1 per year) within the identified shortage area(s). Next, UMH will begin and expand primary care training for case managers and community health workers. In DY 2, UMH will establish a community health worker (CHW) training program. At least 3 CHWs will complete the pr ogram by the end of DY 3. This program will involve training in the Chronic Care Model. In DY 3 UMH will conduct a pilot test of the case management/community health work er program within Uvalde. This pilot test will include CHW involvement in quality improvement projects. Th e CHW training program will grow in class size from DY 3 - DY 5. CHW training program assessment scores and satisfaction scores will also be tracked and improved upon in DY 4 and DY 5. Goals and Relationship to Regional Goals: The goal of this project is to use comm unity health workers (CHWs), case managers and primary care physicians/mid-levels to improve acce ss to and utilization of primary care. CHWs will be supervised by case managers and will focus on enhanced care coordination and culturally competent care to high-risk patients. Project Goals : A reduced number of patients w ho utilize the ED for primary care Patients with chronic disease(s) who are well educated with respect to managing their condition(s) and heal th appropriately A substantial decrease in the rate of potentially preventable re-admissions Greater access to and utilization of local primary care providers This project meets the following regional goals: Work together to make significant progress towards the Triple Aim goals of assuring patients receive high-quality and patient-cen tered care, in the most effective ways. Improve the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of our region. 334 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Uvalde Memorial Hospital Further develop and maintain a c oordinated care delivery system. Improve outcomes while containing cost growth. The project achieves an improved infrastruc ture for Medicaid and uninsured residents through its primary care capacity expansion in workfor ce shortage areas. The project develops and maintains a coordinated care de livery system through its CHW training program. The project improves outcomes while containing cost grow th through reducing ED admissions for target conditions and reducing all- cause 30 day readmissions. Challenges: A major challenge this project will face w ill be recruiting primary care physicians and/or mid- levels to an extensively rural service area. Ho wever with appropriate in centives and recruiting strategies, UMH believes can overcome this challenge. Additional challenges will be establishing trust between patients and CHWs; and establishing trust between primary care physicians and CHWs. Through proper communication and education regardi ng the intent of the program, UMH will overcome this challenge. 5-Year Expected Outcome for Provider and Patients: UMH plans to see improvements in 30 da y readmission rates, ED admissions and in the overall continuum of care. The service region and population will see much greater access to primary care with a focus on management of ch ronic conditions through CHW and primary care provider communication. The populati on will also be more educated on managing their health appropriately through the use of CHWs in the community. Starting Point/Baseline: Baseline for primary care capacity expans ion will be established by the primary care gap analysis conducted in DY 2. Currently there are 9 primary care physicians serving patient within the UMH 5 county service region. This ba seline will shift every year, based on the accomplishments achieved in the prior year. Base line for the community health worker training program will be established in DY 2 when the program begins. Rationale: The executive committee of UMH, as well as its governing board, took time to identify needs of our rural population and create various projects addressing these needs. \"Improving Rural Access to Primary Care\" was chosen out these proj ects. It was determined to be the most likely to have the greatest impact on th e health of our population. This project fit within the project option area 1.2.2 because it not only mentions incr easing the number of primary care providers but it also specifically mentions increasing the number of commun ity health workers/promotoras, an important piece of our project. The CHWs trained throughout the project will have close ties to the community. These CHWs will be bi-lingual and possess cultural skills needed to connect with patients in our underserved, low-income community. CHWs will be: Compassionate, sensitive, and culturally attuned to the pe ople and community Knowledgeable about the envir onment and healthcare system Connected with critical decisi on makers inside the system The primary functions of CHWs employed by the hospital, after completing the training program, will be to educate and motivate patients to: follow their discharge instructions, take their medications consistently and attend thei r appointments with physicians. They may also assist patients overcome common rural barriers su ch as: transportation, la ck of insurance, and lack of health knowledge/literacy. Under the su pervision of the case manager, the CHWs will 335 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Uvalde Memorial Hospital perform these functions in a non-threateni ng, simple manner that wins their trust. These CHWs will be assigned to high-risk patients and ED \"frequent flyers\" to reduce 30 day PPRs and ED admissions for target conditions (see Cat. 3 selected outcomes). However, these goals would be unrealis tic if primary care capacity wa s not being expanded throughout the project. Improvement milestone (I -X) was created and inserted into the project to provide needed access to primary care for rural pa tients. Currently, the primary car e capacity shortage in our community makes efforts to shift care from an acu te care mentality to prevention/chronic disease management mentality extremely difficult, if not impossible. An increased capacity combined with a line of communication between CHWs, ca se managers and primary care physicians/mid- levels will reduce ED admissions and 30 day re admissions. This project will give us the resources and training to make this shift in fo cus to prevention and chr onic disease management feasible and realistic. Unique community need identificati on numbers the project addresses: CN.1 - Texas ranks last in the nation on hea lth care quality. RHP 6 is challenged to deliver improved quality a nd patient satisfaction. CN.2 - A high prevalence of chr onic disease and rela ted health dispariti es require greater prevention efforts and improved management of patient with chronic conditions. Leading causes of death in RHP 6 include cardiova scular disease, cancer and diabetes. CN.3 - Many residents in RHP 6 lack access to medical and dental care due to high rates of uninsurance and health care provider shortages. How the project represents a new initiative or significantly enhances an existing delivery system reform initiative: Currently UMH does not have a case mana gement or a community health worker training program. Also, most if not all local primary car e physicians are not accepting new patients. This has created a high demand by patients for primar y care services. This project will reduce patients' reliance on the UMH emergency room for primary care. It will also lower potentially preventable re-admissions. As there is not curre ntly a case management program, a baseline for all cause potentially preventable re-admissions will be established in DY 2. *This initiative, and any relate d activities, is not being funded in whole or part by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-3: Potentially Preventable Re-Admi ssions - 30 day readmission rate- NQF 1789 (stand-alone) Cohort (1): admissions to acute care fac ilities for patients aged 65 years or older OD-9: Right Care, Right Setting IT-9.2 ED appropriate u tilization (stand-alone) Rate: ED admissions for target conditions (Congestive Heart Fa ilure-CHF, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Disease/Hypertension, Chr onic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease-COPD) Reasons/rationale for select ing the outcome measures: These outcome domains with their associ ated improvement targets were chosen after considering the outcomes most likely to be impact ed the most by the project. These outcomes are also a priority for RHP 6 because they direc tly related to CN.1, CN.2 and CN.3 in the RHP community needs assessment. An example given in a review of literature of CHW su ccess was found at CHRISTUS Spohn Health System in Corpus Christi, TX. As a result of their CHW pilot study, CHRISTUS 336 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Uvalde Memorial Hospital estimated a $56,000 savings to the hospital per ED assigned a CHW per year. While the UMH program \"Improving Rural Access to Primary Car e\" has substantial differences, we anticipate a similar or greater impact on ED usage and costs. Our program will reduce PPRs through case ma nagement that utilizes CHWs with an open line of communication with PC Ps. Increasing the number of PCPs alongside this case management/CHW program is vital as there is a se vere shortage of PCPs in the region currently. All 5 counties within the UMH service area ar e currently designated as primary health care professional shortage areas (HPSAs). This project will lower patient cost of care (important for a low-income population) through reducing re-admissi on rates and educate patients on the benefit of primary care over emergency department car e. CHWs will help patients overcome common local barriers to primary care: transportation, insuran ce coverage, income, cu lture and education. Relationship to other Projects: This project is related to other primary care capacity a nd primary care training projects [1.1, 1.2]. It focuses on expanding primary care capac ity while training community health workers and case managers. This project will \"improve th e health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured resident s of our region\" while \"improvi ng outcomes and containing cost growth\" both of which are RHP 6 goals.

RHP 6 is committed to transf orming health care in our region and throughout the state. Given the large number and value of projects proposed for our region, University Health System, as the RHP 6 anchor, will prom ote and facilitate learning collaboratives. UMH plans to be a significant part of a l earning collaborative with other performing providers with similar projects, as outlined above by the RHP 6 anchor, University Health System. This may include a quarterly newslett er distributed the other provide rs concerning progress towards goals and lessons learned. Meeting semi-annually or more regularly is also being considered. Project Valuation: Out of all potential DSRIP projects cons idered, UMH has chosen \"Increase the number of primary care providers and other clinicians/staff: Improving Rural Access to Primary Care\". This project received a score of 5 on a scale of 1-5 in all categories used to assess project value to the RHP and to our community. Categories included in the valuation process included: project scope, achieves waiver goals, and addresses comm unity needs and project investment. UMH also assessed projects based on cost avoidance to the pa yer, in addition to valu ing potential projects 337 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Uvalde Memorial Hospital based on these 4 areas. \"Improving Rural Acces s to Primary Care\" was high on the list of projects with the most costs avoided. A more detailed look at how UMH valued the project based on cost avoidance follows. Cost Avoidance - \"Improving Rural Access to Primary Care\" : Based on research conducted, it was estima ted that 1 primary care provider covers 1,900 lives. From this number, it was estimated that for each primary care physician added, a corresponding 20 ER visits/month decrease would occur by DY 5. Also, a reduction in the amount Medical/Surgical department admissions of 10/ month by DY 5 would occur for each PCP added. The average cost of an ER visit is $1,318 per visi t. The average cost of a Med/Surg. department admission is $5,359. The total cost avoidance by the end of DY 5 using these figures is: DY 2 $643,080 DY 3 $1,286,160 DY 4 $1,929,240 DY 5 $2,572,320 $6,430,800 + $1,611,992 (est. investment) = 8,042,792 Est. investment = cost of primary care physic ian recruitment, case ma nagement/CHW program This cost avoidance number, $6,430,800, is only cost avoided to the paye r. It does not include costs avoided by the patient. Also, this amount does not include estimated costs to be saved as a direct or indirect result of the community hea lth worker training program. Costs will be reduced further by decreasing potential pr eventable 30-day readmissions and ED utilization from this program. A valid estimate of the cost avoidance for this community health worker program has not been determined at this time. However, UMH anticipates this co st avoidance to be significant. When the cost avoidance and the project investment are totaled the potential value of the project has a variance of $277,340 from the Total DS RIP funding allocated to Cat. 1,2 projects $8,320,096. This variance however will be more than accounted for when the cost avoidance of the case management/CHW program is accounted fo r. The cost avoidance figures above assume primary care capacity expansion will occur at a ra te of 1 new physician per year. However, if capacity expansion occurs at rate greater than this, it would greatly increase the cost avoidance of the project. References 1.

It is the only hospital serving Val Verde County. The county's popula tion is approximately 50,000 with the majority of those persons living in and around Del Rio. Intervention(s) : This project aims to expand primary care resources in this medically underserved community. The hospital has a clinic affiliated with it, and the scope of the project will be to add providers in an effort to expand access to care in Val Verde County. Need for the project : A community needs assessment wa s performed, and the top priority identified was to bring more doctors to the co mmunity. There is a shortage of primary care physicians in both Del Rio and Val Verde County. The following actuarial data provided by HCAPS Community Needs Assessmen t Group earlier this year illu strates the gaps in current supply of primary care providers in the clinic's PSA/SSA versus what is needed to take care of the population: Specialty Current Supply Physician Demand Variance Family Practice 8 18.91 10.91 Internal Medicine 6 11.05 5.05 Target population : Additional care providers will benefit potentially all of the 48,643 residents of Val Verde County who require care by a doctor. Speci fically, there will be an effort to target the sicker patients, the 4,202 that were discharged from an inpatient facility in the previous year, to make sure they have appropriate outpatient care. There will also be an effort toward preventative care under the premise that if there are more provi ders and more appointme nt slots, there is a higher probability that patients wi ll seek care more routinely. Approximately 32% of the population that we se rve is uninsured. Our current payer mix for VVRMC consists of 28% Medicaid, 41% Me dicare, 20% HMO/PPO and 11% Self Pay. Considering these percentages, the percent of Me dicaid/indigent patients we anticipate to serve at the primary care clinics coul d easily range between 20-30%. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The primary benefit will be access to primary care as measured by the increases in clinic visits. In DY 3 we will recruit an additional primary care provider. We estimate our baseline of patient vi sits will increase from 4,740 visits currently to 7,145 visits by the end of DY 3, with addition of th is new provider. In DYs 4 and 5 we have set goals to increase patient visits from this new baseline by 10% a nd 20%, respectively. For both primary care physicians, we expect an average of 3 visits per patient per year. The mid- 343 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Val Verde Regional Medical Center level provider historically has aver aged 1 visit per patient per year. One key patient benefit of increasing access to and utilization of primary care services will be a decreased dependence on emergency room care by patients who are curr ently without primary care providers. There will be an effort to track th is utilization as well with this patient population. Category 3 outcomes: The measured category 3 outcome associated with this program is patient satisfaction. Currently, the clinic has no formal mechanism to measure patient experience in the clinic as it does for ER and inpatient services. Th e plan is to develop a similar, formal format to ensure that patients are pleased with the services and value the experience in an effort to enhance the full continuum of care at the hospital and its clinic. The clinic intends to benchmark its results against similar operations and set goals in the top quartile of performers, which is a mark consistent with expectations for other hospita l/clinic services. Ther e will be a phased in approach to demonstrate pr ogress toward this goal. Project Description: Establish additional primary care providers to a medically underserved area along the Rio Grande border. The intent is to add primary care providers throughout th e life of the project. The primary goal of this project is to expand primary care in Val Verde County and improve access to services so that there are more clinics available to patients and the number of patients utilizing primary care increases over time. We intend to expand preventative medicine and create an environment that residents of Val Verde County feel like they always can see the doctor, whether that is by appointment, wa lk-in or through an after-hours offering. This project will meet the following regional goals: The project will encourage working together to make significant progress towards the Triple Aim goals of assuring patients receiv e high-quality and pa tient-centered, in the most effective ways The project will improve the health care infras tructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of our region. The project will further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system. Finally the project will improve outcomes while containing cost growth. The project achieves an improved infrastructure for Medicaid and uninsured residents through increasing primary care capacity. The project will increase capacity by ex panding the number of primary care clinics. The project develops and maintains a coordinated care delivery system through the establishment of a nurse advice line. The proj ect improves outcomes while containing cost growth by providing access to pr imary care providers. Patients who now rely on the emergency room for primary care will then ha ve access to a less costly and more appropriate mode of care. The challenge and key issue which this project will address will be to reduce the dependency on the emergency room for primary care-type visi ts due to a lack of access to doctors. We will also look to develop a call-a-nurse program that will also serve as an additional clinic resource while the patient is at home. This service can aid the patient in decision-making in regards to what healthcare resources are best to utilize given each unique situation. The 344 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Val Verde Regional Medical Center community develops more confidence in knowin g that health information from a qualified professional is readily ava ilable not only in person but over the phone as well. The 5-year expected outcome is better health, better patient sati sfaction, increased utilization of primary care services and a reduced utiliza tion of the ER for th is patient population. This project that we have selected is especially important in RHP 6 as so much of the RHP is rural. In the rural heal thcare setting, especially Texas and esp ecially along the bor der, there is a short supply of healthcare resources. Del Rio and Val Verde County will be better served and healthier if there is more access to physicians. Starting Point/Baseline: Dr. Charles Rigney (Family Practice) 4,740 visits We estimate our baseline of patient visits will in crease from 4,740 visits currently to 7,145 visits by the end of DY 3, with addition of this new provider. Rationale: As evidenced in the RHP Community Needs Assessm ent, access to (or lack of) primary care is a serious issue in Texas, especially in rural pa rts of Texas. The follo wing Community Needs are specifically related to this project and we re identified locally in Del Rio as well: CN.1 Texas ranks last in the nation on health care quality. RHP 6 is challenged to deliver improved quality and patient satisfaction. CN.2 A high prevalence of chronic disease and related health disparities require greater prevention efforts and improved management of patients with chronic conditions. Leading causes of death in RH P 6 include cardiovascular di sease, cancer, and diabetes. CN.3 Many residents of RHP 6 l ack access to medical and dental care due to high rates of uninsurance and health care provider shortages. The project option (1.1.1) will be to establish more primary care clinics. Val Verde Regional Medical Center began to seriously tackle this issue in 2011. The hospital established a 501(a) for which it is the sole member for, and as a resu lt developed a recruitment vehicle for physicians and mid-levels. Prior to this organization being established it was even more challenging than it is today to recruit doctors a nd physician extenders to a rural, border community. Through this effort, primary care clinics have recently been established, and the hospital has good baseline data from which to compare its progress to in improving and increasing acce ss to care to patients in its community. The hospital has just gotten star ted recruiting providers to the area. It is the intention over the life of this project to attract add itional doctors, physician assistants and nurse practitioners to the clinics so th at number of clinics can be e xpanded as well as the number of patients seen in the clinics. By increasing access, there is a greater opportunity to practice preventative medicine and also watch as utilization of the emergency room declin es for these patients declines as well as their 345 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Val Verde Regional Medical Center readmission rate to the hospital. Process Milestone: P1. Milestone: Establish additional/expand existing/relocate primary care clinics P1.1. Metric: Number of additional c linics or expanded hours or space a. Documentation of detailed expansion plans b. Data Source: New primary care sc hedule or other Performing Provider document or other plans as de signated by Performing Provider. c. Rationale/Evidence: It is well know n the national supply of primary care does not meet the demand for primary care services. Moreover, it is a goal of health care improvement to provide more preventive and primary care in order to keep indi viduals and families healthy and therefore avoid more costly ER and inpatient care. RHPs are in real need of expanding primary care capacity in order to be able to implement the kind of delivery system reforms needed to provide the right care at the right time in th e right setting for all patients. Process Milestone: P7. Milestone: Establish a nurse advice line an d/or primary care patie nt appointment unit. P7.1. Metric: Documentation of nurse advi ce line and/or primary care patient appointment unit. a. Data Source: Documentation of advice line and appointment unit implementation, operating hours and tria ge policies. Advise line system logs, triage algorithms and appoi ntment unit operations/ policies. b. Rationale: In many cases patients are unaware of the appropriate location and timing to seek care fo r urgent and chronic conditions. Implementation of a nurse advice line a llows for primary care to be the first point of contact and offer c linical guidance around how to mitigate symptoms, enhance patient knowledge about certain conditions and seek timely care services. Process Milestone P-5 Train/hire additional primary care providers and staff and/or increase the number of primary care clinics for existing providers Metric 1: 5.1 Documentation of increased numbe r of providers and sta ff and/or clinic sites Data Source: Documentation of completion of all items described by the RHP plan for this measure.

Milestone: Increase the number of patients served and questions addressed on the nurse advice line and patient scheduling unit. Demonstr ate improvement over prior reporting period. I-14.1 Metric: Number of patient served by th e nurse advice line. Demonstrate improvement over baseline rates. a. Numerator: number of unique records created from calls received to the nurse advice line. b. Denominator: total number of calls placed to th e nurse advice line (distinct from number of calls answered) c. Data Source: Automated data from call center d. Rationale/Evidence: This measure will indicate how many calls are addressed successfully as well as an overall call abandonment rate. Abandonm ent rate is the percentage of calls coming into a telephone system that are terminated by the person originating the call before being answered by a staff person. It is related to the management of emergency calls. This metric speaks to the capacity of the nurse advice line. One of the key quality improvement efforts will be with all new patients established with new providers will be to track and measure physician and hospital utilization before and after access and interaction with the clinic. The goal will be to increase the clinic intervention with providers as necessary over a historic time period and al so over time realize a decreased utilization on hospital inpatient services. There are no initiatives related to this project that ha ve related activities that are funded by the U.S. department of Health and Human Services. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): The category 3 Outcome Measure related to this proj ect is Patient Satisfaction (stand alone). As we visited with constituents in the Del Rio a nd Val Verde County communities, there is a sense of frustration in regards to not being able to get in to see a doctor. Then there is extreme dissatisfaction if the only resource available to them is the emergency room. And no matter how well the hospital is performing in regards to ED throughput, care takes longer and costs more. There is clearly a perception in Del Rio to that Del Rio needs more doctors. Actuarial data supports this claim that De l Rio and Val Verde County are medically underserved. If the hospital is successful in establishing more clinics and having more providers available, and if the hospital can enhance the patient experience while at the clinics, the hypothesis is that patients will be satisfied with h ealthcare in their community. In regards to low-income populations , this group stands to benefit th e most from this initiative as this patient population is likely the most dissatisfied with their he althcare in the community. Lack of access typically means a greater depe ndency on the ER for primary care needs. 347 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Val Verde Regional Medical Center The clinic(s) will measure patient satisfaction a nd will establish Process Milestones in DY 2 & 3: P 1 Project planning engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timelines and document implementation plans - DY 2 P 2 Establish baseline rates - DY 3 For DY 4 & 5, the clinic will have improvement targets (stand-alone measure) as follows: OD6 Patient Satisfaction IT6.1 Percent improvement ove r baseline of patient sa tisfaction scores ( all questions within a survey need to be answered to be a standalone measure) Percent improvement over baseline of patient satisf action scores for one or more of the patient satisfaction domains that the provider targets for improvement in a specific tool. Certain supplemental modules for the adult CG CAHPS survey may be used to establish if patients: (1) are getting timely care, appointments, and information; (Standalone measure) a Numerator: Percent improvement in targeted patient satisfaction domain b Data Source: Patient survey c Denominator: Number of patients who were administered the survey d Rationale/Evidence: The intent of th e HCAHPS initiative is to provide a standardized survey instrument and data collectio n methodology for measuring patients' perspectives on hosp ital care. The surveys are designed to produce comparable data on the patien t's perspective on care that allows objective and meaningful comparisons between institutions on domains that are important to consumers. Public repor ting of the survey results is designed to create incentives for institutions to improve their quality of care. Public reporting will serve to enhance public accountability in health care by increasing the transparency of the qua lity of institutional care provided in return for the public investment. Relationship to other Projects: This project is related to 1.2 Incr ease Training of Primary Care Wo rkforce. To the extent that there are providers within the RHP as well as ou tside the RHP are focused on this initiative, it helps to increase the pool of providers that are available to expand primary care in medically underserved areas. This project is also related to 2.4 Redesign to Improve Patient Experience. The Category 3 measure associated with this project is Patient Sa tisfaction. Our redesign of not only the infrastructure to increase medical resources but also the redesi gn of how the care is delivered within this newly expanded infrastructure will driv e results so that patients are happier with their care and have a greater confidence in the local rural healthcare delivery system. This project is related to Ca tegory 4 measures RD-1 Potentia lly Preventable Admissions and RD-2 30-day Readmissions. If access to primary car e is increased, then the goal will be to see lower utilization of hospita l resources as measured by Category 4 measures. This project is also related to the hospital's other project, 1.9 Expand Specialty Care Capacity. To the extent that providers are located in th e same clinic, and expans ion of both primary care 348 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Val Verde Regional Medical Center and specialty physicians working together will enhance the communicatio n process and afford the opportunity for patients to move seamlessly through the system. In a small rural community it makes sense to align providers and develop an infrastructure by which everyone is working on the same EMR so that medical information can be shared and to some extent minimize duplication of services. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: University Hospital Baptist Medical Center Children's Hospital of San Antonio CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Frio Regional Hospital (r ural performing provider) Guadalupe Regional Medical Cent er (rural performing provider) Peterson Regional Medical Center (rural performing provider) Medina Regional Hospital (rural performing provider) Plan for Learning Collaborative: Val Verde Regional Medical Center plans for part icipating in a RHP-wide learning collaborative with other providers, especially in the rura l communities, who are also working to expand primary care in medically underserved areas of the state of Texas. It is our opinion that getting groups together will foster collaborati on and sharing of ideas to best come up with plans to accomplish our goals. RHP6 anchor University Health System inte nds to do the following, which Val Verde Regional Medical Center will participate in: Following completion of the RHP Plan, University H ealth System will facilitate the formation of working groups of performing providers who are pursuing similar projects. These working groups will develop their learning collaborative structure which may include the following: Identify participants Establish Learning Co llaborative goals Develop a calendar of regular meetings, site visits, and/or conference calls Develop a plan to communicate ideas, data , and successes across th e region and state Organize a learning event and inv ite experts and other Performi ng Providers from outside the region to share knowledge and best practices Adopt metrics to measure success Project Valuation: Our approach to valuing this pr oject was by figuring how signifi cant the impact would be to the patient population this clinic and the providers its serves is. Si nce the majority of the adult population requires some level of medical intervention at least a nnually, the potential impact is rather significant. If there are more providers to be able to meet the demand, then the overall health of Del Rio and Val Verde county ought to improve. Costs ought to go down. If our hypothesis holds true that by virtue of increasi ng access to primary care th at ER utilization for 349 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Val Verde Regional Medical Center level 4 & 5 visits decreases, all other things eq ual, we will have moved the care delivery system from a more expensive environment to a less expensive environment. 350 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Val Verde Regional Medical Center 119877204.1.1 PASS 1 1.1.1 N/A 1.1.1 ESTABLISH MORE PRIMARY CARE CLINICS - VAL VERDE COUNTY AND DEL RIO , TEXAS Val Verde Regional Medical Center TPI - 119877204 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 119877204.3.1 3.IT-6.1 Percent improvement over ba seline of patient satisfaction scores Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 P-1 Establish additional/expand existing/relocate primary care clinics Metric 1 : P-1.1 Number of additional clinics or expanded hours or space Baseline: 4,740 visits (2012) Goal: Develop a strategic plan and process for expanding primary care clinic offerings through the clinic Data Source: Evidence of strategic plan Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $1,021,045 Milestone 2 P-7 Establish a nurse advice line and/or primary care patient appointment unit.

It is the only hospital serving Val Verde County. The county's popula tion is approximately 50,000 with the majority of those persons living in and around Del Rio. Intervention(s) : This project aims to expand specia lty care resources in this medically underserved community. The hospital has a clinic a ffiliated with it, and the scope of the project will be to add providers in an effort to expand access to care in Val Verde County. Need for the project : A community needs assessment wa s performed, and the top priority identified was to bring more doctors to the comm unity. There is a shortage of specialty care physicians in both Del Rio and Val Verde County. The following actuarial data provided by HCAPS Community Needs Assessmen t Group earlier this year illu strates the gaps in current supply of primary care providers in the clinic's PSA/SSA versus what is needed to take care of the population: Specialty Current Supply Physician Demand Variance Urology 0 1.39 1.39 Cardiology 1 2.13 0.2 3.67 3.47 Otolaryngology 0 1.69 1.69 Orthopedics 2 3.23 1.23 Surgery 2 4.26 2.26 Target population : Additional care providers will benefit potentially all of the 48,643 residents of Val Verde County who require care by a doctor. Speci fically, there will be an effort to target the sicker patients, the 4,202 that were discharged from an inpatient facility in the previous year, to make sure they have appropriate outpatient care. Because there is a lack of specialists in this medically underserved part of the state, many patie nts end up traveling to San Antonio for care, which increases the cost of care. However, for many of the socioeconomically challenged patients in the county who cannot afford the trip to San Antonio, they end up not getting the care they need. Ultimately, they end up in the emer gency room where their condition is more acute and the cost of care to provide for them, which ofte n includes a transfer to higher level of care, is 353 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Val Verde Regional Medical Center significantly more expensive. Approximately 32% of the population that we se rve is uninsured. Our current payer mix for VVRMC consists of 28% Medicaid, 41% Me dicare, 20% HMO/PPO and 11% Self Pay. Considering these percentages, the percent of Me dicaid/indigent patients we anticipate to serve at the specialty care clinics could easily range between 20-30%. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The primary benefit will be access to specialty care as measured by the increase in encounters in the clin ic. Currently we are activ ely trying to recruit a cardiologist; a mid-level specializ ing in cardiology, an ENT and a urologist. Recruitment into these and other specialties will likely be completed during DY 3. Based on the small number of specialty care clinic visits currently (1,100 in 2012) combined with recruitment into cardiology ENT and urology, we anticipate 2,700 specialty clinic visits by th e end of DY 3. In DYs 4 and 5 we have set goals to increase pa tient visits from this new base line by 10% and 20%, respectively. For all specialist providers we expect an average of 2 visits per patient per year. One key patient benefit of increasing access to and u tilization of specialty ca re services will be a decrease in patient transfers. Access to spec ialty care is extremely limited. It causes many patients to be transferred 2 \u00bd hours to San Antoni o for care. Driving to vi sit specialty providers in San Antonio becomes very expensive for resi dents of our community over time. Reducing the need for this travel through greater access to local providers is a signi ficant benefit to our population. There will be an effort to tr ack this utilization as well w ith this patient population. Category 3 outcomes: The measured category 3 outcome associated with this program is patient satisfaction. Currently, the clinic has no formal mechanism to measure patient experience in the clinic as it does for ER and inpatient services. Th e plan is to develop a similar, formal format to ensure that patients are pleased with the services and value the experience in an effort to enhance the full continuum of care at the hospital and its clinic. The clinic intends to benchmark its results against similar operations and set goals in the top quartile of performers, which is a mark consistent with expectations for other hospita l/clinic services. Ther e will be a phased in approach to demonstrate pr ogress toward this goal. Project Description: Establish additional specialty care providers to a medically underserved area along the Rio Grande border. The intent is to add specialty care providers throughout th e life of the project. The primary goal of this project is to expand specialty care in Val Verde County and improve access to services. The hospital intends to make se rvices available locally that are currently not available at all or limited services at best. This project will meet the following regional goals: The project will encourage working together to make significant progress towards the Triple Aim goals of assuring patients receiv e high-quality and pa tient-centered, in the most effective ways The project will improve the health care infras tructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of our region. 354 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Val Verde Regional Medical Center The project will further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system. Finally the project will improve outcomes while containing cost growth. The project achieves an improved infrastructure for Medicaid and uninsured residents through increasing specialty care capacity. The project will increase capacity by expanding the number of specialty clinics. The project develops and main tains a coordinated care delivery system through implementing \"raise the floor\" quality improveme nt initiatives agreed upon during semi-annual RHP learning collaboratives. The project impr oves outcomes while containing cost growth through reducing transfers into San Antonio and by focusing on improving patient satisfaction. The challenge and key issue which this project will address will be to see to it that residents do not have to travel to large, ur ban areas for specialty care. There are many people in Val Verde County that cannot afford the trip to San Ant onio and thus go without seeing a specialist until their condition worsens. At this point they access the ER and often times must be acutely transferred by air ambulance. The 5-year expected outcome is better health, better patient sati sfaction, increased utilization of specialty care services and appropriate utiliz ation of the ER for th is patient population. This project that we have selected is especially important in RHP 6 as so much of the RHP is rural. In the rural heal thcare setting, especially Texas and espe cially along the bor der, there is a short supply of healthcare resources. Del Rio and Val Verde County will be better served and healthier if there is more access to physicians. Starting Point/Baseline: 2012 Urology-800 visits Vascular Surgery-300 visits Based on the small number of specialty care c linic visits currently (1,100 in 2012) combined with recruitment into cardiology ENT and urolo gy, we anticipate 2,700 specia lty clinic visits by the end of DY 3. We will use this as our baseline in DY 4 and 5. Rationale: As evidenced in the RHP Community Needs Assessm ent, access to (or lack of) specialty care is a serious issue in Texas, especially in rural pa rts of Texas. The following Community Needs are specifically related to this project and we re identified locally in Del Rio as well: CN.1 Texas ranks last in the nation on health care quality. RHP 6 is challenged to deliver improved quality and patient satisfaction. CN.2 A high prevalence of chronic disease and related health disparities require greater prevention efforts and improved management of patients with chronic conditions. Leading causes of death in RH P 6 include cardiovascular di sease, cancer, and diabetes. CN.3 Many residents of RHP 6 l ack access to medical and dental care due to high rates of uninsurance and health care provider shortages. The project option (1.9.2) will be to improve access to specialty care. Val Verde Regional 355 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Val Verde Regional Medical Center Medical Center began to seriously tackle this issue in 2011. The hospital established a 501(a) for which it is the sole member for, and as a resu lt developed a recruitment vehicle for physicians and mid-levels. Prior to this organization being established it was even more challenging than it is today to recruit doctors a nd physician extenders to a rural, border community. Through this effort, specialists are currently being recruited to practice in Del Rio It will be reasonable to track progress as additional provid ers are added and clinics establis hed. It is th e intention over the life of this project to attr act additional doctors, phys ician assistants and nurse practitioners to the clinics so that number of c linics can be expanded as well as the number of patients seen in the clinics. By increasing access, there is a greater opportunity to serve these patients timely and locally. Project Components: Through \"Improving Rural Access to Specialty Care\", we propose to meet all required project components, except for component B. E. Identify high impact/most impac ted specialty services and gap s in care and coordination. This component will be accomplished in DY 2. We plan to hire a third-party healthcare consultant to perform this specialty care ga p assessment. The results of this assessment will establish a firm baseline for our project in those specialty care areas where there are gaps in coverage. Our current specialty clinic visit volume (2012) is 1,100 visits with 800 urology visits and 300 vasc ular surgery visits. F. Increase the number of residents/trainees choosing targeted shortage specialties. This project component will not be a ddressed in this project. The reason this component is left out is because of the small size of the hospital (93 license d beds) and its rural location (150+ miles west of San Antonio). Currently our facility does not have the resources, space or staff to provide residencies for physicians. Also, completing this project component is unrealistic given the few specialis ts available in our ar ea to provide such training. G. Design workforce enhancement initiatives to support access to specialty providers in underserved markets and areas (recruitment and retention). Our community is an underserved market considering the lack of sp ecialty care services and its designation as a HPSA. We plan to meet this project component through increasing the number of specialist providers, clinic hours and/or proce dure hours in targeted specialties. This will occur in DY 3. H. Conduct quality improvement for project using methods such as rapid cycle improvement. We plan to meet this project com ponent through partic ipating in face-to- face learning (i.e. meetings or seminars) at least twice per year with other providers and the RHP. These meetings will be to promot e collaborative learning around shared or similar projects. We will then implement at least one \"raise the floor\" improvement initiatives established at the semiannual meeting per year for DY 3, 4 and 5.

Rationale/Evidence: This measures the increased volume of visits and is a method to assess the ability for the Performing Provider to increase capacity to provide care. One of the key quality improvement efforts will be with all new patients established with new providers will be to track and measure physician and hospital utilization before and after access and interaction with the clinic. The goal will be to increase the clinic intervention with providers 357 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Val Verde Regional Medical Center as necessary over a historic time period and al so over time realize a decreased utilization on hospital inpatient services. There are no initiatives related to this project that ha ve related activities that are funded by the U.S. department of Health and Human Services. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): The category 3 Outcome Measure related to this proj ect is Patient Satisfaction (stand alone). As we visited with constituents in the Del Rio a nd Val Verde County communities, there is a sense of frustration in regards to not being able to get in to see a specialist. Then there is extreme dissatisfaction if the only resource available to them is the emergency room. And no matter how well the hospital is performing in regards to ED throughput, care takes longer and costs more. There is clearly a perception in Del Rio to that Del Rio needs more doctors. Actuarial data supports this claim that De l Rio and Val Verde County are medically underserved. If the hospital is successful in establishing more clinics and having more specialists available, and if the hospital can enhance th e patient experience while at the clinics, the hypothesis is that patients will be satisfied with h ealthcare in their community. In regards to low-income populations , this group stands to benefit th e most from this initiative as this patient population is likely the most dissatisfied with their he althcare in the community. Lack of access typically means a greater depe ndency on the ER for primary care needs. The clinic(s) will measure patient satisfaction a nd will establish Process Milestones in DY 2 & 3: P 1 Project planning engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timelines and document implementation plans - DY 2 P 2 Establish baseline rates - DY 3 For DY 4 & 5, the clinic will have improvement targets (stand-alone measure) as follows: OD6 Patient Satisfaction IT6.1 Percent improvement ove r baseline of patient sa tisfaction scores ( all questions within a survey need to be answered to be a standalone measure) Percent improvement over baseline of patient satisf action scores for one or more of the patient satisfaction domains that the provider targets for improvement in a specific tool.

The surveys are designed to 358 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Val Verde Regional Medical Center produce comparable data on the patien t's perspective on care that allows objective and meaningful comparisons between institutions on domains that are important to consumers. Public repor ting of the survey results is designed to create incentives for institutions to improve their quality of care. Public reporting will serve to enhance public accountability in health care by increasing the transparency of the qua lity of institutional care provided in return for the public investment. Relationship to other Projects: This project is related to 1.7 In troduce, Expand or Enhance Telehea lth/Telemedicine. Part of our strategy to gain access to specialists in our rural community will be through telemedicine and robotic technology. It is also related to 1.13 Development of behavioral health crisis stabilization services as altern atives to hospitalization as if the hospital is successful in developing additional behavioral health services to the comm unity it has the opportunity to impact this project as well. This project is also related to 2.4 Redesign to Improve Patient Experience. The Category 3 measure associated with this project is Patient Sa tisfaction. Our redesign of not only the infrastructure to increase medical resources but also the redesi gn of how the care is delivered within this newly expanded infrastructure will driv e results so that patients are happier with their care and have a greater confidence in the local rural healthcare delivery system. This project is related to Ca tegory 4 measures RD-1 Potentia lly Preventable Admissions and RD-2 30-day Readmissions. If access to primary car e is increased, then the goal will be to see lower utilization of hospita l resources as measured by Category 4 measures. This project is also related to the hospital's other project, 1.1 E xpand Primary Care Capacity. To the extent that providers are located in the sa me clinic, and expansion of both primary care and specialty physicians working together will enhance the communication process and afford the opportunity for patients to move seamlessly thro ugh the system. In a small rural community it makes sense to align providers and develop an infrastructure by which everyone is working on the same EMR so that medical information can be shared and to some extent minimize duplication of services.

It is our opinion that getting groups together will foster collaborati on and sharing of ideas to best come up with plans to accomplish our goals. RHP6 anchor University Health System inte nds to do the following, which Val Verde Regional Medical Center will participate in: Following completion of the RHP Plan, University H ealth System will facilitate the formation of working groups of performing providers who are pursuing similar projects. These working groups will develop their learning collaborative structure which may include the following: Identify participants Establish Learning Co llaborative goals Develop a calendar of regular meetings, site visits, and/or conference calls Develop a plan to communicate ideas, data , and successes across th e region and state Organize a learning event and inv ite experts and other Performi ng Providers from outside the region to share knowledge and best practices Adopt metrics to measure success Project Valuation: Our approach to valuing this pr oject was by figuring how signifi cant the impact would be to the patient population this clinic and th e providers its serves is. Speci alty care, especially in areas like cardiology, vascular surger y and podiatry in an area with so much diabetes and hypertension, is very important to the community. In additional, be havioral services are in short supply in Del Rio. When valuing our two projec ts, we arrived at an equal weight between primary and specialty care. If there are more pr oviders to be able to meet the demand, then the overall health of Del Rio and Val Verde county ought to improve. Costs ought to go down. If our hypothesis holds true that by virtue of incr easing access to specialty care that ER utilization and air transfers decrease, all other things equa l, we will have moved the care delivery system from a more expensive environment to a less expensive environment. 360 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Val Verde Regional Medical Center 119877204.1.2 PASS 1 1.9.2 N/A 1.9.2 EXPAND SPECIALTY CARE SERVICES - FOR VAL VERDE COUNTY AND DEL RIO , TEXAS Val Verde Regional Medical Center TPI - 119877204 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 119877204.3.2 3.IT-6.1 Percent improvement over base line of patient satisfaction scores Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 P-1 Conduct specialty care gap assessment based on community need Metric 1 : P-1.1 Documentation of gap assessment.

It is the only hospital serving Val Verde County. The county's popula tion is approximately 50,000 with the majority of those persons living in and around Del Rio. Intervention(s) : This project aims to develop a robust telemedicine program aimed at enhancing access to services across the full co ntinuum of care for patients in th e hospital and at the clinic. Need for the project : A community needs assessment wa s performed, and the top priority identified was to bring more doctors to the co mmunity. There are three targeted areas for the telemedicine program to have an impact: 1) be havioral health, 2) neur ology and 3) cardiology. The telemedicine services will be primarily offered in the ER and on the inpatient units. Currently, there are no resources av ailable in any of these three im portant specialties for patients who require these services in th e ER or inpatient setting. While there are efforts underway to recruit permanent specialis ts to Val Verde County (s ee 119877024.1.2), the likelihood of procuring all specialties permanently to our rural border community is small. However, with this technology, specialists in urban ar eas can access and provide servic es to patients remotely while significantly enhancing the delivery of care. Target population : Additional care providers will benefit potentially all of the 48,643 residents of Val Verde County who require care by a doctor. Specifically, patient s who present to the ER or who are admitted to the hospital with diagnosis in neurology (stroke), cardiology (heart attack), and psychiatry (mental health) will be idea l candidates for telemedicine intervention. Approximately 32% of the population that we se rve is uninsured. Our current payer mix for VVRMC consists of 28% Medicaid, 41% Me dicare, 20% HMO/PPO and 11% Self Pay. Considering these percentages, the percent of Me dicaid/indigent patients we anticipate to serve in the telemedicine program could easily range between 20-30%. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : In DY 3 we will expand the geriatric psych telemedicine program to additional medical sp ecialties, based upon regional and community need. Our baseline is 420 Gero psych telemedici ne visits (2012). However, we have set DY 4, and 5 goals at 1000 and 1150 visits, respectfully . Based on the specialties the telemedicine program expands into and the prov ider, telemedicine visits per patient may range between 1 and 3 per patient per year. The primary benefit will be access to specialty care as measured by the increase in visits through telemedicine. This is a new program, and its benefits will be easily measurable. We intend to realize a reduction in both ground and air transfers as a result of the telemedicine program as more patients can be treated locally in Del Rio. 364 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Val Verde Regional Medical Center Category 3 outcomes: The measured category 3 outcome associated with this program is patient satisfaction. Our plan is to deve lop a formal patient satisfaction response geared specifically for patients receiving services through telemedicine. With this new technology it will be important to make sure that patients have the confidence in this non-traditional process and that the results being delivered are positively perceived. Project Description: Project Description VVRMC intends to introduce a robotic telemedici ne program for access to specialty care in its rural community in the emergency ro om and inpatient bedded units. Goals Goals include expanding access to specialty care a nd being able to provide specialty care more timely. Many patients present to the VVRMC emer gency room today and immediately must be transferred out to a higher level of care. This transfer is oftentimes risky when treatment time is of the essence and is also costly. Through robotic telemedicine, specialists are availabl e to better interact on the case, intervene qui cker and potentially reduce or el iminate the need to transfer patients out of the facility. Challenges/Issues The challenge and key issue will be to align with specialists who have an interest in this technology and a commitment to the rural communit y. The project will not work unless those specialists on the other end treat episodes of care that present via th is medium just as they would in their locality from a priority perspective. Another challenge is developing protocols and techniques that parties on both sides can agree upon. This will be brand new technology which stands th e chance to greatly imp rove patient care, but some of the local, rural community physicians ofte n times are slow to change, especially when it involves technology. 5-Year Expected Outcome The 5-year expected outcome is better health, better patient sati sfaction, increased utilization of specialty care services and reduced transfers out of the facility. Relationship to Regional Goals This project that we have selected is especially important in RHP 6 as so much of the RHP is rural. In the rural heal thcare setting, especially Texas and espe cially along the bor der, there is a short supply of healthcare resources. Del Rio and Val Verde County will be better served and healthier if there is more access to physicians. Starting Point/Baseline: Our baseline is 420 Gero psych telemedicine vi sits (2012), No baseline exists for other specialties we plan to expand into. 365 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Val Verde Regional Medical Center Rationale: As evidenced in the RHP Community Needs Assessm ent, access to (or lack of) specialty care is a serious issue in Texas, especially in rural pa rts of Texas. The following Community Needs are specifically related to this project and we re identified locally in Del Rio as well: CN.1 Texas ranks last in the nation on health care quality. RHP 6 is challenged to deliver improved quality and patient satisfaction. CN.2 A high prevalence of chronic disease and related health disparities require greater prevention efforts and improved management of patients with chronic conditions. Leading causes of death in RH P 6 include cardiovascular di sease, cancer, and diabetes. CN.3 Many residents of RHP 6 l ack access to medical and dental care due to high rates of uninsurance and health care provider shortages. The project option (1.7.1) will be to implemen t telemedicine program to provide or expand specialist referral services in an area identified as needed to the region. VVRMC has invested in robotic telemedicine technology in th e past 3 months with the intent to deploy the resource to expand services to patients presen ting with specific conditions in the emergency room and on the inpatient bedded units. The primary service areas where VVRMC sees the greatest benefit as evidenced by the community needs assessment is in cardiology, neurology and behavioral health. By increasing access, there is a greater opportunity to serve patients of Val Verde County timely and locally. By virtue of having the technology in place and establishing relationships with medical and surgical specialists who are willing to service our area, we will have accomplished the first core component required. The second core component will be accomplished as the team will continually participate in quality improvement efforts to help evaluate the merits of the program. This includes but is not limited to identifying \"les sons learned,\" opportunities to scale all or part of the project to a broader pati ent population, and identifying ke y challenges associated with expansion of the project, includi ng special considerations for safety net populations.

Rationale: demonstrate increase in access due to teleservices One of the key quality improvement efforts will be with all new patients established with new providers will be to track and measure physician and hospital utilization before and after access and interaction with the clinic. The goal will be to increase the clinic intervention with providers as necessary over a historic time period and al so over time realize a decreased utilization on hospital inpatient services. There are no initiatives related to this project that ha ve related activities that are funded by the U.S. department of Health and Human Services. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): The category 3 Outcome Measure related to this proj ect is Patient Satisfaction (stand alone). As we visited with constituents in the Del Rio a nd Val Verde County communities, there is a sense of frustration in regards to acce ss to specialty care. Because of this frustration, many people in the community avoid the local hospital for fear that the hospital does no t have the appropriate resources to take care of their healthcare need. There is clearly a perception in Del Rio to that Del Rio needs more doctors. One alternative to pe rmanent recruitment to this rural community is to access additional doctors through telemedicine. Actuarial data supports this claim that Del Rio and Val Verde County are medically underserved. If the hospital is successful in establishing bett er access to specialists through telemedicine, and if the hospital can enhance the patient experience while at the clinics, the hypothesis is that patients will be satisfied with h ealthcare in their community. In regards to low-income populations , this group stands to benefit th e most from this initiative as 367 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Val Verde Regional Medical Center this patient population is likely the most dissatisfied with their he althcare in the community. Lack of access typically means a greater depende ncy on the ER for specialty care needs which through this project can now be be tter accessed through telemedicine. VVRMC will measure patient satisfa ction for patients who access care through telemedicine and will establish Process Milestones in DY 2 & 3: P 1 Project planning engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timelines and document implementation plans - DY 2 P 2 Establish baseline rates - DY 3 For DY 4 & 5, the clinic will have improvement targets (stand-alone measure) as follows: OD6 Patient Satisfaction IT6.1 Percent improvement ove r baseline of patient sa tisfaction scores ( all questions within a survey need to be answered to be a standalone measure) Percent improvement over baseline of patient satisf action scores for one or more of the patient satisfaction domains that the provider targets for improvement in a specific tool.

Relationship to other Projects: This project is related to 1.9 Expand Specialty Ca re Capacity. In the 1.9 project, there will be targeted specialists that VVRMC strategically works to recruit permanently to Val Verde County. However, there are certain specialties th at logistically do not make sense to have on a full-time basis but these services are needed ad ho c. This certainly is the case in the emergency room and during acute situations while patients ar e in the hospital. Thr ough robot telemedicine technology, VVRMC will work to ex pand access to specialists who ot herwise would likely never be providing services in a rural community. This project is also related to 2.4 Redesign to Improve Patient Experience. The Category 3 measure associated with this project is Patient Sa tisfaction. Our redesign of not only the infrastructure to increase medical resources but also the redesi gn of how the care is delivered within this newly expanded infrastructure will driv e results so that patients are happier with their 368 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Val Verde Regional Medical Center care and have a greater confidence in the local rural healthcare delivery system. This project is related to Ca tegory 4 measures RD-1 Potentia lly Preventable Admissions and RD-2 Readmissions. If acce ss to specialists through telemedi cine is increased, then the goal will be to see lower utiliz ation of hospital resources as measured by Category 4 measures ongoing. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: University Hospital CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Methodist Hospital UT Health Science Center Plan for Learning Collaborative: Val Verde Regional Medical Center plans for part icipating in a RHP-wide learning collaborative with other providers, especially in the rura l communities, who are also working to expand primary care in medically underserved areas of the state of Texas. It is our opinion that getting groups together will foster collaborati on and sharing of ideas to best come up with plans to accomplish our goals. RHP6 anchor University Health System inte nds to do the following, which Val Verde Regional Medical Center will participate in: Following completion of the RHP Plan, University H ealth System will facilitate the formation of working groups of performing providers who are pursuing similar projects. These working groups will develop their learning collaborative structure which may include the following: Identify participants Establish Learning Co llaborative goals Develop a calendar of regular meetings, site visits, and/or conference calls Develop a plan to communicate ideas, data , and successes across th e region and state Organize a learning event and inv ite experts and other Performi ng Providers from outside the region to share knowledge and best practices Adopt metrics to measure success Project Valuation: Our approach to valuing this pr oject was by figuring how signifi cant the impact would be to the patient population this technology serves. Specialty care, especially in areas like cardiology, neurology and psychiatry via telemedi cine is very important to the community. This effort is the only Pass 2 project for VVRMC, an d therefore we have assigned the full value of the Pass 2 allocation to this project. 369 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Val Verde Regional Medical Center 119877204.1.3 PASS 2 1.7.1 1.7.1 E-F 1.7.1 Implement telemedicine program to provide or expand specialist referral services in an area identified as needed to the region - Val Verde County and Del Rio, Texas Val Verde Regional Medical Center TPI - 119877204 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 119877204.3.3 3.IT-6.1 IT - 6.1 Percent improvement over baseline of patient satisfaction scores Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 P-1 Milestone: Conduct needs assessment to identify needed specialties that can be provided via telemedicine Metric 1 : P-1.1 Needs assessment to identify the types of personnel needed to implement the program and hiring of the respective personnel.

CMA serves the San Antonio area with an estimat ed population of 2 million. CMA currently has approximately 100 providers who practice with in an ambulatory network of 19-primary, specialty and preventive health c linics located thr oughout Bexar County. Intervention(s) : Community Medicine Associates will in crease the number of mid-level provider and allied health professional tr ainees, including Nurse Practitione rs and Physician Assistants, in the primary care setting by increasing the number of training slots available to mid-level provider and allied health professional students. Need for the project : Texas ranks last among the six most- populous states in both the ratio of active patient care physicians per capita and the ratio of active primary care physicians in patient care per capita. In comparison to all 50 stat es, Texas ranks near the bottom of the list: 46th for ratio of active patient care physicians per capita and 48th for active patient care primary care physicians per capita (Source: 2011 State Physician Workforce Data Book, Assoc. of American Medical Colleges). Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assist ants can serve as an extension to the primary care physician. Target population : The target population will include the CMA patient population which is comprised of 32.4% CareLink, 31.9% Medicaid , 12.6% HMO/PPO, 12.1% Medicare, and 10.9% self pay. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The Health System will increase mid-level provider training programs in DY2 through DY5. While student s are in this program, they will be trained in the PCMH model and disease registry us e, will focus on population health, and assist providers in managing their panels. Practice a nd focus in these areas will improve patient experience and outcomes. DY2- Increase the number of mi d-level trainees by 2 over base line; 17 trainees for year.

DY5 - Decrease ED visits by TBD% for patie nts with COPD, behavioral health 371 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Community Medicine Associates diagnoses, diabetes exacerbations , and asthma from baseline Project Description: Our aim is to increase training of allied h ealth providers including Nurse Practitioners and Physician assistants in the primary care setting. Our goal is to expand the primary care workforce to address the challenges of access to care and tr ain provider and care team member students in patient centered concepts. Starting Point/Baseline: As of University Health System Year end September 30, 2012 CMA primary care Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants trained by this program is 15. Rationale: Passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the success in expanding high quality affordable care to millions of Americans will be determine d, in large part, by the strength and capacity of the primary care workforce. National studies on access to health care make salient the importance of investing in a primary care workforce that will meet the health needs of an aging population as well as rapidly grow ing minority populations. Demogr aphic and market forces are also having an impact on the current primary care workforce both in terms of retirement as well as the declining number of medical students choo sing primary care as their career focus. In addition, primary care providers ar e geographically mal-distributed; often located in major urban centers and less likely to work in rural, economically unders erved areas with high minority populations. This growing shortage has subsequen tly led to increased wait times, lower quality of care and poor patient experience. Texas has consistently remained one of the top st ates in the nation in population growth fueled largely by a migration from other states as well as a large Hispanic immigrant population. However, Texas ranks last among the six most-populous states in both the ratio of active patient care physicians per capita and the ratio of activ e primary care physicians in patient care per capita. In comparison to all 50 states, Te xas ranks near the bot tom of the list: 46 th for ratio of active patient care physic ians per capita and 48th for active patient care primary care physicians per capita (Source: 2011 State Physician Workforce Data Book, Assoc. of American Medical Colleges). Increasing the supply of primary care doctors has become a focus through health care reform. This project specifically addr esses community need identifi cation number three (CN3) which finds that large segments of the population in RH P 6 lack access to medical and dental care as result of high percentage of the population being uninsured and a limited supply of health care provider in close proximity to patients in need. This project directly responds to this community need by expa nding allied health professional training. This program is central to addressing the primary care workforce shortage. University Health System has served as a primary care trai ning site for the Univer sity of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSCSA) sc hool of Allied Health and seeks to expand primary care training opportunities. In addi tion, by working with our CareLink members directly, we will provide much needed access to pr imary care while training mid-level providers. The CareLink program was created in 1997 to help address the needs of Bexar County residents without health care coverage who were not eligible for Medicaid or other public or private 372 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Community Medicine Associates funding. While CareLink is not an insurance prod uct per se, it has many similar advantages in terms of promoting access to preventive health services, encouraging a long lasting relationship with a primary care provider, and instilling a sens e of shared responsibility between member and staff for the member's health. By increasing the number of alli ed health provider training slot s, the project addresses the national primary care workforce shortage. Students in this program will have the added benefit of being trained and participating in the Patie nt Centered Medical Home model and disease registries. Students in this program will also develop a focus on population health by assisting providers in the management of their panels du ring their training, which will improve the health outcomes in the community. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): High emergency room (ER) utilization is a consider able concern for the increasing cost of health care. Frequent and inappropria te use of hospital ERs is extremely costly and care could be provided in a less expensive setti ng. Patients, when possible, s hould be treated by their primary care provider for non-emergency conditions in orde r to promote consistent, quality care. The targeted population will be the Carelink members assigned to University Health System patient centered medical homes.

This project will link much needed care coordination, social support and cu lturally competent care to vulnerable patient populations at risk for admissions and re-admissions. 136141205.2.5 Use of Palliative Care Programs: Patient s in the medical homes with chronic end of life conditions will have an avenue that a ddresses patient populations who are at risk for suffering, frequent emergency room visits, admissions and death. Plan for Learning Collaborative: This project lends itself to part icipation in learning collaborativ es as other Performing Providers in RHP6 seek to expand the primary care workfo rce services in other parts of the region for similar patient populations. Processes and tech niques developed and implemented during this project will be documented by th e project team. Successes as well as lessons learned will be shared with regional collaborators who are al so working to improve primary care access. Project Valuation: The project achieves the waiver goal and meets community needs by expanding primary care in a predominantly Hispanic, underserved area of Bexar County. This program builds the primary care workforce, strengthens healthcare linkages with local community partners and enhances access to health care services to a target populat ion who struggle with poverty, receive acute or emergency healthcare services only, and do not have usual providers. In addition, many in the target population have chronic disease; with no primary care access these condition will become far more complicated and costly to treat. Access to a primary care medical home been has shown to improve health, improve heal th care, and lower care costs. 374 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Community Medicine Associates 092414401.1.1 PASS 2 1.2.2 N/A 1.2.2 Increase the number of primary care providers (nurse practitioners and physician assistants) and other clinicians/staff (allied health professionals) Community Medicine Associates TPI - 092414401 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 092414401.3.1 3.IT-9.2 ED appropriate util ization (Standalone measure) (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 P-2: Expand primary care training physician assistants and nurse practitioners.

Stevens, RN, Ed D, FAAN Performing Provider TPI: 085144601 Project Summary: Provider Description : The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio serves San Antonio and the 50,000 square-mile area of South Texas. It exte nds to campuses in the metropolitan border communities of Laredo and the Rio Grande Valley. More than 3,000 students a year train in an environment that involves more than 100 affiliated hospitals, clinics and hea lth care facilities in South Texas. Intervention(s) : This project will implement the evidence-based national standard of team performance training, TeamSTEPPS, with healthcare providers across a range of inter-professional disciplines. Following train-the-trainer interventions, quali ty improvement project s will be performed throughout the region, spreading th e team performance training. Need for the project : Currently, the lack of team perf ormance training results in comm unication defects and threats to patient safety and effectiveness of care. The project seeks to establish a customized for team training (YR 2); train 20 Master Trainers in TeamSTEPPS (YR2=20; YR3-5=30) ; establish baseline for team attitudes toward team performance (YR2); stimulate improvement proj ects (implementation of fundamentals training) (YR2=3; YR3-5=15). Target population : Healthcare providers in UTHSCS A and within the Region, including physicians, advance practice nurses, clinical nurses, clinic and unit staff, other health professions (e.g., PT, OT), faculty, students, and residents. Primary targets for this project are thos e providers who service patients throughout the region, particularly through the University Hea lth System (UHS), including hospital and outpatient-based care teams. The project will train a total of 110 Master Trainers who will spread the training through at le ast 48 quality improvement projects. It is expected that ever y patient in the Region sta nds to ultimately benefit from this project as it produces safer, better team care practices across the hospitals and clinics in the Region. Estimates (see Table 2 below) are that patients pro ceeding through 20,000 hospitalizations and 1.7million outpatient visits will benefit from strengthened team performance. As the providers in the Region practice care with greater team skills, care for these patients becomes safer and more efficient and adverse events resulting from inadequate team 377 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA communication and performance are reduced. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The following offers a snapshot of the Medicaid a nd indigent population that is targeted for safer and better team care, to be impacted through this project. Texas has th e highest percentage of uninsured residents in the nation. Bexar County is one of severa l urban counties in Texas with large public or nonprofit hosp itals, the primary of which is the Un iversity Health System, that have developed programs for serving a wider range of medical needs for a grea ter proportion of low- income uninsured.

America's Safety Net Hospitals and Health Systems. 2012. Category 3 outcomes: Our goal is to improve scores on the Culture of Patient Safety survey by 5% (YR4 and YR5). Project Description: Currently, team-based care is not widely practice d nor broadly taught in healthcare, including our region. The resulting comm unication defects result in threats to patient safety and effectiveness of care. The major delivery solution is implementati on of the evidence-based national standard of TeamSTEPPS team performance training across all healthcare providers in UTHSCSA, including physicians, advance practice nurses, clinical nurses, clinic and unit staff, othe r health professions (e.g., PT, OT), faculty, stude nts, and residents. The goal is to customize, implement, and evaluate an innovative evidence-abased inter- professional team-based care model to achieve hi gh team performance for patient safety in all healthcare practice settings of the HSC. The target is better care through improved team performance to impact care transitions, team communication, culture of patient safety, and patient satisfaction. We will extend, replicate, and test an innovative evidence-based inter-professional team-based care model to achieve team-based care for patient safety in all healthcare practice 378 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA settings of the HSC. The expected outcome target is better care through improved team performance to impact team communication, culture of patient safety, a nd patient experience. Outcome: Team-based care will improve quality and safety for patients and families through a number of channels. The 4-year expected outcome resulting fro m implementation of the project would include greater team-based care effectiveness and cost avoidance from better patient safety and satisfaction with experience. Essential in terim outcomes include expanded care provider attitudes and skills in team performance. Trai ning program outcomes include: Sustained team- based care training for professional development (c ontinuing education) for faculty and clinicians; sustained team-based care training in formal inter-professional coursework and clinical practicum settings in which education occurs and improvement projects performed by newly-trained staff. Challenges faced in promoting team-based skil ls include assembling in ter-professional groups (practicing professionals, faculty, and students) to engage in this training to acquire team-based care skills. The 2 \u00bd day Master Training and th e 4-hour basic training will require dedicated time and effort from these groups and from the traine rs. Another challenge noted by others who have implemented TeamSTEPPS on a broad scale is the para digm shift that must occur to achieve team- based care across disciplines. Often silos and traditional communication/collaboration styles are embedded in team-based care. Finally, the shif t by organizations to evolve systems supporting patient safety demands both administrative and frontline provider to effect a culture of patient safety. Quality: To achieve continuous quality improvement we shall assess the projects impact and make adjustments as necessary, share best practice a nd lessons learned, seize scaling opportunities to expand successful outcomes to broader populations , and rapidly disseminate successful outcomes to other providers across Texas. Region 6 goals: This project achieves CMS's Triple aim objectives of assuring patients receive high quality and patient centered care, in the most cost effectiv e way, improves the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsur ed residents of the counties we serve, further develops and maintains a coordinated care de livery system and improves outcomes while containing costs. Starting Point/Baseline: A strong foundation of available resources has be en developed over the la st 3 years, including 100+ Master Trainers (MT's) in the TeamSTEPPS program, who will serve as resources to extend the training. The ACE center has experience in planning and implementi ng the 2 \u00bd day Master Training and national affiliations (e.g., Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality) to assure the most current training locally. Although these adva nces have been made in training the trainers, diffusion into clinical settings sti ll lags and sustainment is not yet stabilized. For example, of the MT's from this program, about 1/3 have moved fo rward with agency inte gration; and this group reports scores that have remained low on the AHRQ Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture (HSOPS) 15. Clearly, the proposed program can contribut e to gains in team-based care for patient safety. 379 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Rationale: Human factors research demonstrates that even proficient professionals are vulnerable to error due to inherent human limitations. High reliability organizations, such as av iation, find that teams of professionals who communicate effectively compensate for indi vidual vulnerability and reduce consequences of errors, resulting in enhanced safety and improved performance. A major finding of the report, To Err Is Human1 was that inadequate communication was the largest contributing factor to the occurrence of errors and near misses in healthca re. Communication failures have been shown to be the leading cause of sentinel even ts, including preventable patient deaths, accounting for up to 80% of adverse events.2 Preventable medical errors in US hospitals cost an estimated 98,000 patient lives and $17 to 29 billion each year.1 Accrediting agencies acknowledge that poor team communication in the form of intimidating and disruptive behavior also undermine a culture of safety. In this vein, The Joint Commission established a new leadership standard and as of January 2009, requires sentinel event reporting of disruptive and inappropriate behaviors. Sugge sted actions include encouragement of inter- professional dialogues across a variety of forums . Preventive measures include standardized communication techniques, such as t hose contained in teamwork training.3 Effective inter-professional team work in healthcare is essent ial to patient safety. Although sparse, research on inter-professional education (I PE) is suggestive that IPE may produce positive outcomes on department culture, patient satisfacti on, collaborative team beha vior, and reduction of errors. Key IOM recommendations are that heal thcare organizations \"establish interdisciplinary team training programs for pr oviders that incorporate prove n methods of team training...\" 1 that all health professionals are educated to deliver ca re as members of an interdisciplinary team, 4 and that common language and core inter-profe ssional competencies are developed.5 The quick response to these recommendations by multiple government agencies produced a standardized team training program based on best evidence: Team Strategies and Tools to Enhance Performance and Patient Safety (TeamSTEPPS). This new team work system is designed to optimize team performance and outcomes across the health care delivery system. TeamSTEPPS is the standardized federal program for healthcare team training.2 In this context, Academic Health Centers have been called on to create positive clinical education environments. Given that approxi mately 50% of nursing education and 70% of physician education occurs in clin ical settings, IOM urges that Academic Health Centers create positive clinical education environments. 6 Our own UTHSC Strategic Plan, Goal #1 targets the provision of an \"environment for educational excellence\".7 There is an urgent need fo r standardized training in in ter-professional teamwork and communication that moves easily from academic to pr actice settings. In addition to human factors in systems failures, often the basis of br eakdowns in communication is the differing communication styles used by clinicians attributable to differences in education and lack of formal education in teamwork. Every quality improvement intervention, at its core, is targeted at making sure that a team of healthcare workers with vari ous levels of education and often with various agendas come together and coordinate effectivel y and have some equal teamwork competency and standing. This multidisciplinary nature of the team and its work inhibit the team's ability to coordinate and communicate effect ively. Yet standardized team communication is not typically taught as core competencies in health professions4 although required or recommended.8,9 Few 380 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA members of the present workforce have had opp ortunity to be trai ned in standardized communication such as TeamSTEPPS. 2 Emerging evidence11 indicates that TeamSTEPPS diffusion is correlated with improvement in scores of the AHRQ Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture (HSOPS), a system change much n eeded in most clinical settings. To our knowledge, no other similar projects funde d by the USDHHS are currently underway at UTHSCSA. Core Project Requirements: (a) Provide training and education to clinic al and administrative staff on process improvement strategies, methods and culture. (b) Develop an employee suggestion system that a llows for the identifica tion of issues that impact the work environment, patient care a nd satisfaction, efficien cy, and other issues aligned with continuous process improvement. A & B represent all core proj ect components listed above are implemented. The project will train a total of 110 Master Trainers who will spr ead the training through at least 48 quality improvement projects led by these traine rs within 6 months of completion of training. These CQI projects will scale a nd spread the team performance tr aining in order to drive their entire organizations on a more ra pid trajectory of improvement.

Essentia l interim outcomes include expanded care provider attitudes and skills in team performance. Trai ning program outcomes include: Sustained team- based care training for professional development (c ontinuing education) for faculty and clinicians; sustained team-based care training in formal inter-professional coursework and clinical practicum settings in which education occurs and improvement projects performed by newly-trained staff. Relationship to other Projects: 1.1 Expand Primary Care Capacity Dr. Julie Cowan Novak 381 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 1.2 TeamSTEPPS is a program whose ultimate objectiv e and purpose is improved patient safety and as such reinforces, enables, and is related di rectly to most other projects or at a minimum indirectly to all others. The direct application of newly-deve loped modules and metrics makes TeamSTEPPS relevant to ambulatory care settings and patient engagement. In every setting that offers care through team-based pr ocesses, TeamSTEPPS is essential. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: The objective of this project is to improve pati ent safety via tools a nd training centered around quality. As a result it is directly related to all other projects. Plan for Learning Collaborative: A learning collaborative will be formed such that organizations are able to share ideas, challenges and develop solutions. The learning collaborative will bring participating sites together via conference call once a quarter where project-level goals are discusse d and other projects are able to learn. A face-to-face meeting will occur once a year at the CTSA CER meeting where informatics is the topic of discussion. During this meeting, those belonging to the learning collaborative along with others ou tside of the region are able to share knowledge and participating sites are able to learn from the su ccesses/challenges of other sites.

It extends to campuses in the metropolitan border communities of Laredo and the Rio Grande Valley. More than 3,000 students a year train in an environment that involves more than 100 affiliated hosp itals, clinics and health care facilities in South Texas. Intervention(s) : This project will develop longitudinal clinical registries to improve quality of care at our collaborating primary care practices that train medi cal students and residents in medicine and will implement evidence-based community health worker (promotora) interven tions to address health risks in patients who are not meeting their disease management goals. Need for the project : This project serves as a basis for many other initiatives to improve the quality and outcomes of patient care by developing longitudinal cl inical registries to help primary care physicians evaluate their care and identify pati ents who are in need of support to improve outcomes. Our study population is majority Latino with a large proporti on who receive care through CareLink, a county-based financial assistance program. We will offer valuable da ta about predictors of poor achievement of clinical care goals such as uncontrolled hyper tension, poor control of diabetes, and excessive weight gain. These are all associated with the development of complicatio ns that can compromise quality of life and survival as well as increase the need for costly urgent care services including ad mission/readmissions and emergency department utilization. In addition, this pr oject will contribute to a coordinated care delivery system and improve outcomes while containing cost growth though ev idence-based interventions for patients who do not meet quality of care metrics. Thr ough electronic medical record -derived registries, we will be able to examine the continuum of care across ambulatory primary care providers and specialists, and hospital admissions as well as la boratory and procedures performed in these linked systems of care. Target populations : We will focus our project on improving outcomes of low income patients with Medicaid, CareLink (county-funded fi nancial assistance), an d no insurance who are not meeting quality of care, health maintenance goals or requiring treatm ent with narcotics for pain. We will first target individuals with diabetes mellitus who have a m ean hemoglobin (Hb) A1C level of >= 7.5% which increases the patients' risk of diabetes complicati ons. Second, we will identify a similar cohort of persons who have sustained uncontrolled systolic hyperten sion, which is the dominant form of uncontrolled hypertension. Third, we will identify persons who ha ve chronic non-cancer pain and are treated with narcotics long-term since these i ndividuals are known to be heavy users of emergency and hospital services as well as at risk for overdose events. Fina lly, we will identify HIV-infected persons in our local HIV clinic who have Ryan White or CareLink insurance because we have found that over 60% are overweight or obese and are still ha ving significant weight gain. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : DY 2: Patient Navigation (2.9): This project will target over 1,000 pa tients who fail to achieve health maintenance and disease management goals at three clinics. Once these patients are identified, we will 386 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA train and guide 5 patient navigators (promotoras) a nd peers from the practice to assist the patients at greatest need with culturally appropriate interven tions and provide at-risk patients with coordinated, timely, and site appropriate health care services. DY 3: By improving patient navigation, the pati ent experience (2.4) wi ll also be improved. Enhancement/Expansion of Medical Homes (2.1): Ce ntral to successful medi cal homes is access to excellent information about quality of care metrics and insuring well-coordina ted, comprehensive care. Longitudinal chronic disease registri es provide a foundation for these goal s. Our goal is to have all key personnel at the Brady Green clinic s understand how to read and use th e registry by the end of year 5. DY 4: Expansion of Chronic Care Management Model (2.2): By using a longit udinal study design, this project will provide comprehensive information on how patients use an d receive services over time - so that we can identify those who have not been seen within a recommended timeframe to evaluate their chronic disease status. We can also examine patterns of care. A key predictor of poor outcomes in our prior research on patients with diabet es in our primary care clinics at University Health System is the proportion of scheduled visits that a patient keeps (% visit non-attendance). We have found that patients who fail to keep scheduled visits in a baseline three-year period are at in creased risk of hospitalization in a follow-up year - with a two-fold greater risk of hospitalization for person s who keep only 60% of scheduled visits compared with patients who keep >75% of visits (absol ute difference 6% vs. 13%, respectively) after adjusting for pati ent demographic, clinical, and health care variables. We have also found that the % visit non- attendance is also linearly associated with less reduction in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) among patients who have a baseline HbA1c >8%. Sustained HbA1c over 8 is associated with an increased risk of avoidable complications in the l ong term including renal failure, blindness, and vascular diseases. In all of these analyses, 50 -60% of these patients have CareLi nk or Medicaid in surance and most are Latino. For our DSRIP project, we will be able to examine the pattern of visit non-attendance among patients in our cohorts and then stratify on baseline poor control to target pa tients who need additional promotora support along with proactive practice-based interventions. We aim to have >98% of active patients have documented HbA1c as well as documentati on as to why they are not on medication if they HbA1c is over 6.5%. We will also look for all patients with hypertension to have documented blood pressures at least twice a year. We also have approximately 5% of our 1433 patients in HIV clinic who have fewer than two BMI measurements. We aim to have all HIV patients have BMI recorded at visits at least twice a year. Finally we are looking to see do cumentation of a urine drug screen and an opioid use agreement for at least 60% of patie nts on long-term narcotics. Goal is to increase the percentage of patients with diabetes in the registry by 5%. Our goal is to have a complete upda ted registries for patients with hypertension, long-term opioids (defined as at le ast 90 days in a 6 month period), and HIV infection. Lastly, our goal is to have reached 95% of the pr oviders in the Brady Green Clinic with educational materials about the interventions an d educate them about providing a ll patients with disease specific information to overcome barriers to achieving goals. DY 5: Redesign for Cost Containment (2.5): This projec t will allow us to invest igate if patients receive either too many or not enough services. By examini ng these areas, we can also offer feedback to physicians about their level of serv ice utilization relative to other providers (e.g. too many MRIs for low back pain or too few patients immunized against pneumococcal vaccine). For example, we will focus on our chronic non-cancer pain regist ry in identifying patie nts who are receiving hi gh dose opioids or prescriptions without being seen in the office because they have excess utilization of emergency room and hospital services. Reports will be generated for over 75% providers/care teams for care delivered outside the office visit. Our goal is to reduce the mean A1c to <7.3 for these patients using an outreach 387 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA intervention. We can expect to substantively improve blood pressure control in this population from an overall mean of 135 mmHg to 131 mmHg. Lastly, we will work to reverse the observed rapid weight gain to <1% BMI per year. For patients with chronic pain on narcotics, our goal is to have 80% receive urine drug testing at least once a year and 80% have docu mented opioid use agreements. We will also monitor the morphine equivalent doses for th ese patients and offer feedback to 100 percent of th e providers about the risks of doses over 50 per day. Category 3 outcomes: This project will address Outcome Dimens ion 11: Addressing Health Disparities in Minority Populations, specifically Impr ovement in Clinical Indicators in Latino Populations. The clinical indicators chosen for this projec t include hypertension control, HbA1c reduction to goal, and stabilization of weight in HIV infected patients who are overweight or obese. We will also work to improve our non- attendance rate for our patients. Currently, the mean non-attendance rate for our diabetes population is 31%. For persons with diabetes and mean HbA1c >= 7.5% , efforts to reduce this level to < 7.5% are most cost-effective according to the American Diabetes A ssociation. We propose to fi rst target persons with baseline A1c and a last A1c mean 7.5% reduce their m ean to <7.5%. In terms of hypertension, the goal of this project is to insure that the majority of our Latino population meets targets fo r blood pressure control, including <140 mmHg systolic blood pressure for non-diabetics and id eally <130 Hg for diabetics We will reduce the proportion of patients who have unc ontrolled hypertension despite drug therapy by 10% and achieve at least a 3-5 mmHg reduc tion in systolic blood pressure. We will use our registries to define patients who need support to achieve goals and impl ement evidence-based promotora and peer support interventions to address these health risks. For patients treated with long-te rm narcotics, our goal is to o ffer additional support to reduce the proportion of patients who meet quality of care metr ics including, visits every 3-6 months, urine drug screening, opioid agreement, and morphine equivale nt dose <50. In other analyses in an insured population, our group has found that patie nts with chronic non-cancer pain who have are prescribed high dose long-term opioids have 8 times the risk of ho spitalization compared with those on no opioids. Our group has also examined weight gain as an a dverse outcome for patients with HIV infection and found that those who are from minority groups (La tino or non-Hispanic black ) with no insurance (CareLink or Ryan White) have 8 ti mes greater risk of gaining more than 3% of their BMI annually vs. non-Hispanic whites with Medicaid or Medicare insurance. This results in a rapid rise in the obesity; among 455 overweight (BMI 25 to 30) HIV patients at baseline, 25% will become obese (BMI=>30) within only 3 years and among 491 normal BMI (19-25), 9% will become obese in 3 years. We must address this additional risk factor for complications in HIV-infected persons. Project Description: The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSCSA ) and our practices in collaboration with University Health System (UHS) are well positioned in our region to address the DSRIP category I project area 1.3 \"Implement a Chronic Disease Management Registry\". We are already engaged in developing registries to support effective care management . University Health System has each initiated longitudinal Diabetes Registries to inform delivery of care, to educate providers and patients, and to target disease management interven tions that will improve quality of care and clinical outcomes in the population we serve. The first specifi c aim of this project is to create a quality improvement (QI) data mart for the outpatient ma nagement by UT primary care and HIV practices located at UHS Brady Green campus for patients w ith diabetes, hypertension, HIV, and patients with chronic pain treated with opioids. A second specific aim is to assist with building a parallel data mining resource for University Health System clinics because we share many of the same patients. We are in the process of developing a Health Info rmation Exchange (HIE) to ensure seamless exchange of information 388 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA about our patients. A third specific aim is to use thes e data to inform providers and patients about care outcomes and to offer a resource to target and eval uate case management and other interventions to improve outcomes when needed. Challenge s. Major professional societies a nd international public health organizations including the World Health Organization and the American Diabetes Association endorse targ eting diabetes as a key health care threat. Our goal is to reduce the signifi cant adverse impact of diabetes not only on our patients but on our community because it can be a very costl y, high morbidity condition. The other conditions that we are targeting have similar seri ous consequences for our community: a) hypertension - the main cause of cardiovascular disease that, in tur n, is the most common cause of death in adults in our region, b) HIV - a deadly condition that has been transformed into a ch ronic disease if given excellent care, and c) chronic pain management with opioids -- can lead to dive rsion and overdose when care is not well monitored and coordinated. Approaches to Address Challenges: Using diabetes as our model for a re gistry, it is critic al that providers receive information about quality of care indica tors, longitudinal patterns of care (e.g., examining adherence to scheduled appointment s), adherence to medications, and clinical outcomes as defined by hemoglobin (Hb) A1c and renal function to avoid compli cations such as diabetes -related renal disease and blindness. The diabetes registry should be the backbone for population manage ment to identify at-risk persons within a defined population and to provide sp ecific patient support strategies for these persons who are failing to achieve care goals, directed by the patient's usual source of care through a clinical nurse case manager and case management team. Feedback to providers based on periodic registry review will be conducted to insure that these outre ach patient support programs are effective. 5-year outcomes include: 1) Improvement in the proportion of registry patients who receive recommended services; 2) Improvements on lab results including but not limited to: HbA1c tests and lipid tests; and 3) documentation of patient -specific goals, and reduction in ur gent care services. Currently, we have identified 6,780 patients followed in the Family Medicine clinic at the Brady Green Building at UHS who have CareLink, Medicaid, or self-pay, of whom 24.7% have diabetes. Currently we have identified 1,171 patients followed in the General Internal Medici ne clinic at the Brady Green who have CareLink, Medicaid, or self-pay, of whom 39.1 % have diabetes. Similarly, the pr oportions of patie nts in these two clinics with hypertension are 38.8% and 64.4%, respectively. The HI V clinic at the Brady Green currently follows approximately 1,200 patients. By tr acking various chronic dis ease metrics (e.g. HbA1c, lipid, weight, exercise frequency), we will be able meet patient-specific goals by targeting patients in need of support by promotoras and peers to address deficien cies in care such as poor medication adherence and unhealthy lifestyle, thereby improving c linical status and reduce urgent ca re utilization consistent with the region 6 waiver goals of: meeting CM S stated triple aim goals of assu ring patients receive high quality patient centered care, in the most cost effective wa ys. In addition this project improves the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of our counties, further develops and maintains a coordinated care deliv ery system, and improves outcomes while containing cost growth. Starting Point/Baseline: The data source for the diabetes registry is Sunrise elec tronic medical record that serves all of the clinics located at a UHS site - for UT Medicine clinics the si te is the Brady Green campus. In this project, we are serving three clinics at UHS that have large numb ers of Medicaid, CareLink or self-pay patients. The guiding principle of this proj ect is to develop a centralized analytic system that offers a centralized data repository, technology and knowledge management. We w ill establish an analytics/data mining center of excellence that creates, implements and maintains longitudi nal registry databases of health care utilization and services for patients with common chronic dis eases and ambulatory care sensitive conditions. UT Medicine has over 30 primary care providers, including re sidents and faculty as we ll as allied health 389 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA professionals (nurse practitioners, physic ian serving patients in these settings) Currently, the Brady Green diabetes regist ry for the UT Medicine practices has over 2,000 persons from 2011-12 with longitudinal data on demographics , health care utilization, vital signs (e.g. BMI), clinical lab measures (e.g. HbA1c), prescribed medi cations, and other comorbidities. We are working to improve this registry by devel oping improved, more complete data queries, by reducing missing or incomplete data elements, and by linking patients to their usual source of care. No formal provider training has been undertaken on the use of this regist ry. This needs to be completed to ensure that physicians/allied health personnel and their support staff can use the regi stry data properly and to its fullest capacity. The HIV registry from 2008-2011 in cludes over 1,500 persons who have been validated by chart review as having this infection. Our databa se includes all encounters, diagnoses, relevant HIV tests, vital signs (validated), medi cations, insurance and demographics. We plan to train all providers at Brady Green primary care practices to use the data in the registry and, in or der to improve clinical outcomes, to direct promotoras and peers to help patients who are not achievi ng quality of care goals. Rationale: Reasons for Selecting Project: This project serves as a basis for many other initiatives to improve the quality and outcomes of patient care. It meets all the Triple Aim goals by assuring that patients receive high-quality and patient-centered care and in the most cost effective manner. Our providers serving an indigent population including persons with Medicaid, CareLink, and no insurance. We will offer valuable data to inform implementation of pa tient support and practice pr ocedures that will improve patient clinical outcomes such as reduced HbA1c, systolic blood pressu re and weight control - all of these factors are associated with increased use of health care resources and preventable complicati ons when not controlled to nationally accepted goals. We have plans to un ite the University Health System (UHS) and UT Medicine electronic medical reco rd systems through a Health Info rmation Exchange called DBMotion. However, even before the HIE is implemented, we are able to examine the continuum of care across ambulatory primary care providers and specialists, hospital admissions as we ll as laboratory and procedures performed in these linke d systems of care. In addition, this project will further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system and im prove outcomes while contai ning cost growth. This project addresses Categories 1.3, 2.9, and 3 Outcome Dimension 11. The following project Required Core Project Component s are included in the milestone and steps to achieve milestone sections below: (a) Enter patient data into unique chronic disease registry. (b) Use registry data to proactively contact, educate, and track patient s by disease status, risk status, self-management status, community and family need. (c) Use registry reports to develop and implement targeted QI plan. (d) Conduct quality improvement for project using methods such as rapid cycle improvement. Milestones: DY 2: Identify one or more targeted patient popula tions diagnosed with selected chronic disease(s). For the diabetes registry, various data elements will be extracted from the EMR: 1) patient encounters, 2) diagnosis codes from problem lists, medical histor y and encounters, 3) lab orders and results, 4) necessary services (e.g. immunizations, eye examination) - all stored in different tables in the Sunrise electronic medical record database that will be linked to provide comprehensive longitudinal data on patient care. For the hypertensi on and HIV registries, elem ents extracted include demographics, BMI, blood pressures, arrival stat us of visits, relevant labs, disease specific medications, comorbidities, providers , ER use, and hospitalization. 390 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA DY 2: Develop cross-functional team to evaluate registry program DY 2: Implement/expand a functional disease management registry DY 3: Undertake provider training to prepare practices and providers to use the registries to evaluate/ inform patient care, target outreach, and evaluate outcomes of initiatives to improve patient care. DY 3: Conduct staff trainings on popul ating and using registry functions DY 3-5: Case manager/promotora, peer coaches, and associated team members will use this registry to coordinate services for at risk patients in collaboration with the usual source of care. DY 4: Increase the percentage of patients with di abetes based on billing data from UT Medicine (N=2121) recorded in the regi stry (that currently has 2005) by 5% by searching UHS electronic medical records for patients who are not yet in the registry DY 5: Generate registry-based reports for each provi der/care team for the care delivered outside the office visit. DY 5: Increase the percentage of patients with chr onic disease entered into the registry who receive instructions appropriate for thei r chronic disease or MCCs to over 80% Steps to achieve milestones Microsoft SQL Server Database will be acces sed from SAS on Micros oft Windows, using ODBC (Open Database Connectivity and da ta will be imported to SAS. SAS programs will be written for definitions of es tablished patient, assigned physician, diagnosis of diabetes, last HbA1c, last LDL cholesterol as well as more complex variables including the proportion of scheduled visits th at were attended (low proportion = high risk), and adherence to medications. The accuracy of data will be assessed by manual ve rification of selected patient records and, when necessary, the process of data extraction and im port will be modified to improve accuracy. Once fully functional, SAS will continually generate reports for physicians caring for patients with diabetes in UT Medicine and thei r UHS administrators and other team members. Further, reports will be generated for providers to alert them wh en certain goals need to be addressed. The 'at-risk' outliers not achieving therapeutic go als will be identified and \"red-flagged.\" A case manager and case management team will be hired and trained with the goal of periodically reviewing the red-flagged patients wi th the physicians and care team independent of scheduled visits. Outreach project will be designed and implemented to contact and communicat e with these outliers and evidence-based interventions implemented to a ssist them to achieve their therapeutic goals. We hypothesize that an iterative intervention by a \"population manage r,\" who would identify at risk patients and collaborates with the phy sician as well as the patient to address barriers to success could potentially result in significantly better overall diabetes manageme nt compared with a population of patients receiving usual care. Similar potential fo r improvement is possible for the other chronic disease that we will target. Metrics for Diabetes Regi stry as an example Year 1. Develop/implement a registry, hi re and train staff in use of registry. Year 2. 50% - 70% of patients with diabetes are entered in the registry. Year 3. 60% -80% of patients with diabetes are entered in the registry 50%-60% of physicians receive monthly re gistry reports on their patients with diabetes. Year 4. 60% -80% of p hysicians receive monthly registry reports on their patients with selected conditions. 391 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 50% -60% of physicians communicate pe riodically via face-to-face meeting, teleconference or electronically with panel manager and care team to red flag patients to receive outreach by phone, mail or in person. Year 5. 75% -100% of physicians receive monthly registry reports on their patients with selected conditions. 60% -80% of physicia ns communicate periodically via face-to- face meeting, teleconference or electronically with panel manager and care team to redflag patients to receive non-phys ician outreach by phone, mail or in person. Community Need: This project has great po tential to address community needs defined in the Community Health Improvement Plan for Bexar Count y. Specifically, we will address priority areas of Healthy Eating and Active Living (#1) as well as Behavioral and Mental Well-Being (#4). Health issues addressed by identifying patients wi th diabetes, HIV, and hypertension w ho require additional services to meet lifestyle and care goals. In regard to Beha vioral and Mental Health, patients who do not achieve chronic disease management goals are significantly more likely to have unmet behavioral and mental health support needs. A key component of our outreach support and services for at risk patients who are identified from the registry will be offering formal (promotora) and informal (peer support) as needed to address these health care needs. CN.2 is the unique community need being addressed by this project. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-11 Addressing Health Dispari ties in Minority Populations. [IT-11.2]: Improvement in disparate health outcomes for target population, including identification of disparity group (IT-11.1]: Improvement in Clinical Indicator in identified disparity group. Improvement in clinical indicators of hypertension control, HIV viral load suppression, hemoglobin A1 C in both Hispanic and non-Hispanic populations but reductions are expected to be greater in the former group because poorer status at baseline Related to Category 3 Outcome Measures, this proj ect will address Outcome Dimension 11: Addressing Health Disparities in Minority P opulations, specifically Improvement in Clinical Indicators in Latino Populations. The clinical indicators chosen for this project include hypertension control, Hb A1C reduction to goal, and HIV care goals of reducing excessive weight gain in persons who are overweight or obese. These measures are a priority for the RHP because research and national surveys conducted by the CDC have shown that low-income, Hi spanic populations are disproporti onately affected by poor clinical and functional status reflecting poor achievement of chronic disease management goals and a high prevalence of overweight and obesity. Thus, morbidity and chronic disease management are areas of great concern for providers working with Latinos. In terms of hypertension, the goal of this project is to improve our data entry and registry accuracy so that valid blood pressu re data are recorded for at least 90% of our Latino population. For persons with a mean HbA1c over 7.5, efforts to reduce this level to under 7.5 is not only cost-effective but also significantly reduces the risk of diab etes complications when <7% according to the ADA. We propose to reduce th e mean HbA1c from the current 7.7% in our study practices to 7.3 (5% absolute reducti on) by targeting the persons who fa il to keep their appointments and 392 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA who have elevated HbA1c. Currently, we have found that the average relative reduction over a three year period in HbA1c for persons with an HbA1c over 8% at baseline is -15.9% for persons who keep >75% of visits vs. only -9.5% for persons wh o keep <60% of visits. Similarly, we will reduce the proportion of patients who have uncontrolled hypert ension despite therapy by 10% and achieve at least a 3 to 5 mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure. We will be able to achieve these goals by using the registry to define patients who need additional support to achieve goals and to implement evidence-based community health worker (promotora) interventions to address these health risks through promotoras and peer support. In collaboration with the patient practices, promotoras and trained peers will prov ide culturally appropriate outreach aimed at reducing disparities for low-inco me and Hispanic patients. To address health disparities, Dr Turner led a successful randomized controlled trial of pe er support for uncontrolled hypertension in a minority population that resulted in a reduction in systolic blood pressure similar to adding a new drug (Turner, et al. 2012). Relationship to other Projects: In relation to other projects and in terventions within the RHP plan, th is project supports, reinforces and enables Patient Navigation, Redesign to Improve Patie nt Experience, Enhancement/Expansion Medical Homes, Expansion of Chronic Care Management Models, and Redesi gn for Cost Containment. Patient Navigation (2.9) : This project will target patients who fail to achieve health maintenance and disease management goals. Once these patients are id entified, we trai n and guide patient navigators (promotoras) and peers to assist the patients at great est need and provide at-ris k patients with coordinated, timely, and site appropriate health care se rvices. By improving pa tient navigation, the patient experience (2.4) will also be improved. Enhancement/Expansion of Medical Homes (2.1) : Central to successful medical homes is access to excellent information about quality of care metrics and insuring well-coordina ted, comprehensive care. Longitudinal chronic disease registries provide a foundation for these goals. Expansion of Chronic Care Management Model (2.2): By using a longitudinal study design, this project will provide comprehensive information on how patients use services over time - so that we can identify patients who have not been seen within a recommended timeframe to evaluate their chronic disease status. We can also examine adherence to medi cations and patterns of car e. Patients who receive only urgent care can be identified as well as those who persistently cancel or no show to scheduled appointments. These patients are in particular need of targeted management and support programs. Redesign for Cost Containment (2.5): This project will allow us to investigate if patients receive either too many or not enough services. By examining these areas, we can also offer feedback to physicians about their level of servi ce utilization relative to other providers (e.g. too many MRIs for low back pain or too few patients immunized against pneumococcal vaccine). Related to Category 3 Quality Improveme nt of Chronic Disease , this project espe cially focuses on diabetes to ensure that patients who have a mean HbA1c >7.5% and who keep <75% of their visits (associated with an increased risk of adverse even ts and end organ damage) re ceive outreach to improve control of their diabetes. We also aim to target pa tients who continue to ha ve uncontrolled systolic hypertension (>140 mmHg) on treatment. HIV registry data will be used to identify patients who are overweight or obese and work to reduce their rate of weight gain. We have obser ved a 3% annual increase in BMI in 34% for the 434 HIV infected persons in our registry who are Hispanic or black and who have CareLink or Ryan White insurance and 18% for the 496 Hispanic or Bl ack patients with Medicaid or Medicare insurance. Through culturally appropriate out reach by promotoras and peers, this project aims to reduce disparities for low-income and Hispanic pati ents. Our primary goals are to improve diabetes and hypertension control and reduce the ra te of weight gain for these patients. These are secondary outcome 393 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA metrics that we will monitor and ex pect to see reductions blood pressu re, cholesterol, and hyperglycemia that are all related to obesity. We are also going implement team based care programs to improve quality of care metrics for patients who are treated with long-term narcotics for chronic non cancer pain - approximately 100 patients - including record of an opioid use agreement, yearly urine drug testing, and at least one visit every 6 months. Related to Category 4 Population-Focused Measures , this project targets a low-income, Medicaid, and uninsured population because University Health System is our region's safety net institution and provides care to a largely indigent population. UT Medicine primary and specialty care to these patients. This is a high priority patient pop ulation- largely minority (Mexican-American) and low income. These patients are in great need of targeted support to improve hea lth outcomes - this effort will be informed by these longitudinal chronic disease registries. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Other groups with RHP proposals that have similar projects to our implementation of a chronic disease management registry will be asked to form a learni ng collaborative. These providers include University Hospital who is a central partner in this shared registry and patient support program, Baptist Medical Center that shares many patients with UT Medicine , and San Antonio Metropolitan Health District that supports all efforts to improve th e health of our region's populati on. Currently, UTHSCSA has a close working relationship to University Hospital through se veral projects and through its support of our Center for Research to Advance Community Health. Many of the faculty members at UTHSCSA are also providers at University Hospital. Baptist Medical Ce nter is a partner in provi ding health care and has been very supportive of UT Medici ne initiatives such as a new re gional children's hospital. The San Antonio Metropolitan Health District is a close partner of UT Medicine on projects as well as in sharing data on the health status of our residents. Plan for Learning Collaborative: The learning collaborative will be formed such that organizations are able to share ideas, challenges and develop solutions. The lear ning collaborative will bring participati ng sites together via conference call once a quarter where project-level goals are discussed and other projects are able to learn. A face-to-face meeting will occur once a year at the CTSA CER meeting where inform atics is the topic of discussion. During this meeting, those belonging to the learning collaborative along w ith others outside of the region are able to share knowledge and partic ipating sites are able to learn from the successes/challenges of other sites. Metrics will be used to measure success of the learning collaborative (e.g. Ne twork affinity, rate of spread). We propose to develop linkages to ot her groups around the country that have developed registries to learn from their expe riences and to guide our initiatives to improve clinical outcomes: these include the UT Houston (Dr. Bernst am), UT Southwestern (Dr. Halm); University of Pennsylvania (Dr. Day); and MGH (Dr. Atlas). Project Valuation: Achieves Waiver Goals: This project assures that patients on Medicaid, CareLink or self-pay --will receive evidence-based patient-centered care with high value se rvices that will ultimately reduce the risk of complications of these chronic diseases and thereby re duce use of costly urge nt care services and reduce unnecessary tests/services. Prev ious research on the effectiveness of patient registries show that they facilitate identification of at-risk patients and, fo r diabetics, can direct progr ams to help patients met HbA1c control goals and reduce complicat ions as well as costs of care . Address Community Need(s): This project addresses community priority needs described in the Community Health Improvement Plan for Bexar C ounty for: Healthy Eating and Active Living and 394 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Behavioral and Mental Well- Being. Priority health issues addressed by this project include diabetes, obesity and hypertension. Registries are increasingly adopted nationally to effectivel y characterize patient health care needs and respond with appropriate interventions . Through the diabetes and other registries, we will make this unique resource available to providers and patients in order to guide efforts to achieve the goals of the Community Health Improvement Plan for Bexar County. Project Scope: All the proposed database registries will include approximately 10,000 patients and 30 providers. Providers who are recruite d and trained in using these data will be more empowered to improve patient outcomes by targeting interventi ons and support to those who need it most. The cost of diabetes is high (as of 2007, $91.8 billion in direct costs and $39.8 billion spent on indirect expenses) and rising. Previous research estimates costs will be decreased if we are able to decrease hemoglobin A1c in patients with comorbid heart disease and hyper tension from an average of 9 to 10% to an average of 6% to 7% (a $2,536 cost differential accrued over 3 years) (Gilmer TP, O'Connor PJ, Rush WA, et al., 2005). Similarly to diabetes, obesity and hypertension also have high costs. Co sts attributable to ove rweight and obesity in Texas in 2001 totaled $10.5 b illion including $4.2 billion in direct costs for health care, $5.2 billion in indirect costs for lost pr oductivity due to mortality and $1.1 billion in indirect costs for lost productivity due to morbidity (Texas Department of State Hea lth Services, 2004). In 2010, hypertension was projected to cost the United States $93.5 billion in health ca re services, medications, and missed days of work. (Heidenreich, Trogdon, Khavjou, Butler, Dracup, Ezekowitz , et al., 2011). Project Investment: The expected investment in this program for Human Resources will include the cost of trainers, promotoras, project coordinator a nd the data mining team. Equipment purchase and maintenance will be covered by our accompanying projec t to develop a Health Information Exchange - making this a relatively cost-effect ive project. The time to implemen tation of updated diabetes and HIV registries will be one year which will be used to complete the registry a nd hire and train staff in use of the registry. Subsequent hypertension re gistry will be completed in year 2-3 and staff trained by year 4. Several organizational priorities w ill be met by the development of th ese longitudinal chronic disease registries but the most important is to insure that we provide comprehensive, value-based care that improves the health of the vulnerable populations that we serve.

Nadeau, MD Performing Provider TPI: 085144601 Project Summary: Provider : The University of Texas Health Science Cent er at San Antonio serv es San Antonio and the 50,000 square-mile area of South Texas. It exte nds to campuses in the metropolitan border communities of Laredo and the Rio Grande Valley. More than 3,000 students a year train in an environment that involves more than 100 affiliated hospitals, clinics and hea lth care facilities in South Texas. Intervention(s) : Clearly state the intervention(s).Example: This project will increase the number of primary care physicians trained in San Antonio by increasing the size of the UTHSCSA Family Medicine Residency. Need for the project : Texas has a severe shortage of prim ary care physicians. Recruiting agencies are currently reporti ng that these positions are hard to re cruit physicians into since there is a nationwide shortage. The best solu tion is to train more primary car e physicians here is San Antonio since many residency graduates practi ce nearby to where they train. Target population : The Target population ultimately is all patients in South Texas since there is a general shortage of primary care. During training, residents will see an underserved, underinsured population of patients in San Antonio. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : More graduates from the Fami ly Medicine residency will mean more primary care physicians in South Texas. Most of our graduate pr actice in Texas, many stay in San Antonio. Category 3 outcomes: Right care in right setting and patien t centeredness: 15 % increase of primary care visits in the FHC during years 4 and 5 Number of residents who remain in South Texas to practice after 2 years. Expected increase is 10% Project Description: Brief Description: Increase the number of primar y care physicians in Sout h Texas by increasing the number of Family Medicine residents in training. Goal: Increase residency from 12 reside nts per year to 13 residents per year. Expected Outcome: In year one, in crease to 39 residents in training w ith 13 graduates per year with increases in number of faculty members and patient visits consistent with the growth. Challenges/Issues: The major challenge for this pr oject is the funding. Curre ntly, we have 38 funded positions. Two of three classes are on 4 week schedules. The other class rotates on a monthly schedule. All funded positions are filled, and fa culty are maximally engages. Additional faculty support would be important. 401 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA A longer term vision would be to grow the program to 15 residents per year, then to 18 residents per year. The patient care base exists to develop the residency to this size. However, a project of that magnitude requires coordination, approval and s upport from many outside organization, including the ACGME, other university department and Univer sity Health System. More space is needed in the FHC and more CareLink patients and Medicaid Pediatric patient s assigned to our practice. Several additional faculty members would be needed for the larger expansion, and it takes time to develop or hire faculty members. We would need 240 more deliveries pe r year to train the residents, which would require coordination and support from OB/Gyn. We likely woul d need the support of other departments to help us ensure that we ha ve the right inpatient experiences for a quality residency. Other support needed fr om other departments should not be a major issue. By the 5 year point, the residency should be able to have 15 resi dents per year, with the po ssibility of being ready to recruit the first class of 18 residents at that time. Quality: To achieve continuous quality improvement we shall assess the projects impact and make adjustments as necessary, share best practice a nd lessons learned, seize scaling opportunities to expand successful outcomes to broader populations, and rapidly disseminate successful outcomes to other providers across Texas. Region 6 goals: This project achieves CMS's Triple aim objectives of assuring patients receive high quality and patient centered care, in the most cost effective wa y, improves the health care in frastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured re sidents of the counties we serve, further develops and maintains a coordinated care delivery system and improves out comes while containing costs. CMS does have a system to support graduate medical education nationwide which includes funding for resident salaries which is paid to the hospitals. There are no other federal funds involved in the project. Starting Point/Baseline: The residency practice sees over 30,000 visits per year. Increasing the resident complement will increase the amount of patient care provided in addition to increasing the amount of training. The number of patients that can be en rolled into the clinic as a Pati ent Centered Medical Home should increase consistent with the incr ease in number of visits. Increasi ng to 15 residents per year should increase the number of patient vi sits by 15,000 and the number of patient s enrolled in the clinic as a Patient Centered Medical Home by 3000. Rationale: Texas has a growing shortage of primary care doc tors due to increasing population and an aging Of the population. There is a decline in the number of medical students choo sing primary care. Only a very small percentage of Intern al Medicine and Pediat ric residency graduates do primary care as the majority of their career. Th e most important number in dete rmining the number of physicians doing primary care in the future is the number of Family Medicine resi dency training slots. Qualified applicants are available for an expanded number of positions. It is difficult to recruit and hire primary care phys icians. The shortage of primary care providers has contributed to increased wait times in hospitals , community clinics, a nd other care settings. Expanding the primary care workforce will increase access and give patients an opportunity to have 402 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA a personal physician and a Patient Centered Medical Home, which should improve quality and reduce costs. Expansion of Family Medicine residency slots will strengthen an integrated health care system and play a key role in impl ementing disease management programs. A greater focus on primary care will be crucial to the success of an integrated health care system. Furthermore, in order to effectively operate in a medical home model, there is a need for residency and training programs to expand the capabilities of primary ca re providers and other staff to effectively provide team-based care and manage population health. In 2010, Texas ranked 47 in the number of primary care patients per 100,000 population. Increasing medical school enrollment, as has occurred in Te xas will have no effect on the problem since the number of residency positions in the state in inadequate in most specialties and especially inadequate in Family Medicine The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board recommends a ratio of 1.1 entry level GME positions for each Texas medical school graduate. To get to this number, 400 additional GME Positions are needed. The shortage of GME positions for primary care is the most important aspect of the state's physician shortage. CN.3 Addresses provider shortage needs CN.2 By addressing provider shortages disparitie s in health outcomes will also be addressed Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): Appropriate Care, Appropriate Setting Reduced ED utilization By increasing the number of primary care physicians coming into the system from local training programs, patients in South Texas will have better access to primary care services in the Patient Centered Medical Home. There is ample eviden ce that services in this setting are more comprehensive and are delivered at lower cost. By improving access to primary care, fewer patients will need to rely on local Emerge ncy Departments of on going care. Relationship to other Projects: The project will support and reinfo rce the Advanced Primary Care, Enhance PCMH infrastructure project. We will work closely with that group to incorporate The training curriculum developed for the medical assistants will be directly relevant to that project as will lessons learned about implementing elements of the medical home. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Plan for Learning Collaborative: I am aware of some early discussions about creat ing a Family Medicine re sidency in McAllen at Doctors Hospital Renaissance. There is some hope that this can be associated w ith DSRIP. If this concept becomes a reality, there will be opportuni ties for collaboration on ac tivities to grow the number of primary care physicians in South Texas. 403 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Project Valuation: The project is valued based upon achieving waiver goals, meeting community needs, increasing the scope of services available to the community, and resource s deployed. Although the outcome domain chosen targets number of physicians in training, each additional trainee is expected to graduate from residency. Since 90% of physician practice near wher e they train, this should greatly increase the number of practici ng primary care physicians in Texa s, including Health Profession Shortage Areas. Improved availability of services can be expected to improve health outcomes for the communities of South Texas. 404 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 085144601.1.3 PASS 1 1.2 1.2.3 1.2.3 Increase the number of residency/training program for faculty/staff to support an expanded, more updated program: Residency Expansion for Family Medicine Residency UTHSCSA University of Texas Health Scienc e Center at San Antonio TPI - 085144601 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 085144601.3.4 3.IT9.2 ED appropriate utilization Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P-X]Match 1 additional resident (13 total) Start date for training 1 July 2013 Metric 1 [P-X.1] 13 total residents hired for the class entering July of 2013 Baseline/Goal: [Report number of residents interviewed and matched to the residency.

DY2 will be used to develop baseline data for the number of specialty care clinic visits and patient satisfa ction scores related to referral access issues. Target population : UT Medicine provides care for ove r 205,000 unique patients per year. 17% are covered by Medicaid, 17% by Carelink (the local county indigent cove rage program) and 5% are self-pay. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The percentage of UT Me dicine specialty clinics accepting referrals via EpicCareLink will be 10% in DY3, 50% in DY4 and 90% in DY5. The volume of care provided by UT Medicine specialty clinics will increase by 5% over baseline each year from DY3 through DY5. Assuming a base line of 20,000 specialty care visits per year in DY2 the increase would re sult in 21,000 visits in DY 3, 22,050 in DY4 and 23,152 in DY5. Category 3 outcomes: In DY 2 the focus will be on pr oject planning, establishing baseline patient satisfaction scores and developing and testing the EpicCareLink referral system. Once baseline satisfaction scores are available the outcome improvement target for DY 3-5 will be determined. DY 3 will be devoted to conduc ting Plan Do Study Act (PDSA) cycles, disseminating findings through learning colla boratives and beginning to demonstrate improvement in patient satisfaction scores. Th e focus in DY 4-5 will be continued improvement in patient satisfaction scores. Project Description: UT Medicine San Antonio is an academic medical practice which includes physicians from more than 60 different medical specialties and sub-sp ecialties from the facu lty of the School of Medicine at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. As such, UT Medicine fills a critical role as a major provide r of medical specialty ca re for South Texas. The current phone based system of referring patient s to UT Medicine for specialty care is cumbersome, inefficient, and fr ustrating for primary care physicia ns and presents a significant barrier to specialty care for pa tients in need of those servi ces. The process of communicating patient information from UT Medicine specialists back to referring physician s yields inconsistent 408 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA and often unsatisfactory results. This observation is consistent with the conclusion drawn in the 2010 Bexar County Health Assessment th at care is often fragmented. Patients needing specialty care are at high-risk of admissi ons and/or readmissions, and streamlining their access to specialty physicians can help manage their conditions and therefore avoid unnecessary ED utilization, hosp italizations or readmissions. The goal of this project is to make the specialty care serv ices of UT Medicine more accessible to non-UT Medicine physicians throughout the South Texas area thro ugh the implementation of a web based, HIPAA compliant, referral portal integrated with UT Medicine's EpicCare electronic health record (EHR) system. This portal will enable prim ary care physicians throughout South Texas to arrange for referrals online and subsequently a ccess their patients' hea lth information in UT Medicine's EHR system. In addition, UT Medici ne will add marketing staff to promote the use of the referral portal and referral manageme nt staff to process electronic referrals. The 5-year expected outcome of this project is to make 90% of UT Medicine Specialty Clinics accessible through the EpicCareLink electronic refe rral system while significantly increasing the volume of specialty clinic visits at UT Medicine. Quality: To achieve continuous quality improvement we shall assess the projects impact and make adjustments as necessary, share best practice a nd lessons learned, seize scaling opportunities to expand successful outcomes to broader populat ions, and rapidly disseminate successful outcomes to other prov iders across Texas. Region 6 goals: This project achieves CMS's Triple aim objectives of assuring patients receive high quality and patient centered care, in the most cost effectiv e way, improves the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsur ed residents of the counties we serve, further develops and maintains a coordinated care de livery system and improves outcomes while containing costs. Starting Point/Baseline: UT Medicine does not have a system in plac e to accept electronic referrals from non-UT Medicine physicians. DY2 will be used to develop baseline data for the number of specialty care clinic visits and patient satisfaction scores related to referral access issues. Rationale: The overall goal of this projec t is to increase referrals fr om non-UT Medicine physicians throughout the South Texas area to specialty care services at UT Medicine. An increase in referrals will allow UT Medicine to further expand capacity to meet the need for specialty care throughout the RHP. Ultimately more patients will have access to specialty care and their wait times for specialty appointments will decr ease. Improved communica tion between referring providers and UT Medicine specialists will result in improved care overall. In order to achieve these goals UT Medicine will implement a robust referral management system to ensure that referrals are processed, reviewed and the patient' s clinical issue addressed in a timely manner. The community need addressed by this project is health in formation technology to improve physicians' lines of communication and heal th care quality (RHP 6 Community Needs Assessment). The project option for this proposal is 1.9.2 - Improve access to specialty care with components c) Implement transparent, standa rdized referrals across the system . d) 409 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Conduct quality improvement for the project in the form of Plan Do Study Act cycles focusing on identifying and addressing key challenges. Co mponents a, and b are beyond the scope of this project. We are unaware of any projects currently unde rway at UTHSCSA funded by the US Department of Health and Human Serv ices serving a similar purpose as this project. CN.1 This project meets the community need for enhanced quality of care. CN.3 This project meets the community need fo r enhanced access to health care services. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-6 Patient Satisfaction IT-6.1 Percent improvement over baseline of patient sa tisfaction scores, item 3 patient's rating of doctor access to specialist The RHP 6 needs assessment has id entified access to specialty care as a key health challenge for the region, and continued population growth is expect ed to exacerbate this problem in the future. A large academic medical center in the Midwestern US addressed a problem with specialty care access by implementing a web-based referral system , showing that referrals generated through that system were more than twice as likely to le ad to a scheduled visit with a specialty physician (Weiner, M, El Hoyek, G. A web-based generali st-specialist system to improve scheduling of outpatient specialty consultations in an academ ic center. J Gen Intern Med. 2009 Jun;24(6):710- 5). We have selected the Cate gory 3 outcome measure of IT-6.1 Percent improvement over baseline of patient satisfaction scores, item 3 patient's rating of doctor access to specialist (Standalone measure). The baseline for this meas ure will be determined in year 2 using data obtained from supplemental modules for the adult CG-CAHPS survey. Relationship to other Projects: This project is related conceptually to the proposal submitted by UTHSCSA - Implement a Shared Electronic Health Record (EHR) System. Wh ile this project opens a referral portal for physicians in the region, the shared EHR project would make the complete EHR available to unaffiliated physicians. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Given the nature of this project, there is either a direct or indir ect relationship to all other projects in the region. Plan for Learning Collaborative: University Health System, as the RHP 6 an chor, will promote and facilitate learning collaboratives through the formation of work ing groups of performing providers who are pursuing similar projects. These working gr oups will develop their learning collaborative structure which may include the following: identi fy participants, establish learning collaborative goals, develop a calendar of regular meetings, site visits, and/or conference calls, develop a plan to communicate ideas, data, and successes across the region and state, organize a learning event and invite experts and other pe rforming providers from outside the region to share knowledge and best practices. 410 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Project Valuation: In 2010 Bexar county had 14,769 potentially preventa ble hospitalizations costing approximately $370,000,000 at $25,212 per hospitalization (www.dshs.sta te.tx.us/ph). Access to specialty care will reduce the number of potentially preventabl e hospitalizations as well as preventable emergency department visits. We anticipate that this project will prevent at least 80 hospitalizations over the project peri od resulting in a savings of $2,016,960. 411 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 085144601.1.4 PASS 1 1.9.2 NA 1.9.2 Improve access to specialty care: I MPLEMENT EPICCARELINK REFERRAL PORTAL University of Texas Health Scienc e Center at San Antonio TPI - 085144601 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 085144601.3.5 3.IT-6.1 Percent improvement over base line of patient satisfaction scores - patient's rating of doctor access to specialist Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P-7]: Complete a planning process/submit a plan to implement electronic referral technology.

It extends to campuses in the metropolitan border communities of Laredo and the Rio Grande Valley. More than 3,000 students a year train in an environment that i nvolves more than 100 affiliated hospitals, clinics and health care facilities in South Texas. Intervention(s) : This project will implement a Health Information Exchange (HIE) which will automate the flow of key clinical information between disparate EHR systems. Data in the HIE will be used to populate a chronic disease regi stry enabling effective population management. Need for the project : UT Medicine and University Health System do not exchange health information in a meaningful way, and neither or ganization shares information with the local (HIE) - HASA. UT Medicine does not curren tly maintain a Chronic Disease Management Registry. Target population : University Health System provides ca re to more than 230,000 unique patients every year. 19% are covered by Medicaid and 43% are self-pay. UT Medicine provides care for over 205,000 unique patients per year. 17% ar e covered by Medicaid, 17% by Carelink (the local county indigent co verage program) and 5% are self-p ay. Many patients overlap between University Health System and UT Medicine. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The Chronic Disease Management Registry Committee (CDMRC) will meet on at least a quarterly basis to evaluate registry functionality, guide enhancements to the data capture system, and expand the clinical use of the registry for identification and recall of targeted patients. The project seeks to a dd 1% of active patients to the registry in DY2, 5% by DY3, 10% by DY4 and 20% by DY5.

In DY 3 we will begin to conduct Plan Do Study Act (PDSA) cycles to improve data collection and interventi on activities, disseminate our findings to other groups and reduce the percentage of diabetic pa tients with HbA1C > 9.0% by 1% compared to the baseline that will be determined in DY 2. In DY 4 we will reduce the percentage of diabetic patients with HbA1C > 9.0% by anot her 1%. In DY 5 we will reduce the percentage of diabetic patients with HbA1C > 9.0% by another 1%, resu lting in a reduction of 3% by the end of the waiver. No other federal funds are utilized in this project. Project Description: UT Medicine and University Health System sh are thousands of patient s and hundreds of medical 415 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA staff, yet have separate electr onic health record (EHR) systems that do not currently exchange health information in a meaningful way, thus presenting many challenges for patient care, particularly with transi tions of care. This pr oject will address the lack of connectivity between UT Medicine, University Health System and the community Health Information Exchange (HIE) Healthcare Access San Antonio ( HASA). This project achieves CM S's Triple aim objectives of assuring patients receive high quality and patient centered care, in the most cost effective way, improves the health care infrastructure to bette r serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of the counties we serve, further develops and ma intains a coordinated care delivery system and improves outcomes while containing costs. Patient care is currently negatively impacted by the inaccessibility of the UT Medicine ambulatory EHR in the University Health System Emergency Department and Hospital. When a patient who receives specialty or primary care services at a UT Medicine clinic using the EpicCare EHR presents for care at the University Hospital Emergency Department the ED personnel do not have immediate access to informa tion in EpicCare and therefore must rely on patient supplied data regarding past medical history, current medical problems, medications, allergies, diagnostic tests, etc. In this scenario the lack of access to key clinical information prolongs the patient's stay in the ED, and may result in dup licated diagnostic tests or a preventable hospital admission. Patient safety could be placed at risk if the information supplied by the patient is incomplete or inaccurate. With a functional HIE the HIE client application within the ED's EHR system woul d alert ED personnel to the availa bility of important clinical information from the ambulatory EHR and at the same time make that information immediately available. A 13 month study in Memphis, Tennessee found that accessing HIE data was associated with a decrease in hospital admissions and statistically significant decreases in head CT use, body CT use, and laboratory test or dering (Frisse ME, Johnson KB, Nian H. The financial impact of health information exch ange on emergency department care. J Am Med Inform Assoc 2012 19: 328-333.). The following scenario describes a patient admitted to University Hospital and discharged with a follow up appointment with their UT Medicine PCP or a UT Medicine Specialist. The results of several important diagnostic studies are pending at the time of discharge. The patient misses their hospital follow up appointment due to transpor tation issues that are beyond their control. Inadequate access to transportation services is a frequent barrier to seeking health care and accessing community resources among Bexar reside nts (2010 Bexar County Health Assessment. p. 224). The results of the diagnostic studies rev eal a potentially serious new health problem, but these results never made their way through a cumbersome paper system to the patient's UT Medicine PCP or Specialty Physician. With the HIE's patient list management feature the PCP would have been alerted to the patient's admi ssion and discharge and they would receive the results of studies that become available after the patent's discharge. Next, consider how the currently fragmented medical record negatively impacts UT Medicine's ability to optimally manage high risk patients su ch as a poorly controlle d diabetic patient who has been recently discharged from the hospital. As UT Medicine transitions to the Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) model of car e more emphasis is being placed on identifying, tracking, and performing outreach to high risk pa tients. The current manual system for tracking high risk patients recently discharged from th e hospital is inefficient and ineffective. By 416 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA implementing a Chronic Disease Management Regist ry which automatically captures data from UT Medicine and University Health System, via their shared HIE, and ot her local hospitals and providers, via the community HIE, it will beco me possible to proactively manage recently discharged high risk patients in an efficient manner, ensuring that they return for important post discharge clinic visits and rece ive important support services so that they avoid unnecessary hospital readmissions. Five year expected outcomes include: Glycemic control of patients with diabetes mellitus will improve. The Chronic Disease Management Registry Committee (CDMRC) will meet on at least a quarterly basis to evaluate registry functiona lity, guide enhancements to the data capture system, and expand the clinical use of the regi stry for identification and recall of targeted patients. The HIE will include data from at least 20 percent of active patients and, where applicable, data from those patients w ill be used to populate the Chronic Disease Management Registry. Quality: To achieve continuous quality improvement we shall assess the projects impact and make adjustments as necessary, share best practice a nd lessons learned, seize scaling opportunities to expand successful outcomes to broader populat ions, and rapidly disseminate successful outcomes to other prov iders across Texas. Region 6 goals: This project achieves CMS's Triple aim objectives of assuring patients receive high quality and patient centered care, in the most cost effectiv e way, improves the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsur ed residents of the counties we serve, further develops and maintains a coordinated care de livery system and improves outcomes while containing costs. Starting Point/Baseline: UT Medicine San Antonio is an academic medi cal practice including physicians from primary care and more than 60 different medical special ties and sub-specialties from the faculty of the School of Medicine at the Univ ersity of Texas Health Scienc e Center at San Antonio and provides access to critical servi ces to residents of Bexar county and South Texas. UT Medicine operates 13 clinics in the San An tonio area. In addition, many UT Medicine physicians care for patients at University Health System clinics, a nd University Hospital. University Hospital, is a Bexar county owned 498 bed hospital, is one of just 15 Level I trauma centers in Texas, and the lead trauma center for all of South Texas. The Em ergency Center at University Hospital is the busiest in the region and averages nearly 70,000 vi sits each year. In addition, University Health System provides a broad range of healthcare serv ices at multiple clinic locations, including the Robert B. Green Campus, Texas Diabetes Institute, 13 neighbor hood clinics across the community, five urgent-care clinics (ExpressMed) and four outpatient renal dialysis centers. Healthcare Access San Antonio (HASA) is a 501 (c)(3) community colla borative initi ative to enhance access to health and medical care for Ce ntral Texas residents through health information exchange (HIE). At baseline UT Medicine and University Health System do not exchange health information in a meaningful way, and neither orga nization shares information with HASA. UT medicine does not 417 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA currently maintain a Chronic Disease Management Registry Rationale: San Antonio has a majority Hispanic populati on and Hispanic/Latino Americans are 2 times more likely to have diabetes than non-Hispanic wh ites. Diabetes is the 6t h leading cause of death in Texas, the 4th leading cause of death in Bexar County and affect s 11.8% of the population. The overall target goal of this project is the implementation of a state of the art Chronic Disease Management Registry built on the foundation of a new health information exchange (HIE) system. Chronic disease care is the specific i ssue and need noted in the Community Needs Assessment that this project will address. Automating the flow of key clinical informati on between disparate EHR systems will vastly improve the safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of care transitions between University Health System and UT Medicine. According to the Roadmap to Better Care Transitions and Fewer Readmissions (US Department of Health and Human Services. http://www.healthcare.gov/compare/partnership -for-patients/safety/transitions.html) \"safe, effective and efficient care transitions should include...standardized and accurate communication and information exchange betwee n the transferring and receiving provider in time to allow the receiving provider to effectively care for the patient.\" All of the following required co re project components will be a part of th is project. a) Enter patient data into uni que chronic disease registry b) Use registry data to proac tively contact, educate, and track patients by disease status, risk status, self-management status, community and family need. c) Use registry reports to develop and implement targeted QI plan d) Conduct quality improvement activities for th e project using methods such as rapid cycle improvement. Activities may includ e: identifying project impacts, identifying \"lessons learned,\" opportunities to scale all or part of the projec t to a broader patient population, and identifying key challenges associated with expansion of th e project, including spec ial considerations for safety net populations We are unaware of any projects currently unde rway at UTHSCSA funded by the US Department of Health and Human Servi ces serving a similar purpose as this project.

The db Motion HIE will populate the data warehouse described in this proposal. This project is also rela ted to the proposal submitte d by University Health System - Build a Registry for Chronic Diseases. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Given the nature of this project, there is either a direct or indir ect relationship to all other projects in the region. Plan for Learning Collaborative: University Health System, as the RHP 6 an chor, will promote and facilitate learning collaboratives through the formation of work ing groups of performing providers who are pursuing similar projects. These working gr oups will develop their learning collaborative structure which may include the following: identi fy participants, establish learning collaborative goals, develop a calendar of regular meetings, site visits, and/or conference calls, develop a plan to communicate ideas, data, and successes across the region and state, organize a learning event and invite experts and other pe rforming providers from outside the region to share knowledge and best practices. Project Valuation: In 2010 alone Bexar county had 14,769 potentia lly preventable hospitalizations costing approximately $372,000,000 at $25,212 per hospitalizat ion (www.dshs.state.tx.us/ph). Access to specialty care will reduce the number of potenti ally preventable hospitalizations as well as preventable emergency department visits. We cons ervatively anticipate that this project will prevent at least 500 hospitalizations over the four year project period resulting in a total savings of $12,606,000. 419 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 085144601.1.5 PASS 1 1.3.2 N/A 1.3.2 OTHER PROJECT OPTION : POPULATE A CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT REGISTRY USING A HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE SYSTEM WHICH COMBINES AMBULATORY AND HOSPITAL DATA University of Texas Health Scienc e Center at San Antonio TPI - 085144601 Related Category 3 Outcome 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P-3] Develop cross-functional team to evaluate registry program Metric 1 [P-3.1] Documentation of personnel (clinical, IT, administrative) assigned to evaluate registry program Baseline/Goal: Team will meet on a regular basis as the Chronic Disease Management Registry Committee (CDMRC) to evaluate and improve the registry program.

The intervention will increase acce ss to specialty care providers of SUD treatment by 1) recruiting addi ction specialists to struct ure and support the evidence- based treatment programs necessary for de veloping Psychology and an American Council on Graduate Medical Education (A CGME)-approved Addictions Psychiatry program; 2) providing the eviden ce-based treatment by psychi atrists, advanced practice nurses, psychologists and social work car e providers utilizing evidenced-based medication prescription and motivational and co gnitive behavioral therapy (CBT); and 3) providing advanced SUD treatment training for Psychiatry Residents and Fellows as well as Psychology Interns and Fellows, advanced practice nurse trainees, and social work students. Need for the project : SUDs are highly prevalent conditions in Bexar County and there are an insufficient number of SUD treat ment programs or community treatment providers; even less that use evidence-based approaches; and none that take the sustained treatment approach to prevent relapse. The STOP Program will implement two evidence-based initiatives to support in creased access to innovative care in the underserved community. First, we plan a training program involving multidisciplinary teams including psychiatry, psychology, nursi ng, and social work. In this model, psychological therapies are considered essent ial, but for many patients, not sufficient approaches to care. Many patients also re quire medications and social work outpatient case management approaches to treatment - especially given the prevalence of dual diagnosis psychiatric needs in the population. The Transitio n Care Clinic (TCC) in the Dept. Psychiatry is successfully taking this approach to training multidisciplinary teams in the transitional care and outpatient stabi lization of acutely ill community psychiatry patients. Not only are the training ex periences of trainees improved by the 422 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA multidisciplinary environment, but also, patient care needs are more comprehensively met in a coordinated fashion by the multiple disciplines working together. Our second innovation is the deployment of multidimen sional treatments in an outcomes-based approach. Most treatment clinics have a uni tary treatment model (i.e., medication plus counseling, or 12-step group etc.) that all patients receive when they attend that clinic. However, research shows that only some 20-50% of patients entering treatment will demonstrate desirable outcomes and clearly, some patients are more likely to benefit with a particular approach (i.e., some benefit mo re than others with Cognitive therapies or some will do better in individua l therapy than in group, etc.). This is the reason that evidence-based programs such as the Nexus Program in Dallas attempt to provide multiple different treatment options so that pa tients can access the continuum of care they most need at the time. The STOP program will add the innovation that current patient outcome will be monitored for individual patients so that patient care is individualized and maximized to match the individual patient needs. Target population: Patients with SUDs in University Health System. The program will target recently hospitalized patients or thos e that are at high risk for hospitalization. Milestone Achievement benefits : Yr02 , we expect to hire the necessary staff to conduct our preliminary Gap Analysis, hire and train a Licensed Practical Nurse to a ssure an initial launch of the STOP Program and begin seeing at least 100 pa tients; and to recruit an A ddiction's Psychiatrist; an Addiction's Psychologist; and hire and train a Psychology Fellow and a Social Worker. Yr03 , we will have hired and credentialed a ll Faculty necessary to train at least 2 Psychiatry Residents, 2 Psyc hology Interns and 1 Fellow, 1 Nurse Practice student, and 1 Social Worker who will provide trea tment for at least 800 patients. Yr04 The STOP program will expand by seeing more patients (at least 1200) and including more trainees at least 3 Psychiatry Residents, 2 Psychology Interns and 2 Fellows, 2 Nurse Practice students, and 2 Soci al Workers. We also expect to have established an ACGME accredited Addicti on's Fellowship and to begin recruiting Psychiatry Fellows though they may not be in place till later in the year. Yr05 will finally demonstrate the full potential of the STOP Program by training 4 Psychiatry Residents, and 2 Psychiatry Fellows, 3 Psychology Interns and 2 Psychology Fellows, 3 Nurse Practice students, and 3 So cial Workers who will staff at least 1900 community patients. The STOP Program will provide direct patien t care for at least 4,000 SUD patients in a multidisciplinary environment where we will expand capacity by also training Psychiatry, Psychology, Social Work, and Nursing students outcomes-based programs to reduce hospitalization or rehospitalization. T hough the program will take some time to build momentum, the recruitment of new f aculty and growth in training programs are critically important steps to assure a growing and conti nued supply of community-based providers to address the overwhelmi ng need of community SUD patients. Category 3 outcomes: Our goal is to reduce poten tially preventable admissions and readmissions to University Hospital. Preventable substance-related 30 day readmissions to the hospital will be reduced by at least 10%. 423 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Project Description: Substance Use Disorders (SUD), including al coholism and drug dependence (including opiate, cocaine, and methamphetamine) are psychiatric conditi ons that are highly prevalent in Bexar Country. The majority of people with an SUD also suffer from a chronic general medical condition or another psychiatric disorder and they contribute disproportionally to emergency room visi ts and complicated inpatient hospital admissions. Drug addiction may direc tly cause or exacerbate pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, and in fectious diseases that cost the county-area hospitals millions of dollars in health serv ices each year. Further, people who are impaired due to use of an addictive substance have very high rates of trauma due to falls and motor vehicle accidents. For example, the annual number of deaths associated with accidental overdose or abuse of prescripti on opiates tripled in Bexar County between 2000 and 2010. The relatively small cost of tr eatment for alcohol or drug addiction results in multifold-increases in economic cost savings to the community in the form of reduced health care expense, reduced criminal justice expe nse, and increased economic productivity of rehabilitated patients. Th e scientific evidence-basis for treatment indicates that no one treatment works for a ll patients, but that effective outpatient intervention and long-term support (months to years) is necessary to affect long-term rehabilitation. Unfortunatel y, there are insufficient commun ity provider resources to address the needs identified in the 2 010 Community Health Assessment for Bexar County; Lifestyle Behavior s, Alcohol Consumption . Therefore we propose to expand SUD special ty care capacity through infrastructure development (Category 1, Project Area 1.9.1) laying the foundation for delivery system transformation by increasing the number of pr oviders of evidence-based interventions for SUD. in order to reduce the unnecessary us e of hospital and emergency room services by patients in Bexar County. Currently, there ar e an insufficient range of evidence-based treatment options or integrated care program s in the community to help patients access the psychological and psychiat ric continuum of care that many patients require or over the time-periods that are required. Through the establishment of a clinical training program for treatment of SUDs, this propos al will expand both the number of trainees that choose this area of training, the number of future providers for these services, and establish a program that supports access to specialty providers through a continuum of care of available treatment options. Finally, the program will enhance the continuity of patient care necessary to esta blish and sustain reha bilitation. UT Health Science Center will establish the S ustained T reatment as an O utpatient P riority (STOP) Program to support evidence-based clin ical care and training oppor tunities for Psychiatry, Psychology, and Nursing Professionals in training. Through a collaboration with University Health System Primary Care Clinics, the STOP Program will expand the specialty care capacity in the area of S UDs and increase access to specialty care providers of SUD treatment by 1) recruiting addiction speciali sts to structure and support the evidence-based treatment programs nece ssary for developing an American Council on Graduate Medical Educati on (ACGME)-approved Addictions Psychiatry Fellowship program; 2) providing direct service to pa tients utilizing evidenced-based approaches; and 3) providing advanced SUD treatment trai ning for Psychiatry Residents and Fellows, Psychology Interns and Fellows, and Advanced Practice Nurse trainees. All necessary 424 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA treatment planning and coordination, care pr ovision, and training supervision will be achieved through the STOP program. Care w ill be provided within the context of a medical home model integrated into Universi ty Health System primary care clinics, providing for integration of behavioral hea lthcare into the medical environment. Consequently, the capacity, continuum, and cont inuity of outpatient care for SUD will be substantially increased. The STOP Program will enhance medication-treatment capacity and multimodal individual and group thera py options including c ognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) which all have an evidence basis for outpatient detoxification, active intervention, relapse preven tion, and long-term maintenan ce of rehabilitation. The multimodal treatment environment provides evidence-based mental health training in community primary care environments. It also expands the breadth a nd depth of services in University Health System and increases th e continuum and continu ity of care available to patients. The theoretical framework for the STOP Program is to provide Psychiatry, Psychology, and Psychiatric Advanced Practi ce Nurse Specialist tr aining within an interdisciplinary evidence-based clinic pr oviding psychiatric, psychological, and behavioral interventions at the acuity level necessary to achieve validated outcomes of success. Behavioral and motivational proced ures will be used along with validated and standardized assessments to enhance traini ng and program outcome. Urine drug screens will validate outcome, and medication cost subsidies will support evidence-based medication for patients without adequate financial means. The STOP Program will include a variety of medication and therapy ap proaches so that patients unsuccessfully- treated in one modality can switch to alternat ive care in a \"patient-matching\" approach that evidentially works for them. Finally, th e STOP Program will support a rehabilitative maintenance clinic whereby psychiatric or relapse preventative medication can be maintained over time-periods of 6 months to 2 years after initial treatment and patients can return for supplemental therapy or booster therapy as necessary to prevent relapse. The STOP Program will consist of 2 Psychi atrists, 2 Advanced Practice Nurses, 1 Psychologist, and one Social wo rker as core faculty to pr ovide direct patient care and supervision of a multidisciplinary group of up to 8 Psychiatry Residents and Fellows, Psychology Interns and Fellows, and Psychiat ric Advanced Practice Nurse each year. The faculty alone will increase the capacity to provide SUD specialty care in our community, but the community provider base ca n be expected to grow with the addition of trainees graduating fro m our program with community programs expertise and interests in SUD specialty treatment. The overall goal of the STOP Program is to increase the number of residents/trainees choosing the targeted shortage area of SUD treatment while increasing service availability by developing a novel program that will provide rapid a ccess to a continuum of care options for SUD intervention. This program will: (a) benefit individuals by treating the underlying SUD-problems and allo w them to remain productive members of the community; (b) benefit the RHP by directly reducing costs associated with ER visits and hospitalization, exacerbation of general medi cal illness, and redu ce the need for other community services including emergency and medical services, as well as reduced law enforcement and jail expense. Program development will expand the breadth and depth of treatment services available in the co mmunity and will do so programmatically by design as well as through clinical provider resources from participating faculty and trainees. The outcomes-focused program usi ng our continuum and continuity of care 425 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA model is expected to provide standardized and objectively-validated improvements in treatment outcome beyond what is available in any other outpatient treatment program in Bexar County. The long-term maintenance of re lapse prevention provides a continuity of care that is not available in any other community program. Treatment success will improve the lives and health ou tcomes of STOP patients. It also will reduce the social, criminal-justice, and health-care expend itures of Bexar County because successful rehabilitation will reduce the unnecessary service utilization associated with comorbid disease deterioration or law enforcement and criminal incarceration. Quality: To achieve continuous quality improvement we shall assess the project's impact and make adjustments as necessary, share best practice and lessons learned, seize scaling opportunities to expand successful outcomes to broader populations, and rapidly disseminate successful outcomes to other providers across Texas. Region 6 goals: This project achieves CMS's Triple aim obj ectives of assuring patients receive high quality and patient cente red care, in the most cost eff ective way, improves the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of the counties we serve, further develops and maintains a c oordinated care delivery system and improves outcomes while containing costs. 5-Year Project Goal. Over the project period, the STOP progr am will increase the access to care for community patients with SUD by two important means. First, the STOP program will be staffed with Psychiatric and Psychology faculty training Fellows, Residents, and Interns in evidence-based community practice. Sec ond, these clinical resources will provide a continuum and continuity of care that will provide treatment for an estimated 4,000 SUD patients. Two important outcomes will be achieved through this program. First, successful treatment and sustained relapse prevention will reduce readmission rates of UHS patients. Second, successful training will increase the number of community care providers in RHP 6 which will expand th e access to evidence-based care beyond the STOP program. Starting Point/Baseline: No ACGME-approved addictions psychiatry fellowship progra ms are available in all of South Texas. Additionally, no evidence-based continuity of care model substance abuse treatment services are available in our co mmunity. Most existing programs lack the multimodal therapy and none include the medi cation-based dual diagnosis approach. Rationale: We selected Project Option 1.9.1 because the ga ps generated by the la ck of sufficient numbers of community providers or a conti nuum of evidence-based care programs in Bexar County are well known and documented al ready. Therefore, the STOP Program is designed to remedy the problem by increas ing the number of SUD specialty care 426 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA providers and by establishing a clinical program that will provide a more complete continuum of evidence-based care (i.e., inte grated medication and therapy) designed to reduce Relapse Risk. We are not aware of any DHHS projects f unded at UTHSCSA or in Bexar County to support this comprehensive approach to e nhance substance abus e treatment in the community. CN. 4 This project addresses the need for hi gher quality MH services that are better integrated with physical health care services. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): We selected OD-3-IT-3.8 as a Category 3 Outcome because of the compelling cost- effectiveness argument where effective outpatient Specialty Care for SUD will result in reduced hospitalization or read mission through the STOP Program. Thus we expect to demonstrate potentially preventable read missions of STOP Program patients once discharged from the hospital. Inadequate outpatient care for adults with moderate behavioral health needs including substan ce abuse/dependence is well known and was identified in the Section III Needs As sessment Report to result in unnecessary hospitalizations and Emergency Room visits. The STOP program will provide the outpatient continuum of care necessary to gi ve University Health System primary care clinics with the referral source for patients to receive the level of substance abuse care required to prevent hospitalization and to pr ovide inpatient and ER services with the outpatient follow-up necessary to prevent re admission. Successful rehabilitation and maintenance of relapse prevention thr ough the STOP Program also will reduce unnecessary University Health System service utilization associated with comorbid disease deterioration. Relationship to other Projects: To our knowledge, no other programs within our institution are submitting applications to Develop specialty care capacity in the area of SUD's. If such projects are identified, we'd be excited to work with them to c oordinate programs and services and minimize overlap. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: There are other Performing Providers submitting applications within our department and institution, but none to our knowledge, developing workforce enhancement of SUD Specialty Care (Category 1.9.1) to treat s ubstance abuse/dependence. If the RHP6 Anchor identifies other related projects submitted by Performing Providers from the community, we'd be excited to coordinate servi ces or milestones and to learn from others experiences so as to minimize overlap while maximizing improvement outcomes for the RHP. 427 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Plan for Learning Collaborative: There are other Performing Provider DSRIP pr ojects being submitted that could help the RHP Anchor to achieve Category 3 Outcomes of preventable admissions. We have not as yet developed a Plan for a Learning Co llaborative with this other applicants. However, we are open and ready to collaborate with others within the RHP6 to share challenges and new ideas for solutions to achie ve similar improvements. As the RHP is a natural hub for such activity, we are ready to partner w ith the anchor and other Performing Providers to achieve our common go als. This can and should include regular meetings, site visits, and confer ence calls as planned by the RHP. Project Valuation: The most important factor for valuation is the prevalence of substance abuse in the community with very few provider treatment options available. Any increase in the number of psychiatric or psychologically-bas ed providers will be beneficial, but more important will be multidimensional continuum of care model of the STOP program which will provide unique enhancements to our community resources. We anticipate being able to treat more than 4.000 patients ove r the four year peri od of this project. Economic analysis suggests th at community cost savings in medical and social costs approximate 3-7 times the cost savings of the expense of treatment. While there could be a wide range of parameters used to estimat e the value of this program, if you consider only three factors, the anticipated value would be more than $6 million in cost savings. There are several ways to calculate this valu e: 1. Value to the individual patient. Of course productive employment is an importa nt outcome of addictions treatment. A minimum wage employee would earn $15,600 in a year, which is a gain relative to unemployment costs to society of $14,400 for a net benefit of at least $30,000 per year per employed patient with only a minimum wa ge job. 2. Savings due to reduced ER Visits or Hospitalization. The costs of an ER visit would be $1,000-2,000 and the cost of University Health System of hospitaliza tion ranges from $75 0-$2500 per day depending on the acuity of the visit. A 4-day length of stay for an alcohol detox may average $6,500 and treatment or triage preventing hospi talization would save University Health System that expense. Of course the costs of trauma care and transplant services and the treatment of infectious diseases are much higher and effective outpa tient treatment will also reduce these adverse outcomes. 3. Cost a ssociated with preventing a single fatality related to DWI is estimated to be $3,300,000. Th ere also are substant ial cost savings in law enforcement and incarceration costs that co uld be considered in terms of community savings. 428 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 085144601.1.6 PASS 1 1.14.2 N/A 1.4.2 Other Project Option: Expand Specialty Care Capacity through the S ustained T reatment as an O utpatient P riority (STOP) Program.

It extends to campuses in the metropolitan border communities of Laredo and the Rio Grande Valley. More than 3,000 students a year train in an environment that i nvolves more than 100 affiliated hospitals, clinics and health care facilities in South Texas. Intervention(s) : This proposal is to improve access to outpatient neurology services with the addition of 1.0 FTE mid-leve l provider and 1.0 FTE LVN. Need for the project : UTHSCSA Neurology provides care for the adult uninsured patients of Bexar County at University Health System's downt own clinic. This clinic consists of a single general adult neurologist who provides clinic services 5 days per week. Approximately 150 patient visits are provided each month. The first available appointment is 3 to 4 months out with approximately 800 patients (as of Sept 2012) wai ting to be seen. Timely access to outpatient neurology services for patients seen in the Em ergency Department and discharged from the hospital will reduce inpatient length of stay and inappropriate admissions. Target population : The target population includes indigent, Medicare, and Medicai d patients referred by primary care providers for evaluation and/or management of neurological condi tions and follow-up of patients seen in the Emergency Department or discharged from various hospital services. Greater than 90 percent of the neurology patients seen in this location are Medicaid/indigent. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : This project seeks to increase the number of patients served to: DY3: 30 pct above baseline (195 visits per month) DY4: 40 pct above baseline (210 visits per month) DY5: 50 pct above baseline (225 visits per month) Category 3 outcomes: IT-6.1 Patient Satisfaction Scores The goal is to improve patient satisfaction scores by 10 pct over baseline by DY5 as measured by the CG-CAHPS instrument for the following domains: (1) Timely care, appointments, and information (2) Patient rating of doctor access to specialist 435 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Project Description: Background: The UTHSCSA Department of Neur ology provides care for the adult uninsured patients of Bexar County through a contract with the Community Medical Associat es. Services are provided through University Health System's downtown clin ic. The service consists of a single general adult neurologist who provides clin ic services 5 days a week. In addition to seeing indigent, Medicaid and Medicare outpatien ts, this service is also task ed with provided timely follow-up visits for patients seen in Emergency Departme nt as well as patients discharged from various hospital services, in an effort to provide continuity of care and prevent hospital readmissions. Some patients are evaluated and returned to th eir PCP, while others require ongoing neurologic workup or care. This service has been in pl ace for 2 years, and it has had some success; however, the number of referrals has increased, so that the backlog of new referrals has markedly increased (see baseline data below). In addition, all available follow-up slots are being filled as well, so that the first available slot is typically 3-4 months out. Because of this, patient access is again becoming limited. In additi on, the absence of consistent st affing has limited patient access via telephone. Goals: In order to provide continued high quality neurologic care to the indigent patients of Bexar County, accessibility needs to be increased. This proposal will increase accessibility by hiring 1.0 FTE mid-level provider to see follow up pa tients and 1.0 LVN to provide patients with improved telephone access and to perform injections and other procedures as required. We will utilize the skills of these providers and the neurol ogist in a team-based approach to improve the efficiency of neurologic care in this setting. Expected Result: With a mid-level provider seeing follow-up patients, access for follow-up patients is expected to improve. This will also allow additional time fo r the neurologist to see new patients, improving access to care. In addition with a nurse pr oviding improved communication with patients, patient questions and concerns can be addresse s more efficiently without the need for an additional visit with the neurologist. The five-year expected outcome for this proj ect is that the appointment capacity will be increased by 50 percent. Quality: To achieve continuous quality improvement we shall assess the projects impact and make adjustments as necessary, share best practice a nd lessons learned, seize scaling opportunities to expand successful outcomes to broader populat ions, and rapidly disseminate successful outcomes to other prov iders across Texas. Region 6 goals: 436 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA This project achieves CMS's Triple aim objectives of assuring patients receive high quality and patient centered care, in the most cost effectiv e way, improves the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsur ed residents of the counties we serve, further develops and maintains a coordinated care de livery system and improves outcomes while containing costs. \\ Starting Point/Baseline: Outpatient neurology services for the adult un insured patients of Bexar County are provided through the University Hospital - Downtown Ne urology Clinic consisting of a single adult neurologist who provides c linic services 5 days a week. In addition to seeing i ndigent, Medicare, and Medicare patients, this se rvice is also tasked with pr oviding timely follow up visits for patients seen in the Emergency Department as we ll as patients discharged from various hospital services in an effort to provide continuity of care, reduce length of st ay, and prevent hospital readmissions. The number of referrals to the clinic is far in excess of the capacity resulting in a backlog of new referrals that has reached appr oximately 800 patients (as of 9/12). In addition, the first available follow up appoint ment slot is 3 to 4 months out. Rationale: Providing patients with increased ac cess to neurologic services lead ing to earlier intervention in patients with neurologic illnesses may prevent or slow deterioration or improve quality of life, and decrease the need for emergency department visits. Currently, the clinic is not adequately staffed to meet the ongoing needs of patients with neurologic diseases. Lack of timely access to a neurologist results in unnecessary visits to the emergency de partment often resulting in unnecessary admissions and/or increa sed length of stay for services that are not available in a timely fashion. We are unaware of any projects underway at UT HSCSA funded by the US Department of Health and Human Services serving a similar purpose as the project being submitted. CN.1 Meets community need to improve quality and patient satisfaction Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-6 Patient Satisfaction IT-6.1 Percent improvement over ba seline of patient satisfaction sc ores as measured by the adult CG-CAHPS instrument for the following do mains: Timely care, appointments, and information; and patient rating of doctor access to specialist Currently, more than 800 patients are waiting to be seen by the Neurology Clinic for an initial evaluation with follow-up appointments being schedul ed more than 4 months from the date of the initial appointment. The above measure was selected to measure pa tient satisfaction with access to services. Relationship to other Projects: UTHSCSA submitted a proposal to expand neur opsychological services. Individuals with neurological diseases and impairments requir e neuropsychological te sting to effectively characterize neurocognitive changes associated wi th their diseases. Neuropsychological testing aids in patient management, diagnostic clar ification, prediction of disease progression, 437 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA evaluation of disease staging, assessment of f unction status, and development of treatment recommendations. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: This project will require the diagnostic services provided by the following proposal: UTHSCSA 1.9.2 Neuropsyc hological Services Providers from both proposals will collaborate to discuss best practices and treatment options for patients they both serve. Plan for Learning Collaborative: This project is staffed by providers who will be faculty of the UTHSCSA Department of Neurology. As such, providers will participate in Departmental educational activities and discussions regarding best prac tices and treatment innovations which can be applied to the patient population served. Project Valuation: Lack of timely access to a neurolog ist results in unnecessary visits to the emergency department often resulting in unnecessary admissions and/or incr eased length of stay for services that are not available in a timely fashion. Incr eased availability of outpatient neurologic services will result in reduced appointment waiting times, decreased ED utilization, and reduced lengths of stay. The project is valued based upon achieving waiver goals, meeting community needs, scope, and investment. 438 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 085144601.1.7 PASS 1 1.9.2 N/A 1.9.2 Improve Access to Specialty Care: Outpatient Neurology Services UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HEALTH SCIENC E CENTER AT SAN ANTONIO TPI - 085144601 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 085144601.3.8 3.IT-6.1 Percent improvement over base line of patient satisfaction scores For domains: 1) timely care, appointments, and information; and 2) patient rating of doc tor access to specialist Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 P-3 Collect baseline data for wait times, backlog, and/or return appointments in Neurology Metric 1 [P-3.1]: Baseline/Goal: TBD; projected 150 visits per month Appointment wait time Clinic visit volume Data Source: EPIC/Sunrise Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $169,500 Milestone 2 I-22 Increase the number of specialist providers, clinic hours and/or procedure hours available for the high impact/most impacted medical specialties Milestone 4 I-23: Increase specialty care clinic volume of visits and evidence of improved access for patients seeking service Metric 1 [I-23.1]: Baseline/Goal: Increase capacity of patients served to 30 percent above baseline in year 2 (195 visits per month); Data Source: EPIC Milestone 4 Estimated Incentive Payment: $558,396 Milestone 5 I-23: Increase specialty care clinic volume of visits and evidence of improved access for patients seeking service Metric 1 [I-23.1]: Goal: Increase capacity of patients served to 40 percent above baseline in year 2 (210 visits per month); Data Source: EPIC Milestone 5 Estimated Incentive Payment: $597,354 Milestone 6 I-23: Increase specialty care clinic volume of visits and improved access for patients seeking service Metric 1 [I-23.1]: Goal: Increase capacity of patients served to 50 percent above baseline in year 2 (225 visits per month); Data Source: EPIC Milestone 6 Estimated Incentive Payment: $577,154 439 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Metric 1 Baseline/Goal: Number of specialist providers and qualified support staff over baseline (1.0 PA/NP, 1.0 LVN) Data Source: HR documents Milestone 2 Estimated Incentive Payment: $169,500 Milestone 3 P-11 Launch/expand a specialty care clinic Metric 1 Baseline/Goal: Number of patients served by specialty clinic Data Source: EPIC/Sunrise Milestone 3 Estimated Incentive Payment: $169,500 Year 2 Estimated Milestone Bundle Amount: $508,500 Year 3 Estimated Milestone Bundle Amount: $ 558,396 Year 4 Estimated Milestone Bundle Amount: $ 597,354 Year 5 Estimated Milestone Bundle Amount: $ TOTAL INCE NTIVE PAYMENTS FOR 4-YEAR $2,241,404 440 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Identifying Project and Provider Information: Title: 1.9.2 Improve Access Specialty Care: Neuropsychological Services RHP ID# : 085144601.1.8 - PASS 1 Performing Provider: University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio-Russell Pella, PhD Performing Provider TPI: 085144601 Project Summary: Provider Description : The University of Texas Health Sc ience Center at San Antonio serves San Antonio and the 50,000 square-mile area of S outh Texas. It extends to campuses in the metropolitan border communities of Laredo and the Rio Grande Valley. More than 3,000 students a year train in an environment that i nvolves more than 100 affiliated hospitals, clinics and health care facilities in South Texas. Intervention(s) : This proposal is to develop and e xpand the Neuropsychological Division to improve access to neuropsychological evaluation and testing services for patients with epilepsy, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, brain tumors, and tr aumatic brain injuries with the addition of 1.0 FTE neuropsychologist a nd 1.0 FTE psychometrist. Need for the project : The University has multiple programs a nd clinical services serving patients with neurological diseases and impairment but lacks adequate capacity to support the neuropsychological needs of thes e patients. Neuropsychological ev aluation and testing provides effective characterization of neurocognitive changes and/or impairments associated with neurological diseases which aids in patient ma nagement, diagnostic clar ification, prediction of disease progression, evaluation of disease staging, assessmen t of functional status and consequences of neurocognitive dysfunction, and the development of treatment recommendations. There is currently a six month wait to see the neuropsychologist for evaluation and testing. Target population : Patients with epilepsy, stroke, Al zheimer's disease, memory disorders, movement disorders, neuromuscular disorders, brain tumors, and trau matic brain injuries. Approximately 40 percent of the patients served wi ll be Medicaid/indigent. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : This project seeks to increase th e number of patients served ove r the number served in baseline in DY2 (200 projected) to: DY3: 25 pct above baseline (250 visits) DY4: 50 pct above baseline (300 visits) DY4: 100 pct above baseline (400 visits) Category 3 outcomes: IT-6.1 Patient Satisfaction Scores The goal is to improve patient satisfaction scores in DY5 by 10 percent ov er baseline in DY2 for the following domains: (1) Timely care, appointments, and information 441 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA (2) Patient rating of doctor access to specialist The five-year expected outcome for this project is that an additiona l 350 patient visits for neuropsychological evaluation a nd testing will be provided. Project Description: The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio serves a diverse population that lacks access to comprehensive pe rsonalized healthcare for indivi duals who are diagnosed with medical conditions affecting brai n functioning. Such conditions often result in neuropsychiatric symptoms and impaired cognitive abilities both of which are risk factor for decline in functional abilities. To address the behavioral health and medical needs of Bexar County and the San Antonio metropolitan population area, the Department of Neurology is proposing to develop and expand Neuropsychology Division that will improve access to neuropsychological testing services for patients with epilepsy, stroke, Al zheimer's disease, brain tumors , and traumatic brain injuries with the addition of 1.0 FTE psychometrist and 1.0 FTE neuropsychologist. The Region 6 Goals: This project achieves CMS's Triple aim objectives of assuring patients receive high quality and patient centered care, in the most cost effectiv e way, improves the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsur ed residents of the counties we serve, further develops and maintains a coordinated care de livery system and improves outcomes while containing costs. Quality: To achieve continuous quality improvement we shall assess the projects impact and make adjustments as necessary, share best practice a nd lessons learned, seize scaling opportunities to expand successful outcomes to broader populat ions, and rapidly disseminate successful outcomes to other prov iders across Texas. Starting Point/Baseline: The Department of Neurology currently has 1.0 FTE faculty neuropsychologist who provided neuropsychological testing to 86 patients dur ing the period November 2011 and June 2012. Rationale: The University has multiple ne uroscience programs and clini cal services in a number of departments serving patients with neurological diseases and impairments but does not have adequate capacity to support the neuropsychological needs of th ese patient populations. Effective characterization of neurocognitive changes and or impairments associated with neurological diseases aids in patient management, diagnostic clarification, predicti on of disease progression, evaluation of disease staging, assessment of functional status and consequences of neurocognitive dysfunction, and developm ent of treatment recommendations. We are unaware of any projects currently underway UTHSCSA that are funded by the US Department of Health and Human Services se rving a similar purpose as the project being submitted. 442 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA CN.3 This project expands access to care addressing provider shortages CN.1 This project will enhance qualit y and improve patient satisfaction Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): IT-6.1 Percent improvement over base line of patient satisfaction scores There is limited access to neuropsychological testi ng services in Bexar Co unty for patients with epilepsy, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, brai n tumors, and traumatic brain injuries. The above measures were selected to measure pa tient access and demand for services as well as patient satisfaction with services. Relationship to other Projects: UTHSCSA submitted a proposal to develop a program to provide epilepsy care for outlying areas of South Texas. Indivi duals utilizing such a service will also benefit from neuropsychological services provided through the current proposal, which will expand the quality of care for patients in rural sectors of the region. There are also a number of clinical specialties within the sponsoring institution that are projected to benef it from neuropsychological services including movement disord er specialists, comprehensive epilepsy center, trauma center, stroke center, geriatric medici ne, neurorehabilitation center, sports medicine, neurosurgery, psychiatry, and primary care. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: This project provides diagnostic services th at are related to the following proposals: UTHSCSA 1.9 Expand Specialty Care Capaci ty: Epilepsy Outreach - Uvalde and UTHSCSA 1.9 Neurology Ou tpatient Services. Plan for Learning Collaborative: The South Texas Comprehensive Epilepsy Center base d at University Health System consists of a multidisciplinary group of physicians and staff. This group meets weekly to review cases, exchange ideas, and discuss best practices/appro aches to patient management. Services provided under this proposal will be included in these weekly discussions. Project Valuation: Individuals with medical conditi ons affecting brain functioning of ten result in neuropsychiatric symptoms impaired cognitive abilities. Both of which are risk factor for decline in functional abilities. A decline in functional abilities affect s patients' ability to obtain/maintain employment resulting in lost productiv ity and work-related earnings. 443 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 085144601.1.8 PASS 1 1.9.2 N/A 1.9.2 Improve Access to Specialty Care: Neuropsychological Services UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HEALTH SCIENCE CENTER AT SAN ANTONIO TPI - 085144601 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 085144601.3.10 3.IT-6.1 Percent improvement over base line of patient satisfaction scores Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 P-3 Collect baseline data for wait times, backlog, and/or return appointments in Neuropsychology Metric 1 P-3.1 Establish baseline for appointment wait time and clinic visit volume (200 projected) Baseline/Goal: Collect date on current appointment wait time and clinic visit volume Data Source: EPIC Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $203,400 Milestone 2 I-22 Increase the number of specialist providers, clinic hours and/or procedure hours Milestone 3 I-23: Increase specialty care clinic volume of visits and evidence of improved access for patients seeking service Metric 1 [I-23.1]: Baseline/Goal: Increase capacity of patients served to 25 percent above baseline (250 patients); Data Source: EPIC Milestone 3 Estimated Incentive Payment: $223,358.50 Milestone 4 I-22 Increase the number of specialist providers, clinic hours and/or procedure hours available for the high impact/most impacted medical specialties Milestone 5 I-23: Increase specialty care clinic volume of visits and evidence of improved access for patients seeking service Metric 1 [I-23.1]: Goal: Increase capacity of patients served to 50 percent above baseline (300 patients); Data Source: EPIC Milestone 5 Estimated Incentive Payment: $477,883 Milestone 6 I-23: Increase specialty care clinic volume of visits and improved access for patients seeking service Metric 1 [I-23.1]: Goal: Increase capacity of patients served to 100 percent above baseline (400 patients); Data Source: EPIC Milestone 6 Estimated Incentive Payment: $461,723 444 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA available for the high impact/most impacted medical specialties Metric 1 Baseline/Goal: Number of specialist providers and qualified support staff over baseline; hire 1.0 FTE psych technician Data Source: HR documents Milestone 2 Estimated Incentive Payment: $203,400 Metric 1 Baseline/Goal: Number of specialist providers and qualified support staff over baseline; hire 1.0 FTE neuropsychologist Data Source: HR documents Milestone 4 Estimated Incentive Payment: $223,358.50 Year 2 Estimated Milestone Bundle Amount: $406,800 Year 3 Estimated Milestone Bundle Amount: $446,717 Year 4 Estimated Milestone Bundle Amount: $477,883 Year 5 Estimated Milestone Bundle Amount: NTIVE PAYMENTS FOR 4-YEAR 445 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Identifying Project and Provider Information: Title: 1.1.2 Expand existing primary care capacity - Establish more primary care clinics Unique RHP ID#: 085144601.1.9 - PASS 1 Performing Provider: University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio Dr. Julie Cowan Novak Performing Provider TPI: 085144601 Project Summary: Provider Description : The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio serves San Antonio and the 50,000 square-mile area of South Texas. It exte nds to campuses in the metropolitan border communities of Laredo and the Rio Grande Valley. More than 3,000 students a year train in an environment that involves more than 100 affiliated hospitals, clinics and hea lth care facilities in South Texas. Intervention(s) : The UT Nursing Clinical Enterprise provides care in four clinical settings (UTHSCSA Student Health Center, Employee H ealth and Wellness Clinic, community-based clinics: AVANCE Head Start and Healy-Murphy Alternative High Sc hool and Daycare. Care is provided to a population of approximately 10,163. Patient volume will increase to approximately 20,000 by year 4. This project wi ll expand the hours and days of operation and primary care and psych/behavioral health services. Three of the four clinics are designated as Medically Underserved Populations (MUPs). The fourth clinic's population is 60% from underrepresented groups. Need for the project : This project will allow each clinic to expand its patient base to include care across the lifespan. Additional nurse practitioners are needed to integrate behavioral/mental health into primary care. This project will allow each clinic to expand its hours of operation and services to better serve their respective commun ities. Interprofessional students need clinical rotations and diverse co mmunity service learning sites. Th ese settings provide rich learning laboratories for interprofessional Health Scie nce Center students (N ursing, Medicine, PA, Dentistry, PT, OT and audiology). Target population : These patients need increased access to improved care that is cost effective. This project integrates psych/be havioral health into primary car e. 50% of the students at Healy- Murphy are pregnant or parenti ng and approximately 50% of birt hs in Bexar County are funded by Medicaid. The AVANCE and Healy-Murphy patient base includes approximately 4,000 patients who are eligible for Medicaid or are i ndigent. The patient base of these clinics will expand by 50% - 60% over the course of this project. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The patients will have th e benefit of extended clinic hours (evenings) and days at AVANCE and Healy- Murphy from 2 days to 5 days/week. Patient populations will be expanded at each site (pedia tric, adult and geriatric; across the lifespan). Services will be developed to include psych/beha vioral health care, incr eased Harvard Brazelton Touchpoints parent coaching and patient educa tional programs regarding monthly evidence- based health promotion programs: (Healthy Eating and Activity Together (HEAT); ALA smoking cessation; Keep your children/yourself Safe , Secure (KySS) mental health promotion; Teen Outreach Program (TOP), teen pregna ncy and dropout prevention) and chronic disease 446 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA management. The benefit to the patients is increased access, additiona l days/extended hours of service; additional psych NP, hear ing and pediatric screenings a nd services. This promotes a greater level of health promotion, disease pr evention, early interven tion, and patient/parent coaching which all contribute to ER diversion and lower cost ca re. Patient population and visits will increase as follows: Year 2 encounters/patient visits will increase in Year 3 AVANCE 399 to 2040; Healy-Murphy 200 day care users only to 923 day care and high school users; Year 3-4 will increase from: days per week to 5533 five days per week (birth through elder patient population) Category 3 outcomes: This project will increase collaborative interprofessional student and faculty participation by 50%-75%. It will allow increased admission of pediatric, family and psych/mental health NP students, hiring of pr imary care providers, allowing increased access to high quality, cost-effective health care. Pediat ric patient appointments will increase by 40%; psych/behavioral health appointments will in crease by 80% at the Student Health Clinic, AVANCE and Healy-Murphy sites and by 20% at the Employee Health and Wellness Clinic. Data analytics from the EPIC EHR system w ill promote care continuity, patient safety and quality, and will enable reporting to be shared w ith the community partners, UT peer groups, and disseminated at local, state and national nursing and interprofessional health and health policy conferences. The components noted in the project summary are reflected in the milestones. We are not aware of any si milar projects at UTHSCS A funded by the USDHHS. Project Description: This project proposal, Nurse-Managed Clinics: Improving Access, Expanding Clinical Sites, Promoting Interprofessional Education and Evid ence-based Practice, Optimizing EHR Use and Financial Sustainability, documents needs and ad dresses health problems identified within the \"Bexar County Community Health Assessment.\" This proposal meets the RHP 6 Community Needs Assessment and emphasizes primary care, health promotion and disease prevention, increases access to care, proposes integration of mental health services into primary care, promotes interprofessional practice and educatio n, and promotes ER diversion through increased access, early intervention and pati ent/parent coaching/education at four sites. The UT Nursing Clinical Enterprise (UTNC) model serves a birt h to 5 year old populatio n (90% Latino) at the AVANCE Community Partnership Clin ic (ACPC), an Early Head Star t and Head Start site. The UTNC will expand service provision to the families of these infants and children as well as increase slots available for primary care nurse practitioner students as well as other Health Science Center students (Med, dentistry, PT, OT, PA and audiology). The second site, the UTHSCSA Student Health Center (SHC) will ex pand interprofessional healthcare for students' family members. The SHC is a designated Me dically Underserved Popul ation (MUP) as more than 50% of students come from underrepresen ted groups and qualify for state and federal programs. Many report that they are Head Start gr aduates. Services woul d also be expanded at the third site, UTHSCSA's Employee Health a nd Wellness Clinic where 60% of the population is from underrepresented groups. The fourth site, Healy-Murphy (a community partnership 447 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA clinic) will significantly expand a nd provide services within an alternative high school and day care center (78% Latino) with a focus on health promotion/disease prevention. Expansion of this child and family centered Health Home mode l will provide full UTNC service across the lifespan. Community workers and senior public health nursing students will enhance care continuity through weekly home visits. The four existing nurse-managed clinics target children and young adults, birth through college age, as we ll as the adult populations of employees, and parents and grandparents of the community-based clin ics' pediatric patients. This project is also consistent with the UTHSCSA, School of Nursi ng and School of Medicine strategic initiatives for healthcare: expand primary care services tailored to the needs of our patients; effective coordination and integration of care; enhance qua lity and delivery of care; develop alternative reimbursement methodologies that reward quality outcomes a nd efficiencies; explore novel opportunities for healthcare delivery. The number of patients served will exceed 20,000 annually with annual encounters in creasing by 40-50%. Expansion of access to primary care is demonstrated in the number of patients we can care for during the project timeline in settings where the patients live, work, study or enroll in Head Start or daycare . Patient populations will expand as shown in the chart in the ne xt section. This project targets health promotion/disease prevention, mental health, obe sity, teen pregnancy, child abuse prevention, tobacco use prevention/cessation, and chronic dis ease prevention, intervention and management. Use of evidence-based interventions: NAPNAP CDC-approved KySS Mental Health promotion and Healthy Eating and Activity Together (H EAT); Harvard Brazelton Touchpoints parent coaching and child abuse prevention; Harvar d/UVA Teen Outreach Program for teen and pregnancy and dropout prevention. The American Cancer Society evidence-based smoking cessation programs targeted to speci fic populations. This project has a high level of return on investment. One example is that the 50% of the teens at Healy-Murphy are pregnant or parenting - our services are helping them stay in school, graduate, and transition to a post secondary educational or traini ng program. The parent coachi ng prevents child abuse. Our education, coaching, role modeling, and provision of healthcare aids in breaking the cycle - 70- 80% of prisoners were abused as children and 80% were high school dr opouts. Other programs for targeted audiences include tobacco use pr evention/cessation using ACA developmental and age appropriate EB programs. Children who live with smokers have 4-16 times higher rates of Otitis Media than children who live with non-smokers. In addition, otitis media alone exceeds $6 billion in healthcare costs. Due to obesity, Type 2 diabetes is reaching epidemic proportions. The CDC-approved NAPNAP Healthy Eating Activ ity Together (HEAT) provides effective evidence-based prevention and in tervention related to physical activity and eating disorders including obesity. These evid ence- based programs are integrat ed into the School of Nursing Curriculum. Our community partnerships are well established and will allow us to achieve and sustain our milestones and metrics. One aspect of our mosaic of support and sustainability is the broad interprofessional participation. Thes e evidence-based best practice programs are embedded in the School of Nursing curriculum. A ll interprofessional students will have access to computer modules for review. Region 6 objectives: This project achieves CMS's Triple Aim objectives of assuring patie nts receive high quality and 448 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA patient centered care, in the most cost effectiv e way, improves the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsur ed residents of the counties we serve, further develops and maintains a coordinated care de livery system and improves outcomes while containing costs. Quality: To achieve continuous quality improvement we shall assess the project's impact and make adjustments as necessary, share best practices an d lessons learned, seize scaling opportunities to expand successful outcomes to broader populat ions, and rapidly disseminate successful outcomes to other prov iders across Texas. Starting Point/Baseline: This project will provide cultu rally proficient APNs, PAs and MDs who care for underserved populations. Each provider is trained in evid ence-based primary care and this project would allow the integration of psych NPs to expand beha vioral/mental health services at each clinic site. The chart below shows our patient base as of July, 2012 a nd the estimated growth over the span of the project with incr eased volume based upon increased days of service, increased cohorts served, and increased number of providers and services offered.

The e xpansion includes: strengt hening the innovative and comprehensive nature of primary care delivered in the existing sites by integrating mental health services, significantly expandi ng the hours of clinic operation, thus incr easing the number of medically underserved and vulnerable population constituents served without regard to insurance or ability to pay. This will double the number of trai ning slots for primary care nurse practitioner, medical, dentistry, PT, OT, PA and audiology students. An interoperable electronic health record (EPIC) system has b een implemented across the sites for practice management, data collection/anal ytics related to safety and qu ality measures and improvement, patient and clinic outcomes, best practice guidelines, and expanding care across the lifespan in all sites. The result is a foundation for our enha nced model ultimately leading to a network of UTNCs in San Antonio and South Texas whic h is interprofessional and sustainable. Not only does this project address one of the key ai ms of the Texas 1115 Waiv er, this project is a perfect fit with the Triple Aim goals of assuring patients receive high quality and patient- centered care in the most cost-effective way - specifically primary care, mental health promotion, child abuse prevention, obesity prevention/intervention, and tobacco use prevention/cessation. One innovati ve aspect of the enhanced UTNC emerges from recognition that individuals with beha vioral health problems present first in primary care settings with these settings being ill-equipped to m eet urgent needs of these patients. The comprehensive primary care provided through the UTNC includes the integrat ion of mental health services within the context of providing holistic interp rofessional patient care. This a ddresses the issue of the RHP 6 counties being identified as a H PSA for mental health. Anothe r novelty of this proposal is the diverse target populatio n of both medically underserved and vulnerable populations who currently seek care at the UTNCs. In addition, our programs directly correlate to Table 5 of the RHP 6 Community Health Improvement Plan for Bexar County: Priority Area - Healt hy Eating and Active UTNCE program - NAPNAP CDC approved \"Hea lthy Eating Activity T ogether\" (HEAT); Priority Area - Healthy Child and Family Development; UTNCE program - NAPNAP and CDC approved \"Keep Your Sa fe and Secure\" (KySS) and \"Teen Outreach Program\" (TOP - teen pregnancy and dropout prev ention); Priority Area - Safe Communities; UTNCE program - \"Touch Points\" an evidence-b ased theory of child development, based upon more than 60 years of ground-breaking research by Dr. T. Berry Brazelton and his colleagues at Harvard Children's Hospital in Boston and in communities around the world. The Touch Points program promotes healthy parenti ng thus breaking the cycle of child abuse. The KySS program promotes mental health, and the prevention of family dysfunction, violence, substance abuse, eating disorders, depression and suicide. 70-80% of prisoners were abused as children and 80% were high school dropouts. 450 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA CN. 3 This project addresses the need for greater access to primary care services in South Texas. 1.1.2 Expand existing primary care capacity Required core proj ect components: a) Expand primary care clinic space b) Expand primary care clinic hours c) Expand primary care clinic staffing Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): Project Area 1.1; OD 9 Right Care, Right Setting; IT 9.2 ED appropriate uti lization (Standalone measure) Reduce ED visits for patients with asthma in the UTNCs Medicaid, pediatric and indigent populations.

Stevens Plan for Learning Collaborative: We look forward to participating in a RHP-wide l earning collaborative. It is very important to share challenges and to learn from others. This will aid in sustaining each performing provider's project and its success. We are available for any format selected, i.e., conference calls, meetings. 451 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Project Valuation: Objectives of the project will address such i ssues as the inability of the practitioner to communicate with the patient due to a language ba rrier, issues surrounding health literacy, and the inability of the patient to fully understand pr escribed care. The majority of UTNC APNs are native Spanish speakers or bilingual. Developi ng and implementing systems and services: Our established clinics have system s and services in place; however , funding limitations result in clinic service provision only 1- 2 days per week at AVANCE a nd Healy-Murphy. This project will allow primary and behavioral health care expansion at each site. Of the 3,813 Health Science Center students (Nursing, Medicine, Dentistry, Health Prof essions, and Basic Sciences), 50% come from underrepresented groups (38% Hispanic, 10% African American, and 2% \"Other\") and qualify for state and federal pr ograms. In FY2011, the SHC had 4,730 patient visits and averaged 20 patient visits a day. Thus far in 2012, patient visits have increased in the range of 40-50 visits per day. Services pr ovided at the SHC and EHWC include health promotion/disease prevention, immunizations, comp rehensive health assessments, diagnosis and management of acute and chronic health problem s including behavioral health counseling, onsite collection of laboratory specimens, and ER diversion through early intervention and patient/parent coaching/education. All SHC a nd EHWC nurse practitioners (NPs) hold dual roles as faculty in the School of Nursing with cross appointments in the Department of Family Medicine. With the goal of expanding services at the SHC to dependents (children and spouses) of UTHSCSA students, we can in crease primary care rotations for APN, PA and med students and service learning projects for students in other HSC programs, e.g., PT/ OT. Inter professional students will partic ipate in annual UTHSCSA employee health fairs, fun run/walks, pandemic preparedness, and research opportuni ties. The EHWC, serves approximately 6,000 UTHSCSA employees. The EHWC opened on November 15, 2010 and the patient base continues to grow. 60% of the employee population is from unde rrepresented groups. Redesigning and expanding the number of exam rooms in the SHC and EHWC, will allow a collaborative workspace for the interprofessional faculty and students of both clinics. In addition, this expansion would allow a private exam room for the counseling/ behavioral health appointments and an evening pediatric clinic fo r children of HSC students and children enrolled at Murphy or AVANCE. In 2012, an employee survey by the HR department identified mental health issues as the top concern among UTHS CSA employees. A doctorally prepared psych mental health NP/APN will be added to each clinic. The UTHSCSA AVANCE Community Partnership Clinic, is located within the very heart of the high-risk community it s erves (a designated MUA). AVANCE has been a family/community program in SA for 40 years a nd is a national model. Two rooms have been dedicated to the clinic. With this funding, a third examination room will be fully equipped. AVANCE services 400 children from birth to age 3 and over 2,000 children city-wide with further expansion planned. AVANC E is ranked number 10 by the Hispanic Business Journal , as a significant contributor to pa rent education, promotion of pa rent's high school completion and primary healthcare. This clinic is seen as a re plicable model for the development of Head Start Health Homes. Since its inception, the clin ic has ensured 100% immunization compliance among the enrolled children. The requested funding would allow expansion of services from 1.5 to 5 days a week. Women's health services will be added. There is a documented need for services for the parents/grandparents, given an AVANCE Early Head Start 2011 survey where 29% of the parents reported alc ohol or substance abuse disorder s, 27% report domestic violence, 452 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA and 10% being on probation or parole. Thirty-four percent reported mental health problems, with 18% reporting personal experi ence with child abuse and neglect. The Healy-Murphy Wellness Center (HMWC), is committed to serving at-risk youth, including pregnant teens , parents (both male and female), thos e who have dropped out of high school and others unable to achieve success in traditional school settings. HMWC is licensed by the state of Texas, and was one of only 17 schools in SA to receive the award for Texas School Readiness 2007-2011. Implementing the \"TOP\" program - Teen Outreach Program and education for teen pregnancy and dropout prev ention is critical. Also, having an on-site child development center and nurse-led clinic has provided young parents with a safe, nurturing educational environment for their children during the school day. This also allows APNs to provide care to the children on site, as most face transportation issues. The high school serves approximately 150 students per year; approximately 50% of the students are pregnant, parenting, or both . The culturally diverse population is 78% Hispanic, 18% African American, and 4% Anglo. Over 95% of students qualify for free or reduced meals. The daycare serves 200 infants/children per year, from 4 weeks to 5 y ears of age. The program is affiliated with the SA Independent Sc hool District. A NAPNAP and CDC approved study entitled \"Ky SS: Keep Your Children/Yourself Safe and Secure\" revealed that approximately 1 in 4 chil dren and teens experience mental health problems or psychosocial morbidities. A survey of 621 ch ildren/teens, and their parents reported concerns or \"worries\" regardi ng coping with stress, anxiety, depression, self-esteem problems and family relationships (Melnyk et al, 2001). Health care prov iders (600 PNPs and physicians) in the study contended that they were ill equippe d to provide optimal care for children with these psychosocial morbidities. Increased educational content and continued education courses related to family dysfunction, substan ce abuse, eating disorders, depression and suicide were recommended and subsequently integrated into the UTHSCSA APN/Nurse Practitioner curriculum. Modules will be available for each of the interprofessional students to review the CB programs used in this project. Since childhood obesity rates are alarming at 34% among Hispanics, the NAPNAP and CDC approved \"Healthy Eating and Activity Together\" (HEAT) evidenced based program will be introduced at each of the project sites. UTNC E provides parenting/childbirth classes, parent coaching using Harvard Touchpoints, behavioral/mental health promotion using evidence-based NAPNAP KySS and obesity prevention using evidence-based NAPNAP HEAT. Both the alternative high school students/parents and th eir children who attend the day care center are enrolled in Medicaid or meeti ng the criteria for enrollment. The proposed project would significantly expand clinic operations from 1 day per week to 5 days per week. Healy- Murphy received a capital improvement grant to create a 2,000 square f oot clinic that opened August, 2012. This allows expansion of servi ces and space for an interprofessional team of APN/NP students, PA students, a nd med students and their faculty. This project will create a patient and family centered primary care heal th home for enrolled children expanding to include their parents and their grandparents a nd other family members over the course of the project years. This interprofessional primary care Health Home and collaboration will allow integration of discovery, learning, and engagement. The c ontent will be sh ared with all interprofessional student and faculty project participants. These clinics when expanded from one to five days/week can be operated for approximate ly 30-50% of the cost of traditional models. 453 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 085144601.1.9 PASS 1 1.1.2 1.1.2 (A, B, C) 1.1.2 EXPAND EXISTING PRIMARY CARE CAPACITY -ESTABLISH MORE PRIMARY CARE CLINICS University of Texas Health Science Center at San TPI - 08514460 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 085144601.3.11 IT-9.2 ED Appropriate Utilization Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P-1]: Establish additional/expand existing /relocate primary care clinics Metric 1 [P-1.1]: [Expand space] Document the expansion plan with UTHSCSA Facility Services Dept. and determine short and long-term needs.

Ja\u00e9n MD, PhD Performing Provider TPI: 085144601 Project Summary: Provider Description : The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio serves San Antonio and the 50,000 square-mile area of South Texas. It exte nds to campuses in the metropolitan border communities of Laredo and the Rio Grande Valley. More than 3,000 students a year train in an environment that involves more than 100 affiliated hospitals, clinics and hea lth care facilities in South Texas. Intervention(s) : This project will build two new medical homes that in addition to the usual primary care clinicians, we will have services provided by behavioral health professionals, pharmacists, nutritionists and RN case management services to deal with patients with complex medical problems. Need for the project : There are significant gaps in the number of primary care clinicians who practice in the region and thus lacks the capacity to care fo r common chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes and heart disease), provi de clinical preventive services (e.g., colon cancer screening and breast cancer screening), and in th e treatment of obesity and tobacc o use disorder. Treatment of behavioral problems is also a big gap identifi ed in the needs assessment. These gaps are effectively addressed by primary car e and behavioral services that are integrated and community responsive. Moreover, building clinics such as the ones proposed here will help attract and retain more primary care clinicians to the region. Target population : The target population is patients wit hout primary care and behavioral health services, specifically Medicai d and indigent patients. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : By the end of this proj ect, the region will have 10 additional primary care and behavioral health clinicians practicing in the community. The primary care capacity of UT Medicine will be increased by 25% to almost 50,000 unduplicated patients in all primary care cl inics from a baseline of 39,818. At the end of the project we expect to be caring for a panel of 9600 patients. At this rate the value in savings to the system could be as high as $867,072 at the final ye ar in savings to the region. By the 5th year, the clinics will have 4 FTE primary care physicians and 4 F TE PAs/NPs, 1 FTE behavioral clinician, 4 FTE RN and 1 FTE pr imary care pharmacist. These two new clinics directly address the regional goa l of expanding primary care capacity to serve residents of Bexar County, the largest county in th e region, and by recruiting and re taining a primary care force needed to address critical chronic disease a nd prevention needs specifically among Medicaid and indigent patients. 458 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Patient Benefit: DY 3 4,000 unique patients clinic 1 DY4 12,600 visits clinic 1, and 1,000 visits clinic 2 DY5 12,720 visits clinic 1, and 12,000 visits clinic 2 Category 3 outcomes: We selected IT 1.11 Diabetes care: BP control (<140/90mm Hg) NQF 0061 (Standalone measure) as our Category 3 outcome measure. Diabetes is one of the most costly and highly prevalent chronic diseas es in the United States. Approximately 20.8 million Americans have diabetes, and half these cases are undiagnosed. Complications from the disease cost the country nearly $100 bill ion annually. In addition, diabetes. The known prevalence of diabetes in Bexar County is 10% and more than double for African Americans (14%) and Hispanics (13%) compared to 6% am ong Non-Hispanic Whites. Hispanics represent 54% of residents of RHP 6. A highly functional primary care office in addition to increasing access will improve the quality of care for diabetics and hypertensives. Project Description: The overall goal is to increase UT Medicine San Antonio primary care capacity by 1/3 improving care for chronic diseases and preventi on and also to enhance behavioral health availability by providing behavioral health services at the 2 new clinic locations. Considerable evidence is now accumulating that carefully exec uted transformation to a patient-centered medical home model achieves better outcomes with lower costs. In order to be effective medical homes must have staff and resources not usually available in primary care practices in most communities. We propose building new medi cal homes that in additional to the usual primary care clinicians, will have services by be havioral health professionals, pharmacists, nutritionists and RN case management services to deal with patients with complex medical problems. By the 5th year, the clinics will have 4 F TE primary care physicians and 4 FTE PAs/NPs, 1 FTE behavioral c FTE dietician and 1 FTE primary care pharmacist. These two new clinics di rectly address the regional goal of expanding primary care capacity to serve Medicaid and indi gent patients and by re cruiting and retaining a primary care force needed to address critic al chronic disease and prevention needs. Quality: To achieve continuous quality improvement we shall assess the projects impact and make adjustments as necessary, share best practice a nd lessons learned, seize scaling opportunities to expand successful outcomes to broader populat ions, and rapidly disseminate successful outcomes to other prov iders across Texas. Region 6 goals: This project achieves CMS's Triple aim objectives of assuring patients receive high quality and patient centered care, in the most cost effectiv e way, improves the health care infrastructure to 459 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA better serve the Medicaid and uninsur ed residents of the counties we serve, further develops and maintains a coordinated care de livery system and improves outcomes while containing costs. Starting Point/Baseline: UT Medicine San Antonio is the practice pl an of the School of Me dicine at UTHSCSA. Currently primary care visits account for less than 9% of the total yearly visits (100K visits of the 1.1 million visits during the la st year). In terms of unduplic ated adult patients, all the primary care clinics at UT Me dicine only cared for 39,818 unduplicat ed patients over the last 2 years (June 2010-May 2012). There is clearly a n eed to grow the primary care footprint of UT Medicine to better serve our community and reap the benefits of primary care for our community. Currently only 2 of 7 primary care c linics offer behavioral health services and only one offers case management by RN on a pilot basis. Rationale: The RHP6 Needs Assessment identifies significant gaps in the number of primary care clinicians who practice in the region and thus lacks the capacity to care for common chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes and heart disease), provi de clinical preventive services (e.g., colon cancer screening and breast cancer screening), and in th e treatment of obesity and tobacco use disorder. Treatment of behavioral problems is also a big gap identified in this assessment. These gaps are effectively addressed by primary care and behavioral services that are integrated and community responsive. Moreover, building clinics such as the ones propo sed here will help attract and retain more primary care clinicians to the region. The known prevalence of diabetes in Bexar County is 10% and more than double for African Americans (14%) and Hispanics (13%) compared to 6% among Non-Hispanic Whites. Hispanics account for 54% of residents in the region. A significant proportion of Bexar County residents, 67%, are obese or ove rweight and 23% are sedentary. With the current direction of health reform towards ACOs and other arrangements featuring population management and some form of prospec tive payment, it is imperative that the RHP6 develops local experience and expertise with state-of-the-art car e delivery systems to appropriately manage population risk, improve qua lity indicators, and achieve cost savings through reductions in avoidable morbidity (i.e., inappropriate visits to emergency departments and avoidable hospitalizations). Many PCMH projects using care management and related protocols are achieving cost savings of 20-30% and demons trating positive returns on investment. In order to achieve these outcomes is imperative to have a critical mass of primary care clinics and behavioral health services to allow the expression of these benefits. We are not aware of any related U.S. Department of Hea lth and Human Services underway at UTHSCSA. CN.2 Reduce health disparitie s by expanding access to integr ated primary care services CN.4 There is a shortage of high qua lity mental and behavioral health services that are integrated with physical health care services an d/or provide crisis stabilization. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): We selected IT 1.11 Diabetes care: BP control (<140/90mm Hg) NQF 0061 (Standalone measure) as our Category 3 outcome measure. Diabetes is one of the most costly and 460 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA highly prevalent chronic diseas es in the United States. Approximately 20.8 million Americans have diabetes, and half these cases are undiagnosed. Complications from the disease cost the country nearly $100 billion annually. In addition, diabetes accounts for nearly 20 percent of all deaths in people over 25 years of age. Many complications, such as amputation, blindness, and kidney fail ure, can be prevented if detected and addressed in the early stages. Although many people live with diabetes years after diagnosis, it is a costly condition that le ads to serious and poten tially fatal health complications. Diabetes control can improve the quality of life for millions of Americans and save billions of health care dollars . The known prevalence of diabetes in Bexar County is 10% and more than double for African Amer icans (14%) and Hispanics (13%) compared to 6% among Non-Hispanic Whites. Hispanics re present 54% of residents of RHP 6. These estimates do not account for undiagnosed diabet ics and pre-diabetics. A highly functional primary care office in addition to increasing access will improve the quality of care for diabetics and hypertensives. The system changes needed to achieve this outcome will benefit both diabetic and hypertensive patient s treated at these clinics with substantial savings preventing major complications from both diseases. Th ese conditions are more prevalent among low- income populations because of their higher pr evalence of obesity and sedentary lifestyle. Relationship to other Projects: The project will support and re inforce the \"Health Workfor ce Training to Support Patient- Centered Medical Homes\" project. The training curriculum developed for the medical assistants will be directly relevant to that project as wi ll lessons learned about implementing elements of the medical home. This project will also benefit from the \"E xpanding chronic care management in a safety net clinic\" in that the training and pr otocols developed for this project will directly benefit the RN case managers that will be part of the new clinics. The risk stratification methods used for that project would also be useful fo r the functioning of the new clinics. There is ongoing close coordination at the lead ership level among these projects. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: It is our intention to synergize with other pr ojects that are in the process of implementing primary care transformation efforts conducted by University Health System, Community Medicine Associates and other RHP 6. We have a history of collaboration and joined projects that will facilitate close collaboration. Plan for Learning Collaborative: We are ready to participate a nd lead if necessary the deve lopment of RHP-wide learning collaborative with other providers with similar projects. We have substantial experience in planning and executing these. Dr. Ja\u00e9n was the Principal Investigator of the team that evaluated the first National Demonstration Project of the Patient-Centered Medical Home. We can work closely with the leadership of the RHP 6 to make this process a reality. 461 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Project Valuation: Achieves waiver goals (score 5): The project directly addresses wa iver goals, with its objectives to assure that patients receive high-quality a nd patient-centered care in the most cost effective ways; improves health care infrastructure by expanding primary care and behavioral health access care access; further develops and maintain s a coordinated care delivery system; and improves outcomes while containing cost growth by avoiding expensive emergency department visits and improving preventive and chronic disease care. Addresses community needs (score 5): The project directly addresses multiple community needs including the recruitment and re tention of a primary care workforce and thus addressing the shortage and access to primary care; addresses the need to have in tegrated behavioral health and primary care services; and directly addresses car diovascular disease, cancer and diabetes, three of the top causes of death in the region Project Scope - (score 5) - By the end of this project, the region will have 10 additional primary care and behavioral health clinic ians practicing in the community. The primary care capacity of UT Medicine will be increased by 25% to al most 50,000 unduplicated patients in all primary care clinics from a baseline of 39,818. A recently published article in Health Affairs provides us with an estimate of savings (Z. Song, D. G. Safran, B. E. Landon et al., \"The 'Alternative Quality Contract,' Based on a Global Budget, Lowered Medical Spending and Improved Quality,\" Health Affairs Web First, publishe d online July 11, 2012.) Properly implemented changes similar to those proposed here provi de savings as high as $22.58 per member per quarter. At the end of the project we expect to be caring for a panel of 9600 pa tients. At this rate the value in savings to the system could be as high as $867,072 at the final year in savings to the region. Project Investment - (score 5) - The expected capital investment in human resources, lease, equipment, medical supplies, IT infrastructure and support, and time to implement is relatively large. The sustainability of th e project is risky in that it requ ires a significant change in the payment structure for primary care from a fe e-for-service only to a medical home blended payment similar to those implemented in other states. 462 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 085144601.1.11 PASS 1 1.1.1 N/A 1.1.1 Establish more primary ca re clinics: Primary Care and Behavioral Care Capacity Expansion at UT Medicine San Antonio University of Texas Health Scienc e Center at San Antonio TPI - 085144601 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): (10/1/2013 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 P-1 Establish additional primary care clinic #1 Metric 1 : P-1.1 Number of additional clinics Baseline/Goal: New clinic Data Source: P-1.1a Documentation of detailed expansion plans.

It exte nds to campuses in the metropolitan border communities of Laredo and the Rio Grande Valley. More than 3,000 students a year train in an environment that involves more than 100 affiliated hospitals, clinics and hea lth care facilities in South Texas. The primary mission of the UTHSCS A Dental School is to educate the future dental workforce for the state of Texas. In order to accomplish that goal, the Dental School requires an adequate patient pool to ensure that all of our dental studen ts and residents receive the training required to attain competency to pr actice dentistry in Texas. Accordingly, the UTHSCSA Dental School does not does not require income ve rification in order to become a patient at the Dental School. We do however track patients by source of payment. Approximately 70% of the Dental School patients in all of th e clinics in the school are identified as \"self-pay\" patien ts (dentally uninsured). In orde r to determine whether or not a patient is indigent, the DS can run a query, sorting patients by zip code and then ascertaining what % of the population in each specific zip code fall below the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). If we apply that Zip code percenta ge below the FPL to patients from the same Zip Code, we can estimate the % of indigent patients treated by the Dental School. Also, we do obtain/track information (payor stat us) for children enrolled in Medicaid CHIP, and Title V at the DS and off-site clinics on the same clinic information system. In order to determine the percentage of adult who are eligib le/enrolled in Medicaid for Medical benefits, but not dental benefits, we could add that element to our certif ied electronic health record. This would be proof of indigent status even though Me dicaid does not cover adult dental benefits in Texas. It is assumed that the majority of the patients who would seek emergency dental care in the new clinic are going to be adults (Self-paying). Most Dental Schools in the US have similar clinical operations due to the common primary goal of educating the future dental workforce and the requirement have adequate patient pools to attain our outcomes. In order to increase our pool of indigent/uninsured patients we will need to establish this baseline without requiri ng income verification in order not to undermine the total patient pool. Generally speaking, th e indigent population also presents with the greatest treatment needs and th erefore are very good teaching cases. The challenge for uninsured adults in the country who are indigent to be able to afford comprehensive dental care, The goal of the Emergency Dental Clinic proposal is to increase access to \"emergency dental care\" while simultaneously controlling costs and educating future workforce. The intent is to address the patient's chief complaint in a timely manner at a reasona ble price. A secondary goal is to educate the patients that present fo r emergency care about the importance of treating active dental disease and to enc ourage this cohort of patients to seek primary care to restore them to health and then to encourage th em to seek regular dental care, including 466 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA prevention. This approach is not designed to restore full function, that is, to provide comprehensive rehabilitative care , but rather to enc ourage this cohort of patients to work towards that goal. Some people will choose not to seek comprehensive dental care due to the costs which are not covered by Me dicaid or Medicare. The focus is on urgent care with referrals for primary care and comprehensive ca re. Hopefully, a segment of this cohort of emergency patients will decide to seek the care they need as the Dental School offers dental care to patients using different fee schedules for care provided by dental students in training, general and specialty residents in training, and dental school facult y. The fees associated with dental student training are consid erably lower that the fees asso ciated with care rendered by a faculty member. Intervention(s) : The major goal of this project is to establish an emergency dental clin ic for treating patients presenting with urgent dental c onditions including oral infections, abscesses, pain and fractured dental restorations. This clin ic will provide treatment to re solve the emergency condition and refer patients seeking comprehensive oral care to the UTHSCS A Dental School. Need for the project : Access to emergency oral health care is a chal lenging problem that greatly impacts both medical and dental treatment teams. For example, a recent Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) report demonstrated that the number of hospital ER visits (> 830,000) due to oral health emergencies has increased by nearly 16% from 2006-2009 (1). This has major health care resource implications since hospital ER visits fo r dental emergencies cost nearly ten times more than similar care delivered in a dental office ( $6,498/visit versus $660) (2). Development of an emergency dental clinic is likel y to have major community impact , particularly since nearly 66% of all emergency room visits for oral emergenc ies are by patients with a mean annual household income of <$47,000 (3). Target population : Our web-based survey indicates that low inco me populations with moderate/severe health disparities comprise the majority of subject s contacting the UTHSCSA Dental Clinic with requests for access to emergency/urgent dental ca re. Thus, the focus on these outcomes directly addresses a health care i ssue in this population. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : As described above, a hospital ER visit for emerge ncy oral health care co sts about $6,498/visit. The enclosed Table lists the projected numbers of patients and incentive paym ents for each year. In the aggregate, the total incentive costs are $6,724,213 for treating a projected 8,917 patient visits, giving a calculated cost of $1,006/patient visit. Thus, considerable value is added by establishing this oral health ca re emergency clinic. Given that the UTHSCSA Dental School is an academic institution with a primary teachi ng mission, this value is quite similar to the comparison costs for oral health emergency care delivered in a dental office, and much lower than hospital ER costs ($6,498/visit) for dental emergencies (2). Year Projected # Projec ted # Incentive Valuation 467 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Unique Patients Total Visits Payment ($/Patient Visit) Year 2 0 (planning stage) 0 $1,525,501 -- Year 3 720 800 1,675,189 $2,093/patient Year 4 2,000 $1,792,062 3,880 $1,731,461 $446/patient Category 3 outcomes: The category 3 patient benefit is a 40% increase in the proportion of indigent and impoverished patients treated over baseline values. Project Description: The major goal of this project is to establish an emergency dental clin ic for treating patients presenting with urgent dental c onditions including oral infections, abscesses, pain and fractured dental restorations. This clin ic will provide treatment to re solve the emergency condition and refer patients seeking comprehensive oral care to the UTHSCSA Dental Sc hool. It is important to note that this is a new entity since existi ng hospital emergency rooms or dental clinics only offer limited and/or irreversible treatments consis ting of extractions. Access to emergency oral health care is a challenging problem that grea tly impacts both medical and dental treatment teams. For example, a recent Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) report demonstrated that the number of hospital ER vi sits (> 830,000) due to oral health emergencies has increased by nearly 16% from 2006-2009 (1). This has major health care resource implications since hospital ER visits for dental emergencies cost nearly ten times more than similar care delivered in a dent al office ($6,498/visit versus $660) (2). Development of an emergency dental clinic is likel y to have major community impact , particularly since nearly 66% of all emergency room visits for oral emergenc ies are by patients with a mean annual household income of <$47,000 (3). Despite this widely r ecognized problem, no current emergency dental clinic exists in Bexar Country that offers any form of treatment other than an irreversible extraction, leading to a major negative imp act on long- term stab le oral health. In addition, this Clinic will develop a triage serv ice that bridges emergency treatment to dental providers that can provide comprehensive care. This service will directly benefit patients, by increased oral health, as well as providing increased training opport unities for students and residents at the UTHSCSA Dental School. Quality: To achieve continuous quality improvement we shall assess the projects impact and make adjustments as necessary, share best practice a nd lessons learned, seize scaling opportunities to expand successful outcomes to broader populat ions, and rapidly disseminate successful outcomes to other prov iders across Texas. Region 6 goals: This project achieves CMS's Triple aim objectives of assuring patients receive high quality and patient centered care, in the most cost effectiv e way, improves the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsur ed residents of the counties we serve, further develops and 468 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA maintains a coordinated care de livery system and improves outcomes while containing costs. Starting Point/Baseline: The UTHSCSA Dental School developed an online patient screening website application in 2007 (4). This application collect s demographic information and pr eliminary oral health history information that is maintained in a secure database. As of July 12, 2012, a total of 32,824 records have been entered by prospe ctive patients. An analysis of this database indicates that there is a large unmet need for treating oral emergencies. Nearly 55% of the 32,824 records included patients who entered at least one of the following keywords indicative of a need we have conducted a Ge o Map analysis of the subjects entering these keywords for the top 20 most frequently used ho me zip codes (Fig 1). The top 20 zip codes entered by these subjects were represented in ~42% of all online reco rds using the key words listed above. Two major conclusions emerge from this analysis. First, the UTHSCSA Dental School has a large catchment zone that includes broad repr esentation across our community. However, the second finding is even more significant. The zip codes most frequently used by prospective emergency dental patients are highly linked to elevated scores on the Community Needs Index (CNI; see Fig 1). The CNI identifies the severity of health disparity for every zip code in the United States (5,6). It is a composite measure of income barriers, culture/language barriers, education barriers, insurance ba rriers and housing barriers. The CNI ranges from 1 (lowest socioeconomic barriers) to 5 (highest socio-eco nomic barriers). There is >95% correlation between CNI scores and hospitalization rates, with admission rates for communities with CNI scores of 5 being ~60% greater than rates observe d in communities with CNI scores of 1 (5). Importantly, the mean CNI score for the top 20 zip codes in our database is 3.7. This analysis clearly demonstrates that there is strong need for an emergency dental clinic at UTHSCSA and that such a clinic will directly address populations with substa ntial health di sparities. 469 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA To specifically relate this to the December 2011 starting point, we have re-analyzed the online patient screening database for Dec 2011 and f ound 100 patients who reported dental emergencies via this internet ba sed application.

Despite this widely recognized problem, no current emergency dental clinic exists in Bexar Country that offers any form of treatment other than an ir reversible extraction, leading to a major negative impact on long-term stable oral health. Unique Community Need Identification Number: This project relates to RHP 6 Community Needs Assessment-Current Healthcare Infrastructure & Health Care Quality. Access to emergency oral health care is a chal lenging problem that greatly impacts both medical and dental treatment teams. For example, a recent Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) report demonstrated that the number of hospital ER visits (> 830,000) due to oral health emergencies has increased by nearly 16% from 2006-2009 (1).

Medscape Dentistry and Oral Health, posted 3/19/2012. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): We have selected IT-7.10. Other Outcome Im provement Target: Proportion of children and adults with urgent dental care needs (Stand alone measure) a Numerator: Number of children and adu lts with urgent dental care needs b Denominator: Total number of pati ents seen by a dental provider c Data Source: EHR, Claims d Rationale/Evidence: patients are less likely to suffer from more severe, urgent oral health 471 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA problems with adequate and re gular access to dental care This outcome should be a priority for the RHP since it directly addresses a community need for emergency/urgent dental care. Data are described in \"Starting Point/Baseline\" section, above. The proposed Category 1 project will help achieve this Category 3 outcome measure by providing emergency/urgent de ntal care to children and adult (including geriatric) patients. Thus, each patient treated contri butes directly to the numerator for this Outcome Measure. As described above in the \"Starting Poin t/Baseline\" section, our web-based survey indicates that low income populations with m oderate/severe health disparities comprise the majority of subjects cont acting the UTHSCSA Dental Clinic with requests for access to emergency/urgent dental care. Thus, the focus on these outcomes directly addresses a health care issue in this population. Relationship to other Projects: This project is related to the UTHSCSA Dental School IT project (1.8) in that this project establishes a new clinic within the DS which w ill rely on the IT projec t to provide the data source including core clinical quality outcome indicators required of certified EHR's for all patients treated for emergency dental care, allo wing us to analyze resu lts and assess impact. Also, this project is related to the San Ant onio Metropolitan Health District's School-Based prevention project, in that the DS Emergency De ntal Clinic will serve as a referral site for children identified as having \"urgent need\" for de ntal care as well as connection to a pediatric dental care clinic for children who need comp rehensive care and do not have a dental home. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: We will be collaborating closely with Dr. Gary Gues t, Interim Associate Dean for Patient Care at the DS and project director for the IT project, regarding the integration of the Emergency Dental Care Clinic into the DS clinical infrastructure as staffing of this c linic will require the collaboration of several disciplines in addressing the patients with urge nt care visits, including Oral Surgery, Endodontics, Advanced Genera l Dentistry, and Pediatric Dentistry. The residency directors of thes e disciplines will be involved in the Learning Collaborative to enable us to develop a schedule that will allow us to treat the patient's urgent need in this new clinic as well as provide an academic framewor k for cross fertilization, teaching dental students and residents in the same environment. Plan for Learning Collaborative: Since the DS is building a new 200,000 sq. ft. clini cal/research facility with 350 operatories will open in 2015, it will be essentia l to establish a Learning Collaborative that includes Faculty within the DS collaborating to integrate the Emergency Dental Care Clinic into the overall Mission and Goals of the institution as well as linking the departmental goals and objectives together for the good of the patient. As me ntioned, the IT project provides the necessary foundation for data collection and an alysis to enable successful im plementation of this project. Because the educational mission of dental school s is to graduate competent general dental practitioners, a significant portion of the curric ulum and clinical training is focused on the treatment of adults and as we are all aware, Medicaid does no t cover adult dental benefits, making it difficult for Dental Schools in the nati on to quality for the El ectronic Health Record Incentive program in terms of the 30% rule. Howe ver, in preparation for the opening of the new DS, the DS has ordered the certifie d edition of the AxiUm software. All of the faculty, residents, 472 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA staff and students will be trained via the IT project to use the new software - this also requires a great deal of coordination, collaboration and effi ciency so as to avoid interruption of the academic, research, and clinical missions of the DS. Also, si nce this project will depend upon staffing from various departments as well as calibration of training in operation of an ER Dental clinic, developing a referral base form various sources, and integrating sustainability in an uninsured patient pool environment, the Learning Collaborative will need to include partners outside the DS, including the De ntal Coordinator from the Sa n Antonio Metropolitan Health District. The DS Emergency Care Clinic will se rve as the referral site for children having urgent care needs. Other partners may be added to address specific issues that arise. Project Valuation: Achieves Waiver Goals (Self-Scor e =5): This project will devel op a new dental care clinic for treating emergency/urgent care patients and pr ovides new training and rotations for dental students and residents. As cited above, the cost of treating de ntal emergency patients in a dental clinic is about 10% of the cost of treatment provi ded in the ER. Thus, this project addresses the Triple Aim by providing high quality and patient cente red care in a cost effective manner. It also directly improves the health care infrastructure by BOTH establishing a new dental care clinic and reducing the volume of patients who otherwis e may use hospital ER services. Since ER services often are only extracti ons, the dental clinic treatment s would improve health outcomes by saving teeth. Addresses Community Needs (Self-Score =5): As indicated above, n early 55% of the 32,824 patient contacts to the UTHSCSA Dental School re quested emergency/urgent care treatment. Since this sample only included patie nts who had access to the internet and knew about the dental school clinic website, it li kely represents a large under-e stimate of the actual community need. Moreover, our GeoMapping analysis reveals that these patient contacts occurred from our RHP zip codes with particularly high socio-economic barriers (s ee Fig above). Thus, this project application documents a st rong community need for emergency/urgent dental care that is based both upon literature review and dire ct analysis of our RHP's population. Project Scope (Self-Score = 4): Th is project scope is large in im pact from four perspectives. First, it provides a new dental care clinic that does not currently exist. Second, it will employ expanded hours to increase patient visits/encoun ters. Third, it will i nvolve training of both dental students and residents to treat these populations increa sing the number of recruited/ trained practitioners for the population living in the borders of RHP 6. Fo urth, it will provide savings from avoiding unnecessary ER visits. Project Investment (Self-Score = 5): This project involves human re sources (faculty, staff, dental students, residents), new clinic space, new equipment and time to implement with an overall plan that integrates improvement and pr ocess to achieve the milestones. 473 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 085144601.1.12 PASS 1 1.8.6 N/A 1.8.6 INCREASE , EXPAND AND ENHANCE DENTAL SERVICES University of Texas Health Scienc e Center at San Antonio TPI - 085144601 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 085144601.3.14 3.IT7.10 Other Outcome Improvement Target Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P4]: Establish additional/expand existing/relocate dental care clinics or space Metric 1 [P4.1] Number of additional clinics, expanded space, or existing available space used to capacity Baseline/Goal: purchase equipment for 3 operatories of the emergency clinic Data Source : Equipment lists Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $ 508,500 Milestone 2 [P5]: Expand the hours of a dental care clinic or office, including both evening and/or weekend hours Metric 1 [P5.1] Develop policies for expanded hours for Milestone 4 [P-4]: Establish additional/expand existing/relocate dental care clinics or space Metric 1 [P-4.1]: Number of additional clinics, expanded space, or existing available space used to capacity Baseline/Goal: Increased number of treatment rooms by 2.

It extends to campuses in the metropolitan border communities of Laredo and the Rio Grande Valley. More than 3,000 students a year train in an environment that i nvolves more than 100 affiliated hospitals, clinics and health care facilities in South Texas. Th e primary mission of the UTHSCSA Dental School is to educate the future dental workforce for th e state of Texas. In order to accomplish that goal, the Dental School requires an adequate pa tient pool to ensure that all of our dental students and residents receive the training required to attain competency to practice dentistry/specialty practice in Texas. Acco rdingly, the UTHSCSA Dent al School does not does not require income verification in order to be come a patient at the Dental School. We do however track patients by source of payment. Approximately 70% of the Dental School patients in all of the clinics in the school ar e identified as \"self-pay\" patients (dentally uninsured). Through our Electronic Health Record system we will be able to track patients by financial class and determine percentage of pati ents that are low income, including those below federal poverty level. We will also capture information related to Medicaid status. Intervention(s) : Upgrade the oral healthcare IT in frastructure to be used with Ce rtified Software in support of the dental treatment of all patients served by the De ntal School, including special populations and mothers, infants, and children. The certified version of the EHR incor porates core clinical quality measures allowing for the tracking of medi cal conditions related to dental health status, and the treatment of special needs patients. Need for the project : The RHP Planning protocols delineate Specific Proj ect Goals which include, the enhancement of quality dental care but does not include an op tion to provide training and use of the use of a certified electronic health record. The Federal government supports the us e of the certified EPR to enhance quality as demonstrated by the E HR Incentive Program that has established and standardized clinical quality measures. Traini ng of all clinic personnel in an academic dental school setting will faci litate automated reporting and allow providers to track patient demographics, diagnoses, treatment status, referra ls, and cost of care which is essential to improving quality and providing quality assurance. The system will expand performance improvement and reporting capacity through participat ion in a clinical database for standardized data sharing and the development of a quality dashboard that is shar ed with faculty in the DS as well as with faculty in all othe r Dental Schools in the US who ar e using the Certified version of the Electronic Health Record. The system will also provide actionable quality data, streamline the specialty provider referral process, and enhanc e coordination of patient care at all DS sites. Referral will lead to joint consultation and treatm ent planning to improve patient education and 477 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA treatment as well as performance. Target population (focus on qua lity of clinical care) : The Dental School Electroni c Health Record will allow analysis of all patients to enable us to assess the quality of care rende red, provide effective care and focus on patient safety. This includes tracking key Quality Clinical Measur es as designated by \"Meaningful Use Rule\" (tobacco use, diabetes, hypertension, drug and al cohol use etc). Our web-based survey indicates that low income populations with moderate/severe health dispari ties comprise the majority of subjects contacting the UTHSCSA Dental Clinic w ith requests for access to dental care. Thus, the focus on these outcomes directly addre sses a health care issu e in this population. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : Expected patient benefit will be linked to st andards of care, treatment outcomes, patient satisfaction survey results, hea lth care provider compliance. The focus on quality of patient care is anticipated to enhance the benefit for all patients in the Dental School Clinic. Category 3 outcomes: The category 3 benefit relates to the implementati on of the certified electr onic record, training of users, analysis of patient data to support quality measures. This information will enable us to make necessary changes to improve oral health quality. Our benchmark for compliance will be 85% after year 3 implementation with goal of 95-100% in year 4. Expect ed result: to drive quality improvement through enhanced completion and information sharing. Project Description: The UTHSCSA Dental School (DS) is building a new 200,000 sq. ft. dental clinical/research facility which will be equipped with state-of -the-art dental equipment and information technology (350 dental operatories) . Our existing clinic information system will be replaced with a \"certified\" electronic hea lth record system (axiUm software ). The goal of this proposal is to upgrade the oral healthcare infr astructure to be used with th e certified software to support the dental treatment of all patients served by the Dental School, includi ng special populations and mothers, infants, and children. In Bexar Count y, 57% of children enrolle d in Head Start were found to have dental caries. Many of these childre n will receive basic dental care at the Ricardo Salinas Clinic owned by the San Antonio Housin g Authority and operated by the DS and this clinic will be included in the network using th e enhanced technology infrastructure. In order to accomplish this goal, the DS will need to upgrade the hardware technology and network systems throughout all of the clin ics and to prepare the entire de ntal school workforce and future graduates of UTHSCSA Dent al School to utilize an electronic health r ecord (EHR). Funding for E.H.R. (Certified Version) has been provided through Meaningful use incentive payment. This was for software only. The certified version of the EHR incorporates core clinical quality measures to enable us to track medical conditions related to dental health status, as well as to track the treatment of special needs patients, im prove quality controls, facilitate referrals to specialty providers as needed and enhance coordinati on of patient care at all DS sites. Results of queries from this type of system can be di splayed, mapped and exported in multiple machine readable formats for customized data analysis and or the ability to combine multiple datasets for larger population analysis. The axiUm system that will be used by the DS has the capacity to integrate with a DICOM imaging system, MiPACS. This system has analytical tools that can 478 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA assist in quantification of findings that in turn can be utilized as quality improvement efforts. Standardized data elements related to radiographic analysis from images in MIPACS will be added to axiUm EHR. The Dental School will al so utilize site licensing for a Drug Information System and Patient Education Software design ed to improve the quality of patient care. Information from the Drug Information System will be integrated into the AxiUm EHR along with surveys of patient behavior related to digital forms of patien t education materials. Faculty, students, staff and residents will be trained in the use of clinical modules of the EMR as part of their provision of dental care. Challenges: Our current CIS is outdated and does not include the clinical quality measures include d in the certified version and DS personnel are not trained in the usage of this new system. Implementation will require significant traini ng of all personnel without negatively impacting the delivery of de ntal care. Also, determ ining how to aggregate information in the EHR in a meaningful way will require accurate and precise data elements that need to be developed. All new/updated hardware and network systems will be required and will have to be integrated with the new certified so ftware at all sites. The Dental School provides approximately 120,000 patient visits pe r year at its main clinical f acility and off-site clinical training sites, serving as a safe ty net for dental patients in South Texas, most of whom are dentally uninsured and cannot afford dental car e in the private sector. For every medically uninsured individual in Texas, approximately 2.6 individuals are dentally uninsured. This proposal supports the Emergency dental care proposal. Clinical Informatics System Project applies to all patients served (unduplicated -10,000 pa tients in the dental school clinic per year in San Antonio). Clinical Informatics System Project applies to all dent al care services provided to all patients at each patient visit. Quality: To achieve continuous quality improvement we shall assess the projects impact and make adjustments as necessary, share best practice a nd lessons learned, seize scaling opportunities to expand successful outcomes to broader populat ions, and rapidly disseminate successful outcomes to other prov iders across Texas. Region 6 goals: This project achieves CMS's Triple aim objectives of assuring patients receive high quality and patient centered care, in the most cost effectiv e way, improves the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsur ed residents of the counties we serve, further develops and maintains a coordinated care de livery system and improves outcomes while containing costs. Starting Point/Baseline: The Dental School provides a pproximately 120,000 patient visits/e ncounters per year (FY 2012) at its main clinical facility and off-site clinical training sites, serving as a safety net for dental patients in South Texas, most of whom are dental ly uninsured and cannot afford dental care in the private sector. Currently none of the DS provi ders have been trained on the Certified Edition of the axiUm EHR. Approximately 500 individuals will be trained in the us e of the Certified Edition of the axiUm EHR in year 2 (2013); all new entering student s as well as new faculty and staff will be trained in subs equent years (2014-2016) 479 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Rationale: The primary reason for selecting this project is th e need to adequately prepare our students and residents to practice in an environment where th ey will have the capability to assess their own performance and the quality of the care provided to their patients as well as the need to improve the oral healthcare technology infrastructure. The Dental School's goal is to teach students and residents to use best practices and practice evidence-based den tistry upon graduation, including the attainment of competence in the treatment of patients, including sp ecial populations. The milestones and metrics relate to the IT training of the entire Dental School personnel enterprise which includes approximately 400 dental students, 120 residents, 200 faculty and125 staff. As specified in the Community Needs Assessment, a high dental caries rate (57%) was reported in Bexar County children enrolled in Head Star t. Also, 11 of the 20 counties in RHP 6 are designated entire county dental HPSA's and Be xar County is designate d as a partial county dental HPSA. Other problems include: limited access to dental care, high dentally uninsured patient rates, and lack of dental providers. Recen t prospects in the job market due to drilling for natural gas are expected to increase the populatio n in this region and presumably a demand for health care services, including oral health car e services. A comprehens ive report by the Texas Department of State Health Services, Oral Health in Texas 2008 provides a snapshot of oral health and the distribution of or al health problems among Texas re sidents. \"Infections in the mouth, such as periodontal disease can increase the risk of heart disease (Beck at al.1998). Periodontal disease has also been associated with pre-term delivery (Scannapieco,et al, 2003) and complicates the control of blood sugar for pe ople with diabetes (Taylor 12001)\". We expect to track these parameters among the entire DS patient populati on, including at DS off-campus sites which serve, children, adults, and the homel ess. In order to assess the effectiveness, timeliness and appropriateness of ca re. \"Changes in the mouth ofte n serve as first indicators of problems elsewhere in the body. And infectious diseases, immune disorders, nutritional deficiencies and cancer often first reveal themse lves by changes in the mouth\" (TDHS). Oral health disparities have been associated with ra ce, ethnicity, sex and socioeconomic class relative to oral health status and access to oral health care. Therefore, this data could be used as indicators of socioeconomic differences in oral health and can be used to analyze the burden of oral disease among patients served by the Dental School. Use of the certifi ed electronic record will also enable us to contribute to the body of sc ientific evidence related to oral health outcomes and to impact policy and the prov ision of services thru surveill ance. The Clinic Information System/Dental EHR will serve as a data source to measure milestones for the project. The system contains patient record information, clinic schedu les, transactional history for both patients and providers, billing information, consent forms and clin ical notes. Dental School faculty and staff in the office of Patient Care/Information techno logy will be responsible for the implementation of the project and for the traini ng of all the Dental School workfo rce providers involved in the delivery of patient care in the various general and specialty clinics. The DS has already begun the investment by submitting a purchase order to ac quire the certified electronic record software thru the EHR Incentive Program. Hardware to support the system , including servers, computers and network upgrades will be needed to enable the implementation of the improved healthcare storage infrastructure project at the new Oral Heal th Care and Research facility. Training will be phased in by groups of users. Ready access and s ecurity arrangements will be made to protect severs by establishing 3 separate hubs on campus i ndependent of the dental school. Since this system underlies the basis of tracking both educat ional and patient care outcomes, it will need to be in place and the providers traine d in order to ensure successful transition to a new facility and 480 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA to an updated electronic health record system. CN.3 This project addresses the need for greater access and enhance quality assessment to dental services for the indigent and Medicaid eligible populations as ascertain ed from the Certified Electronic System. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): Proposed Category 3 Outcome Measure (I-X) Proposed : Enhance quality assessment of dental care via use of information technol ogy. (Proposed Standalone measure) The primary reason for selecting this project is th e need to adequately prepare our students and residents to practice in an environment where th ey will have the capability to assess their own performance and the quality of the care provided to their patients as well as the need to improve the oral healthcare technology infrastructure. The Dental School's goal is to teach students and residents to use best practices and practice evidence-based de ntistry upon graduation. The milestones and metrics relate to the training of the entire Dental School personnel enterprise which includes approximately 400 dental students, 120 residents, 175 faculty and 125 staff. The current dental care delivery system and dental workforce are currently segregated from the healthcare system, making coordination of care a nd the attainment of ove rall health outcomes that are impacted by oral health status impossibl e. While the technology does not exist to enable electronic health r ecord systems to communicate directly among all providers, the capacity to export relevant oral health status data to health care practitioners treati ng patients with diabetes, heart disease, cancer, etc. can impact patients' overall health status. a Numerator: Number of DS facu lty, students, residents and staff trained in use of Certified EHR b Denominator: Total number of faculty, students, residents and staff involved in patient care delivery at the Dental School and Off-campus sites c Data Source: Training logs/s chedules; training materials d Rationale/Evidence: The ability to impact the effectiveness, timeline ss and appropriateness of care within the UTHSCSA dental school and its' off-campus sites all of which serve low-income populations and to have the capacity to share this information with other providers of health care services and dental educators is critical to maintaining the quality of dental educational institutions. (F ontaine et al). Relationship to other Projects: This project supports the UTHSCS A Emergency Care proposal (1.8). This project will enable the DS to track increased access to dental ca re, improve urgent dental care and improve performance and reporting capaci ty throughout all of the dent al clinics using the same technology. Additionally, the training and upgrad ing of our electronic information system (hardware) to the utilization of a \"certified\" electronic record will enable us to provide information relative to many of the medical clinical measures in the DS population which is expected to increase dental care coordination within the dental school and identify patients. With implementation of the certified system along with project goals database elements and their aggregation into reports, we will be able us to evaluate special populati ons to address project goals. 481 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: We will be collaborating closely with Dr. Ken Hargreaves, Chairman, Department of Endodontics to support the establishment of a new Em ergency Dental Care Clinic at the DS and the integration of the Emergency Dental Care C linic into the DS clinical information technology storage infrastructure. All of this will requ ire significant planning, co llaboration of several disciplines in addressing the patients with urgent care visits, including Oral Surgery, Endodontics, Advanced General Dentistry, and Pediatri c Dentistry as well as all patients in the Dental Scholl served by the 10 general and spec ialty disciplines as well as the undergraduate dental school and the dental hygiene clinics (approximately 240 dental operatories). The residency directors of thes e disciplines as well as the un dergraduate faculty clinic group leaders and dental hygiene faculty will be involved in the Learning Collaborative to enable us to develop a schedule that will allow us to not only treat the large volume of dental patients that present to the dental clinic for dental care on a da ily basis. This will also provide the basis for an academic framework for cross fertilization, teach ing dental/dental hygiene students and dental residents in the Dental School clinics. Plan for Learning Collaborative: Since the DS is building a new 200,000 sq. ft. cl inical/research facility with 350 dental operatories that will open in 2015, it will be esse ntial to establish a Le arning Collaborative that includes faculty and staff within the DS collabor ating to integrate the Emergency Dental Care Clinic into the overall Mission and Goals of the institution as well as linking the departmental goals and objectives together fo r the good of all patients. As me ntioned the IT project provides the data collection and analysis necessary for the treatment of all patients. Because the educational mission of dental schools is to grad uate competent general dental practitioners, a significant portion of the curriculum and clinical training is focused on the treatment of adults and as we are all aware, Medicaid does not c over adult dental benefits, making it difficult for Dental Schools in the nation to quality for the Electronic Health Record Incentive program in terms of the 30% rule. However, in preparation for the opening of the new DS, the DS has ordered the certified edition of the axiUm software and will need to upgrade the hardware and network systems as well as train a large cohort of dental workforce personne l in the use of this new technology. All of the faculty, residents, staff and dental/dental hygiene students will be trained via the IT project to use the new software - this also requi res a great deal of coordination, collaboration and efficiency so as to avoid inte rruption of the academic, clinical and research missions of the DS. Also, since the Emergency Care project will also require staffing from various departments as well as calibration of tr aining in operation of an ER Dental clinic, developing a referral base form various sources, and integrating sustainability in an uninsured patient pool environment, the Lear ning Collaborative will also in clude partners outside the DS, including the Dental Consultant from the San An tonio Metropolitan Health District. The DS operates a pediatric dentistry clinic owned by th e City of San Antonio. Also, the DS operates a 15 chair dental clinic at the Laredo Health De partment which is sta ffed by UTHSCSA Dental School full-time and part-time faculty; this clin ic will be incorporated into the upgraded EHR network and a representative from the LHD program will be part of the learning collaborative via video conferencing. Other partne rs may be added to address specific issues that arise. 482 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Project Valuation: This project is intended to provide the informati on infrastructure needed to ensure that patients treated at the Dental School a nd off-site clinics receive high qu ality, patient-centered dental care in a cost effective and efficient manner; and that the dental care is coor dinated and that better dental care outcomes are attained for all de ntal school patients, in cluding the uninsured, Medicaid and CHIP as well as Title V and speci al needs patients. The DS will implement and train the dental school faculty, sta ff, dental/dental hygiene students and residents in the use of the certified electronic record. Through this projec t, we will track dental treatment outcomes, cost savings, efficiency of dental care delivery and referral systems within de ntal school to specialty departments, reduction in dental errors/prosthetic replacements , measure student performance, provide broad array of clinical experiences re quired to train dentists, dental hygienists, and dental specialists to be competent practitione rs, and identify gaps in training needs. The implementation of the certified electronic record, tr aining of users, analysis of patient data to support quality measures. This information will enab le us to make necessary changes to improve oral health quality. Our benchmark for complia nce (patient records documentation, treatment outcomes, and diagnosis/treatment of oral diseas es) will be 85% after year 3 implementation with goal of 95-100% in year 4. Th e Electronic Record System will be used to coordinate care between general and specialty dent ists. Data from this system can aggregated and exported to machine readable formats for data mapping and warehousing to aid in quality of care assessments over multiple systems including systems used by medical providers. We are working with the City of San Antonio/San Antoni o Metropolitan Health Dist rict to develop data warehousing strategy to assess quality of care for the Children's Oral Hea lth Initiative. This initiative proposes to provide preventive dental services to 10,000 unders erved children in San Antonio / Bexar County. The dental school anticipat es that all patients wi ll benefit from the implementation of the Electronic Dental Record which has a significant focus is on quality of care. A value added benefit is the training of future oral health care workforce on use of technology to enhance quality of care. Achieves Waiver goals: this project focuses on assuring that patients receive high-quality care through monitoring treatment via use of the certifi ed electronic health record. It improves the oral health care infrastructure to better serve all patients, including Medi caid patients and will enable the DS to further develop and maintain an internal coordinated care delivery system. The implementation of this project is expected to im prove oral health outcomes while containing cost and minimizing unneeded treatment. This project will also impact the DS urgent care clinic, facilitating reporting and standardization and imp acts all patients treated by the DS. The evidence supports implementation of the Certif ied EHR. Addresses Community Needs: this project supports all of the DS treatment programs and is exp ected to provide real-time evidence regarding treatment outcomes for patients, incl uding the underserved and uninsured, many of whom seek treatment in the DS. Project Scope: Patient visits/encounters will be tracked for all patients along with clinical core measures, providers will be tr ained and savings are anticipated due to better coordination of comprehensive dental care. Project Investment: this project involves human resources (faculty, staff, dental students , residents), new clinic facility, new equipment and time to implement with an overall plan that integrates improvement and process to achieve the milestones.

It exte nds to campuses in the metropolitan border communities of Laredo and the Rio Grande Valley. More than 3,000 students a year train in an environment that involves more than 100 affiliated hos pitals, clinics and health care facilities in South Texas. Intervention(s) : This project will establish pilot hearing health care delivery model with the goal of making hearing health care services (includi ng hearing aids) more accessible and affordable for those needing it. It will incorporate ne wly evolving teleaudiology technology placed in existing healthcare location that do not have au diology services; in the context of student training (1.cooperative Doctor of Audiology degree progra m (UT-Austin/UTSHCSA; and 2.UTHSCSA nursing and other pr ofessional degree (e.g. PA, OT) programs and possibly the St. Phillips Alamo College nursing program all particip ating in a Teleaudiolo gy Clinical Technician course), who will together with mentor audiology faculty learn to deliver teleaudiology services to the target population of adults with self-identifie d hearing concerns who are not otherwise accessing hearing health care services. Need for the project : It is estimated that 35+million peopl e in the U.S. have hearing loss significant enough to interfere w ith communication and quality of life, with only about 24% receiving help for their hearing loss. Accessibility, affordability and effectiveness of hearing health care services (including hear ing aids) have been identified as significant factors related to the gap between those needing hearing health care services and those receiving them. As in the rest of the U.S., these issues related to poor utiliz ation of hearing health ca re are also particularly true in the South Texas region with its vast geographical area, limited hearing health care facilities, and wide educationa l, health care, and socioecono mic diversity represented among South Texas residents. Target population : Although a significant por tion of the adult populati on with hearing loss are Medicaid and Medicare eligible , hearing health care services delivered via the telehealth modality are not currently reimbursed, with only lim ited coverage of hearing aids for Medicaid patients and no hearing aid paymen t coverage for Medicare patients. This pilot project is an effort to show the effectiveness of hearing he alth care services delivered via the telehealth modality, in terms of triage of pa tients to the next level of appropr iate hearing health care when necessary, and on-site remote teleaudiology delivery of appr opriate hearing health care (including hearing aids) for appropr iate hard of hearing adult patie nts (e.g. those with mild to 488 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA severe bilaterally symmetrical hearing loss, uncomplicated by other medical conditions affecting the auditory system). Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : 700 hard of hearing patients (100 in year three; 200 in year 4 and 400 in year five) will be served via teleaudiology consultation, by 15 Doctor of Audiology students in conjuncti on with 15-30 nursing students a nd other professional degree program students participating in the TCT course, working coope ratively under the supervision of audiology faculty in years 2 through 5 of the project. Category 3 outcomes: The goal over years 2-5 of the pr oject is to use teleaudiology to successfully deliver entry-level he aring health care and triage se rvices to 700 patients, and open fit mini behind the ear hearing ai ds fit with standard earbud coupling to patients for whom they are appropriate and who would, according to the patients, otherwise not have had access to hearing health care and hearing aid services. Patie nt self-ratings for those using their new hearing aids will be completed regarding their abili ty to achieve their own goals for improved communication and social function, acceptable h earing aid satisfaction in daily life, and reduction in self-perceived hearing handicap. Project Description: Establish an innovative pilot South Texas (Bexar County) Hearing Health Care Delivery Model which incorporates existing and new resources including: Teleaudiology; a new level of support personnel (Teleaudiology Clinical Technicians (T CTs); a \"Drop-In Heari ng Clinic\" ; community clinic collaborations; and ex isting partner audiologists, ot olaryngologists and Primary Care Providers (MDs/NPs/PAs). This model targets pr imarily members of the adult hard of hearing population; the majority of whom are not rece iving diagnostic/rehabil itative help for their hearing loss. Our ability to communicate using the unique synergies of hearing, speech, voice and language separates humans from the rest of the animal kingdom. It is estimated that 35+ million people in the U.S. have hearing loss sign ificant enough to interfere with 65 years and 50-50% over 75 years. It is estimated that onl y 24% are receiving help for their hearing loss: with accessibility, affordability and effectiveness of hearing health care services being significant factors causally related to the gap between those needing hearing health care services an d those receiving them. The South Texas Hearing Health Care Deliver y Model proposed speci fically addresses the challenges of accessibility, cost and effectiven ess in the delivery of hearing health care (including hearing aids) to the majority of adults who need it. Specifically, this model proposes the integration of Doctor of Audiology educati on with the education of other professional students (e.g. nursing students, PA students, etc) who would be completing the new \"Teleaudiology Clinical Technician Course\", and the delivery of teleaudiology clinical services via teams of audiologists/TCTs in a \"Drop In H earing Clinic\" placed in co llaborative partnership in the UTHSCSA Student/Employee Health. This proj ect proposes to coordi nate the education of audiologists with that of stude nts in the Teleaudiology Clinical T echnician Course to learn to jointly deliver teleaudiology services (hearing/ot oscopic screening, hearing aid assessment and dispensing) at a service delivery site (\"Drop In Hearing Clini c\") that is located away from the main audiology clinic and more geographically conve nient to the target patients, with ability to triage and determine which hearing health car e needs can be delivered at the Drop In Clinic versus which needs require referral to the next le vel of primary or specialty care. Five year expected outcomes for providers include: 15 UT-Austin/UTHSCSA Doctor of Audiology 489 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA students will complete clinical rotations among the CECSD hearing/balanc e consortium partners in the San Antonio region including particip ation in the Drop-In Te will comp lete the Teleaudiology Clinical Technician training course and engage in teleaudiology clini cal service delivery in the Drop -In Hearing Clinic. Five year expected outcomes for patients: 700 adult patient s will be served at the Drop In Hearing Clinic location and either provided with high perfor mance mini-BTE hearing aids or appropriately referred to the next level of hearing health care. The objectives (core component s) of the project are: 1.7.1 e. to provide patient consultations by audiologists, and ENT specialists as needed, w ith the assistance of a Teleaudiology Clinical Technicians (a new and necessary category of telehealth support personnel) using telecommunications and digitally-based video otoscopes, audiometers, immittance equipment, real ear probe microphone equipment, and digita lly programmable hearin g aids that are all remotely controllable by the audiologist w ith the local assistance of the TCT, and 1.7.1 f conduct continuous quality improvement by assessi ng the projects impact and make adjustments as necessary, share best practices and lessons learned, seize scaling opportunities to expand successful outcomes to broader populations, a nd rapidly disseminate successful outcomes to other providers across Texas. Region 6 goals: This project achie ves CMS's Triple aim objectives of assuring patients receive high quality and patient centered care, in the most cost effective way, improves the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of the counties we serve, further develops and maintains a coordinated care delivery system and improves outcomes while containing costs.

The DSRI P funding will complete the mosaic of funding to develop the proposed innova tive audiology/TCT educationa l programs and pilot the new hearing health care delivery system model proposed. Baseli ne 12/1/2011 hearing health care services are currently delivere d at a variety of unrelated a udiology, hearing aid dispensing, and ENT offices in Bexar county; w ith hearing aids costing on aver age $2600/aid, and minimal to no existing third party coverage for them. Hearing aids are a core component of successful hearing loss rehabilitation, and with the current hearing health care de livery model, only those with hearing loss who can find, access and afford hearing he alth care are getting help for this chronic condition; resulting in failure to \"thrive\", loss of productivity, social disengagement, and breakdown in family and social functioning. Cu rrently no clients outside of the VA Hospital System in Bexar County are being served by a te le-hearing health deliver y model as the model does not currently exist. There are also very few if any audiologists traine d in the delivery of teleaudiology services in the United States, much less the stat e of Texas and Bexar County, and the category of hearing health care support personnel, Teleaudiol ogy Clinical Technician (TCT), does not exist outside of the VA Health Care Sy stem. We also do not currently have a TCT course in place and the joint or cooperativ e UTHSCSA CECSD component of the UT-Austin Doctor of Audiology program is currently going through the development and approval process at UT-Austin, UTHSCSA, culminating in the creation of the joint or cooperative UT- Austin/UTHSCSA Doctor of Audiology program. Rationale: The target goal of this project is to develop a pilot model for a limited scope integrated South Texas Hearing Health Care Network that will en able an optimum continuum of care for patients with hearing/balance and related communication disorders and coordina te the education of audiology students in the UT-Austin/UTHSCSA Doctor of Audiology program with those nurses, PAs or other professional program students, in the new TC T certificate course, with the overall goal of expanding audiol ogy clinical practice to includ e the delivery of teleaudiology services as proposed in this model. There is great disparity betw een those with chronic sensorineural hearing loss needi ng hearing health care services, in cluding hearing aids, and those receiving it in Bexar County and elsewhere in Texa s and the U.S. Behavior al Health and Mental Well-Being has been identified as a priority area in the RHP 6 Community Health Improvement Plan for Bexar County . One's ability to effectively commun icate with others through the most natural avenues of hearing and oral speech/langu age is fundamental to human behavioral and mental health. Research has shown that thos e with un-rehabilitated hearing loss significant enough to interfere with communi cation results in symptoms of social withdrawal, social isolation, depression, anxiety, frus tration, and paranoia. Individua ls who also have significant /debilitating tinnitus for which treatment has not been provided have also been shown to have sleep disorders, family/marital discord, vocational problems, and have even committed suicide because of their inability to cope with their unr elenting tinnitus and hearing loss. Hearing health care services including hearing aids and related adjustment a nd communication counseling have 491 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA been shown to significantly reduce these negative symptoms/behaviors in persons with hearing loss. This project proposes a hearing health care model that would enable more individuals with hearing loss to benefit from appr opriate hearing health care inte rvention, includi ng the use of hearing aids, with the goal of minimizing the contribution of hearing loss as one of the many stressors in the lives of Bexar County citizens pa rticipating in this pilo t hearing health care system model. This teleaudiology model proposed in this project is made possible by the advent of computer-based hearing test equipment and hearing aids that can be operated remotely via two-way audio/video interactive digital Internet technology. This techno logy allows audiologists and ENTs to expand their existing practices to include teleaudiology/te lehealth delivery of hearing health care, including hear ing aids. This means that audi ologists/ENTs participating in the South Texas Hearing Health Care Telehe alth network could partner with a remote community-based Drop-In Hearing clinic (e.g. UTHSCSA student/employee health clinic) to provide hearing health care to pa tients being seen at that clinic, without the need to expand their own clinical infrastructure other than the addi tion of a two-way A/V desk-top video conferencing equipment (e.g. CISCO/Polycom) and their o ffice computer. Via their desk-top video conferencing system, they can then hook-up to the video conferencing system at the Drop-In Hearing Clinic and the digital audiometric probe mi crophone equipment and hearing aid programming software) to provide teleaudiol ogy services and patient counseli ng with the esse ntial support of the on-site TCT. A Hearing Health Care Ne twork consists of audiologists/ENTs in the community who sign on as providers in the Netw ork; enabling them to expand their existing practices and \"reach\" to locations closer to wher e the patients live, and enabling patients with hearing loss who would otherwise be un-served due to lack of a ccess to, lack of trust in, and expense of the current hearing health care system, to receive the hearing health care that they need. This proposed innovative South Texas Hear ing Health Care System model incorporating telehealth and new ways of pr oviding patient hearing health care has been embraced by the NIH/NIDCD challenge to de velop innovative approaches to hearing health care delivery that will demonstrate a model for delivery of hearing hea lth care to underserved populations that is accessible/lower in cost and effec tive for the majority of adults with hearing loss desiring hearing health care and hearing aids ; NIDCD research on hearing health care (R01) :(http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/ PA-100253.html and NIDCD Re search on Hearing Health Care (R21/R33): http://grants.nih.gov/ grants/guide/rfa-f iles/RFA-DC-12-003.html Dr. Novak has had initial discussions with NIDCD program officers Dr. Amy Donahue and Dr. Dan Sklare, regarding this proposed model for heari ng health care and heari ng aid delivery. They have expressed sincere interest in the model and funding of it as a demonstration project in the future. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): Category 3 reporting options related to this proposal : OD-10 Quality of Life/Function al Status; IT-10.1 Quality of Life (Standalone measure) In general our goal for individuals with hearing loss that is significantly interfering with their ability to communicate and generall y enjoy life is to enable them through appropriate assessment and intervention including use of appropriate hearing aids a nd supportive counseling, to hear more of the sounds around them and better understand speech in a range of situations. Our goal is to help them increase all communication-rela ted activities (World H ealth Organization). In 492 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA short, to more effectively claim their unaliena ble rights to life, liber ty and the pursuit of happiness. To assess the benefit derived from amplificatio n and the resultant reduction in hearing handicap and improved life quality we will administer thre e brief questionnaires, prior to intervention (at the time of initial assessment) and following inte rvention (30 -45 days after the initial fitting of amplification and ini tial communication counseling). Need for programming changes to the hearing aid and further counseling will be determ ined at the second visit as well. Three standardized self-assessment meas ures will be used: The Client Oriented Scale of Improvement (COSI);The 10 item Hearing Handicap Inventor y for Adults/Elderly Screening Version (HHIE),(Ventry & Weinstein, 1982 ) which assess both the social and emotional impact of hearing loss on the individual, and the 15 item Sa tisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life scale (SADL) (Cox and Alexander, 1999), which a ssess positive effect comprised of decreased communication disability, improved self-conf idence, improved sound quality, and overall assessment of worth; service and cost, comprising reliability, clinician competence, and cost; negative features comprised of reaction to b ackground sounds, feedback, and the hearing aid's usefulness on the telephone; and personal image, comprised of appearance and the apparent reaction of others. Pre and post measures will be taken to assess reduc tion in hearing handicap and desired increase in communication ability an d overall satisfaction an d improvement in life quality. Documentation will be maintained to de termine those patients are successfully served at the telehealth site, versus t hose needing referral to the next le vel of audiology/ENT care at the central site. Documentation will also be mainta ined to determine number of patients to whom hearing aids are dispensed and w ho are successfully using them ve rsus those who have returned the aids with assessment of residua l reasons for rejection of the hearing aids, after attempts have been made to support successful use, with imp lications for modifications in the telehealth delivery system as needed. Relationship to other Projects: 1.1 Expand Primary Care: Dr. Julie Cowan Novak We have identified the UTHSCSA Clinical Ente rprise as well as the UTHSCSA School of Nursing as partners in enabling nursing stude nts to develop the technical skills through participation in a Teleaudiology Clinical Technici an Certification Course, necessary for them to support the delivery of teleaudiol ogy services in part nership with Doctor of Audiology students in joint UT-Austin/UTHSCSA Do ctor of Audiology program. We have also identified the UTHSCSA Student Health and Employee Health s ite as a location for a pilot Drop-In Hearing Clinic that would serve as both a laboratory fo r this collaborative/cr oss-disciplinary student education, as well as a convenient entry point for UTHSCSA students and faculty into the hearing health care delivery system. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: There are no other similar projects being proposed Plan for Learning Collaborative: There are no other similar projects being proposed 493 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Project Valuation: The value of this project is in its creation of a new model for hearing health care delivery that incorporates both new and existing personnel and ne w and existing health care facilities in multi- level hearing health care assessment/treatment m odel designed to address the gross disparity in percentage of adults with heari ng loss receiving heari ng health care services versus all who need those services. Consistent with the definition of health care \"v alue\" as health outcomes per dollar spent, it is designed to provide more c onvenient patient access to lower cost effective hearing health care resulting in improved hearing/communicati on ability for an increased percentage of those who need effective heari ng health care. The m odel acknowledges that a significant percentage of this population has se nsorineural hearing loss that is essentially bilaterally symmetrical with no other medically-r elated hearing/balance complications and who primarily need assessment of their hearing and appropriate fitting/adjustment of digital single processing hearing aid technology delivered and supported as cl ose to their neighborhood as possible. A smaller percentage of the adult ha rd of hearing populati on needs more extensive audiology and medical services. They are in need of triage from the Drop-In Hearing Clinic with referral to the next level of audi ology/medical care. A goal of this project is to demonstrate an approach to the \"right care, each time for each pa tient\" for individuals entering the hearing health care system. This triage and referral pro cess would be accomplished through the Drop-In Hearing Clinic access point staffed by remote co mmunity audiologists participating in the Drop- In Hearing Clinic Network, working in conj unction with onsite Te leaudiology Clinical Technician whom they supervise. Next-level referrals would be to network audiology/ENT providers who the patients identify as located conveniently to them and/or who has the most immediate ability to schedule a next-level hearin g health care appointment for the patient. This would enable the patient to begin the referral relationship facilitated at the Drop-In Hearing Clinic site. The scope of this pilot project is limited to 2 site: UTHSCSA Student/Employee Health Clinic with audiology faculty and thei r Au.D. students providing the re mote audiology services from the UTHSCSA MARC, University Health Sy stems Audiology Department; or UT-Austin Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders on-campus audiology clinic in conjunction with UTHSCSA nursi ng or other professional de gree students taking the TCT course. This scope is designed to bring heari ng health care services to UTHSCSA students, employees and their families at a central campus location. Pr oject outcomes for providers include: 15 joint UT-Austin/UTHSCSA Doctor of Audiology students will complete clinical rotations among the CECSD hearing/balance cons ortium partners in the San Antonio region including delivery of audiology services under fa culty supervision in the Drop-In 15-30 LVN/RN/NP students will comple te Clinical Certificate training and engage in teleaudi ology clinical service delivery unde r supervision in the Drop-In Hearing Clinic. Project outcomes for patients: 700 adult patients will be served at the Drop In Hearing Clinic locations and either provided wi th high performance mini -BTE hearing aids as appropriate or appropriately referred to the next level of hearing health care. 494 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 085144601.1.15 PASS 2 1.7.1 1.7.1 (E, F) 1.7.1 - IMPLEMENT TELEMEDICINE PROGRAM TO PROVIDE OR EXPAND SPECIALIST REFERRAL SERVICES IN AN AREA IDENTIFIED AS NEEDED TO THE REGION [REENGINEERING THE HEARING HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN SOUTH TEXAS : A TELEHEALTH MODEL FOR ADDRESSING THE UNMET HEARING HEALTH CARE/HEARING AID NEEDS OF ADULTS WITH MILD TO SEVERE BILATERAL SENSORINEURAL HEARING LOSS] University of Texas Health Scienc e Center at San Antonio TPI - 085144601 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 085144601.3.23 3.IT-10.1 Quality of Life Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 P1 - Conduct needs assessment to identify needed specialties that can be provided via telemedicine.

It extends to campuses in the metropolitan border communities of Laredo and the Rio Grande Valley. More than 3,000 students a year train in an environment that i nvolves more than 100 affiliated hospitals, clinics and health care facilities in South Texas. Intervention(s) : This project is to use telemedicine to provide the specialized cancer-care to underserved areas delivered safely and effec tively in their own communities. As a NCI- designated Cancer Center, the CTRC is committed to enhancing access to specialty cancer care in underserved areas. Need for the project : Cancer is a leading public health issue in Texas (It is the number one cause of death for children in Texas age 1-14, and the leading cause of death for people in Texas age 85 or younger). Effective communi cation is central to quality cancer-care from Primary- Prevention to survivorship (Institute of Medici ne Report 1999). In the absence of effective communication, providers of cancer-care are forced to refer patients to tertiary care centers, and the patients and public are forced to travel enormous distances to tertiary-care cancer centers at significant cost to their qual ity of life and financial health. Communication methods like telemedicine can improve cancer healthcare by enhancing cancer-relat ed decision-making and motivate action to improve the quality of cancer care in underserved areas. Target population : Our target population is the underserve d population with or at-risk for cancer in Central and South Texas. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The CTRC is committed to enhancing Cancer- Telemedicine to communities in underserved areas of South Texas by expanding use of telehealth to provide expert multidisciplinary cancer conferences and Tumor Boards to improve access to evidence-based cancer decision-making acro ss the disease spectrum from prevention to survivorship and end of life care. Increase the percent of providers in unders erved areas of South Texas accessing specialty cancer-care consulta tions by cancer telemedicine by 25% over baseline; of patients in those areas receivi ng tertiary cancer-care by telehealth in their own communities by 30 % over baseline by Year-3 of implementation Category 3 outcomes: The project seeks to increase th e number of patients accessing cancer telemedicine from 60 to 75. Increasing the number of underserved areas from 3 to 5 in DY4 and Increase the number of patients accessing cancer telemedicine from 75 to 100. Increasing the number of underserved areas from 5 to 7 in DY5 499 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Project Description: Our goal is to increase access to tertiary-l evel evidence-based cancer care from primary prevention to survivorship and palliative ca re in underserved areas of South Texas. This project is to provide ideal cancer health care to underserved areas which is the highest priority for the Cancer Therapy and Research Center (CTRC). As a NCI-designated Cancer Center, the CTRC is committed to enhancing acce ss to specialty cancer care in underserved areas, and to use telemedicine to provide the specialized cancer-c are that they need delivered safely and effectively in their own communities. Pl ease see attached table for milestone, metrics, targets. Increase the numb er of electronic consultations for sp ecialty cancer care without patient being scheduled for an in-person visit, thereby reducing healthcare costs. Reduce wait times for specialty cancer care by expe diting tertiary level care. Finding the ideal time for telemedicine conferen ce to suit the audience ; designing just-in-time consultations for cancer prevention and treatm ent questions; garnering support from local community cancer healthcare providers to access the service; and advertising this service effectively. With plans to implement cancer-related teleme dicine services in Webb (Laredo), Hidalgo (Edinburgh), and Cameron (Brownsville) counties in the initial phase and expand to Val Verde (Del-Rio), Maverick (Carrizo Springs and Eagl e Pass), Victoria and Me dina (Hondo) Counties in years 3-5, we believe that this project will ha ve a major positive impact on the cancer-related health care in this region. Region 6 goals: This project achieves CMS's Triple aim objectives of assuring that patients receive high quality and patient centered care in the most cost effec tive way, improving the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured resi dents of the counties we serve, and further developing and maintaining a coordinated care delivery system that improves outcomes while containing costs. Quality: To achieve continuous quality improvement we shall assess the projects impact and make adjustments as necessary, share best practice a nd lessons learned, seize scaling opportunities to expand successful outcomes to broader populat ions, and rapidly disseminate successful outcomes to other prov iders across Texas. Starting Point/Baseline: Cancer is a leading public health issue in Texas (It is the number one cause of death for children in Texas age 1-14, and the leading cause of death for people in Texas age 85 or younger). Effective communication is central to quali ty cancer-care from Primary-Prevention to survivorship (Institute of Medicine Report 1999). In the absence of effective communication, providers of cancer-care are forced to refer patients to tertiary car e centers, and the patients and 500 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA public are forced to travel enorm ous distances to tertiary-care cancer centers at significant cost to their quality of life and financia l health. Communication methods like telemedicine can improve cancer healthcare by enhancing cancer-related de cision-making and motivate action to improve the quality of cancer care in unde rserved areas. It is important to use modern communication technology to improve knowledge about, access to, and use of high quality, evidence-based cancer control strategies regardless of race, et hnicity, health status, education, income, age, gender, culture, or geographic re gion. As a National Cancer Inst itute-designated Cancer Center, the Cancer Therapy and Research Center (CTRC) is committed to enhancing access to specialty cancer care in underserved areas, and to use tele medicine to provide the specialized cancer-care that they need delivered safely and effectivel y in their own communities. To this end, the CTRC is committed to enhancing Cancer-Telemedicine to communities in underserved areas of South Texas by expanding use of telehealth to provide expert multidisciplinary cancer conferences and Tumor Boards to improve access to evidence-bas ed cancer decision-making across the disease spectrum from prevention to survivorship and end of life care. Increase th e percent of providers in underserved areas of South Texas accessing sp ecialty cancer-care consultations by cancer telemedicine by 25% over baseline; and of patients in those areas receiving tertia ry cancer-care by telehealth in their own communities by 30 % over baseline by Year-3 of implementation. Rationale: The CTRC is committed to enhancing Cancer-Telemedicine to communities in underserved areas of South Texas by expanding use of telehea lth to provide expert multidisciplinary cancer conferences and Tumor Boards to improve acce ss to evidence-based cancer decision-making across the disease spectrum from prevention to survivorship and end of life care. Increase the percent of providers in underserved areas of South Texas accessing specialty cancer-care consultations by cancer telemedicine by 25% ove r baseline; and of patients in those areas receiving tertiary cancer-care by telehealth in their own comm unities by 25 % over baseline by Year-3 of implementation. The CTRC has established strong colla borative partnerships to provi de cancer telehealth services and virtual Tumor Boards with cancer health providers and communities in Laredo, Harlingen, Edinburgh, with plans to extend services to Del Rio, Eagle Pass, Carizo Springs, Victoria, and Hondo. Video-conferencing using Webex communication has been su ccessfully tested for links to Laredo and Harlingen. Dr. Karnad has made trips to Harlingen and to Laredo with CTRC teams to establish cancer teleme dicine conferences and tumor boa rds in formats most acceptable to the communities served, and highlighting spec ific cancer types common in those communities (hepatocellular carcinoma) or for expert consultation on uncommon cancers (leukemia and hematological cancers). This project addresses the fo llowing community needs: CN.2, a high prevalence of chronic dis ease and related health disparities requiring greater prevention efforts and improved manageme nt of patients with chronic conditions. Cancer is a leading cause of death in RHP 6. CN.1, the need for improved health care quality in our community. CN.3, the need for improved access to medical care due to health care provider shortages.

Per centage increase the nu mber of patients accessing cancer telemedicine services. 1. Health Disparities: 1. Can cer is the leading cause of deat h among Hispanics in the US\u2014the largest and fastest growing minority group in the US. It is therefor e a priority for this RHP to serve 20% of all Hispanics in the US residing in Texas who potentially face cancer health disparity. It is essential to note that 1 in 2 Hispanic men, and 1 in 3 Hispanic women will be diagnosed with cancer, and the lifetime proba bility of dying from cancer is 1 in 5 for Hispanic men and 1 in 6 for Hispanic women. 2. Disparity between rural and urban cancer-sur vival can be improved by telemedicine efforts to enhance delivery of ideal care to populations at risk: Sabesan S, et al., Rural Remote Health. 2009 Jul-Sep;9(3):1146. 3. The delivery of complex cancer-care in th e patient's own communities instead of their having to travel to tertiary-care centers will re sult in significant improvement in quality of life, and eliminate delays between diagnosis and treatment leadi ng to improvement in survival. Relationship to other Projects: This project is related to 4 other projects under the plans to \"Introduce, Expand, or Enhance Telemedicine/Telehealth. Three of these are hospital based in Be xar County: University Health System, Christus Santa Rosa, and Methodist Hospita l Systems. The other, like our project is at UTHSCSA. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: While a list of the other provider names is not available at this time, we would be able to immediately implement a learning collaborative to support this project an d share best practices since all the other 4 projects ar e in our Medical Center Campus. Plan for Learning Collaborative: Our project focuses on cancer as a primary diseas e category in our area. We would establish a learning collaborative meeting that is regul arly scheduled, perhaps also conducted via teleconference, and identify shared goals even though the focus of the other projects will be a different category of illness, or target group: identifying stakeholders for areas served; telemedicine/telehealth program content; Inform ation technology costs and implementation; and ideal outcome measure evaluation systems. Project Valuation: Cancer is a huge burden in Texas an d it is important to point out th at Cancer is the leading cause of death among Hispanics in the US\u2014the largest and fastest grow ing minority group in the US. With 20% of all Hispanics in the US residing in Texas, we will need to prepare for 1 in 2 Hispanic men, and 1 in 3 Hispanic women being diagnosed with cancer, and the lifetime probability of dying from cancer is 1 in 5 for Hispanic men and 1 in 6 for Hispanic women (American Cancer Society, Can cer Facts and Figures for Hisp anics and Latinos 2012-2014), we will need to enhance the access to specialty cancer-care using telemedicine and for this 502 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA population. In addition, there ar e projected to be nearly 12 million cancer survivors by 2020, >60% of whom are age >65\u2014it is critical, therefore, to use the best technology to provide immediate access to specialty cancer-care across all areas of Texas urban and rural using telemedicine to deal with this magnitude of elderly cancer survivor s who will need care, surveillance, and efforts to prom ote healthy aging (Parry C et al., Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 2011;20:1996-2005). There is a disproportionately highe r incidence of the following can cers in South Texas: cervical cancer (11.5/100,000), liver and gall bladde r cancer (10.4/100,000), stomach cancer (8.6/100,000) and childhood leukemia (47/million). This project will serve the needs of these high-incidence cancers in a ddition to all other types. 503 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 085144601.1.16 PASS 2 1.7.2 NA 1.7.2 Implement remote patient monitoring programs for diagnosis and/or management of care University of Texas Health Scienc e Center at San Antonio TPI - 085144601 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 085144601.3.24 3.IT-9.4 Other outcome improvement target Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P-X]: Implement cancer telemedicine conferences to underserved communities Statistics from Texas Department of State Health Services \"Expected number of cancer cases and deaths, Texas, 2012 Year 1 Numerator: # of patients per year with newly diagnosed cancer receiving telehealth services = 0 Denominator: # of patients per year with newly diagnosed cancer = 4845 Year 2 (planning stage) Numerator: 0 Denominator: 0 Metric 1 [P-X.1] a) Telemedicine conference Milestone 3 [P-X]: Increase the number of patients participating: 3 Metric 1 [P-X.1]: Number of unique cancer-related patients presented for discussion via Webex teleconferences at the CTRC.

It exte nds to campuses in the metropolitan border communities of Laredo and the Rio Grande Valley. More than 3,000 students a year train in an environment that involves more than 100 affiliated hos pitals, clinics and health care facilities in South Texas. Intervention(s) : The project is to increase trained oncology providers to serve the cancer population in Central and South Texas. Need for the project : There is an overwhelming burden of cancer affecting our population in Texas\u2014cancer is the leading cause of death in this state, coupled with seri ous shortage of trained oncology providers\u2014Texas ranks 45th in the nation in the number of physicians per population: Therefore, we would like to educate the next generation of cancer care providers especially medical oncologists who can provide ideal cancer care from cancer prevention to survivorship care in rural and underserved areas of South Texas. Target population : Our target population is the underserve d population with or at-risk for cancer in Central and South Texas. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project seeks to increase the number of fellows in the ACGME accredited program by 25% per year over baseline Category 3 outcomes: The project seeks to increase the number of fellows serving in outreach clinics in underserved areas from 2 to 4 in DY4 and from 4 to 6 in DY5. It also seeks to serve 3 to 5 clinics in DY4 and 5 to 7 in DY 5 Project Description: The aim of the project is to train new oncologi sts to enhance delivery of cancer care in underserved areas of South Texas. The United States will likely f ace a major (36%) deficit in the number of oncologists relative to the demand for cancer care by the year 2020. This is in large part due to dramatic increases in cancer survivorship, and the projected 48% increa se in cancer incidence caused by the aging population. Thus, there is likely to be a shor tfall of between 2,550 a nd 4,080 oncologists by the year 2020. In Texas, cancer is the leading cause of death for those aged 85 and younger, and this year 110,135 Texans will be diagnosed with cance r and 39,072 will die of the disease. It is 506 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA estimated that there were 457,076 cancer surviv ors in Texas diagnosed between 1998 and 2007. The estimated cost of cancer care in Texa s for 2010 was $25.3 billion. Texas ranks second in total population, but 45th in the nation in the num ber of physicians per population. Graduate Medical Education (GME) refers to the specialized training a phys ician receives after graduating from medical school, and specialty training in Oncology is obta ined through completion of a residency program in that specialty. Texas has fewer GME slots than New York, California, or Pennsylvania. Training new oncologi sts is therefore critical to de livering ideal cancer care in South Texas in the future, especially with traini ng in cancer health disparities and practice in outreach clinics in underserved areas. The fellowship training program in hematology and medical oncology at the UT Health Science Ce nter, San Antonio, is fully accredited by the Association for Graduate Medica l Education (ACGME) and current ly has a three-year program which graduates 4 new oncologists per year. The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the individual mandate in the Affordable Ca re Act (ACA) means 32 million newly insured Americans will be entering the health care system . This makes addressing the nation's physician shortage\u2014projected to climb to more th an 90,000 by 2020\u2014more important than ever. Additional residency slots and increased funding for doctor training will ensure that Americans have access to care, not just an insurance card. Th e training of new oncologists with special skills to practice in Texas will lead to quality cancer care provided to cancer patients, including those in active treatment, those facing a terminal illness, and for cancer survivors. Our training program provides large amounts of indigent care. Funding for the existing approved training slots is thre atened by a lack of stable state-supported GME funding through the state Medicaid Program (Texas is one of only th ree states in the country that does not provide GME funding through the state Medicaid progra m). Lack of sustained funding for oncology training may force a reduction in th e number of slots for trainees at a time of desperate need to increase the training pipe line for new oncologists. Patient Benefit and 5 year expected outcome: The total number of new patients with cancer pe r year in Webb, Hidalgo, and Cameron Counties is estimated to be about 4,000. Conservative esti mates indicate that about 30% (1,200) will be either Medicaid eligible, or considered indi gent. The proposed projec t would provide outreach clinics staffed by fellows with supervision from Faculty to serve this population. The number of oncology clinics to be staffed in underserved areas, targeting this population, will grow from 2 in DY 4 to 6 in DY 5. The number of Medicaid and Indigent patients that will receive cancer treatment/services within an outreach setting as a result of institu ting this project by DY year is as follows: DY 3: 60 cancer patients ( 5% of total projected Medicaid/I ndigent patients) DY 4: 120 cancer patients (10% of total pr ojected Medicaid/ Indigent patients) DY 5: 300 cancer patients (25% of total projected Medicaid/I ndigent patients) Uninsured estimated data from South Texas Health Status Review by Ramirez et al. 507 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Region 6 Goals: This project achieves CMS's Triple aim objectives of assuring that patients receive high quality and patient centered care in the most cost effec tive way, improving the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured resi dents of the counties we serve, and further developing and maintaining a coordinated care delivery system that improves outcomes while containing costs. Quality: To achieve continuous quality improvement we shall assess the projects impact and make adjustments as necessary, share best practice a nd lessons learned, seize scaling opportunities to expand successful outcomes to broader populat ions, and rapidly disseminate successful outcomes to other prov iders across Texas. Starting Point/Baseline: Texas Medical Association (TMA) data show that physicians w ho complete both medical school and GME in the state are almost three times more likely to practice in Texas. Our own data on training oncologists from 2004-2012 in our ACGM E accredited training program at the UT Health Science Center demonstrates the followi ng: 19 of the total of 26 (73%) oncologists who graduated from our program in this period stay ed in Texas upon graduating, and of those, 17 (89%) are still practicing in Texas. Rationale: The main reason for selecting this project is : educating the next ge neration of cancer care providers especially medical oncologists who can provide id eal cancer care from cancer prevention to survivorship care in rural and und erserved areas of Sout h Texas is one of the highest priorities for the NCI-d esignated Cancer Center, the CT RC. We would like to increase the capacity to provide cancer care and oncology specialty care services and the availability of highly trained specialty providers to better acco mmodate the high demand for cancer care and oncology specialty care so that pa tients have efficient and effec tive access to such services in their own community. This project addresses the fo llowing community needs: CN.2, a high prevalence of chronic dis ease and related health disparities requiring greater prevention efforts and improved manageme nt of patients with chronic conditions. Cancer is a leading cause of death in RHP 6. CN.1, the need for improved health care quality in our community. CN.3, the need for improved access to medical care due to health care provider shortages. There are no projects funded by the US Department of Health and Human Services serving a similar purpose as the project being submitted 508 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): Related Category 3 Outcome Measure: OD-11 Addressing Health Dispari ties in Minority Populations IT-9.4 Other Outcome Improvement Target.

Relationship to other Projects: This project is related to 15 ot her projects under the plans to \"Expa nd Specialty Care Capacity.\". 11 of these are hospital systems; 5 based in Be xar County; 3 based in Rural Communities; and. 4 others, like our project are at UTHSCSA. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Projects at Bexar County Hospital Systems incl ude: University Health System, Baptist, Childrens, Methodist, and Southwest General. Rural Providers include Dimmit County, Val Verde, and Connally. In addition, there are 4 others on campus at UTHSCSA. We would be able to immediately implement a learning collabo rative to support this project and share best practices with many of the above providers especi ally if they are closely related to expanding specialty care capacity as it re lates to training new providers. 509 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Plan for Learning Collaborative: Our project focuses on training oncology providers to provide and expand cancer-care in at-risk communities in rural areas and other communities.. We would establish a learning collaborative meeting that is regularly scheduled, perhaps also conducted via telec onference, and identify shared goals , especially if proj ects are related to training programs to enhance the workforce, even though the focus of the other projects will be a different category of illness, or target group: identifying stakeholders for areas served; tele medicine/telehealth program content; Information technology costs and implementation; and id eal outcome measure evaluation systems. Project Valuation: Cancer is a huge burden in Texas an d it is important to point out th at Cancer is the leading cause of death among Hispanics in the US\u2014the largest and fastest grow ing minority group in the US. With 20% of all Hispanics in the US residing in Texas, we will need to prepare for 1 in 2 Hispanic men, and 1 in 3 Hispanic women being diagnosed with cancer, and the lifetime probability of dying from cancer is 1 in 5 for Hispanic men and 1 in 6 for Hispanic women (American Cancer Society, Can cer Facts and Figures for Hisp anics and Latinos 2012-2014), we will need to enhance the number and quality of trained oncologists to serve this population. In addition, there are projected to be nearly 12 million cancer survivors by 2020, >60% of whom are age >65\u2014it is critical, therefore, to prepar e a workforce to deal with this magnitude of elderly cancer survivors who will need care, surv eillance, and efforts to promote healthy aging (Parry C et al., Cancer Epidem iol Biomarkers Prev 2011;20:1996-2005). There will be a 48% increase in new cases of cancer, and an 81% increase in people living with or surviving cancer between 2000 and 2020. Visits to oncologists are expected to increase by 48% by 2020, the projected supply of oncologists will leave a shortfal l of 9.4 to 15.1 million visits. This project aims to corr ect the shortfall by increasing th e workforce of cancer doctors in South Texas. 510 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 085144601.1.17 PASS 2 1.9.3 N/A 1.9.3 Implement other eviden ce based project to expand specialty care capacity in an innovative manner - Oncology University of Texas Health Scienc e Center at San Antonio TPI - 085144601 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 085144601.3.25 3.IT-9.4 IT-9.4 Other Outcome Improvement Target.

It extends to campuses in the metropolitan border communities of Laredo and the Rio Grande Valley. More than 3,000 students a year train in an environment that i nvolves more than 100 affiliated hospitals, clinics and health care facilities in South Texas. Intervention(s) : This project will establish three pedi atric specialty care clinics throughout greater San Antonio to improve access to pediatri c specialists for children and families. The proposed new clinics are expected to be located in central San Antonio, south or southeast San Antonio, and north central San Antonio. Need for the project : A recent study documented the current s hortage of pediatric subspecialists in Bexar County, and projected an expanding need for additional pediatric subspecialists through the end of this decade. Additionally, the great majo rity of subspecialty pr oviders are based in the South Texas Medical Center (northwest), creatin g an additional access barrier to patients and families. In particular, this access barrier is most acute for patients who are indigent. Target population : The target population is children in greater San Antonio requiring outpatient pediatric cardiology, pediatric de rmatology, pediatric endocrinol ogy, pediatric gastroenterology, pediatric neurology, and pediatric pulmonology evalua tion. Over 50% of children in RHP6 have Medicaid or are indigent and we anticipate this project will have Medicaid repr esentation of 60% or more of total estimated patient visit volume. We expect all children, including those with Medicaid, to benefit from clinical expansion an d improved access. The proposed clinic sites are located throughout greater San Antonio to minimi ze the effects of travel and access. In particular, the specialty clinic sites in downtown San Antonio and southeast San Antonio have been chosen specifically because central San An tonio, west San Antonio, and south San Antonio have a preponderance of Medicaid-eligible and indigent children. These locations will greatly enhance the access to care for these vulnerable populations. UT-Medicine challenges related to this project UT-Medicine, one of the major employers of pe diatric specialists and subspecialists in San Antonio does not have adequate lo ng-term outpatient capacity for specialty care pediatrics. With the construction of the new academic children's hospital, planned for the South Texas Medical Center, the space available for specialty pediat rics will be expanded, but not until 2016. UT- Medicine is committed to the belief that much of pediatric specialty care can be delivered in community sites more convenient to patients and fa milies than the Medical Center. This project will allow creation of satellite s ites that are more convenient to the majority of the communities in greater San Antonio. 513 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : This project seeks to provide 11,000 pediatric specialty care visits in DY3, 19,000 specialty care visits in DY4, and 24,000 specialty care visits in DY5. Additionally, this project seeks to improve access by establishing an electronic referral program. Category 3 outcomes: This project will monitor patient satisfaction throughout the process of clinic establishment and will aim to continua lly improve patient satis faction scores through education of staff and providers, improvement ef forts, and a learning collaborative design to spread successes in patient satisfaction. Project Description: UT-Medicine has the opportunity to improve acce ss to Pediatric Specialists through the addition of a group of multi-specialty, multi-site pediatric subs pecialty clinics. This will be a part of a network of pediatric care, part nering with a new academic chil dren's hospital delivering a comprehensive network of services. This initia tive supports enhanced delivery of subspecialty pediatric services. It is expected that the ne w academic children's hospital will be located in or adjacent to the South Texas Medical Center, in no rthwest San Antonio. By establishing alternate ambulatory specialty pediatri c clinic access points throughout San Antonio, we propose to provide improved access through geographically convenient sites, and improved access by increasing the total number of available providers and total number of appointment slots available. Delivery of pediatric specia lty care will be enhanced through these improvements: 1. Establishment of a network of pediatric special ty care clinics staffed by specialists in pediatric cardiology, pediatric neur ology, pediatric gastroen and pediatric endocronology. Even tually, there will be a central hub clinic adjacent to the academic children's hospital, and there will be three sate llite clinics in Bexar county. 2. The satellite clinics will be supported a nd managed through the use of a multifunctional Electronic Medical Record that w ill allow electronic referrals to the clinics and will allow timely, reliable, and durable communicatio n to referring physicians and pr actitioners. A dditionally, the use of a common EMR for all site s and all providers will elim inate common process variation, enhancing delivery of service. 3. Additional subspecialty providers will be recr uited to support this service expansion. Quality: To achieve continuous quality improvement we will assess the project's impact and make adjustments as necessary, share best practice a nd lessons learned, seize scaling opportunities to expand successful outcomes to broader populat ions, and rapidly disseminate successful outcomes to other prov iders across Texas. RHP 6 goals: This project achieves CMS's Triple aim objectives of assuring patients receive high quality and patient centered care, in the most cost effectiv e way, improves the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsur ed residents of the counties we serve, further develops and maintains a coordinated care de livery system and improves outcomes while containing costs. 514 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Starting Point/Baseline: A recent study, commissioned by the Methodist Hea lthcare Ministries, established that Bexar County currently lacks at least 20 pediatric subsp ecialists compared to the number of providers usually expected to provide reasonable access to ca re for children with specialty care needs. Additionally, the complement of pe diatric specialists is aging with 2/3 of the current complement between the ages of 45 and 65 years. By the e nd of the decade, the number of children in Bexar County is projected to increas e by at least 100,000. With this projected growth, and the expectation that providers will leav e through retirement or relocation, it is expected that there is a need for an additional 75 to 95 pediatric subspe cialists to join the medical community in San Antonio by the end of the decade to meet the needs of our children. Currently, the greatest concentr ation of specialty care provider clinics in RHP6 bases in the South Texas Medical Center. This requires families with specialty care conc erns to travel to the providers, creating access barriers. There are insuffi cient numbers of pediatric subspecialists in the community to address subspecialty care needs of infants, children and young adults. Currently, in UT-Medicine, only the cardiology division provides subspecialty access outside downtown and the medical center, by providing re gular outpatient clinics in north central San Antonio, New Braunfels, Seguin, and Jourdanton. This project will be marked by multiple star ting points, relevant to the three project interventions: Venues for pediatric specialty care will be established in downtown San Antonio, north central San Antonio, and southeast San Antonio. These sites will be established sequentially as additional providers are successfully recr uited. UT-Medicine currently uses Epic as their EM R, but it has not yet been deployed throughout the practice. Epic training will occur for all prov iders and support staff that will be a part of the specialty care expansion. Epic will be deploy ed for use in each specialty care clinic as they are opened. UTHSCSA approval for additional faculty in pediatric cardiology, pediatric pulmonology, pediatric gastroenterology, pediatric neurology, pediatric endocrinology, and hematology will be secured. Recruitment will proceed for these new providers to allow adequate staffing of all subspecialty clinic sites. Patient Benefit: The number of pediatric visits to be generated by expansion of sub-specialty pediatric services as described within this project are as follows by DY Year : DY 3 11,000 DY 4 19,000 DY 5 24,000 Of the visits listed above UTHSCSA estimates at least 60% of those visits will be delivered to Medicaid and Indi gent patients. 515 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Rationale: As related above, Bexar County and RHP 6 have a significant current shortage of pediatric specialty care providers and this shortage is predicted to become a critical shortage by the end of the decade. Partly related to this shortage of providers, there are few locations where children can access pediatric specialty car e. The current systems of access and communication are limited by old models of communication which can be enhanced with adoption of novel electronic methods. These improvements will help to: 1.9.2: Improve access to specialty care. This propos al will increase the total number of pediatric specialty providers in the community and will expa nd the number of locations in the greater San Antonio area that families can access pediatri c specialty care. Esta blishing a network of specialty clinics throughout the metropolitan area increas es the number of available appointments and creates more convenient locat ions for care. Implementing EpicCare and enrolling practitioners in EpicCare will es tablish and enhance processes for effective coordination and integration of care for our patients within our practice and with other partners. Proposed Milestones: Milestone 1 (P-1: Conduct spec ialty care gap analysis base d on community need): Milestone 2 (P-3: Develop baseline data for wait times, back log, and or return appointments). Milestone 3 (P-11: Launch/expand a specialty care clinic: Goal: Add Pediatric Specialty Clinic Site in Southeast San Antonio) Milestone 4 (P-8: Develop the technical capabil ities to facilitate el ectronic referral.) Milestone 5 (I-33]: Increased numbe r of specialty care visits: Goal: A total of 11,000 patients will be seen in the specialty clinics) Milestone 6 (I-24: Implement specialty care access programs, e.g., referral technologies, Goal: 20% of the referring providers will be enrolled in EpicCare.)

Milestone 11 (P-11: Launch/expand a specialty care clinic: Goal: Add Pediatric Specialty Clinic Site in Southeast San Antonio) Milestone 12 (P-8: Develop the t echnical capabilities to facilitate electronic referral. Goal: EpicCare will be implemented in th e new Pediatric Specialty Clinic.) Milestone 13 (I-33: Increased number of specialty care visits. Goal: A total of 24,000 patients will be seen in the specialty clinics) Core project components: a) Increase service availability with extended hours. In the initial phases of this project, we anticipate that the specialty clinics will operate during standard hours (8AM to 5PM. ) However, if there is an identified 516 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA need for further expansion of activitie s, this will be considered through our quality improvement process. In particular , after establishment of all three clinic sites, this will be evaluated as a poten tial opportunity for further expansion in DY- 5. b) Increase number of specialty clinic locations. Three new unique pediatric specialty clinic locations will be established in this project. The three clinic s are distributed throughout greater San Antonio, with geographic sensitivity, and avoiding the S outh Texas Medical Ce nter. By design, the downtown pediatric specialty clinic and the southeast specialty clinic are placed in areas of greater community n eed due to a preponderance of Medicaid- eligible and indigent patients and families c) Implement transparent, standardi zed referrals thr oughout the system We plan to use deploy an electronic referral system based in EpicCare. This will increase the ways that referrals can be processed, augmenting entry into the system, and allowing direct feedback to providers in a timely fashion. d) Conduct quality improvement for project using methods such as rapid cycle improvement. Activities may in clude, but are not limited to, identifying project impacts, identifying \"lessons learned,\" oppor tunities to scale all or part of the project to a broader patient population, and identifying key challe nges associated with expansion of the project, including special considerat ions for safety net populations. Information about service delivery will be collected through the use of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality tool \"CAHPS Clinician & Groups Surveys - Visit Survey 2.0 (Child)\". This information will allow us to determine if we are delivering care in such a way th at it is valuable and meaningful to the patients and families. All shortcomings that are identifies with this tool will become targets for improvement. Formal quality improvement tools will be used to determine best steps for improvement. Differences in meeting the needs of indigent and Medicaid-eligible populations will be surveyed, and if the needs are found to be different in different locati ons, unique delivery interventions will be tested. The results of rapi d cycle improvement tactics will be determined through ongoing use of the CAHPS tool. Successf ul interventions will be shared throughout the pediatric specialty clinic operations. Additional opportunities for further dissemination will be sought th rough presentations and publications. CN.3 This project addresses the RHP 6 n eed of expanding access to medical care. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-6: Patient Satisfaction. IT 6.1 Patient satisfac tion will be measured th roughout the process of subspecialty clinic expansion and operation. Base line data will be collected from a sample of patients in each specialty area in DY2. The su rvey tool used will be designed on the survey framework provided in the Agency for Healthcar e Research and Quality tool \"CAHPS Clinician & Groups Surveys - Visit Survey 2.0 (Child).\" Key survey elements will include: A) Patient/parent impression of ease of access to specialist and timeliness of appointment B) Patient/parent impression of the qua lity of physician communication. C) Patient/parent impression of involve ment in shared decision making. 517 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA The information collected through the survey pr ocess will be reviewed continually throughout the process (DY2 through DY5.) Quarterly feedb ack will be given to providers (physicians and nurse practitioners) in the specialty care clinics and to the clinic leadership. Individual specialty clinic sites will be empowered to adopt change s to improve patient satisfaction. Successful improvements will be shared formally throughout the Specialty Care network semi-annually through a Learning Collaborative model. This activity will accomplish the following Process Milestones: P-1: Project planning. Informati on collected at baseline in DY2 and DY3 will be used to identify specific targets for improvement in the proces ses of new patient re ferral, appointments, communication, and decision making. This will allow planning for general improvements in access, and allow design of educational efforts to assure that patient satisfaction improves throughout the process. The new specialty clinics will not begin to be established until the end of DY2. Initial patient satisfaction data will be collected from existing UT-Medicine clinics in pediatric cardiology, pediatric he matology, pediatric endocrinol ogy, pediatric gastroenterology, pediatric neurology, and pediatric pulmonology prior to opening new specialty clinics. P-2: Establish baseline rates: This activity will establish specific baseline rates for patient satisfaction and will be used to identify practitione rs and services with high baseline outcomes to guide improvements throughout the Pe diatric Specialty Care Network. P-3: Develop and test data systems. The init ial survey tool will be modeled closely upon the CAHPS Clinician & Groups Survey - Visit Survey 2.0. The survey tool will be continually re- evaluated by leadership of the Pediatric Specia lty Care Network. Additional elements will be added as necessary to assure th at improvements are progressive. P-4: Conduct PDSA cycles: Improvement targets that are identified thro ugh the Visit Survey will be formally addressed through improvement efforts, and tracking of the effects of the improvement will be followed through ongoing use of the Visit Survey. Improvement efforts and education will occur through a Learning Colla borative internal to the Pediatric Specialty Care providers (physicians and NPs) and the sta ff supporting the clinics. These efforts will take place in DY3-DY5. P-5: Disseminate findings: Patient Satisfaction re sults will be distributed quarterly to providers and leadership. Specific guidan ce around findings will be given and individual specialty clinic sites will be empowered to adopt change s to improve patient satisfaction. Relationship to other Projects: Related to project 085144601.2.1. Reduce and prevent lead poisoning and asthma in children and adolescents by targeting environmental aspects of children's health (TEACH ) Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: TBD Plan for Learning Collaborative: TBD. We anticipate that the in formation obtained through the use of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality tool \"CAHPS Clinician & Groups Surveys - Visit Survey 2.0 (Child)\" will yield improvement opportunities. We will use these to create improvement oriented learning opportunities that will share best practices and improvement strategies throughout the specialty network. 518 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Project Valuation: The overall target goal is to establish a networ k of pediatric specialty care clinic s throughout greater San Antonio which will enhance the ability for all children in San Antonio and the surrounding region to have timely and convenient access to pediatric specialty care. This project will establish three unique, new sites for pediatri c specialty care throughout greater San Antonio which will benefit the community by reaching out to various groups. With successful deployment of these clinics, we plan to cr eate 54,000 new opportunities for children to see pediatric specialists through th e end of DSRIP year 5. By reaching out through establishing community clinics, this will decrease the disrupt ion to parents who work, and children who are in school, thus bringing additional benefit, beyond the direct health care benefits, and thereby also decreasing some of the hidden cost s for parents. Overall health of the children of the region will be enhanced through effective delivery of care and effective communication with referring practitioners through the use of modern EMR application. These improvements will enhance access for all children to the new children's hos pital and will support the addition of needed pediatric specialt y care providers. 519 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 085144601.1.18 PASS 2 1.9.2 1.9.2 A-D 1.9.2 Improve Access to Specialty Care (Pediatric Specialty Care Network) University of Texas Health Scienc e Center at San Antonio TPI - 085144601 Related Category 3 outcomes: 085144601.3.27 3.IT-6.1 Improvement in Patient Satisfaction Scores Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P-1]: Conduct specialty care gap assessment based on community need Metric [P-1.1]: Document of gap assessment Data source: Needs assessment Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $1,135,443 Milestone 2 [P-3]: Collect baseline data for wait times, back log, and or return appointments.

It exte nds to campuses in the metropolitan border communities of Laredo and the Rio Grande Valley. More than 3,000 students a year train in an environment that involves more than 100 affiliated hospitals, clinics and hea lth care facilities in South Texas. Located in Bexar County, we se rve a large, Spanish-speaking, Medicaid population: 20% of our patient population is covered under Medicaid, almost an equal percentage to our Comme rcial payor population. Intervention(s) : The project will implement the CG -CAHPS patient experience survey among patients on behalf of all UT Medi cine providers. All patients ha ve an equal chance of being chosen to provide feedback via a 6-page survey , mailed to them in their preferred language. Need for the project : Implementation of CG CAHPS is in lin e one of the Strategic Directions put forth by Bexar County's Community Health Assessm ent (a document which laid out the biggest needs for Bexar County): more direct community involvement in healthcare. We currently have no way to measure patient satisfaction and expe rience, and as such, have been implementing quality improvement efforts without the inpu t of the community. The CG-CAHPS survey will provide patients a direct way to become involved in their care , resulting in a more engaged, adherent patient population. Target population : The target population is all of the patients seen at ou r UT Medicine clinics. 50 patients per provider will be sel ected randomly via a computer. 20% of our patient population is covered under Medicaid, and this interventi on gives this often underrepresented patient population the opportunity for direct feedback. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : With the feedback that we received from over 8,000 patients, we will be able to identify operational in efficiencies in each of our clinics. Refinement of these operational processes will result in increased capacity a nd greater access for our patients across demonstration years (DY). Category 3 outcomes: Research has shown that patient care experiences positively correlate to clinical quality processe s and outcomes on both the pr actice and provider levels . We aim to increase patient experience scores in two domains specifically: to increase patient satisfaction scores for all providers on at least one m easure from CG-CAHPS by 2.5% in year 4, and to increase patient satisfaction scor es on shared decision making for all providers by 3% in year 5. 523 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Project Description: Providers at the MARC and CTRC currently have no way to m easure patient experience, a measure that is becoming an explicit com ponent of compensation and certification. Implementation of CG CAHPS is in line with two of the Strategic Directions put forth by Bexar County's Community Health Assessment, a documen t which laid out the biggest needs for Bexar County. Patient care experience is broadly recognized as a core el ement of healthcare quality and also correlates to key financial indicators. The CG-CAHPS survey measures a broad range of core areas including access to ca re, provider communication, courtesy of clinic staff, how the patient would rate the provider, and whether or not they would recommend the clinic to family and friends. This invaluable information is presen ted in clear reports via the Catalyst program of NRC Picker, making the development and implementation of systems change easy, intuitive, and best of all, measurable. The questions will be consistent across service lines so we will be able to see actionable system problems that have broad quality and efficiency implications. In implementing the evidence- based Clinician and Group C onsumer Assessment of Health Providers and Systems (CG- CAHPS) at UT Medicine, we aim to measure and improve patient e xperience of care. The significance of this goal will be realized through increased patient loyalty, a more engaged and adherent patient population, and increased clinical quality. Starting Point/Baseline: The proposed project will include 50 randomly select ed patients per UT Medicine providers, or 8750 patients total. By making available patient experience data availa ble by provider, each provider will be more empowered to improve pa tient experience by targe ting interventions and support in the areas that are need ed most. We do not currently ha ve a baseline for our providers in terms of patient care experien ce. This is part of the problem. With the implementation of CG- CAHPS, we will be able to not only get a baselin e for our providers, but compare that baseline nationally with other institutions. Core Project Components: (a) Provide training and education to clinic al and administrative staff on process improvement strategies, methodologies and culture. (b) Develop an employee suggestion system that allo ws for the identificati on of issues that impact the work environment, patient care a nd satisfaction, efficien cy, and other issues aligned with continuous process (c) Implement CG-CAHPS survey to evalua te and improve patient satisfaction Quality: To achieve continuous quality improvement we shall assess the project's impact and make adjustments as necessary, share best practice a nd lessons learned, seize scaling opportunities to expand successful outcomes to broader populat ions, and rapidly disseminate successful outcomes to other prov iders across Texas. Region 6 goals: This project achieves CMS's Triple aim objectives of assuring patients receive high quality and patient centered care, in the most cost effectiv e way, improves the health care infrastructure to 524 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA better serve the Medicaid and uninsur ed residents of the counties we serve, further develops and maintains a coordinated care de livery system and improves outcomes while containing costs. Rationale: Implementing the CG-CAHPS a nd CG-CAHPS/PCMH surveys fills two of the gaps recently identified by the most recent Bexar Coun ty Community Health Leadership Community Health Assessment: an increased focus on systems change and increased engagement with the community in improvement initiatives. Implemen ting the CG-CAHPS is a direct way to engage community members in providing feedback regard ing the quality of their care experience. And unlike traditional patient satisfaction tools, CG -CAHPS asks behavior-based, patient experience questions to uncover whether and to what frequency patient-cente red behaviors occurred during the patient's visit. By providi ng this focused feedback, patien ts bring to light where care providers are consistently meeting or exceeding their expectations, and where they are not. In order to deliver higher quality care to Bexar County residents and beyond, we must have their direct feedback. Additionally, The CG-CAHPS survey measures a broad range of core areas including access to care, provider communication, courtesy of clinic staff, how the patient would rate the provider, and whether or not they would recommend the clinic to family and friends. This invaluable information is presented in clea r reports via the Catalyst program of NRC Picker, making the development and implementation of systems change easy, intuitive, and best of all, measurable. The questions will be consistent ac ross service lines so we will be able to see actionable system problems that have broad qual ity and efficiency implications. This project presents a new initiative for UTHSCSA as it has ne ver been done in the past. I am not aware of any similar projects currently being funded by DHHS at UTHSCSA. CN.1 Addresses community need for greater emphasis on quality. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): We selected the Category 3 st and alone outcome domain of Patient Satisfaction. Research has shown that patient care experiences positivel y correlate to clinical quality processes and outcomes on both the practice and provider levels39. Additionally, patients with better care experiences are more engaged and adherent, and have better health outcomes. For example, a recent study in the Journal of Family Practice demonstrated that adhe rence rates were 2.6 times higher among primary care patients whose provide rs had \"whole person knowledge\" of them compared to patients of providers without that knowledge40. This translates to better, more cost effective healthcare and healthier patients. There are also other financial implications to consider, in the form of incentives, lower malpractice risk, and increased patient loyalty. Increasingly, patient experi ence is being tied to financial incentives, as is the case in Massachusetts and California41. And with the passage of the new healthcare law, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) will be making 39 Sequist et al.

Last accessed July 12, 2012 525 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA mandatory the implementation and reporting of patient experience survey results, and tying these measures to financial incentives42. We will most likely be monetarily penalized for not collecting and reporting on this data. The implementation of CG-CAHPS now puts us in the position to have better scores once we are mandated to report them publicly. Tracking patient experience data is cost efficient in other ways. The Journal of the American Medical Association43 has published several articles demonstr ating that good patient experience correlates with lower medical malpractice risk44. In fact, a 2009 study found that with each drop in patient-reported score along a five-step scal e from \"very good\" to \"very poor\", the likelihood of being named in a malpractice suit increased by 21.7%45. Measuring patient experience using the CG-CAHPS and with the assist ance of NRC Picker Service aler ts is a hands-on approach for identifying and addressing issues in care that could lead to lawsuits. Lastly, it is well known that patients keep or change providers based upon experience. Relationship quality is a key predictor of patient loyalty46, and in Bexar County where patients have many choices for their healthcare n eeds, they can vote with their feet. Relationship to other Projects: This project directly supports those seeking to enhance/expand medical homes. When a medical home uses the CG-CAHPS survey, special recognition is given to that site. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Providers at Methodist, University Health System, CHOSA, and CS R are proposing similar projects to improve patient satisfacti on and the patient care experience. Plan for Learning Collaborative: Implementing CG-CAHPS is a huge endeavor. Bei ng able to share challenges and solutions, brainstorm ideas, and work togeth er with other providers going th rough the same process will be invaluable. Our collaborative will establish goals, develop a calendar of regular meetings, and develop a plan to communi cate ideas/data/successes. Project Valuation: Achieves Waiver Goals: This project assures that patients-- regardless of their income level or insurance status -will be fu ll partners in their healthcar e by providing feedback on their experiences. Previous research in this ar ea shows that measuring and improving patient experience results in a more engaged and adhe rent patient populati on with better health outcomes.

Priority i ssues addressed by this project are health care quality and satisfaction. Indigent populations are notoriously underrepres ented in studies of healthcare quality and satisfaction. However, our mail-based survey gives each patient an equal chance of being chosen to provide feedback. NRC Picker continues to follow up with the patient until a response is provided, or until the patient declines to provide feedback. This ensures this underrepresented patient population will be included in our feedback. Project Scope: The proposed project will include 50 ra ndomly selected patients for all 175 UT Medicine providers (8750 patients total, per year). By making av ailable patient experience data available by provider each provider will be more empowered to improve patient experience by targeting interventions and support in th e areas that are needed most. Project Investment: The expected investment in this program for Human Resources will include the cost of a staff member to oversee th e project onsite in conjun ction with NRC Picker, the company who will be administering the surv eys. Survey implementation will already be underway by year 2, allowing us to begin to deve lop and implement improvement plans in year 3. 527 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 085144601.1.20 PASS 2 1.10.1 1.10.1 (A, B) 1.10.1 ENHANCE IMPROVEMENT CAPACITY WITHIN PEOPLE [REDESIGN TO IMPROVE PATIENT EXPERIENCE ] University of Texas Health Scienc e Center at San Antonio TPI - 085144601 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 085144601.3.29 3.IT-6.1 Percent improvement over base line of patient satisfaction scores Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P-5]: Enhance the organizational infrastructure and resources to store, analyze, and share patient experience data as well as utilize them for quality improvement Metric [P-5.1]: Number of new patient experience measures being collected) Goal: Increased number of new patient experience measures being collected from 1 to 5 Data Source (p-5.1b): Documentation of methodology for patient experience data collection and reporting Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $454,177 Milestone 2 [I-7]: Implement quality improvement data systems, collection, and reporting capabilities Metric [1-7.1] : Number of reports generated through these quality improvement data systems.

It extends to campuses in the metropolitan border communities of Laredo and the Rio Grande Valley. More than 3,000 students a year train in an environment that i nvolves more than 100 affiliated hospitals, clinics and health care facilities in South Texas. Intervention(s) : The goal of this proposal is to deliv er epilepsy care to the underserved area of Uvalde by providing an outre ach clinic for patients with epil epsy. Epilepsy specialist physicians and support staff comprised of a cas e manager, social worker, and me dical assistant will travel to Uvalde once every other month at the beginning of the project a nd increase the frequency of the services as needed in re sponse to increasing need. Need for the project : Epilepsy is a chronic medical condition that is best treated in an outpatient clinic setting by neurologists with specialized tr aining in epilepsy. When people with epilepsy do not have access to specialty care, they generally seek care in the Emergency Department (ED). Care in the ED is not sufficient for long-term effective management of seizures. Repeated use of the ED for seizure results in poor medicati on compliance and poor seizure management. By providing access to neurologists, patients with epilepsy will ha ve improved seizure management which will reduce the need to visit the ED. Target population : Patients with epilepsy and/or seizures. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : This project seeks to provide 60 visits in the ou treach clinic in DY2 and increase the number of visits by 30 pct above baseline (76 visits) in DY3, 60 pct above baseline in DY4 (92 visits), and 80 pct above baseline in DY5 (108 visits). Category 3 outcomes: IT-9.2 ED appropriate utilization The goal of this project is to reduce ED visit ra te for seizures by 50 perc ent over current rates by DY5 for patients followed in this clinic. The five-year expected outcome for this project is to provide approximately 285 patient visits and reduce the ED visit rate for seizures for pa tients receiving care in the outreach clinic by 50 530 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA percent over the initial ED visit rate. Project Description: Brief Description: The goal of this proposal is to devel op a mechanism to deliver epilepsy care to underserved areas in South and West Texas. The main focus of the outreach program will be to provide expanded outpatient ca re to people with epilepsy, bot h insured and indigent, who are predominantly Latinos. We are already providing this service to patients in Harlingen, Texas in collaboration with the Epilepsy Foundation Central & South Texas (EFCST) (See baseline data below). We are proposing to expand this care to additional areas with the greatest needs including Uvalde . Our epilepsy specialists and EFCST sta ff will travel to these remote clinics one day every two months at the beginning of the project, and incr ease the frequency of services as the project proceeds and in response to incr easing need. The services would continue to be provided jointly with the EFCST. EFCST would al so provide subsidies for medical therapies, access to medication assistance programs from Pharma, social services for employment, behavioral health services, disability app lications, epilepsy education, and access to support groups. EFCST serves over 23,000 individuals in 79 Texas counties annually. The funding requested will support a nurse cas e manager, physician services, and travel, and food for the nurse case manager and physicians tr aveling to these underserved areas. Goal: The specific objective is to develop outpatient epilepsy services for the underserved populations of Uvalde as an exte nsion of what is alre ady being done in Harlingen (see baseline data below). In addition, the outreach clinics wi ll provide community access to the services offered by the South Texas Comprehensive Epileps y Center in San Antonio and the educational and social service resources of the EFCST. Scope of the Problem: There are 6.4 million uninsured people in Texas, with 172,800 diagnosed with epilepsy. The uninsured generally seek care through emergency room or primary care settings which are not adequate ly prepared to diagnose and tr eat epilepsy. There are direct (medical costs) and indirect (w ork-related) costs when patients don't receive the specialty care they need. Given the lack of access in these ar eas to epilepsy specialty care even for those individuals who have some type of insurance, the opportunity to improve care for epilepsy patients in these areas is even greater. Inform ation attached below provides details about the demographics of epilepsy service ne eds of the proposed service area. Challenges/Issues: Delivery of any type of specialty care to an underinsured, immigrant population is a large challenge. Health care services and infrastructure are rudimentary in most of our targeted locations. For this proposal to succeed, outreach to local physicians, hospitals, schools, and social service providers, among others , will be crucial. Ou r project will provide access to patients, but we must first raise commun ity awareness of the service so patients will be able to be able to benefit from it. Another chal lenge is the poverty in our targeted service areas. Many patients cannot afford necessary tests and me dications to appropriate ly treat their epilepsy. By partnering with the EFCST, who has resources to help underwrite tests and help patients get medications, we will dramatically improve outcomes by helping patients get access to the diagnostic services and treatments they need. Even with access to medications, medication compliance is a big issue, as well. A recent study found that 26% of patients with insurance were non-compliant with their epilepsy medications, le ading to an increase in hospitalizations and emergency room visits. For the uninsured, the probl em is even worse. Our plan to provide robust educational services - in English and Spanish - will help patients understand what to expect from their medications and why it is important to take them as directed. We anticipate that this will improve compliance, and decrease seizure frequency and trips to the ED. As described 531 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA above, 75% of medically refractory seizure patients may be helped by epilepsy surgery or other non-medical therapies. Currently, most epilepsy pa tients in these regions have no access to this type of treatment. By partnering with the South Texas Comprehensive Epilepsy Center at University Hospital in San Antonio, with financ ial help from the EFCST, these potentially life- changing treatments will now be an option for patients. As described in the Baseline Data section, approximately 37% of patients seen in our Harlingen location have some type of medical insurance (predominantly Medicaid and Medicare, with a smaller number with other insurance). Given the lack of neurology, let al one epilepsy, specialty care, we anticipate that the insured and uninsured patients served will con tinue to be seen by our group in the future rather than make the long tr ip into San Antonio for care. In addition, we anticipate that approximately 20 % of patients per year seen in each clinic location will be candidates for an epilepsy surgery evaluation at University Hospital, which will bring in additional revenue that will help supp ort the physician costs of the program. Quality: To achieve continuous quality improvement we shall assess the projects impact and make adjustments as necessary, share best practice a nd lessons learned, seize scaling opportunities to expand successful outcomes to broader populat ions, and rapidly disseminate successful outcomes to other prov iders across Texas. Region 6 goals: This project achieves CMS's Triple aim objectives of assuring patients receive high quality and patient centered care, in the most cost effectiv e way, improves the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsur ed residents of the counties we serve, further develops and maintains a coordinated care de livery system and improves outcomes while containing costs. Starting Point/Baseline: Outreach epilepsy services are currently provided to patients in Harlingen in collaboration with the Epilepsy Foundation Central & South Texas. Th e clinic, in operation for 10 years, occurs 2 days every other month and provided 689 visits to 349 patients in FY11. To date, there have been a total of 92 patients from this out-reach clinic who have ha d epilepsy surgery at the South Texas Comprehensive Epilepsy Center at University Hospital. Rationale: Given that people living in this ar ea do not have access to specialty care even if they have some type of health insurance, the oppor tunity to improve care of the pa tients with epilepsy is great. Many of these people use the emergency department frequently because of this lack of access. The total population for the Uvalde Clinic ca tchment area is 67,416. Of this population, there are approximately 1,348 individuals with epilepsy wi th an estimated 30 percent (404) who are indigent. We expect to reduce emergency room visits th rough implementation of this project. Epilepsy surgery and other non-medical treatments may benef it as much as 75 percent of patients with 532 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA medically refractory epilepsy (patients who are no t helped by appropriate antiepileptic therapy). Patients with frequent seizures are unable to dr ive, have difficult holding jobs, and are risk for seizure-related sudden death. We are unaware of any projects underway at UT HSCSA funded by the US Department of Health and Human Services serving a similar purpose as the project being submitted. CN.3 This project addresses the community need for greater access to medical care. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): IT-9.2 ED appropr iate utilization The above outcome measure was selected to: measure reduction in visits to the emergenc y department resulting from improved seizure medication compliance/seizure management Relationship to other Projects: UTHSCSA submitted a proposal to expand neuropsychological services. Patients served by this proposal benefit from neuropsychol ogical testing as eff ective characterization of neurocognitive changes aid in patient management, diagnostic clarification, prediction of disease progression, assessment of functional status, and deve lopment of treatment recommendations. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: This project is related to the following request: UTHSCSA 1.9.2 Neurops ychology Services. Plan for Learning Collaborative: The South Texas Comprehensive Epilepsy Center based at University Health System in San Antonio consists of a multidisciplinary group of physicians and staff. This group meets weekly to review cases, exchange ideas, and discuss be st practices/approaches to patient management. Services provided under this proposal will be included in these weekly discussions. Project Valuation: 533 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA People with epilepsy who do not have access to specialty care genera lly seek care in an emergency room, at an average cost of $3,000 per visit. Difficulty in accessing needed medications will lead to noncompliance at a co st of about $5,000 per person. For those uninsured and without some type of assistance, epileps y medications can't be accessed through Pharma assistance programs ($1,338,525 in such assistan ce was facilitated by the EFCST in FY 2010 alone) and lost productivity in terms of work -related earnings for people with uncontrolled epilepsy amount to $8,953 per year per household. With seizure control due to appropriate treatment, approximately 60% of could return to work. The cost savings realized by this proposal detailed below is conservative, as it primarily accounts for benefits to those who are uninsured. As mentioned above, approximately 37% have some type of insurance and will be benefitted as well. The table below provides the data used to estimate the conservative value of this proposal in terms of cost savings.

Child Crisis Respite through Therapeutic Foster Care Unique RHP ID#: 1268443-05.1.1 - PASS 1 Performing Provider: Bluebonnet Trails Community Mental Health and Mental Retardation Center dba/Bluebonnet Trai ls Community Services Performing Provider TPI: 126844305 Project Summary: Provider Description : Bluebonnet Trails Community Services (BTCS) is the state designated Local Mental Health Authority (LMHA) for Gu adalupe County in Region 6 as well as for seven other Counties located east of and parallel to IH 35 and extending north of Austin, Texas in Travis County. In that capacity we are respons ible for an array of public services as well as for behavioral health planni ng and coordination throughout our local service area. As the LMHA, we contract with the Depa rtment of State Health Services (DSHS) to provide specialty behavioral health services to children and adolescents with Severe Emotional Disturbance (SED) that DSHS identifies as the \"priority population.\" BTCS is the only publicly funded behavioral health provider in the County of 131,533 in population. Intervention(s) : This project will implement Treatment Foster Care (TFC) sites in Guadalupe County to provide crisis respite services to youth in psychiatri c crisis. Youth will be assessed and if eligible placed in foster homes for an average of 45 days but long enough to resolve the crisis and initiate therapeutic services for youth and family. Admission to TFC will be accessible 24 hours a day. Need for the project : We will address the RHP 6 Community Needs Assessment CN. 4 \"There is a shortage of high quality mental and behavior al health services that are integrated with physical health care services.\" There are no f acilities for uninsured or underinsured youth in Guadalupe County and all crises must be take n to facilities in Bexar County. The target population for this service is poor, uninsured or underinsured youth and families. These families cannot afford to travel to San Antonio to participate in treatment and discharge planning. Target population : The Target population is high risk yout h diagnosed with Severe Emotional Disturbance the majority of them involved in Juvenile Justice who are in behavioral health crisis and who re poor, uninsured and/or unde rinsured. BTCS served 1,292 youth in its 8 County region in FY 2012, 76% of the youth were el igible for CHIP or Medicaid. We expect over 80% of those benefitting from these services will be uninsured or enrolled in CHIP or Medicaid. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project seeks to provi de 730 crisis respite bed days in DY 4 serving 16 youth; and to provide 1,460 crisis respite be days in DY 5 serving 30 youth. Category 3 outcomes: IT- 9.1 Our goal is to decrease mental health admissions and readmissions to criminal justice settings, i.e., juvenile justice residential facilities out of Guadalupe County and referral by Guadalupe C ounty Juvenile Probation to TYC and to juvenile detention facilities in any County, by a percentage TBD af ter baseline is established in 537 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Bluebonnet Trails Community Services DY 3. Project Description: Bluebonnet Trails Community Services (BTCS) is the state designated Local Mental Health Authority (LMHA) for Guadalupe County in Re gion 6 as well as for seven other Counties located east of and parallel to IH 35 and extending north of Austin, Texas in Travis County. In that capacity we are responsible for an array of public services as well as for behavioral health planning and coordination throughout our local service ar ea. As the LMHA, we contract with the Department of State Health Services (DSH S) to provide specialty behavioral health services to children and adolescents with Seve re Emotional Disturbance (SED), that DSHS identifies as the \"priority population.\" BTCS proposes to develop a special ized therapeutic foster care setting (also called 'treatment foster care') that can be used to intervene with the target populat ion, youth diagnosed with SED in crisis and divert them from admission to a psychiatri c hospital or juvenile justice facility. Specifically, this setting will be used to provide a safe environment to begin reintegration and family reunification followi ng diversion or discharge from hospital or residential facility. We will lo cate willing foster care homes in Guadalupe County certify these homes and provide specialized training to foster families. Therapeutic Foster Care is a distinct, powerful, and unique mo del of care that provides children with a combination of the best elements of traditional foster care and resi dential treatment centers. In Therapeutic Foster Care, the positive aspects of the nurturing and therapeutic family environment are combined with active and structured treatment. Therapeu tic Foster Programs provide, in a clinically effective and cost-effective way, individualized and intensive treatment for children and adolescents who would otherwise be placed in institutional settings. Youth diagnosed with SED generally have adjust ment or functioning difficulties in more than one life domain and therefore are usually served by more than one child serving agency in the community including specialized school programs, juvenile probation as well as mental health and substance abuse providers. These youth ex perience self-identified or family-identified crises that put them in danger of removal from the home and transfer or physical relocation to distant communities for inpatient or secure re sidential care, usually under contract with juvenile probation. BTCS is responsible for tr ansitioning youth from the state hospital system. We also work with local partne rs in coordinating car e for the persons returning from private hospitals and residential settings; however, youth who are separated from their families are less likely to make a quick rec overy and have difficulty re-integ rating into family life without active participation in therapy services by the family unit. Families who have limited financial and external support are unable to travel to Sa n Antonio or out of region to participate in hospital or residential treatme nt facility scheduled treatmen t meetings, treatment planning, therapy sessions and other re-integration activities. The limited family participation results in children who are often unable to stabilize and retu rn home. This causes disruption in families, in child and adolescent development and leads to increased involvement with the juvenile justice system. Crisis Respite through Therap eutic Foster Care offers families and youth a chance to return home. Specific Improvement Targets relating to reductions in justice involvement for these youth ar e included in the table. According to the Community Needs Assessment published by RHP 6 Guadalupe County is 538 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Bluebonnet Trails Community Services one of the fastest growing Counties in the Regi on. The Assessment also identifies the entire county as a Health Provider Shortage Area by HRSA for both primary care and behavioral health care. BTCS participates in the Mental Health Task Force for this County and they identified a need for services to youth and fa milies. This program of screening and early intervention in a community setting is a better alternative to address the challenges faced by these youth and families. The goals of this project as it relates to BTCS are: to develop sites in Guadalupe County with trained foster parents recruited from within the communities and professional support provided by licensed and certified staff currently working for BTCS outpatient sites there; to place youth in these settings as an alternative to inpa tient and secure resident ial settings. The goals for the youth and families are: to successfully reintegrate children with emotional and/or behavioral needs into their communities and families\u2014families who are trained to have the skills to meet those needs; and to reduce th e number of children who will be removed from home and placed out of county in juvenile probati on contracted facilities. Stable families and increased access to care will result in better functioning and reduced reliance on juvenile justice interventions. The project meets the following regional goals: in support of the triple aim of CMS, the project ensure s that youth receive high-quality patient centered care in the most cost-effective way; and this further deve lops a coordinated care delivery system. The Therapeutic Foster Care program will safely reduce the number of children in out-of-home care and expedite permanency for children currently in out-of-home placements; effectively maintaining a child with emotional and/or behavi oral needs in a family setting. The program supports effective growth and relationships of the child through an intensive support and treatment program, this program is designed to a ssist children transitioning to a less restrictive environment\u2014and, ultimately, into a healthy family situation. We support the following, nationally recognized definition of permanency: an enduring family relationship that is safe and meant to last a lifetime; offers the legal right and social status of full family membership; provides for physical, emotional, social, cogni tive, and spiritual well-being; and assures lifelong connections to extended family, siblin gs, other significant ad ults, family history, traditions, race and ethnic heritage, culture, religion, and language. We believe that these family relationships help produce healthy and well-adjusted adults which strengthens the safety and security of our communities. A major challenge for this program will involve the regulation and infrastructure needed to operate Foster Care services and to develop the philosophy of care to carry it out. We are certain that we can address the challenges and ac hieve the goal of this project because BTCS has reached agreement to collaborate with the Center for Health Care Services, (CHCS) the LMHA for Bexar County which is also a licen sed Child Placing Agency and has been developing foster care sites for several years. The CHCS staff brings tr aining and certification expertise. That staff along with the foster parents and BTCS staff in Guadalupe County will provide a therapeutic envi ronment that will enable children in the area to stay connected to their families and community wh ile learning the skills and copi ng mechanisms needed to be successful. Professional support will also be provided to the pa rents and key family members to develop skills strengthening the family unit, supporting successful reunification. There are a variety of evidenced based practices (EBP) that have been implemented in Therapeutic Foster Care settings, as noted in \"Evidenced Based Practices in Treatment Foster Care- A 539 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Bluebonnet Trails Community Services Resource Guide\" produced by the Foster Fa mily Based Treatment Association. Over the next five years, we expect the outcomes for the youth and families to be: higher success rate for reintegration from residentia l treatment facilities as evidenced by longer average tenure than currently recorded with thei r natural family after discharge; a reduction in removals and placements out of the Region by Juve nile Probation; and a reduction in inpatient psychiatric placements. These outcomes are suppor ted by the goals above, i.e., to establish this community alternative for crisis intervention that is cost effective, culturally competent and preserves families. The outcomes expected from this mental health program will address the needs in this Region. Starting Point/Baseline: Currently no Crisis Respite or Therapeutic Fo ster Care program exis ts in Guadalupe County and services are not provided for this gr oup of involved with juvenile probation and experiencing crises. Therefore, the baseline is 0 in DY 2. We do not have data related to out of home placements through Juvenile Probation Department in Guadalupe County nor do we have a comprehensive picture of psychiatric hospitalizations for youth. We will undertake to identify resources and methods to capture a nd share information acros s these various child serving agencies. Rationale: Crisis Respite through Therapeutic foster Care e xpands the options for caregivers and agencies involved with these children and adolescents othe r than to assess and transport to San Antonio or even farther outside of RHP 6 for admission to a hospital or secure residential facility for stabilization. Aside from the distant locations of these stabilization optio ns, we believe this is the best approach, an innovative use of a family oriented community setting rather than a more restrictive community in stitutional setting. BTCS served 1,292 youth in FY 2012 most of whom had diagnoses that put them into the range of Serious Emotional Disturbance and were at or below the poverty level with multiple functional deficits to overcome. Guadalupe County saw a 47.8% increa se in population from 2000 to 2010. According to that census data, 27. 2% of the population is under 18 years of age and 36% is Latino. The Community Health Impr ovement Plan for Bexar County states that \"Nearly 10 times as many Hispanic youth utilized state mental he alth services compared to the number of White and African American youth w ho utilized the same services.\" There are no crisis behavioral health facilities or resources in the County. Families transport their child to an Emergency Department in th eir own community or in San An tonio because of concern for the safety and security of their child and fam ily. Strategic planning sessions sponsored by the Bexar County Commissioners Court and Method ist Healthcare Ministries identified the following issue, \"Inadequate and fragmented con tinuum of care for children with behavioral health diagnoses.\" This project implements a crisis response for youth that addresses these identified gaps in th e continuum of care The Crisis Respite through Therapeutic Foster Ca re project will address all of the required core project components: a) Convene community stakeholders who can s upport the development of crisis stabilization services to conduct a gap analysis of the cu rrent community crisis system and develop a specific action plan that iden tifies specific crisis stabi lization services to address 540 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Bluebonnet Trails Community Services identified gaps. Our focus will be to work with st akeholders who are child serving agencies and to identify gaps that lead to re ferral to juvenile justice. We will convene community stakeholders during the remainder of FY 2013 to identify information needed to assess the gap in crisis services; the numbers of people removed by Juvenile Probation, taken to ED's and ad mitted to private facilities. b) Analyze the current system of crisis st abilization services available in the community including capacity of each service, current utilization patterns, eligibility criteria and discharge criteria for each service. We know that families tr ansport their child to an Emergency Department in their own community or in San Antonio rather than contacting the LMHA because of the limited crisis respons e services and/or concern for the safety and security of their child and family. Th is creates a complex issue related to data identification and access. Working with co mmunity stakeholders and child serving agencies, we will identify tools to provide data to analyze the capacity for service, current utilization patterns and to identify th e key characteristics of the people to be served. c) Assess the behavioral health needs of patients currently receiving crisis services. Determine the types and volume of services needed to resolve crises in community based settings. Then conduct a gap analysis that will result in a data driven plan to develop specific community based crisis stabilization alterna tives that will meet the behavioral health needs of the patients. We will use the current staff to assess current needs of those who are now and have been detained in the last year. d) Explore potential crisis alternative servic e models and determine acceptable and feasible models for implementation. Using the information from stakeholders, from capacity and utilization tools and from asse ssment of those detained, we will assess the intervention we are providing as to acceptab ility and feasibility to scale into other facilities in this County to increase capacity in Region 6. e) Review the intervention(s) impact on acce ss to and quality of behav ioral health crisis stabilization services and ident ify \"lessons learned,\" opportuniti es to scale all or part of the intervention(s) to a broader patie nt population, and identify key challenges associated with expansion of the interventi on(s), including special considerations for safetynet populations. Finally, we will review the intervention and the changes to identify lessons learned and adjust the m odel with respect to area, intensity and population. There is guidance available, and we plan to take care that the evidenced based practice (EBP) approach will evolve from a thorough needs assessment process that considers how well it fits with the clients, the staff and the organization. Unique community need identificat ion numbers the project addresses are: CN. 4 \"There is a shortage of high quality mental a nd behavioral health services th at are integrated with physical health care services;\" and CN.5 \"Lack of interconceptional a nd prenatal care for women and primary and preventive pediatric care results in poor maternal and child health outcomes.\" This project significantly enhances delivery system reform by enhancing the holistic health care approach of BTCS and its partners, includi ng Community Health Centers of South Texas, the FQHC for Guadalupe County. We have rece ived a grant from HRSA to build a clinic together to co-locate behavioral health and primary care services in Seguin. This program is another innovative community alternative. It reduces the need for in stitutional care and not 541 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Bluebonnet Trails Community Services only saves money but also provide s families with limited resources, the opportunity to engage in therapeutic interventions with their child in order to learn how to be more capable parents and caregivers. The project will improve child integration into the natural family; reduce in involvement with Juvenile Probation and subseq uent removal from the home and family. The increased capacity and access to these specialty services will decrease unnece ssary utilization the most costly healthcare delivery services such as emergency departments, psychiatric emergency services and psychiatric hospitals. BTCS currently receives funds from US Department of HHS to operate substance abuse screening and referral se rvice, OSAR in other counties, and Mental Health block grant funds for outpatient mental health services. Those HHS funds will not be used for direct services ; this project enhances and extends the care currently provided with Federal funds by a new and innovative to behavioral health crisis services. We are certain this intervention wi ll improve the healthcare outcomes for entire community and improve the ability of these young people to become contributing members of their communities. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): The Category 3 Outcome Measure that we selected is \"OD-9 Right Care, Right Setting\" the IT selected was IT- 9.1 Decrease in mental h ealth admissions and readmissions to criminal justice settings such as jails or prisons.\" Th is Improvement Target ('IT') language references criminal justice but more accurately, we are engaged in improvements related to juvenile justice. For the purpose of this project we are interpreting the IT to include the various levels of juvenile justice involvement to include resi dential treatment in a secure facility. We selected this measure because one of the key community partners in this project is the Juvenile Probation Department in Guadalupe County. Unfo rtunately, it is often the case that families have no options to care and treatment except through court action that removes custody and physically removes their child to a contracted Ju venile Probation residentia l facility. We feel treatment in the community rather than deeper and deeper involvement in the juvenile justice system would be a good predictor of success. Relationship to other Projects: BTCS has also proposed to establish a new out patient substance abuse service in Guadalupe County that supports services to this group of youth, creating new opportunities for referral and care. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: This approach it child crisis se rvices is different than the one proposed by CHCS and is for a population in a different County in RHP 6. We plan to coordinate care with CHCS and participate in learning collaborative with them so that we may both improve our systems of care. Plan for Learning Collaborative: BTCS will participate in all learning collabora tives organized or sponsored by University Health System that are relevant to our projects. We believe it is important to improving and adjusting the care provided. 542 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Bluebonnet Trails Community Services Project Valuation: The project seeks to provide 730 crisis respit e bed days in DY 4 serving 16 youth; and to provide 1,460 crisis respite bed days in DY 5 serv ing 30 youth. This valuation used cost-utility analysis which measures program cost in dolla rs and the health cons equences in utility- weighted units called quality- adjusted life-years (QALYs). QA LYS incorporate costs averted when known (e.g., emergency room visits that ar e avoided). The valuation study was prepared by professors H. Shelton Brown, Ph.D. and A. Hasanat Alamgir, Ph.D. both of the UT Houston School of Public Health and Thomas Bohman, Ph.D. of the UT Austin Center for Social Work Research based on the cost utility model and an extensive literature of similar interventions and cost savings and health outcomes related to those interventions. We assigned a value of $2,395,828 through DY 5.

We will open and staff substance abuse services within our current clinic site in Seguin, Texas. That site has space and it is suitable for the service without renovation or capit al expenditure. This outpatient substance abuse service site which establishes services that are new to BTCS and to the community will provide supportive outpatient services, i.e., group and individual counseling; and an intensive outpatient program for persons who have been diagnosed with and require treatment for substance use disorders. Need for the project : This project addresses RHP 6 Community Needs Assessment needs: CN. 3 Many residents of RHP 6 lack acces s to medical and dental care due to high rates of uninsurance and health care prov ider shortages; and CN. 4 There is a shortage of high quality mental and behavioral health services that are integrated with physical hea lth care services. There is only one licensed treatment provider in all of Guadalupe County and it does not serve primarily poor, uninsured and under insured. Target population : Our target population is community re ferrals, and those referred from detoxification or ED's who ar e poor, uninsured or underinsured and in need of outpatient substance abuse services. BTCS served 3,377 persons in Guadalupe County in FY 2012; 2,401 persons with behavioral health disorders. In FY 2012, an average of 43% of the adults were eligible for Medicaid; 73% of BTCS client s are below the federal poverty level; 55% are uninsured. We estimate that approximately 70% of those benefitting from this project will be poor, uninsured or underinsured. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project seeks to provi de outpatient substance abuse services to 200 people in DY 4 and 400 people in DY 5. Category 3 outcomes: IT3.8 Our goal is to reduce the behavi oral health /substance abuse 30 day readmission rate to detoxification and residential facilities by a percentage rate TBD after the baseline is established in DY 3. 546 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Bluebonnet Trails Community Services Project Description: Bluebonnet Trails Community Services (BTCS) is the state designated Local Mental Health Authority (LMHA) for Guadalupe County in Re gion 6 as well as for seven other Counties located east of and parallel to IH 35 and extending north of Austin, Texas in Travis County. In that capacity we are responsible for an array of public behavioral health services as well as for behavioral health planning and coordinati on throughout our local service area. That responsibility includes identifying gaps in service or barriers to access for persons residing in the area. As referenced in the Community N eeds Assessment for RHP 6, page 14, the National Rural Health Association (NRHA) has identified se veral issues of particular interest to rural communities: and among them is lack of access to health care services, particularly health disparities and physician shortages; mental health services, partic ularly relating to provider shortages and lack of insurance c overage; and substance abuse services . Over the last year, staff of BTCS along with leaders and advocates participated in the Guadalupe County Mental Health Task Force to identify community needs. One of the most pressing deficiencies identified is lack of access to outpatient substance abuse treatment especia lly for the poor and uninsured or underinsured. BTCS proposes to enhance service availability by establishment of a new substance abuse services within our current community based set ting where behavioral health services may be delivered in this underserved area. Our current si te has space and it is suitable for the service without renovation or capital expenditure. This new outpatient substance abuse service will include supportive outpatient serv ices, i.e., group and individual counseling, and an intensive outpatient program for persons who have been diagnosed with and require treatment for substance use disorders. The goal of this project is to allow people who have limited resources to access outpatient substance abus e services in their home count y. Many of these individuals will have this access following a detoxificati on or ED visit in adjacent Bexar county. Additionally the goal is to stop the cycle of det oxification or ED utilizatio n and relapse that is triggered by inadequate access to suppor tive and intensive outpatient services. The goal of the project is to establish this new outpatient service in Seguin in Guadalupe County to improve the availability of substance abuse services and targ eting specifically the poor and uninsured. This project m eets the following regional goals : achieving one of the CMS aims by improving the patient's experience of care; will m eet the regional need to reduce over utilization of ED's in Bexar County by persons with behavioral health disorders. The primary challenge to this project will be to achieve ac ceptance in the community of the need for and desirability of treatment for substance use disorders. The recovery community is under resourced and several agencies and services have ceased operation over the last several years. BTCS is a well-established the mental health provider and the LMHA in Guadalupe county and has a good relationship with the Federally Qualif ied Health Center and most health care providers in the community. We feel we ar e positioned to address the challenge by creating opportunities for community engagement and educa tion concerning substance use and its impact. Over the next five years we expect to an increase in th e number of people accessing substance use disorder treatment and a concomitant re duction in the number of readmissions to detoxification facilities and substance abuse related ED vis its for Guadalupe county residents, 547 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Bluebonnet Trails Community Services both in Guadalupe County and in Bexar County. The goals stated above related to establishing this new service and educating the community a bout the need for intervention and treatment will directly affect achieveme nt of these outcomes. Starting Point/Baseline: This is a new project for BTCS in Guadalupe County. There is no program for substance abuse treatment that targets the poor and uninsured and therefore the baseline for DY 2 is 0. We do not have current data to identify those from Guad alupe County who are acces sing detoxification and ED services due to substance abuse disorders, but an important first step in this project will be link to Health Access San Antonio or some other means of gathering and tr acking that data. We are also aware that we must secure licensure and for outpatient subs tance abuse services. Rationale: The primary intent of this project, which is to establish a new substan ce abuse service location within our current mental health clinic in an underserved area. There is one substance abuse provider in the County, but the focus of that servi ce is not specifically on the poor and uninsured. Locating a service locally will increase utilizatio n, eliminating the barrier of travel into Bexar County that prevents the economically disadvantaged from accessing care. According to the Community Needs Assessment of RHP 6, eleven to twenty percent of the population of Guadalupe County is below the povert y level. Additionally, 24 % of the people in the RHP 6 region are without insu rance or any third party covera ge. The entire county has been designated a mental health provide r shortage area according to US Department of HHS, HRSA. The challenges for the people living in Guadalup e County are that there is only one licensed treatment provider in the County, the Teddy Buerge r Center associated with Guadalupe Regional Medical Center. The Center accepts third party pa yments and operates on a sliding fee scale for those unable to pay, but it cannot m eet the need of all the citizens of the County. It is especially not equipped to meet the needs of the poor and uninsured. Some services available in the adjacent Bexar County and frequently when there is a life threatening or dire crisis of some sort, people travel from Guadalupe County to Bexar county and access the ED's and detoxification facilities. According to the Bexar County C onsortium Report of 2012, the ED's in Bexar County are over utilized by persons pres enting with behavioral health conditions. That includes a substantial number of people from other counties. Once the crisis is over and the person is medically stable they return to Guadalupe County but are unable to access ongoing outpatient treatment to remain free of alcohol and drugs. Th e result is relapse and a return to ED's and detoxification facilities. Even though there are no Core Co mponents associated with this option, but we plan to use the guidance found in other Options. We expect to carefully devel op the project and then to adjust based on a rapid cycle quality improvement model. The development of this project will begin by reconvening community stakeholders during the remainder of FY 2013 to gather support for and assess the barriers to access to outpatient subs tance abuse services. With these stakeholders, we will identify tools to provide data to get current utilization of ED and residential services in Bexar County as well as ED use at the Guadal upe Regional Medical Center in Seguin and to assess the demand for outpatient se rvices in Guadalupe County. BT CS operates a mental health clinic in Guadalupe County and is in process of building a new facility to co-locate services with 548 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Bluebonnet Trails Community Services the Community Centers of South Ce ntral Texas, the FQHC in that County. We will use the staff and community resources we have in the county to assess current need s of those who are now accessing EDs and detoxification and then returning to the County. Using the information from stakeholders, from capacity and utilization tools, from furthe r literature reviews and from assessment of those potential referrals, we will assess the interventi on we are planning to provide. As we establish the new service within our outpatient site, we will plan a rapid cycle quality improvement component through our Qual ity Management Department at BTCS. We plan to continuously improve the program over the next 4 years as we adjust the volume of interventions and service array and make changes based on lessons learned. Those changes may include adjustments to the mode l with respect to interventi ons, intensity and population. This project addresses Commun ity Needs Assessment needs : CN. 3 Many residents of RHP 6 lack access to medical and dental care due to high rates of uninsurance and health care provider shortages; and CN. 4 There is a shortage of high quality me ntal and behavioral health services that are integrated with physic al health care services. This project will enhance the curren t delivery system reform initiatives by establishing this new community setting within the FQHC and impr oving access to behavioral health care while integrating that care with primary care. BTCS currently receives funds from US Department of HHS to operate substance abuse screening and refe rral service, OSAR in other counties. Those HHS funds are not used for direct outpatient services and are a llocated in a different RHP. No other federal funding sources are used in this project. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): The Category 3 Outcome Measure that we selected is \"OD 3 Potentially Preventable ReAdmissions 30 day Readmission Rates (PPRs ); IT 3.8 Behavioral Health /Substance Abuse 30 day readmission rate.\" This is a stand-alone m easure. We selected this measure because the goal of this project is to help people who have been in some inpatient or other detoxification program to transition to stable living in the community by providing access to community outpatient services. The cycle of relapse and re turn to hospital or re sidential detoxification services is a major disruption for in dividuals seeking to ach ieve recovery. It is also costly to the health care system and devastating to individual s and families. We believe that measuring the reduction in re-hospitalization will be a good indicator of success for the program and a good indicator of success on a personal basis for t hose enrolled in the program. Low income individuals cannot now access outpatient care and ar e left in this cycle of relapse. Extended sobriety and productivity will improve their health outcomes. Relationship to other Projects: BTCS has also proposed in Category 2, Pr oject 1268443-05.2.1. This project is the establishment of a patient naviga tor program for high utilizers of the ED at Guadalupe Regional Medical Center. The project to establish a new outpatient subs tance abuse service in the county supports the patient navigator project by creating new opportunities fo r referral and care. 549 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Bluebonnet Trails Community Services Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: This project supports and enhances CHCS proj ects 3 and 4 by reducing the burden of homeless substance abusing individuals who are in need of the Haven for Hope services. We hope to participate with CHCS in coordinating care and learning from their approach to these vital services. Plan for Learning Collaborative: BTCS will participate in all learning collaborative s organized or sponsored by University Health System that are relevant to our projects. We believe it is important to improving and adjusting the care provided. Project Valuation: The project reduces inappropria te use of ED by this populati on which improves their lives through stable services in a medical home; and improves community health by opening access for those who truly need of ED. The project seeks to provide out patient substance abuse services to 200 people in DY 4 and 400 people in DY 5. The valuation calculated for this project used cost-utility analysis which measures program cost in dollars and the health consequences in utility-weighted units that were applied to the fact ors existing in this unde rserved area, including: limited access to primary care and to behavioral health care, poverty and the link between chronic health conditions and chronic behavioral health conditions. The valuation study was prepared by professors H. Shelton Brown, Ph.D. and A. Hasanat Alamgir, Ph.D. both of the UT Houston School of Public Health and Thomas Bohman, Ph.D. of the UT Austin Center for Social Work Research based on a model that include d quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and an extensive literature of similar interventions and co st savings and health outcomes related to those interventions. The QALY index incorporates costs averted when known (e.g., emergency room visits that are avoided). We valued this project at $1,387,058 through DY 5. Complete write-up of project will be available at performing provider site. 550 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Bluebonnet Trails Community Services 1268443-05.1.2 PASS 1 1.12.2 N/A 1.12.2 EXPAND THE NUMBER OF COMMUNITY BASED SETTINGS WHERE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES MAY BE DELIVERED IN UNDERSERVED AREAS : SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT AND INTERVENTION SERVICES Bluebonnet Trails Community Mental Health and Me ntal Retardation Center dba/Bluebonnet Trails Community Services TPI - 1268443-05 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 1268443-05.3.2 3.IT-3.8 Behavioral Health /Sub stance Abuse 30 day readmission rate Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 P3 Develop administrative protocols and clinical guidelines for projects selected Metric 1 [P3.1.]: Manual of operations for the project detailing administrative protocols and clinical guidelines Goal: Produce a manual of operations that can be used to establish administrative and clinical practices.

The provider is located in a 10,000 square mile rural service area with a total population of approximate ly 206,777. In 2012, the Center provided services to 3,538 adults and children that met criteria for services. The Mental Health Operating budget is approximately 6.9 million dollars. The pr ograms work closely with schools, health centers, hospitals, law enforcemen t, judiciary and local elected officials to coordinate the provision of services. Intervention(s) : The project is to establish Crisis Stabiliz ation Services in the service area. More specifically, it is the Center's intent to provide a minimum of a 10 bed Crisis Residential Facility. Need for the project : Camino Real Community Services' area is challenged by its extremely rural nature where there is limited access to community based options that provide readily accessible crisis interventions. The designation as a historically heal th care professional shortage area and mental health professiona l shortage area reflects the great challenge this area has with accessibility to needed services. There are no local psychiatric hospitals or crisis stabilization facilities in the service area. The center provi ded 413 crisis assessments (January 2012 - August 2012) to individuals in the service area. Of the 413 approximately 140 patients were sent to inpatient psychiatric hospitals between January 2012 - August 2012. Currently there are no Federal Funds utilized for any Crisis Stabilization services in the Camino Real service area. Target population : The target population is individuals of all ages experiencing a psychiatric crisis and requiring crisis resi dential treatment. The center's current behavioral health population is comprised of individuals who are indige nt or Medicaid and/or Medicare eligible. It is anticipated that once the facility is fully operational, the expected service volume will be 108 persons per 12 month period. This assumes an av erage stay of 30 days per patient and a 90% occupancy rate. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project intends to benefit patients by providing crisis residential serv ices including psychiatric interven tion, 24 hour active treatment by mental health professionals and rehabilitati on and education services that en hance patient skills. It is the performing provider's expectation that this model will improve access to the appropriate level of care for patients. The other benefits include decreasing travel for patients needing crisis stabilization services. Category 3 outcomes: OD-9, IT 9.4 Decrease Behavioral Health /Substance Abuse admissions and readmissions to institutional facilities incl uding local emergency departments and psychiatric facilities. 553 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Camino Real Community Services Project Description: When a consumer lacks appropriate behavioral health crisis resolution mechanisms, first responders are often limited in their options to resolve the situation. Sometimes the choice comes down to the ER, jail, or an inpatient ho spital bed. Unfortunately, a worst case scenario occurs when even these undesirable options fail , and the consumer is left to the care of family/friends until transportation and availability of an in-patient placement can be arranged. It leaves the person in crisis and the family at great risk and feeling frustrated with the system they turn to for help. Crisis stabilization services can be developed that crea te alternatives to these less desirable settings. Building on existing systems, communities can develop crisis alternatives such as sobering units, crisis residentia l settings and crisis respite programs with varying degrees of clinical services based on the needs of clients. While hospitalization pr ovides a high degree of safety for the person in crisis, it is very expens ive and is often more than what is needed to address the crisis. Community-based crisis alte rnatives can effectively reduce expensive and undesirable outcomes, such as prev entable inpatient stays. For exam ple, state psychiatric hospital recidivism trended downward coinci dent with implementation of cr isis outpatient services in some Texas communities. The percent of persons readmitted to a Texas state psychiatric hospital within 30 days decreased from 8.0% in SFY2008 (before implementation of alternatives) to 6.9% in SFY2011.1 The Camino Real Community Services area is vastly rural and has been designated as a Medically Underserved Area, Health Professiona l Shortage Area and Mental Health Shortage Area by the US Department of Health and Human Services Health Resources and Services Administration division. Ther e are many challenges that accomp any these designations. For instance, in the 10,000 square miles that comprise the portion of Region 6 that Camino Real is responsible for, none of the inpatie nt hospitals have a psychiatric unit to address th e needs of the community. The lack of resources in the loca l community requires extensive travel into San Antonio for access to a private or public psychiatri c facility in order to stabilize the person in crisis. Typically, local law enforcement provides transportation to these distant locations. The cost to the community is not only in the ma n hours and mileage costs associated with the transport, but the risk to the community when th e peace officer is diverted from the responsibility of protecting the community to provide the needed transportation. The emotional cost to the person in crisis and their family/f riends who wait for hours for logist ics to be worked out in order to finally get to the help they need is immeasurable. The project proposed by Camino Real is to develop local crisis st abilization services for persons in psychiatric crisis. This program will be de signed and staffed to provide acute psychiatric intervention comparable to that received at remote psychiatric inpatient hospitals. This community based alternative wi ll have a dramatic impact on frequency, duration and cost associated with usage of local hospital Emergency Rooms. The local crisis stabilization serv ices will assure that the right car e is being provided in the right setting (OD-9.4.1). There should be a corresponding d ecrease of mental health admissions and re-admissions of persons needing crisis stabil ization services to institutional facilities. The target goal is to decrease use of higher cost services in Emergency Rooms and/or Inpatient Facilities. Additional goals woul d be to decrease travel for patie nts needing crisis stabilization 554 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Camino Real Community Services services. Inherent to the program design w ill be the provision of responsive psychiatric intervention, active treat ment by mental health professionals and rehabilitation and education services that enhance consumer skills as they return to their homes. By the end of the 5 year period and the establishm ent of crisis stabilizat ion services, consumers in need, will be able to receive these services in their community. On average, drive times to services will be non-existent or would be no more than one hour. Response times to consumers will be significantly reduced ending long wait time s in emergency rooms and/or long transport times to State Hospitals and othe r facilities. The efficacy of tr eatment will be significantly improved and overall costs to the total care system (not just ho spitals) would be significantly reduced. The project responds to needs as compiled in the RHP 6 Needs Assessment particularly CN 4 which states \"There is a shortage of high quality mental and behavi oral health services that are integrated with physical health care services and/ or provide crisis stabil ization\". Further the project meets the following regional goals: Transform health care delivery from a dis ease-focused model of episodic care to a patient-centered, coordinated delivery model th at improves patient satisfaction and health outcomes, reduces unnecessary or duplicative services, and builds on the accomplishments of our existing health care system; and Develop a regional approach to health car e delivery that leverages and improves on existing programs and infrastructure, is res ponsive to patient need s throughout the entire region, and improves health care out comes and patient satisfaction. Starting Point/Baseline: No local 24 hour crisis stabilization services are available to community members who are in psychiatric crisis; persons eith er stay in hospital emergency rooms or are transported long distances to more restrictive inpatient servic e environments. In DY 2 and DY 3 planning and implementation processes will be in place to esta blish the project. DY 4 will see the hiring of staff and the initial provision of services with full services in place in DY 5. The Category 3 outcome measure baseline will be determined in years DY4 and DY 5 when program is implemented. Rationale: Camino Real has selected Project Option #1.13.1 , Development of Behavioral Health Crisis Stabilization Serves as alterna tive to hospitalization, with all the required core components. These are as follows: a) Convene community stakeholders who can support the development of crisis stabilization serv ices to conduct a gap analysis of the current community crisis system and develop a specific action plan that identifies specific crisis stabilization services to address identified gaps (e.g. for example, one community with high rates of incarceration an d/or ED visits for intoxicated patients may need a sobering unit while another community with high rates of 555 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Camino Real Community Services hospitalizations for mild exacer bations mental illness that could be treated in community sett ing may need cris is residential programs). b) Analyze the current system of crisis stabilization services available in the community including capacity of each serv ice, current utilization patterns, eligibility criteria and discharge criteria for each service. c) Assess the behavioral health needs of patients currently receiving crisis services in the jails, EDs, or psychiatric hospitals. Determine the types and volume of services needed to resolve crises in community based settings. Then conduct a gap analysis that will result in a data driven plan to develop specific community based crisis stabilization alternatives that will meet the behavioral health n eeds of the patients (e.g. a minor emergency stabilization site for first responders to utilize as an alternative to costly and time consuming Emergency Department settings) d) Explore potential crisis alternativ e service models and determine acceptable and feasible models for implementation. e) Review the intervention(s) impact on access to and quality of behavioral health crisis stabilization services and identify \"lessons learned,\" opportunities to scale all or part of th e intervention(s) to a broader patient population, and identify key challenges associated with expansion of the intervention(s), including special considerations for safety net populations Note a substantial number of the above Core Components are included in category 1 and category 3 milestones. This selection is based on the fact that there are no local crisis stabilizati on services to persons in psychiatric crisis in the Camino Real service area. The population has a significant need as evidenced by the number of calls made to the loca l crisis hotline and the requests made for crisis assessment at local hospitals. It is responsive to Community Need #4 (CN4). In 2008, Mental Health or Subs tance Abuse disorders were th e principal reason for 1.8 million inpatient community hospital stays, accounting for 4.5 percent of stays in the U.S. This is according to Brief #117 (Agency for Healthcare Re search and Quality, June 2011). It was also noted the MH and SA conditions most frequently treated in community hospitals were mood disorders (depression and bipolar disorder), schi zophrenia and other psycho tic disorders, alcohol- related disorders and drug-related disorders. Th ese MHSA hospital stays cost $9.7 billion ($7.7 billion for MH; $2.1 billion for SA) accounting for 2.7 percent of all inpatient community hospital costs. Nationwide, the MH average le ngth of stay was 8.0 days and the SA average length of stay was 4.8 days with an average cost $5100. In another pub lication (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2010) the prevalence of many serious hea lth conditions such as cognitive or mental impairments, depression, and diab etes is significantly higher for dua l eligible individuals. They are also some of the sickest and poorest indivi duals covered by either Medicare or Medicaid. Approximately 31% of the individuals served by the Performing Provider are dual eligible (Medicaid & Medicare). 556 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Camino Real Community Services This is a new initiative for the Performing Provi der since there are no local crisis stabilization services available to persons in psychiatric cris is as an alternative in the local communities. Based on data reviewed from the provider's loca l database the local popu lation has a significant need as evidenced by the number of calls made to the provider's crisis hotline and requests for crisis assessments by local hospitals. This results in a significant financial impact on local resources including law enforcement, judicial system and hospital emergency rooms. In addition, availability of inpatien t psychiatric hospital beds in pub lic and private facilities has been significantly reduced due to the demands of the forensic population. In Fiscal Year 2012 the center crisis hotline receive d 3016 calls with over 1000 of thes e requiring crisis assessments that resulted in 28% needing stabilization at hi gher cost inpatient facilities. The community needs cost effective local option for residents in crisis. In Texas the average cost of an Emergency Room visit is approxim ately $996 and an average stay at a state funded mental health facility is $400/day according to the 2011 report by Health Management Associate on \"The Impact of Proposed Budget Cuts to Community Ba sed Mental Health Services\". Furthermore the report supports the model of community based services as a better option for treating persons with mental illness in a more cost-effective loca l environment. In the Texas Fact Sheet-2011 Psychiatric Hospitals there were a total of 5391 ps ychiatric beds in the state with 49.3% of the beds being public beds, 14.4% were nonprofit beds, and 36.3% were for-profit beds. Two hundred and twelve counties in Texas do not have a psychiatric hospital and most hospitals are located in metropolitan areas. The Performing Providers Service area reported earlier has no psychiatric hospital available; therefore, individu als in crisis do not have access to a local option with regards to alternative cris is stabilization services.

The reason for selecting this measure is that it captures the impact of having a local, cost effective alternative to higher costs systems such as jail, emergency room, or inpatient hospitalization when addressing crisis situations that can be quickly resolved. The project will track the number of admissions to the crisis faci lity and compare to historical data kept by the Center regarding the number of admissions to public and pr ivate in-patient psychiatric institutions to calculate cost a voidance. As the community becomes familiar with the crisis stabilization unit and diverts persons in psychiat ric crisis from the jails and Emergency Room, crisis stabilization admission data will be tracked and calculation of cost avoidance to the ER and jails will be maintained to substantiate the cost effectiveness of this alternative. Health Management Associates, in their March 2011 Impact of Proposed Budget Cuts to Community-Based Mental Health Services presented to the Texas Conf erence of Urban Counties, reported the average per day cost of community based services is $12 for adults and $13 for children, as compared to $401 for a State Hospita l bed, $137 for a jail bed for an inmate with mental illness, and $986 for an emergency room vi sit. Camino Real anticipates that development of a crisis stabilization unit in the local community will also reduce costs to other stakeholders involved in the crisis response system which in cludes the local sheriff's department and the judicial system. Relationship to other Projects: Camino Real is proposing one project in Re gion 6. It is category 1.13 Development of behavioral health crisis stabi lization services as alternatives to hospitalization with Quality Improvement 3.IT-9.4 Right Care, Right Setting. It relates to other projects in the region by addressing the ne ed for a local alternative for stabilization of crisis situations that are benign and are more appropriately addressed in a facility located within the service area. Hospital emer gency rooms, law enforcement personnel, jails, programs of the center and other affiliated agencies will have the capability to place individuals in this facility. This project will compliment other activities and will be a clear alternative to options that are costly, involve extended wait times for consumers, use great amounts of local resources and involve long tr avel distances for people th at are needing services. 558 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Camino Real Community Services Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: By establishing crisis stabilization services as a local option, Camino Real Community Services supports the effort to have better outcomes for persons with mental illness in the service area in line with RHP Regional Goals: -Triple Aim: assuring patients' re ceive high quality and patient centered care, in the most cost effective ways. -Improve the health care infr astructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of our counties. -Further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system -Improve out comes while contai ning cost growth Project Valuation: Project valuation takes into consideration: 1) Costs for both State oper ated Psychiatric Hospitals 2) Cost of private Psychiatric Hospitals 3) Local Emergency Room and Hospital costs 4) Cost of local Judicial systems 5) Cost of local City and County law enforcemen t systems both in their intervention activity as well as the provision of transportation for consumers needing treatment. Significant value will be given to a program that can provide serv ices much more responsive to consumer needs with significantly reduced time frames and efficient use of limited resources! 559 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Camino Real Community Services 121990904.1.1 PASS 1 1.13.1 A-E 1.13.1 Development of Behavioral Health Crisis Stabilization Services as alternatives to hospitalization Camino Real Community Services TPI-121990904 Category 3 outcome measure: 121990904.3.1 3.IT-9.4 Decrease mental health ad missions and readmissions of persons needing crisis stabilization services to institutional facilities Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 P-2 Conduct mapping and gap analysis of current crisis system Metric 1 P-2.1Produce a written analysis of community needs for crisis services.

The provider is located in a 10,000 square mile rural service area with a total population of approximate ly 206,777. In 2012, the Center provided services to 3,538 adults and children that met criteria for services. The Mental Health Operating budget is approximately 6.9 million dollars. The pr ograms work closely with schools, health centers, hospitals, law enforcemen t, judiciary and local elected officials to coordinate the provision of services. Intervention(s) : The project is to establish two (2) Mob ile Crisis Outreach Teams (MCOT) in the service area. Need for the project : Camino Real Community Services' area is challenged by its extremely rural nature where there is limited access to community based options that provide readily accessible crisis interventions. The designation as a historically heal th care professional shortage area and mental health professiona l shortage area reflects the great challenge this area has with accessibility to needed services. There are no local psychiatric hospitals or crisis stabilization facilities in the service area. The center provi ded 413 crisis assessments (January 2012 - August 2012) to individuals in the service area. Of the 413 approximately 140 patients were sent to inpatient psychiatric hospitals between January 2012 - August 2012. Currently there are no Federal Funds utilized for any Mobile Crisis services in the Cami no Real service area. Target population : The target population is individuals of all ages experiencing a psychiatric crisis. The center's current be havioral health population is co mprised of individuals who are indigent (52%) or Medicaid eligible (48%). The expected patient volume this project expects to serve is as follows: DY3 100 patients, DY4 120 patients and by DY5 144 patients. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project intends to benefit patients by providing crisis services to individuals at their place of residence, school and/or other community-based safe locations, 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Services include the provision of responsive psychiatric intervention, active tr eatment by mental health profe ssionals and rehabilitation and education services that enhance patient skills. It is the performing provider's expectation that this model will improve access to the appropriate level of care for patients. The other benefits include decreasing travel for patients need ing crisis stabilization services. Category 3 outcomes: IT-9.2. ED appropriate utiliz ation. Our goal is to Reduce Emergency Department visits for target conditions: Behavioral Health/Substance Abuse. The actual target is to be determined. 562 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Camino Real Community Services Project Description: The project is to increase the capacity of its crisis services by establishing 2 Mobile Crisis Outreach Teams (MCOT) in the service area. The goal of this project is to enhance access to crisis services, while reducing the need for local Emergency Departments (ED) in Camino Real's catchment area and reducing the number of indivi duals sent to more expensive mental health inpatient beds for crisis resolution services that could be provided to th ese individuals in a less restrictive environment. The Camino Real Community Services area is ch allenged by its extremely rural nature where there is limited access to community based optio ns that provide readily accessible crisis interventions. The designation as a historically health care professional s hortage area and mental health professional shortage area reflects the great challenge this area has with accessibility to needed services. The lack of robust social agen cies or organizations geared towards addressing behavioral health crisis shifts the burden to the public community mental health system that has not been funded to develop dedicated Mobile Crisis Outreach teams in this area. Through this project, Camino Real Community Services (CRCS) will implement clinically staffed mobile treatment teams that provide prompt face-to-face crisis assessment, crisis intervention services, crisis follow-up, and rela pse prevention services for individuals in the community. These services intend to reach individuals at their plac e of residence, school and/or other community-based safe locations, 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. It is the performing provider's expectation that this model will im prove access to the appropriate level of care for patients in the provider's service area, reduce the need for utiliza tion of local EDs, and provide an alternate and more expedient option for law enforcement when encountering individuals in the community suffering from psychiatric disorders or experiencing a crisis. The program will also be designed to interface with CRCS's outpatient mental health clinics to ensure that all behavioral health issues ar e treated in the most therapeutic manner possible. The target goal is to decrease use of higher cost services in Emergency Rooms and/or Inpatient Facilities and get people timely access to needed se rvices. Additional goals would be to decrease travel for patients needing crisis stabilization serv ices. Inherent to the program design will be the provision of responsive psychiatri c intervention, active treatment by mental health professionals and rehabilitation and education services that enhance consumer skills. This project is responsive to RHP Community Need #4. By the end of the 5 year period and the esta blishment of Mobile Crisis Outreach Teams , consumers in need will be able to access these services in their community. Response times to consumers will be immediate and lead to signif icantly reduced wait times in emergency rooms and/or long transport times to State Hospitals and other private psychi atric facilities. The efficacy of treatment will be significantly improved and overall costs to the total care system (not just hospitals) would be significantly reduced. 563 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Camino Real Community Services Starting Point/Baseline: The baseline is zero. No local 24 hour Mobile Cris is Outreach Teams exist in the community for persons who are in psychiatric crisis; persons e ither stay in hospital emergency rooms or are transported long distances to more restrictive inpatient service environments. The baseline will be determined in year DY3 when program is implemented. Rationale: Camino Real has selected Project Option #1.12.3 , Develop and staff a num ber of mobile clinics that can provide access to care in very remote, inaccessible, or impoverished areas of Texas. This selection is based on the fact that there ar e no local Mobile Crisis Outreach Teams, no local psychiatric hospitals nor local crisis stabilizatio n services available to persons in psychiatric crisis in the Camino Real service area. The popul ation has a significant n eed as evidenced by the number of calls made to the local crisis hotline and the requests made fo r crisis assessment at local hospitals. Development of Mobile Crisis Ou treach Teams/Services offers an alternative to costly hospitalization that may occur if crisis situations escalate due to lack of immediate intervention. It is responsive to Community Need #4. In 2008, Mental Health or Substance Abuse (MHSA) disorders were the principal reason for 1.8 million inpatient community hospital stays, accounti ng for 4.5 percent of stays in the U.S. This is according to Brief #117 (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, June 2011). It was also noted the MH and SA conditions most frequently treated in community hospitals were mood disorders (depression and bipolar disorder), schi zophrenia and other psycho tic disorders, alcohol- related disorders and drug-related disorders. Th ese MHSA hospital stays cost $9.7 billion ($7.7 billion for MH; $2.1 billion for SA) accounting for 2.7 percent of all inpatient community hospital costs. Nationwide, the MH average le ngth of stay was 8.0 days and the SA average length of stay was 4.8 days with an average cost $5100. This project represents a significantly enhanced initiative for the Perfor ming Provider since there are no local mobile crisis outreac h teams; although, there is a 24-H our crisis hotline available to persons in psychiatric crisis and a limited respons e system in place for purposes of determining recommendations for placement of persons in a mo re restrictive environment. Based on data reviewed from the provider's local database the local population has a significant need as evidenced by the number of calls made to the performing provider's crisis hotline and requests for crisis assessments by local hospitals. In Fiscal Year 2012 the cente r crisis hotline received 3016 calls with over 1000 of thes e requiring crisis assessments and 28% of those assessed needing stabilization at higher cost inpatient facilities. This results in a significant financial impact on local resources including law enforcem ent, judicial system and hospital emergency rooms. In addition, availability of inpatient ps ychiatric hospital beds in public and private facilities has been significantly reduced due to the demands of the forensic population. In Texas the average cost of an Emergency Room visit is approximately $996 and an average stay at a state funded mental health facility is $400/day according to th e 2011 report by Health Management Associate on \"The Impact of Propos ed Budget Cuts to Community Based Mental Health Services\". Furthermore the report suppo rts the model of community based services as a better option for treating persons with mental illness in a more cost -effective local environment. In the Texas Fact Sheet-2011 Psychiatric Hospitals there were a total of 5391 psychiatric beds in the state with 49.3% of the beds being public beds, 14.4% were nonprofit beds, and 36.3% were 564 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Camino Real Community Services for-profit beds. Two hundred and twelve countie s in Texas do not have a psychiatric hospital and most hospitals are located in metropolitan areas. The Perfo rming Provider Service area has no psychiatric hospital available; therefore, individuals in crisis do not have immediate access to a local option with regards to alternative crisis resolution services. When a consumer lacks appropriate behavioral health cr isis resolution mechanisms, firs t responders are often limited in their options to resolve the situation. Sometimes the choice comes down to the ER, jail, or an inpatient hospital bed. Unfortunately, a worst ca se scenario occurs when even these undesirable options fail, and the consumer is left to the care of family/friends until transportation and availability of an in-patient placement can be arranged. It leaves the person in crisis and the family at great risk and feeling frustrated with the system they turn to for help. Mobile Crisis services can be developed that create alternatives to these less desirable settings. While hospitalization provides a high degree of safety for the person in crisis, it is very expensive and is often more than what is needed to address the crisis. Community-based crisis alternatives can effectively reduce expensive and undesirable outcomes, such as preventable inpatient stays. A major challenge is related to the fact that the service area is vastly rural and has been designated as a Medically Underserve d Area, Health Professi onal Shortage Area and Mental Health Shortage Area by th e US Department of Health and Human Services Health Resources and Services Administration division. In the 10,000 square miles that comprise the portion of Region 6 that Ca mino Real is responsible for, none of the inpatient hospitals have a psychiatric unit to ad dress the needs of the community. The lack of resources in the local community requires ex tensive travel into San Antoni o for access to a private or public psychiatric facility in order to stabiliz e the person in crisis. Typically, local law enforcement provides transportation to these di stant locations. The co st to the community is not only in the man hours and mileage costs as sociated with the transp ort, but the risk to the community when the peace officer is divert ed from the responsib ility of protecting the community to provide the needed transportation. The emot ional cost to the person in crisis and their family/friends who wait for hours for logistics to be worked out in order to finally get to the help they need is immeasurable.

The reason for selecting this measure is that it capture s the impact of having a local, cost effective alternative to higher costs system s such as jail, emergency room, or inpatient hospitalization when addressing crisis situations that can be quickly resolved. The project will track the number of persons served by the M obile Crisis Outreach Teams and compare to historical data kept by the Cent er regarding the number of admi ssions to public and private in- patient psychiatric institutions to calculate cost avoidance. As the community becomes familiar with the MCOT services and these teams divert persons in psychiatric crisis from the jails, Emergency Room, and inpatient hospitals, data w ill be tracked and calculation of cost avoidance to the ER and jails will be maintained to substantia te the cost effectiveness of this alternative. Health Management Associates, in their March 2011 Impact of Proposed Budget Cuts to Community-Based Mental Health Services presented to the Texas Conf erence of Urban Counties, reported the average per day cost of community based services is $12 for adults and $13 for children, as compared to $401 for a State Hospital bed, $137 for a jail bed for an inmate with mental illness, and $986 for an emergency room vi sit. Camino Real anticipates that development of a mobile crisis outreach teams in the lo cal community will also reduce costs to other stakeholders involved in the cris is response system which includes the local sheriff's department and the judicial system. Relationship to other Projects: Camino Real is proposing one other project in Region 6. It is category 1.13 Development of behavioral health crisis stabi lization services as alternatives to hospitalization with Quality Improvement 3.IT-9.4 Right Care, Right Setting. The unique RHP # is 121990904.1.1 The proposed project for the development of Mo bile Crisis Outreach Teams compliments the proposal for development of cris is stabilization services and al lows for a strong continuum of care in the most cost effective environments. It relates to other projects in the region by addressing the ne ed for a local alternative for stabilization of crisis situations that are benign and are more appropriately addressed in a facility located within the service area. Hospital emer gency rooms, law enforcement personnel, jails, programs of the center and other affiliated agencies will have the capability to place individuals in this facility. This project will compliment other activities and will be a clear alternative to options that are costly, involve extended wait times for consumers, use great amounts of local resources and involve long tr avel distances for people th at are needing services. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: NON APPLICABLE Plan for Learning Collaborative: NON APPLICABLE 566 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Camino Real Community Services Project Valuation: Highest cost for stabilizati on services occur when crises escalate and require an inpatient/institutional solution due to lack of op tions in the local community. Mobile Crisis Outreach services create immediate alternatives to individuals who are in a mental health crisis and otherwise may be responded to by local Law Enforcement and taken to Emergency Departments. Cost avoidance is the basis for deve lopment of crisis mobile outreach teams in this region. This project valuation has taken into consideration: 1) Costs for both State operated and private Psychi atric Hospitals: EXAMPLE : $5,100 (avg. inpatient cost) X 100 individuals = $510,000 per year 2) Costs of Local Emergency Department Vis its: EXAMPLE: $996 ED cost X 100 individuals = $99,600 per year 3) Cost of local Judicial systems 4) Cost of local City and County law enforcemen t systems both in their intervention activity as well as the provision of transportation for consumers needing treatment. The implementation of a local mobile crisis outre ach teams will result in significant cost savings to various entities locally and at the state and fe deral levels through basic cost avoidance. Health Management Associates, in their March 2011 Impact of Proposed Budget Cuts to Community-Based Mental Health Services presented to the Texas Conf erence of Urban Counties, reported the average per day cost of community based services is $12 for adults and $13 for children, as compared to $401 for a State Hospital bed, $137 for a jail bed for an inmate with mental illness, and $986 for an emergency room vi sit.

CHCS provides behavioral health services and treatment to children, adolescents and adults. Intervention(s) : CHCS seeks to establish a residential crisis and respite center for children with severe emotional disturbance that will include a total of 16 beds, eight reserved for children in crisis and eight for children whose families require a brief respite from the overwhelming, 24-hour per day resp onsibilities of deliv ering care. The avai lability of this new community resource will enable children to reach and maintain their highest level of functioning while minimizing further crisis and hospitalization. In the crisis service component, children will receive comprehensiv e psychiatric assessment and treatment as needed to restore stability as well as resi dential care, e.g., meals, nursing care, etc. Children in the respite care se rvice component will receive residential care, psychiatric treatment and support as needed. A primary care physician will be available to conduct routine diagnostic work ups and check for developmental disabilities and other co- occurring conditions. When appropriate, children served in either the crisis or respite components will be connected to commun ity based outpatient care through CHCS' Children's Mental Health Services pr ogram and/or Early Childhood Intervention services. The assignment of Family Partners fr om CHCS will be a critical ingredient to the success of this approach as they ha ve the experience and empathy required to effectively connect families to resources and support positive parenting and decision-making. Need for the project : Children with serious emotiona l disturbance, especially those involved with multiple systems (juvenile pr obation, schools, child welfare), and those with developmental disabilities and delays (including those where those disabilities or delays are attributed to their mothers use of substances while they were in utero) often experience periods of crisis and require speciali zed supports if they are to regain stability and avert longer-term placement. The significant requirements of delivering care to these children can be draining to thei r families and can result in in adequate care or even abuse or neglect. Bexar County does not currently ha ve a facility designed to deliver needed supports to children in crisis or their families. Target population : Children with serious emotional disturbance. Based upon current service statistics, it is anticipated that 44% will be indigent and uninsured and 46% will be covered by Medicaid.. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project seeks to rea lize an increase in the utilization of appropriate cris is and respite alternatives in DY4 and in DY5. The project plans to serve 100 children in its first fu ll year of operation (DY4) and 150 in DY5, a 50% increase. Significant cost savings will resu lt from community-based care in lieu of 563 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services inpatient or emergency care as well as better ED appropriate utilization. Category 3 outcomes: IT-9.2 Our first goal is to achie ve an improvement, in appropriate utilization of crisis services. IT-5.1 Our sec ond goal is to achieve a 5% cost savings as a direct result of efficient care delivery. Project Description: The Center for Health Care Services (CHCS) seeks to establish a residential crisis and respite center for children with severe emoti onal disturbance. The center would include a total of 16 beds, eight reserved for children in crisis and eight for children whose families require a brief respite from the overwhe lming, 24-hour per day responsibilities of delivering care. The availability of this new community resource will enable children to reach and maintain their highest level of f unctioning while minimizing further crisis and hospitalization. Children in th e crisis service component will receive comprehensive psychiatric assessment and treatment as needed to restore stability as well as residential care, e.g., meals, nursing care, etc. Children in the respite care service component will receive residential ca re, psychiatric treatment and s upport as needed. A primary care physician will be available to conduct r outine diagnostic work ups and check for developmental disabilities and other co -occurring conditions. When developmental disabilities are diagnosed, the child also will be connected to the Early Childhood Intervention program. Finally, all children served in either the crisis or respite components will be connected to commun ity based outpatient care through CHCS' Children's Mental Health Services program . The assignment of Family Partners to families accessing services from the center will be a critical ingredient to the success of this approach as they have the experience and empathy required to effectively connect families to resources and support pos itive parenting and decision-making. Another critical component of the new program will be the availability of comprehensive assessment services. Evidence-based pediatric diagnostic tools will be used to develop a precise diagnosis and to advise the types of services that will benefit the child, e.g., residential placement or outpatient care. It is anticipated that the new center will meet a wide variety of needs ranging from children in active crisis who may or may not have a psychiatric diagnosis to those who are l eaving longer-term hospita lization and require step-down care or to families who need a br eak from their child's care requirements. The availability of this new resource also is expected to divert ch ildren from further involvement with or referral to Bexar C ounty Juvenile Probation or Child Protective Services. Goals . Establish a single location offering a con tinuum of care for child ren with acute or chronically severe behavioral h ealth needs. Use the center as a site for training staff from a variety of disciplines to incr ease the availability of pediat ric specialists with behavioral health competencies. Challenges addressed by the project . Children with serious emotional disturbance, especially those involved with multiple sy stems (juvenile probation, schools, child welfare), and those with developmental disabi lities and delays (including those where those disabilities or delays are attributed to their mothers use of substances while they were in utero) often experience periods of cr isis and require specia lized supports if they are to regain stability and avert longer-t erm placement. The significant requirements of delivering care to these children can be dr aining to their families and can result in inadequate care or even abuse or neglect. Bexar County does not curr ently have a facility 563 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services designed to deliver needed supports to ch ildren in crisis or their families. 5-year expected outcomes for CHCS . 1) Development of Residential Crisis/Respite Center for Children and Adolescents in Bexar County. 2) Expanded hours of operation for crisis services.3) Expande d respite home providers. 5-year expected outcomes for persons served by the project .1) Improved access and availability to crisis services for chil dren and adolescents through extended hours of operation for nights/weekends 2) Reduced wa iting time during a psychiatric crisis. 3) Reduced inpatient admissions for children and adolescents in crisis . 4) Diversion from referrals to juvenile justice and child welfar e for children and adolescents with behavioral health issues during a psychiatric crisis. Relation to Regional Goals . As there are no similar services available to Bexar County children and their families, the proposed Bexar CARES Crisis and Respite Center will support the regional goal of \"Improving the in frastructure for delivery of behavioral health services\". It also meets the CMS th ree part aim, by improving population care with increased patient satisfaction by filling an ex isting gap in care and improving the existing behavioral health infrastructure t better se rve Medicaid and uninsure d children in Bexar County in individualized and patient centered settings. Th e program offers step down care for children discharged fr om hospitals and establishes a coordinated care delivery system and step-down care. D) The program will reduce hospital re-admissions, which will improve outcomes while containing cost growth . Starting Point/Baseline: This is a new project. There are currently 0 clients served. However, the Children's Mobile Outreach Team (CMOT) responded to 6 15 crisis calls for ch ildren during the last nine months of Program Year 2012. Rationale: The project option (1.13.1 Develop and implemen t crisis stabilization services to address the identified gaps in the current community crisis system), process milestone (P-3 Develop implementation plans for needed crisis services and P-6 Evaluate and continuously improve crisis services) and improvement milestone (I-12 Utilization of appropriate crisis alternativ es) were selected in correspondence to existing, unmet community needs for children's crisis and resp ite services. The current service continuum for children does not include e ither crisis or respite care services, both of which are known to prevent re-admission. This project builds upon existing and planned behavioral health system enhancements and will a ssist Bexar County in developing crisis alternatives, which will redu ce utilization of emergency departments and preventable inpatient stays. Project Components: Through the developmen t of the Crisis stabilization unit we propose to meet all required project components. a) Convene community stakeholders who can support the development of crisis stabilization servic es to conduct a gap analysis of the current community crisis system and de velop a specific action pl an that identifies specific crisis stabilization services to a ddress identified gaps. b) Analyze the current system of crisis stabilization services avai lable in the community including capacity of each service, current utilization patterns, eligib ility criteria and discharge criteria for each service. c) Assess the behavioral health n eeds of patients curren tly receiving crisis services in the jails, EDs, or psychiatric hospitals. Determine th e types and volume of services needed to resolve crisis in community -based settings. By developing this crisis 563 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services stabilization unit dedicated to children and adolescents. We will be able to baseline and assess health needs and begin to set up a sy stem for delivery of care and determine needed types and volume of services. d) E xplore potential crisis alternative service models and determine acceptable and feas ible models for implementation. Although there are no similar services in this comm unity we will explore other models offered throughout the country. e) Review the interven tion(s) impact on access to and quality of behavioral health crisis stabi lization services and identify \"lessons learned,\" opportunities to scale all or part of the in tervention(s) to a broader pati ent population, and identify key challenges associated with expansion of the intervention(s) including special considerations for safety-net populations. With this being a new service we will be able to assess barriers, risks, and opportunities and document this as lessons learned whereby implementing necessary changes to ensure ac cess and quality of services are maximized. Unique community need identificati on numbers the project addresses: CN.1 - Texas ranks last in the nation on h ealth care quality. RHP 6 is challenged to deliver improved quality and patient satisfaction. CN.4 There is a shortage of high quality mental and behavioral health services that are integrated with physical health care servi ces and/or provide crisis stabilization. The proposed project will positively impact i ssues identified by University Health System as the Mental and Behavioral Hea lth Unique needs iden tification numbers: 1. Inadequate and fragmented continuum of car e for children with behavioral health diagnoses. 2) Inadequate access to care ma nagement and resource navigation. 3) How the Project represents a new initiative or significantly enhances an existing delivery system reform initiative: New initiative. Related initiatives funded by U. S. Department of HHS. None. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-9 Right Care, Right Setting IT-9.2 ED appropria te utilization 1) OD-5 Cost of care, IT-5.1 Improved cost savings: demonstrate cost savings in care delivery. Reasons/rationale for select ing the outcome measures: These measures are indicative of children fi nding the right care in an easily accessed setting, which will diminish crises, improve behavioral health status, reduce the inappropriate use of emergency depa rtments and reduce cost of care. Relationship to other Projects: There is one related project proposed for implementation in RHP 6: establishment of a children's mental health emer gency room in Bexar County (1.12). It is unclear whether this is a supportive service for the Crisis Respite Center. A new treatment project for children with ADHD is being proposed for RHP 6 (2.15). Because the Crisis Respite Center will include services for children w ith both a serious emo tional disturbance and a developmental disability, it is possible that the children served in the new ADHD project will also receive services from the Crisis Respite Center. CHCS will coordinate service availability and innovative ways of meeting th e shared target population's needs with the Performing Provider. 563 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Clarity is proposing establishment of the Children's Mental Hea lth Emergency Room. CHCS will join Clarity in any University He alth System-organized learning collaborative dedicated to sharing best pract ices and service solutions for children's mental health. If there is a collaboration o pportunity with the ADHD proj ect proposed by UTHSCSA, CHCS will join key UTHSCSA staff in any learning community organized by University Health System. Plan for Learning Collaborative: CHCS will participate in any and all re levant learning collaborative organized by University Health System. Project Valuation: The value for this project is $1,998,596 fo r DY 2 and $8,809,554 for all years. By DY5, the project proposes to serve 150 children in community-based crisis and respite care. The establishment of a Children's Crisis Respit e Center fills an existing gap in the local continuum of behavioral health care for chil dren. The availability of this new resource will ensure children in a behavioral health cr isis are stabilized, connected to systems of care that will support comm unity living and prevent or reduce costly, avoidable hospitalization, lengthy stays in institutions, further crises and the inappropriate use of emergency departments as well as providing respite for them and their families to prevent destabilization. This also will be a crit ical resource and a new option for police departments, schools and child protective servic es, making it an alternative to more costly and restrictive institutio nal care. CHCS has a significant amount of existing infrastructure from which this project can be launched; only site preparation is re quired; thereby driving down the required investment and increasing th e cost effectiveness of the approach. The annual value of benefits provided to thos e served at full implementation considered several factors in valuing this project such as reducing costs at hospitals, costs for emergency detention and use of psychiatric in stitutions. This information was based on extensive literature as well as a valuation st udy completed and prepared by professors of the Houston School of Public health and of the UT Austin Center for Social Work Research that was based on the cost utility mode l, usage of extensive literature of similar interventions, costs savings and health outcomes related to th ose interventions. The annual value of benefits provided to those served at full implementation was calculated by multiplying the annual value of a single successful intervention by five. The rationale for selection of a multiplier of five was that to overcome resistance to change in a hard-to-serve population, both in the deliver y and payment systems, five years of benefits would be needed. This assumption was verified as valid after an extensive literature review. Cost-utility analysis (CUA) also was used to measure the cost of the program in dollars and the health consequences in utility-weighted units. This valuation uses a quality- adjusted life-years (QALYs) analysis that combin es health quality (uti lity) with length of time in a particular health state. Cost-utility analysis is a useful tool for assessing the value of new health service interventions because it provide s a standard way of valuing multiple types of interventions and programs. The valuation also incorporates costs 563 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services averted when known (e.g., emergency room visits that are avoided). In order to make the valuations fair across different types of interventions, the common health goal, or outcome, is the number of life-years added. The CUA calculations indicate that the avai lability of a dedicated Children's Crisis Respite Center has the potential to increase QALY among those it serves. 569 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services 137251808.1.1 PASS 1 1.13.1 1.13.1.

CHCS provides behavioral health services and treatment to children, adolescents and adults. Intervention(s) : The Center For Health Care Services (CHCS) seeks to expand access to mental health services in Bexar County. This will include: new clinic al locations, longer service hours and evening and weekend c overage at new and existing locations; utilization of a behavioral health care manager model to align case management and wellness education with treatment services to more rapidly imp rove outcomes; and increased training opportunities to support th e expanded workforce needs. Telemedicine will be used in the near term to augment th e available behavioral health workforce until such time as the number of skilled clinicians increases. Finally, a Psychiatric Urgent Care Clinic will be opened to dispense medications and connect consumers in crisis to durable community-based care. Services available from the clinics will incl ude psychiatry, labs and medication, mental health treatment anc illary to psychiatric care, peer recovery services, and substance abuse counseling and treatment for individuals with co-occurring disorders. All new facilities will be locat ed in Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas, per the U.S. Health Resources and Se rvices Administration. This project is in direct response to significant gaps identif ied in community needs assessments and other planning documents that have verified the insu fficiency of outpatient care for the target population. Improved access to care reduces symptomology and crises and improves functioning, which are known correlates to impr oved quality of life, greater retention in and compliance with care recommendations, and cost reductions attributable to unnecessary utilization of acute and sub-acute services. Need for the project : Resource limitations for outpatie nt psychiatric care in Bexar County, triggered by state funding cuts, have greatly diminished access to needed services, especially for persons with severe and persistent mental illness, the elderly and adults with co-occurring mental illness and s ubstance abuse disorders. Also, state funds must only be used for priority populations , i.e., persons diagnosed with severe depression, schizophrenia or bi -polar disorder. Individuals with diagnoses that do not meet one of these classifications, e.g., majo r depression, anxiety diso rders, post-traumatic stress disorder, are forced to wait for car e and, when their symptoms escalate beyond their capacity for self-managem ent, most are reliant upon urgent or acute care from the most costly providers, e.g., emergency depart ments, hospitals. Many of these individuals cannot maintain their stabili ty through available res ources and do not get their medications refilled or managed in a c onsistent manner, further triggering de- compensation and the need for acute care. Target population : Adults with severe and persistent mental illness, substance abuse 569 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services disorders and/or co-occurring disorders. Ba sed upon current servic e statistics, it is anticipated that 46% of those served will be indigent and uninsured and 50% will be covered by Medicaid. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project seeks to re alize a 20% increase or 7,002 individuals from a baseline of 5,835 in the utilization of community behavioral health care services in DY4, and a 30% or 1,750 increase in DY5 with an overall goal of 7,585 utilizing community behavioral healthcare. Category 3 outcomes: IT-10.1. Our goal is to demonstrate improvement in quality of life (QOL) scores for DYs 4 and 5. Project Description: The Center For Health Care Services (CHC S) seeks to expand access to mental health services in Bexar County. This will include both new clini cal locations, longer service hours and evening and weekend coverage at new and existing locati ons, utilization of a behavioral health care manager model to a lign case management and wellness education with treatment services to more rapidl y improve outcomes, and increased training opportunities to support the expa nded workforce needs. Also, telemedicine will be used in the near term to augment the available be havioral health workforce until such time as the number of skilled clinicians increases.

All new facilities will be locat ed in Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas, per the U.S. Health Resour ces and Services Administration. Goals . Improve access to behavioral health car e and reduce unnecessary hospitalizations resulting from lengthy waiting lists for care. Increase utilization of community behavioral health services, reducing in appropriate use significantly more costly care, i.e., institutional and crisis care. Challenges addressed by the project . Resource limitations for out patient psychiatric care in Bexar County, triggered by state funding cu ts, have greatly diminished access to needed services, especially for persons with severe and persistent mental illness, the elderly and adults with co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse disorders. Also, state funds must only be used for priority popul ations, i.e., persons diagnosed with severe depression, schizophrenia or bi -polar disorder. Individuals with diagnoses that do not meet one of these classifications, e.g., majo r depression, anxiety diso rders, post-traumatic stress disorder, are forced to wait for car e and, when their symptoms escalate beyond their capacity for self-managem ent, most are reliant upon urgent or acute care from the most costly providers, e.g., emergency depart ments, hospitals. Many of these individuals cannot maintain their stabili ty through available res ources and do not get their medications refilled or managed in a c onsistent manner, further triggering de- compensation and the need for acute care. 5-year expected outcomes for CHCS . 1) New outpatient clinic site developed in downtown the San Antonio \"Corridor of Ca re\" offering integrated behavioral and primary health care. 2) New urgent care medication management clinic services. 3) Expanded hours access for psychiatric and relate d clinical services to include evenings and weekends. 569 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services 5-year expected outcomes for persons served by the project . Improved access to services, including: a) Significantly reduced waiting time for physician appointments. Currently, new ps ychiatric evaluation appointments are scheduled 10-14 weeks from date of intake . Reduced waiting times will improve patient satisfaction and reduce adverse outcomes cause d by the lack of timely access to care. b) Improve compliance with scheduled appointment s. The new availability of evening and weekend hours will support consumers in ke eping appointments and accessing routine care. c) Urgent care for medication manage ment and related crisis resolution. Relation to Regional Goals . Expanding resource availability to address the dearth of outpatient mental health services is a ke y means of achieving the regional goal of \"Improving the infrastructure for delivery of be havioral health services \". It also meets the CMS three part aim, as follows. 1) The program fills an existing gap in care and improves the existing behavioral health infrastructure to better serve Medicaid and uninsured adults in Bexar County. 2) The pr ogram will support lasting community living and reduce hospital re-admissions, which will improve outcomes while containing cost growth . Starting Point/Baseline: The baseline for the proposed project is the number of adults served in CHCS' existing adult outpatient clinics (Harvard Place, Zarzamora, Northwest) in FY 2012, or 5,835. Rationale: The project option (1.12.1 Establ ish extended operating hours at a select number of Local Mental Health Center clinic s or other community-based setting in areas of the State where access to care is like ly to be limited Expand the number of community based settings where behavioral health services ma y be delivered in unders erved areas), process milestones (P-3 Develop administrative protoc ols and clinical guidelines for projects selected and P-6 Establish behavioral health services in new community-based settings in underserved areas) and improvement milestone (I-11 Increased utiliz ation of community behavioral healthcare) were selected in correspondence to existing, unmet community needs for outpatient care and treatment. Po sitive behavioral h ealth outcomes are contingent upon the availability of the consumer to obtain services as soon as possible after a need has been identified. However, ad ults with mental illnesses who are reliant upon public mental health services often face significant wait times before they can access care, e.g., the wait for a psychiatric examination currently averages 14 weeks. Waiting for care can be especially detrimental to the target populati on, who may be easily discouraged and opt out of car e seeking, worsening symptoms and heightening functional loss. The project also seeks to expand the availabi lity of appropriate, credentialed mental health professionals to provide optimal tr eatment to the target population. A March 2011 report published by the Hogg Foundation for Mental Health and Methodist Healthcare Ministries warns the most severe health pr ofession shortages are in mental health services, with Texas ranking far below the na tional average in number of mental health professional per 100,000 residents. Further, le ss than 33% of the state's 48,700 practicing doctors accept Medicaid patients and nearly every county in RHP 6 is designated as a 569 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services Health Provider Shortage Area for mental he alth. Inadequate mental health services results in avoidable costs to hospital and criminal a nd juvenile justice systems.47 Project Components: Through expansion of outpatient capacity, we propose to meet all required project components. a) Evaluate existing transp ortation programs and ensure that transportation to and from medical appoi ntments is made available outside of normal operating hours. If transportation is a si gnificant issue in care access, develop and implement improvements as part of larger proj ect. b) Review the intervention(s) impact on access to behavioral health services and identify \"lessons lear ned\" opportunities to scale all or part of the in tervention(s) to a broader pa tient population, and identify key challenges associated with expansion of the intervention(s), including special considerations for safety-net populations. Unique community need identificati on numbers the project addresses: CN.1 - Texas ranks last in the nation on h ealth care quality. RHP 6 is challenged to deliver improved quality and patient satisfaction. CN.4 There is a shortage of high quality mental and behavioral health services that are integrated with physical health care servi ces and/or provide crisis stabilization. More specifically, the propos ed project will also positiv ely impact the following: 1. Inadequate access to care mana gement and resource navigation 2. Inadequate services for individuals who have been arrested or incarcerated either as a result or precipitated by unmet behavioral health needs 3. Inadequate resources for special need s populations (e.g., homeless adults, sex offenders) including efficiencies such as integrated behavioral and primary care, pharmacy services, teleme dicine, and physician extenders 4. Inadequate outpatient care for adults w ith moderate acuity behavioral health needs to support reductions in hospita l readmissions and the inappropriate use of emergency departments How the Project represents a ne w initiative or significantly enhances an existing delivery system reform initiative: Significant enhan cement. Currently, our outpatient clinics are limited in location and hours. The initiativ e will improve access, reduce wait times and provide services where access to care is curr ently limited. As more adults are stabilized through consistent, timely outpatient care, their use of inappropriate cr isis services, i.e., emergency departments, will decrease.

Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-10 Quality of Life/Functional Status IT-10.1 Quality of Life. Reasons/rationale for selecting the outcome measures: This measure is indicative of consumer retention in care and enhanced st ability, both of which are critical means of reducing unnecessary hospita lizations and the inappropr iate use of emergency departments. 47 http://www.hogg.utexas.edu/uploads/documen ts/Mental_Health_Crisis_final_032111.pdf , accessed July 25, 2012. 569 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services Relationship to other Projects: The proposed project will address signif icant behavioral health care resource insufficiency in Bexar County. As such, it is an integral component of this County's health care infrastructure. A nother proposed project seeks to establish research-based care for a segment of the populati on of adults with mental illn ess. These resources will be coordinated with CHCS's proposed outpatient expansion, if appropria te, to build a more durable continuum of care. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: UTHSCA is proposing a potential ly similar project. CHCS will join any collaborative learning communities with UTHSCA or other pr oviders dedicated to serving adults with mental illness. Plan for Learning Collaborative: CHCS will participate in a ny and all relevant learning collaboratives organized by University Health System. Project Valuation: The value for this project is $3,997,191 for DY 2 and $17,619,107 for all years. By DY5, 7,585 adults with serious mental illness will receive outpatient behavioral health services every year. The expansion of Adult Outpatient Services will increase accessibility of behavioral health care and will ensure e xpedient treatment and rapid connection to systems of care that support community li ving and prevent or reduce costly, avoidable hospitalization, lengthy stays in institutions, further crises and the inappropriate use of emergency departments.

CHCS provides behavioral health services and treatment to children, adolescents and adults. Intervention(s) : The Center For Health Care Services (CHCS) seeks to establish crisis transitional residential options, up to 32 beds , for adults. Available service will include: 1) crisis respite and a con tinuum of care (e.g., psychiatri c care, medication management, nursing services, intensive case management, p eer support) for individuals with complex treatment issues, including those who are chronically mentally ill, homeless and alcohol or drug dependent and have chronic medical conditions; and, 2) transitional residential services, including medication assistance, support for activities of daily living and connection to supported housing and employment services, to assist individuals with complex treatment issues move to greater independence and community living. These new resources will provide the most appropria te, least restrictive care and are cost effective alternatives to longer-term hospita lization (on the front end) or subsequent, rapid re-hospitalization. The variety of available service options will enable individualized care in corres pondence to patient needs. Need for the project : Following crisis stabilization, adults with persistent mental illness often benefit from transitional or step- down care designed to s upport their effective adjustment to community living. There are no such resources in Bexar County, thereby hindering successful community reintegration and increasing the potential for cycling back into costly inpatient care. Target population : Adults with persistent mental illness. Based upon current service statistics, it is anticipated that 21% will be covered by Medicaid and 58% will be indigent and uninsured.. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project seeks to re alize a 20% increase or 270 individuals from a baseline of 1,353 in the utilization of appropriate crisis alternatives in DY4 and a 35% or a 475 increase in DY 5 that will access appropriate crisis care th rough the unit.

Available service will include: 1) crisis respite care and a continuum of services (e.g., psychiatric care, medication management, nursing services, intensive case management, p eer support) for individuals with complex treatment issues, including those who are chronically mentally ill, homeless and alcohol or drug dependent and have chronic medical conditions; and, 2) transitional residential services, including medication assistance, support for activities of daily living and 575 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services connection to supported housing employment servi ces, to assist indivi duals with complex treatment issues move to greater inde pendence and community living. These new resources will provide the most appropriate, le ast restrictive care and are cost effective alternatives to longer-term hos pitalization (on the front end) or subsequent, rapid re- hospitalization. The variety of av ailable service options will enable individualized care in correspondence to patient needs. The Crisis Transitional Residential Services ap proach meets an identified need for high acuity, secure beds and will enable the more ef ficient use of scarce inpatient psychiatric care. Special, high-risk populations, e.g., se x offenders, ex-offenders, could be assisted without compromising public safety. Goals: Reduce the per capita cost of care and improve health outcomes, including lengthening time spent living productively in th e community, of patients with significant behavioral health needs a nd frequent hospitalizations . Reduce potential hospital readmissions among a target ed post-acute population. Challenges addressed by the project . Following crisis stabilizati on, adults with persistent mental illness often benefit from transitional or step-down care designed to support their effective adjustment to community living. Th ere are no such resources in Bexar County, thereby hindering successful community rein tegration and increasi ng the potential for cycling back into costly inpatient care. 5-year expected outcomes for CHCS . 1) Development of new Crisis Transitional Services for adults in Bexar County. 2) Expanded hour s of operation for crisis services. 3) Expanded crisis transitional options. 5-year expected outcomes for persons served by the project . The proposed new alternative crisis services will expand opportun ities available to individuals with serious mental illness, increasing the number accessing appropriate care by 35% in DY5. Accessing appropriate care will improve treat ment compliance and retention in care and will support a stronger, more durable tran sition into the community after extended hospitalization. Other related outcomes include : 1) Improved access and availability to crisis services for adults through extended hours of opera tion for nights/weekends and assistance with crisis transportation. 2) Re duced waiting time during a psychiatric crisis. 3) Reduced potentially avoidable re-admissi ons for adults. 4) Diversion from emergency departments. 5) Availability of new step-down care. Relation to Regional Goals . As there are no similar services available to Bexar County residents, the proposed Crisis Transitional Re sidential Services support the regional goal of \"Improving the infrastructure for delivery of behavioral hea lth services\". It also meets the CMS three part aim, as follows. The program enables and ensures individualized, patient-centered care. The program fills an existing gap in care and improves the existing behavioral health infrastructure to better serve Medicaid a nd uninsured adults in Bexar County. The program offers step down care for indi viduals discharged from hospitals and supports their re-integration into daily living, thereby establishing a coordinated care delivery system . The program will support lasting community living and reduce hospital re- admissions, which will improve outcomes while containing cost growth . 575 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services Starting Point/Baseline: CHCS currently operates a 16-bed crisis tr ansitional unit. The proposed facility and project will serve a different a nd more complex target population. Rationale: The project option (1.13.1 Develop and implemen t crisis stabilization services to address the identified gaps in the current community crisis system), process milestone (P-3 Develop implementation plans for needed crisis services and P-6 Evaluate and continuously improve crisis services) and improvement milestone (I-12 Utilization of appropriate crisis alternativ es) were selected in correspondence to existing, unmet community needs for crisis services. Specifi cally, the crisis continuum does not contain after-care or step-down servic es that are known to support community re-integration or assimilation post-hospitalization and prev ent re-admission. This project builds upon existing and planned behavioral health sy stem enhancements and will assist Bexar County in developing crisis alternatives, which will reduce utilization of emergency departments and preventable inpatient stays. Project Components: Through the Crisis Transitional Residential Services, we propose to meet all required project components. a) Convene comm unity stakeholder who can support the development of crisis stabili zation services to conduct a gap analysis of the current community crisis system and develop a specific action plan that identifies specific crisis stabilization services to address identified ga ps. b) Analyze the current system of crisis stabilization services available in the co mmunity including capacity of each service, current utilization patterns, eligibility criteria and discharge criteria for each service. c) Assess the behavioral health needs of patients currently receiving crisis services in the jails, EDs, or psychiatric hos pitals. Determine the types an d volume of services needed to resolve crisis in community-based settings. By developing this cr isis stabilization unit dedicated to children and adolescents. We will be able to baseline and assess health needs and begin to set up a system for delivery of care and determine needed types and volume of services. d) Explore potential crisis alternative service models and determine acceptable and feasible models for impleme ntation. Although there are no similar services in this community we will explor e other models offered throughout the country. e) Review the intervention(s) impact on access to and quality of behavioral health crisis stabilization services and identify \"lessons le arned,\" opportunities to scale all or part of the intervention(s) to a broader patient popul ation, and identify key challenges associated with expansion of the intervention(s) includ ing special considerations for safety-net populations. With this being a new service we will be able to assess barriers, risks, and opportunities and document this as lessons learned whereby implementing necessary changes to ensure access and quali ty of services are maximized. Unique community need identification numbers the project addresses: CN.1 - Texas ranks last in the nation on h ealth care quality. RHP 6 is challenged to deliver improved quality and patient satisfaction. CN.4 There is a shortage of high quality mental and behavioral health services that are integrated with physical health care servi ces and/or provide crisis stabilization. 575 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services More specifically, the propos ed project will positively impact the following issues: 1. Inadequate access to care mana gement and resource navigation 2. Inadequate resources for special need s populations (e.g., homeless adults, sex offenders) including efficiencies such as integrated behavioral and primary care, pharmacy services, teleme dicine, and physician extenders 3. Inadequate outpatient care for adults w ith moderate acuity behavioral health needs to support reductions in hospita l readmissions and the inappropriate use of emergency departments How the Project represents a ne w initiative or significantly enhances an existing delivery system reform initiative: New initiative. Related initiatives funded by U. S. Department of HHS. None. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-3 Potentially Preventable Re-admissions Reasons/rationale for selec ting the outcome measures: This measure is indicative of adults finding the right care in an easily accessed setting, which will diminish crises, improve behavioral health status, reduce the inappropriate use of emergency departments and reduce cost of care. Relationship to other Projects: There are no similar services proposed in RHP 6. As such, the Crisis Transitional Residential Services project wi ll fill a critical gap in Bexa r County's behavioral health continuum of care. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: There are no simila r projects proposed. Plan for Learning Collaborative: CHCS will participate in any and all re levant learning collaborative organized by University Health System. Project Valuation: The value for this project is $1,598,877 fo r DY 2 and $7,047,642 for all years. By DY5, 475 adults will receive appropria te crisis care each year from the proposed project. The establishment of a Crisis Transitional Residential Services program fills an existing gap in the local continuum of behavioral health care for adults with mental illness. The availability of this new resource will ensure the target population of high need adults is stabilized, connected to con tinuity care to support comm unity living and prevent or reduce costly, avoidable hospita lization, lengthy stays in inst itutions, further crises and the inappropriate use of emergency depart ments. CHCS has a significant amount of existing infrastructure from which this project can be launched; only site preparation is required; thereby driving down the require d investment and increasing the cost effectiveness of the approach. The annual value of benefits provided to thos e served at full implementation considered 575 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services several factors in valuing this project such as reducing costs at hospitals, costs for emergency detention and use of psychiatric in stitutions. This information was based on extensive literature as well as a valuation st udy completed and prepared by professors of the Houston School of Public health and of the UT Austin Center for Social Work Research that was based on the cost utility mode l, usage of extensive literature of similar interventions, costs savings and health outcomes related to th ose interventions. The annual value of benefits provided to those served at full implementation was calculated by multiplying the annual value of a single successful intervention by five. The rationale for selection of a multiplier of five was that to overcome resistance to change in a hard-to-serve population, both in the deliver y and payment systems, five years of benefits would be needed. This assumption was verified as valid after an extensive literature review. Cost-utility analysis (CUA) also was used to measure the cost of the program in dollars and the health consequences in utility-weighted units. This valuation uses a quality- adjusted life-years (QALYs) analysis that combin es health quality (uti lity) with length of time in a particular health state. Cost-utility analysis is a useful tool for assessing the value of new health service interventions because it provide s a standard way of valuing multiple types of interventions and programs. The valuation also incorporates costs averted when known (e.g., emergency room visits that are avoided). In order to make the valuations fair across different types of interventions, the common health goal, or outcome, is the number of life-years added. The CUA calculations indicate that the availabi lity of a dedicated Crisis Transitional Unit will provide a cost effective alternativ e to current over-reliance on emergency departments and providers of tertiary care and also has the potential to increase QALY among those it serves. 575 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services 137251808.1.3 PASS 1 1.13.1 1.13.1.

CHCS provides behavioral health services and treatment to children, adolescents and adults. Intervention(s) : The Center For Health Care Services (CHCS) seeks to establish a centralized, accessible campus from which systems or familie s can obtain care for children and adolescents (0 to 17 years old) with a seri ous emotional and/or be havioral problem or developmental delays. Services will include: comprehensive treatm ent planning, wraparound care, mental health interventions, coordination of car e among all interested systems (sc hools, juvenile justice, child protective services), substance abuse counseling, group couns eling for children, parents or caregivers and siblings, recreat ional therapy, ROPES course, connection to in-home services (occupational therapy, physical therapy, nutritio nal counseling, medicatio n education, in-home nursing care), therapeutic foster care, and diversion services for youth involved with the juvenile justice system. Also, an on-site model classroom and learning lab will as sist children with the transition to school environments and will suppor t their academic achievement. And safe rooms and relaxation areas will be available for a ll ages, making the campus a trusted and valued resource for children and their families. To fac ilitate service coordinati on, staff from all child- serving systems, i.e., schools, juvenile probati on, child protective services, Medicaid, sexual abuse services, will have on-site representatives. As a result of the proposed project, in DY2, c linical operations will be manualized to enhance efficiency and accessibility to coordinated car e. In DY3, the new and expanded campus will open. In DY4, the number of Bexar County ch ildren utilizing coordinating community behavioral health services will increase wher eby in DY5, the volume of Bexar County children utilizing coordinating community behavioral he alth services will continue to increase. Need for the project : Families of children with serious emotional disturbance, especially those involved with multiple systems (juvenile probati on, schools, child welfare), and those with developmental disabilities and delays (including those where those disabilities or delays are attributed to their mothers use of substances wh ile they were in utero) have difficulty accessing coordinated care. In the absence of a single site from which multi-faceted, multi-partner care is available, families often have to work with four or more entities and these entities often do not communicate with one another or efficiently share information. Target population : Children with serious emotional dist urbance. Based upon current service statistics, it is anticipated that 45% will be i ndigent and uninsured and 35% will be covered by Medicaid. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project seeks to increase utilization of community-behavioral healthcare. In DY4 an initia l baseline of 460 will be served with a goal of 115 or 25% increase in access and utilization a nd in DY5 an increase of 230 or 50% of baseline will access and increase utiliza tion. The proposed project will serve approximately 805 children by end of DY5. Category 3 outcomes: IT-10.1 Quality of Life. Our goal for improvement in quality of life will 581 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services be determined in Year 4. Project Description: The Center For Health Care Services (CHCS) s eeks to establish a centralized, accessible campus from which systems or families can obtain care fo r children and adolescents (0 to 17 years old) with a serious emotional and/or behavioral problem or developmental delay. Services will include: comprehensive treatment planning, wr aparound care, mental health interventions, coordination of care among all in terested systems (schools, juve nile justice, child protective services), substance abuse couns eling, group counseling for children, parents or caregivers and siblings, recreational therapy, ROPES course, connection to in -home services (occupational therapy, physical therapy, nutri tional counseling, medication e ducation, in-home nursing care), therapeutic foster care, and di version services for youth involved with the juvenile justice system. Also, an on-site model classroom and lear ning lab will assist childr en with the transition to school environments and will support thei r academic achievement. And safe rooms and relaxation areas will be available for all ages, making the campus a trusted and valued resource for children and their families. To facilitate service coordinati on, staff from all child-serving systems, i.e., schools, juvenile probation, child protective services, Medicaid, sexual abuse services, will have on-site representatives. The Center for Health Care Services will fill an existing void in Bexar County by becoming the community's primary resource regarding children's mental health. Families will be able to visit the new campus to obtain information about th eir children's mental health and available treatment options. Older youth w ill engage in scheduled and or ganized peer activities and community service projects, a new opportunity for most. Family Partners will be available to help parents and other caregive rs identify resources designed to assist their children and strengthen their parenting skill s. Parents will attend regularly scheduled training classes in becoming an effective advocate fo r their children. School staff and other community providers will be invited to specialized professional deve lopment opportunities regarding children's mental health and the evidence-based pr actices that are available. Special populations also will be served. For example, children with developmental disabilities and a mental health diagnosis will be able to receive single-site occupational and physical therapy and continuity care af ter they age-out of the Early Childhood Intervention system. Also, children leaving the crisis and respite cente r or longer-term hospita lization will have the opportunity to continue tr eatment at the campus. Goals . Establish a single location o ffering a continuum of care fo r children with behavioral health needs. Use the campus as a site for training staff from a variety of disciplines to increase the availability of pediatric specialists with behavioral health competencies. Challenges addressed by the project . Families of children with serious emotional disturbance, especially those involved with multiple systems (juvenile probation, schools, child welfare), and those with developmental disabilities and delays (including those where disa bilities or delays are attributed to their mothers use of substances wh ile they were in utero) have difficulty accessing coordinated care. In the absence of a single site from which multi-faceted, multi-partner care is available, families often have to work with four or more entities and these entities often do not communicate with one another or efficiently share information. 5-year expected outcomes for CHCS . 1) Development of Children' s Behavioral Health Campus. 2) Expanded hours of operation for services. 3) E xpanded continuum of services for children and adolescents and their caregivers. 4) Integration of Behavioral H ealth and Primary Health Care. 5-year expected outcomes for persons served by the project . 1) Improved quality of life and 581 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services functioning for children at school and at home. 2) Integration of primary care services into behavioral health setting so beha vioral health services are an in tegral part of overall healthcare for children and adolescents. 3) Development of a continuum of care to include services and supports to help caregivers impr ove their abilities to successfully parent children and adolescents with behavioral health issues. 4) Establish comprehensive mental health services for children and adolescents including opportunitie s to connect to peers with similar experiences to promote improved family functioning and the ability to remain in their own home and community. Relation to Regional Goals . Expanding resource availability to address the dearth of children's mental health services is a key means of achieving the regional goal of \"Improving the infrastructure for delivery of beha vioral health services\". It also meets the CMS three part aim, as follows. The program fills an existing gap in care and improves the existing behavioral health infrastructure to better serve Medicaid and uninsured children in Bexar County. The program will meet children's needs in an outpatient setting, which will reduce crisis and the need for hospital admissions and will improve outcomes while containing cost growth . Starting Point/Baseline: Children's Mental Health currently is funded to serve 460 children per year. Rationale: The project option (1.12.2 Expand the number of community based settings where behavioral health services may be deliver ed in underserved areas), process milestones (P-3 Develop administrative protocols and clinic al guidelines for projects select ed and P-6 Establish behavioral health services in new comm unity-based settings in underserved areas) and improvement milestone (I-11 Increased utiliz ation of community behavioral healthcare) were selected in correspondence to existing, unmet community need s for children's outpatient mental health services. Project Components: There are no pr oject components for this option. Unique community need identification numbers the project addresses: CN.1 - Texas ranks last in the nation on hea lth care quality. RHP 6 is challenged to deliver improved quality a nd patient satisfaction. CN.4 There is a shortage of high quality mental and behavioral health services that are integrated with physical health care servic es and/or provide cr isis stabilization. More specifically, the proposed project will positively impact the following issues: Inadequate and fragmented continuum of car e for children with behavioral health diagnoses. Inadequate access to care mana gement and resource navigation How the Project represents a new in itiative or significantly enhan ces an existing delivery system reform initiative: New initiative. Related initiatives funded by U.S. Department of HHS. CHCS does not receive direct HHS funding for the Children's Outpatient Clinic. State mental health block grant funding is received via Texas Department of State Health Services but is insufficient to meet current needs. The proposed new initiative also will significantly enhance and expand and existing delivery system of the Children's Outpatient Clinic. 581 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-10 Quality of Life /Functional Status: IT-10.1 Quality of Life. Reasons/rationale for selecting the outcome measures: This measure is indicative of consumer retention in care and enhanced stabil ity, both of which are critical means of reducing unnecessary hospitalizations and the inappropriate use of emergency departments. Relationship to other Projects: There is one related project propos ed for implementation in RHP 6: establishment of a children's mental health emergency room in Bexar County. The children served in the emergency room could receive continuity care fr om CHCS from the proposed Ch ildren's Mental Health campus. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Clarity is proposing establishment of the Child ren's Mental Health Emergency Room. CHCS will join Clarity in any University Health Syst em-organized learning collaborative dedicated to sharing best practices and service solu tions for children's mental health. Plan for Learning Collaborative: CHCS will participate in any and all relevant learning collaborative organized by University Health System. Project Valuation: The value for this project is $1,758,764 for DY 2 and $7,752,406 for all years. By DY5, the proposed project will serve approximately 805 ch ildren per year. The expansion of Children's Mental Health increases accessibility of behavioral health care for children. The availability of this new resource will ensure children are treate d expediently, connected to systems of care that will support community living and prevent or reduce costly, a voidable hospitalization, lengthy stays in institutions, further crises and the in appropriate use of emergency departments.

CHCS provides behavioral health services and treatment to children, adolescents and adults. Intervention(s) : CHCS seeks to establish a comprehe nsive continuum of services, across the life span for individuals with co-occu rring intellectual developmental disability (IDD), mental illness and substance use diso rders. Services for individuals with co- occurring illnesses will include: medicat ion management, comprehensive treatment planning, wraparound care, mental health inte rventions, skills development through in- home or clinic based services for occupa tional therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, recreational therapy, and primary care acces s for routine medical services. Support services will be provided to caregivers by fa mily support specialists. Telemedicine may be used to deliver medication management se rvices to individuals with transportation challenges or whose disabilities prevent them fr om participating from clinic activities. To facilitate service coordination, wraparound care will be coordinated with staff from other systems also serving the IDD population, e .g., schools, Child and Adult Protective Services, Juvenile and Adu lt Probation, the local authority for IDD, and service providers. Finally, the addition of an on-site primary health care provider will give consumers access to integrated behavioral heal th and primary health care, increasing the possibility of treatment adherence. Continuity of care will be a primary focus for children with a dual diagnosis as they transition from Early Childhood Intervention Services. This clinic will be operated con tiguous to the Children's Outp atient Clinic to achieve maximum efficiencies. However, evidence ba sed practices demonstrate maximum benefit when these services are self-contained and adul ts served in this program do not interact with children served by the Outpatient Clinic. Need for the project : Individuals with IDD experien ce a full range of psychiatric disorders similar to the ge neral population; however, th e occurrence of adjustment, anxiety, and impulse-control disorders or the ne ed to complete a psychiatric consultation to rule them out, is higher. Individuals with dual diagnosis are frequently ostracized and often have limited support systems. Additiona lly, as they physically age out of childhood these individuals have difficulty adjusting to societal expectations of their physical age. Creating relationships with new providers and new care teams can be marked with anxiety, regression and acting out behavior s. Because of limited cognition, language skills, and social experiences as well as in creased stress and anxi ety related to overall functioning, it is critical that th is population be cared for in a continuum of care with the same team and as little change as possible in the team of experi enced professionals who can provide appropriate interv entions, i.e., the right care in the right setting including transitional support services fo r aging caregivers. However, interest lists for Medicaid Waiver programs dedicated to thes e services are 2 to 10 years long. 587 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services Target population : Children, adolescents and adults w ith an existing determination of IDD or an IQ below 70, adults and childre n on the Autism Spectrum, and children and adults with an existing DSM mental health di agnosis and either Autism or an IDD. Based upon current service statistics, it is anticipated that 10% will be indigent and uninsured and 74% will be covered by Medicaid. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project seeks to increase utilization of community behavioral healthcare for this dual diagnosis populat ion by increasing by 48 individuals (20%) in DY4 and 62 individuals 30% in DY5. Category 3 outcomes: IT-10.1 Our goal, which will be quantified in DY4, is to improve quality of life for the children and families we serve. Project Description: The Center For Health Care Services (CHCS) seeks to establish a centralized, accessible clinic for children and adolescents (0 to 17 years old) with a co -occurring intellectual developmental disability (IDD) and mental illness and expand services to adults with a similarly co-occurring intellectual developmen tal disability (IDD) and mental health diagnosis. Services for individuals with co-occurring illnesses will include: medication management, comprehensive treatment pl anning, wraparound care, mental health interventions, skills development through in-home or clinic based services for occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, recreational therapy, and primary care access for routine medical services. Support services will be provided to caregivers by family support specialists. Telemedicine may be used to deliver medication management services to indivi duals with transportation challenges. To facilitate service coordination, wraparound services will be coor dinated with staff from other systems also serving the IDD population, e.g., schools, Child and Adult Protective Services, Juvenile and Adult Probation, the local authority for IDD, and service providers. Finally, the addition of an on-site primary health care provider will give consumers access to integrated behavioral health and primary h ealth care, increasing treatment compliance. The population to be served will include children and adults with an existing determination of intellectual developmental disability (IDD) or an IQ below 70, adults and children on the Autism Spectrum, and ch ildren and adults with an existing DSM mental health diagnosis and either Autism or an intellectual developmental disability (IDD). Continuity of care will be a primary focus for children with a dual diagnosis who are transitioning out of Early Childhood Intervention (ECI) Services. Individuals with IDD experience a full range of psychiatric disorders similar to the general population; however, the occurrence of adjustment , anxiety, and impulse-control disorders or the need to comple te a psychiatric cons ultation to rule them out, is higher. These individuals reside in a range of settings, e.g., reside ntial facilities, group homes, supported living programs, and with family or friends, but public policy continues to promote the least restrictive setting with appr opriate medical and ment al health services. Individuals with dual diagnosis are frequently ostracized and often have limited support systems. As such, indicators of a mental health problem may be ignored or mistaken for \"acting out\". Because of limited cognition, language skills, and social experiences as well as increased stress and anxiety related to overall functioning, it is critical that this population be evaluated by experienced prof essionals who can provide appropriate interventions, i.e., the right care in the right setting. Goals . Increase access for children and adults with a dual diagnosis of mental illness and 587 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services intellectual developmental disability to a c ontinuum of co-located services, including psychiatric, medication evaluation and ma nagement, and primary health care. Challenges addressed by the project . Individuals with the dual diagnosis of mental illness and IDD typically have resided in institutiona l settings. Today, a growing number reside in the community, often with family, and rely on community resources for treatment; however, interest lists for Medi caid Waiver programs dedicated to these services are 2 to 10 years long. Effective mental health tr eatment for this popula tion requires two key components: 1) utilization of an interdisciplinary team aware of the complexity of mental health issues among individuals with IDD, including how symptoms can be masked by the behaviors intrinsic to the intellectual disa bility, and 2) routine in tegration of caregiver feedback, insights from those who know and understand the consumer the best and can accurately communicate sympto ms and daily functioning. 5-year expected outcomes for CHCS . 1) Expanded provision of dual diagnosis services. 2) Expanded hours of operation. 3) Effective c ontinuum of services for dually diagnosed children, adolescents, adults, a nd their caregivers. 4) Integr ated behavioral health and primary health care for indi viduals with dual diagnosis. 5-year expected outcomes for persons served by the project . 1) Increased access to services to promote improved functioning and the ability to remain in-home and community. 2) Improved physical and behavioral health as a result of integrated, single site primary care and behavioral health serv ices. 3) Development of a continuum of care that includes essential services and supports from a single site . 4) Improved quality of life and functioning. Relation to Regional Goals . Expanding resource availability to address the unmet needs of individuals with dual dia gnosis is a key means of achie ving the regional goal of \"Improving the infrastructure for delivery of be havioral health services \". It also meets the CMS three part aim, as follows. The program fills an existing gap in care and improves the existing behavioral health infrastructure to better serve Medi caid and uninsured children and adults in Bexar County. The program will meet the needs of dually diagnosed children and adults in an outpatient setting, which will reduce the need for hospital admissions and will improve outcomes while containing cost growth . Starting Point/Baseline: CHCS currently provides psychiatric serv ices to approximately 40 dually diagnosed clients per month. Rationale: The project option (1.12.2 Expand the number of community based settings where behavioral health services may be delivered in underserved areas), process milestones (P- 3 Develop administrative protocol s and clinical guidelines for projects selected and P-6 Establish behavioral health services in new community-based se ttings in underserved areas) and improvement milestone (I-11Miles tone: Increased utilization of community behavioral healthcare) were selected in correspondence to existing, unmet community needs for services to individuals with dual diagnosis of mental illness and intellectual developmental disability. The proposed project addresses the followi ng community need identification numbers: 587 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services CN.4 - Shortage of high quality mental and behavioral health services that are integrated with physical health care servic es and/or provide cr isis stabilization. More specifically, the proposed project will positively impact: Inadequate and fragmented continuum of car e for children with behavioral health diagnoses. Need for integrated behavioral health and primary care services. Inadequate resources for special needs popul ations, including efficiencies such as integrated behavioral and primary care, pharmacy services, telemedicine, and physician extenders. Inadequate outpatient care for adults with moderate acuity behavioral health needs to support reductions in hospital readmi ssions and the inappropriate use of emergency departments. How the Project represents a ne w initiative or significantly enhances an existing delivery system reform initiative: Expansi on of an existing initiative. Related initiatives funded by U.S. Departme nt of HHS. CHCS does not receive direct HHS funding for this program. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-10 Quality of Life /Functional Status IT-10.1 Quality of life Reasons/rationale for selecting the outcome measures: These measures are indicative of consumer retention in care and enhanced stability. Relationship to other Projects: There is one children's project proposed for implementation in RHP 6 that is related: establishment of a children's mental hea lth emergency room in Bexar County. The children served in the emergency room could receive continuity ca re from CHCS through the proposed Dual Diagnosis Program. CHCS's Adult Outpatient Services program also will be a referral source for dually di agnosed adults in their caseload. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Clarity is proposing establishment of the Children's Mental Hea lth Emergency Room. CHCS will join Clarity in any University He alth System-organized learning collaborative dedicated to sharing best pract ices and service solutions fo r children's mental health. Plan for Learning Collaborative: CHCS will participate in a ny and all relevant learning collaboratives organized by University Health System. 587 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services Project Valuation: The value for this project is $1,653,898 fo r DY 2 and $7,287,006 for all years. By DY5, 62 dually diagnosed patients will be receivi ng highly specialized pr oject services. The proposed expansion of a Dual Diagnosis clinic for children and adults with co-occurring mental illness and intellectual developmental disability will increa se accessibility of behavioral health care and will integrate primary care for this unique, underserved population. The availability of this expande d resource will ensure dually diagnosed children and adults are treated expediently, conn ected to systems of care that will support community living and prevent or reduce cost ly, avoidable hospita lization, lengthy stays in institutions, further crises and the inappr opriate use of emergency departments. CHCS has a significant amount of ex isting infrastructure from which this project can be launched and only site preparation is re quired; thereby driving down the required investment and increasing the cost effectiveness of the approach. The annual value of benefits provided to thos e served at full implementation considered several factors in valuing this project such as reducing costs at hospitals, costs for emergency detention and use of psychiatric in stitutions. This information was based on extensive literature as well as a valuation st udy completed and prepared by professors of the Houston School of Public health and of the UT Austin Center for Social Work Research that was based on the cost utility mode l, usage of extensive literature of similar interventions, costs savings and health outcomes related to th ose interventions. Cost-utility analysis (CUA) also was used to measure the cost of the program in dollars and the health consequences in utility-weighted units. This valuation uses a quality- adjusted life-years (QALYs) analysis that combin es health quality (uti lity) with length of time in a particular health state. Cost-utility analysis is a useful tool for assessing the value of new health service interventions because it provide s a standard way of valuing multiple types of interventions and programs. The valuation also incorporates costs averted when known (e.g., emergency room visits that are avoided). In order to make the valuations fair across different types of interventions, the common health goal, or outcome, is the number of life-years added. The CUA calculations indicate that the avai lability of expanded services for dually diagnosed individuals, i.e ., children, adolescents and adults with an existing determination of IDD or an IQ below 70, adults and children on the Autism Spectrum, and children and adults with an existing DSM mental health diagnosis and either Autism or an IDD, has the potential to increase QALY among those it serves. This valuation used cost-utility analysis wh ich measures program cost in dollars and the health consequences in util ity-weighted units called quality -adjusted life-years (QALYs). The QALY index incorporates costs averte d when known (e.g., emergency room visits that are avoided). The proposed program's value is based on a monetary value of $50,000 per QALY gained due to the intervention multiplied by number of participants. (Eichler, H. G., et al.

Unique RHP ID#: 091308902.1.1 (PASS 1) Performing Provider: San Antonio Metropolitan Health District Performing Provider TPI: 082426001 Project Summary: Provider Description : The San Antonio Metropolitan Health Di strict (Metro Health) is the public health agency charged by State law, City code, and County resolution with the responsibility for providing public health programs in San Antoni o and unincorporated areas of Bexar County. Services include health code enforcement, f ood inspections, immunizations, clinical services, environmental monitoring, disease control, h ealth education, dental health, and emergency preparedness. As a public health department Metr o Health provides services to all residents, but has a particular focus on unders erved populations and those expe riencing health disparities which often include a higher representation of Medicaid funded individuals. Intervention(s) : The project will improve access to preven tive dental services (dental sealants and fluoride varnish applications ) by providing preventive oral heal th services in non-traditional settings to include early ch ildhood education settings and eco nomically disadvantaged public schools. The project also supports early identification of children with unmet dental needs, and reinforces the importance of linking families to a \"main dental home\" in the community where they may receive comprehensive oral health se rvices. These services will be available to children not enrolled in the Head Start progra m that already receive federal funding for oral health services provi ded by Metro Health. Need for the project : Development of an alternative m eans to deliver preventive care in alternative settings has become increasingly important with the transition of Texas Medicaid from a fee-for service model to a managed care m odel. Under the new plan, all dental services must be provided through a \"main dental home\" or through specialist referral coordinated through the main dental home. This model can be enhanced through the use of complementary community-based preventive services in non-trad itional settings which can help reach children that are not currently being serve d. The strongest predicto r of future dental decay is a history of previous decay (car ies experience). Using a population-based approach to risk assessment, the rate of caries experi ence (62.2% in elementary school-aged participants), combin ed with other risk factors such as low socioeconomic status of target sites and schools (all 70% or greater econ omically disadvantaged) and race/ethnicity of target population must all be considered in development of a treatment/services plan for target schools. These community-based interventions do not conf lict with the \"main dental home\" model, but, rather provide an opportunity to identify Medicaid beneficiaries that ha ve not accessed dental services covered under the plan a nd facilitate referral to their de signated dental home. A review 605 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District of the data collected by Metro Health for 6,344 ch ildren enrolled in the City of San Antonio's Head Start Program revealed that 95% of enro lled children are also enrolled in the Texas Medicaid Program and have a \"main dental home\". However, upon examination, Metro Health dentists identified one in four children that had obvious clinical signs of untreated decay. Similarly, preliminary data collected for elem entary school-aged children in Bexar county suggests that approximately 48% ha ve untreated dental disease. Target population : The project aims to improve access to preventive dental care for economically disadvantaged children attending early education pre-ki ndergarten programs (other than Head Start) and elementary schools in Bexar County. School campuses with an enrollment of at least 70% economically disadvantaged children will be elig ible for participation. Children enrolled in Texas Medicaid and CHIP as well as those who are not eligible for public insurance will be served through the project. In this way, a gr eater number of childre n with needs will be identified sooner and can be linke d to either a \"dental home\" or provider that can take care of these needs in a more timely fashion, lesseni ng the likelihood of furt her breakdown of the dentition or loss of teeth. Referrals for follow up care will be coordinated with the child's main dental home, if applicable, or another community provider. The focus is on preventive services for children with documented limited access to a de ntal home and/or a long delay since their last evaluation for health services. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : Project goals include volume incremental increases in DY3, DY4 and DY5; which will be measured by th e number of unduplicated patients that access one or more oral health services through the pr oject during the measurement period. Ultimately, the expected outcome is to expand the reach of Metro Health's existing safety net dental programs for Head Start children to serve additional pre-school and elementary school-aged children which would result in improved access to preventive dental care for approximately 32,500 children in Bexar County over the course of the waiver. The table below outlines the age appropriate services for each group of children a nd the expected volume of services for DY3-5: Unduplicated Patients 20132014 School Year 20142015 School Year 20152016 School Year PreKindergarten Limited Oral 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District Category 3 outcomes: OD- 7 Oral Health These selected outcome measures demonstrate both the provision of needed preventive oral health services for children se rved through the project (IT-7.1 and IT-7.3) as well as ultimate reductions in adverse oral health outcome s (IT-7.6) for the populations served. o IT-7.1 Dental Sealants - % of children age 6-9 with a dental sealant on a permanent first molar tooth o IT-7.3 Early Childhood Caries - Fluo ride varnish applications o IT-7.6 Urgent Dental Care Needs in Children - % of children with urgent dental care needs Project Description: Project Overview Currently, the City operates comm unity-based prevention programs that provide access to early diagnosis, fluoride varnish and dental sealants for more than 15,000 children at high risk for dental decay. These programs have included services for nearly 7,000 Head Start children (federally funded) and over 8,000 students throu gh a school-based sealant grant (federal pass through) which will end in August 2013. These programs have been developed and implemented using the most current evidence-bas ed strategies to prev ent dental disease and reduce oral health disparities. Programs provide case management support for children identified with urgent dental conditions incl uding those who are uninsured or underinsured for required treatment. Additionall y, Metro Health provides oral he alth education, training and technical assistance for Head Start and Early He ad Start faculty and staff, and serves as a resources for school nurses in lo cal districts served by the progr ams. As a Region 6 performing provider, Metro Health will expa nd the reach of early childhood services beyond the Head Start population and will be able to reinitiate school base d sealant services for elementary children to serve children with unmet dental needs. Dental caries is the most common chronic dis ease of childhood. Childre n living in poverty are disproportionately affected, and experience nearly 12 times as many restricted-activity days compared to their higher income counterparts. Nationwide, an estimated 51 million school hours are lost each year due to dental-related illn ess. Poor oral health has been related to compromised nutritional intake, decreased schoo l attendance and performance, poor social relationships and re duced self esteem. School based sealant programs and fluoride va rnish preventive treatments are among the strongest evidence-based interventions for preven tion of dental caries and adverse oral health outcomes for children. These interventions, in a context of preventive oral health assessments and follow up treatments will be expanded in local schools and non-traditional settings to prevent future adverse oral health outcomes for Medicaid and other underserved populations. The use of non-traditional settings is critical to reaching underserved children that are not being served in a main dental home. Additionally this project will seek to develop and refine progress in serving the oral health needs of children through participation in a variety of Continuous Quality Improvement activities including participation in a re gional learning collaborative, pa rtnership with the UTHSCSA on program improvement analysis a nd activities and work with other Metro Health projects on CQI 607 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District as outlined in milestones 2, 4, 6 and 8. Goals and Relationship to Regional Goals Project Goals: 1. Providing preventive oral health services in non-traditional settings such as early childhood centers to non-Head Start child ren and to economically disadvantaged public schools 2. Supporting early identification of ch ildren with unmet dental needs 3. Linking children to comprehensive oral health services through private, public and other community partners within the c ontext of the main dental home model This project meets the following regional goals: This project directly addresses the RHP 6 need to expand access fo r dental services within the region (CN.3). Project Goals and 5 Year Expected Outcom e for Performing Provider and Patients: Project goals include volume incremental incr eases in DY3 , DY4 and DY5; which will be measured by the number of unduplicated patients th at access one or more oral health service through the project during the m easurement period. Ultimately, the expected outcome is to expand the reach of Metro Health 's existing safety net dental programs to serve additional pre- school and elementary school-aged children whic h would result in improved access to dental care for approximately 32,500 children in Bexa r County over the course of the waiver. These community-based interventions do not conf lict with the \"main dental home\" model, but, rather provide an opportunity to identify Medicaid beneficiaries that ha ve not accessed dental services covered under the plan a nd facilitate referral to their de signated dental home. A review of the data collected by Metro Health for 6,344 ch ildren enrolled in the City of San Antonio's Head Start Program revealed that 95% of enro lled children are also enrolled in the Texas Medicaid Program and have a \"main dental home\". However, upon examination, Metro Health dentists identified one in four children that had obvious clinical signs of untreated decay. Similarly, preliminary data collected for elem entary school-aged children in Bexar county suggests that approximately 48% ha ve untreated dental disease. Project metrics will include collection of oral health surveillance data using the appropriate module of the Basic Screening Survey. Key oral hea lth status indicators w ill be captured directly on site on elementary school campuses for childre n enrolled in Pre-K, Kindergarten, second and third grade. Direct data entr y will be performed in the schoo l-based sealant program using the SmilesMaker software, a modified version of the CDC's S.E.A.L.S. data collection tool. In both modules of the Basic Screening Survey, the asse ssment includes age-appropriate oral measures of oral health status including: untreated decay, urgency of ca re, caries experience, dental sealants and early childhood caries. Challenges/Opportunities: According to the Centers for Medicare and Me dicaid Services 2010 Annual EPSDT Participation Report (CMS-416), 1,429,066 children (47.3%) enroll ed in Texas Medicai d did not receive a single preventive service during a 12 month period. Provision of pr eventive dental services in 608 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District non-traditional settings, will remove barriers to care for children living in poverty and improve oral health outcomes for children at high risk fo r disease. Specific prog rams for consideration target provision age-appropriate preventive interventions includi ng fluoride varnish and dental sealants in outreach locations. Development of an alternative means to deliver preventive care in alternative settings has become increasingly important with the transition of Texas Medicaid from a fee-for service model to a managed care m odel. Under the new plan, all dental services must be provided through a \"main dental home\" or through specialist referral coordinated through the main dental home. The goal of this program is to address these ch allenges by providing a complementary service to the main dental home. The Metro Health dental program has consistently identified children that are covered by Texas Medicaid a nd CHIP with untreated dental decay and helped them obtain access to a main dental home through a variety of special projects and grant funded programs. Starting Point/Baseline: School-Based Oral Health Prevention Program-Children (Children ages 6-9) Metro Health provides diagnostic and preventive services on the campuses of local elementary schools with the highest concen tration of children living in poverty. During the 2011-2012 academic school year, the City's previously gr ant funded school-based sealant program reached 69 elementary school campuses in 5 school district s. A total of 8,961 children received one or more diagnostic and/or prev entive service during the prev ious program period, with 1,760 second grade students received dental sealants. A total of 8,961 fl uoride varnish applications and 5,291 dental sealants were applie d for participating children. Ho wever with the loss of these grant funds the program will not be able to provide school-based exams and sealants without 1115 funding. The project table is set at zero for DY3. Early Childhood Oral Health Program (Children ages birth through 5) Metro Health provides diagnostic and preventive services on site in Head Start Centers throughout Bexar County for approximately 7,000 children ages 3-5 en rolled in the local program. During the 2011-2012 academic school y ear, Metro Health served 6,897 children ages 3-5 years enrolled in Head St art. In addition to a limited oral examination performed by a dentist, program staff administered 12,135 applic ations of fluoride varnish. These Head Start services are supported by federal funds and will not be counted as part of this proposed project. The baseline for non-Head start se rvices is set at zero and this project will seek to expand services to children not funded by Head Start, many of which are co-located in the same classrooms and schools as children that do receive Head Start services. Rationale: Community water fluoridation a nd school-based sealant programs are the foundation of dental caries prevention of and reducti on of oral health disparities. Community assessment data collected from the City's oral health outreach programs serve as evidence of the need for new and innovative solutions to eliminate barriers to a ccessing preventive dental care such as fluoride varnish applications and dental sealants. The strongest predictor of future dental decay is a history of previous decay (caries experience) . Using a population-based approach to risk assessment, the rate of caries experience ( 62.2% in elementary school-aged participants), combined with other risk factors such as low so cioeconomic status of ta rget sites and schools (all 70% or greater economically disadvantaged) and r ace/ethnicity of target population must all be 609 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District considered in development of a treatmen t/services plan for target schools. Unique community need identificati on number the project addresses: This project directly addresses the RHP 6 need to expand access fo r dental services within the region (CN.3). Provide services to economically disadvant aged elementary schools through the Metro Health School-Based Oral Health Prevention Program Rationale/Evidence: School-based dental sealant programs have b een identified by the CDC as a preventive measure that has strong evidence demonstrating effectiveness in the prevention of dental caries and allow for low-income high risk ch ildren to receive dental sealants that otherwise may not have the oppor tunity to r eceive them. Measuring increase in special high risk populat ions accessing dental services reflects the goals of addressing health dispar ities in access to dental care. Expand the reach of Metro Health's current oral health prevention for economically disadvantaged pre-kindergarten children (ages bi rth through 5) to children not enrolled in Head Start Rationale/Evidence: Identified by the CDC as a preventive measure that has strong evidence demonstrating effectiveness in the prevention of dental caries and allow for low-income high risk children to receive fluoride varnish applic ations that otherwise may not have the opportunity to receive them. Measuring increase in special high risk populati ons accessing dental services reflects the goals of addressing disparitie s in access to dental care Children who have regular access to a dental pr ovider are more likely to have received dental services such as fl uoride varnish applications. Children are less likely to suffer from more severe, urgent oral health problems with adequate and regular access to dental care How the project represents a new initiative or significantly enhances an existing delivery system reform initiative: This project would allow for a significant expans ion of the number of ch ildren served through the Metro Health preventive oral health program. Funding for this project would be utilized to reach new school and community locations not pr eviously served by the Metro Health program and to reinstate services in elementary schools which have lo st funding for school based oral health services. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-7 Oral Health IT-7.1 Dental Sealants - % of children age 6-9 with a dental sealant on a permanent first molar tooth IT-7.3 Early Childhood Caries - Fluo ride varnish applications 610 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District IT-7.6 Urgent Dental Care Needs in Children - % of children with urgent dental care needs Reasons/rationale for select ing the outcome measures: These selected outcome measures demonstrate both the provision of needed preventive oral health services for children se rved through the project (IT-7.1 and IT-7.3) as well as ultimate reductions in adverse oral health outcomes (IT- 7.6) for the populations served. These measures closely align with the RHP 6 goals in terms of bo th expanded oral health services and reductions in adverse oral health outcomes. Relationship to other Projects: Metro Health and the UT Health Science Center Dental School have a long-standing community partnership. In addition to collaborative effort s in support of community water fluoridation, the local health department and dental school work closely to ensure ac cess to quality dental care is available in Bexar County and that future or al health training progr ams include relevant community health experiences for students. In 2010, the UT Health Science Center Dental School was granted a 3 year award through the Health Resources and Services Administration th at included a sub contractual agreement with Metro Health to develop and implement a model school-based oral health prevention program. In addition to the Texas Oral Health Workforce Grant, contractual agreem ents between these two entities are in place that allows Metro Health to provide direct reimbursement to the University for provision of comprehensive dental care for income-eligible children referred for comprehensive care. The UT Health Science Cent er clinics serve as the primary referral source for children who are uninsured or underinsured for the care needed to be restored to health. Specifically, the University's Ricardo Salinas C linic provides approximately 5,000 patient visits for low income children on an annual basis, many of which are not eligible for Medicaid or CHIP. The UT Health Science Center Dental School's community-based clinic al activities at the Ricardo Salinas Dental Clinic a nd the San Antonio Christian Dent al Clinic at the Haven for Hope campus serve as key components of the local de ntal safety net. Both pre-doctoral students and pediatric dentistry resident s gain hands-on experience work ing with at-risk populations by providing care in these sites. In addition to the training experien ces gained through the University's traditional clinic rotations, community health rotations have also been established for students to work with Metro Health to provi de fluoride varnish and dental sealants in non- traditional settings. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Relative to the UT Health Science Center Dent al School DSRIP project proposals, preliminary discussions have taken place regarding linkage of community-based patient encounters with certified electronic health records. The Univer sity's proposal also seeks to establish emergency dental clinics, which could serve as a vital refe rral source for the reside nts that contact Metro Health for assistance in locati ng emergency dental services. 611 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District Plan for Learning Collaborative: Metro Health will foster Continuous Quality Im provement (CQI) through ac tive participation in the RHP 6 learning collaborative working grou ps to support and enhance project quality improvement, evaluation and achievement of outco mes. CQI elements are specifically included through milestones 2, 4, 6 and 8 beginning in DY 2. Additionally, Metro Health will seek out project specific opportunities to collaborate with regional maternal and child health as well as other local health department performi ng providers in other Texas regions. Project Valuation: Numerous studies have documented the value of preventive oral health services, specifically school-based sealants and fluorid e varnish applicants in reducing subsequent dental visits, restorative care and emergency vi sits. Overall children receiving preventive services incur lower dental costs. Utilizing the methodology provided by the RHP 6 anchor, Metro Health assessed the following factors in assigning a value to this preventive or al health project: achievement of waiver goals, community need, project scope and th e level of projec t investment. This project was ranked high on achievement of waiver goals given the strong research and high potential for reduction of oral hea lth costs for Medicaid and other underserved populations of children in Bexar County. This project will expand access to oral health services, emphasize effective evidence-based preventive se rvices, provide opportunities for coordinated care between community ba sed preventive services and follow up care through the main dental home model, and reduce costs. This project was ranked moderately in rega rds to addressing a community need. While this project is consistent with the RHP need to expand dental services other community health needs have been more prominent in public surveys and community planning efforts. This project was ranked low on project scope in that services will be focused on children only in specific community settings which is a more narrow target population than other Metro Health proposed projects. This project was ranked moderately in regards to program investment in that the selected project requires individual screening and case management of patients rather than population-based approaches which will be mo re resource intensive for both project implementation and evaluation. 612 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District 091308902.1.1 PASS 1 1.8.9 N/A E XPANSION OF SCHOOL -BASED SEALANT AND FLUORIDE VARNISH PROGRAMS San Antonio Metropolitan H ealth District TPI e Varnish Applications Urgent Dental Care Needs in Children Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P-6]: Implement/expand alternative dental care delivery systems to underserved populations Metric 1 [P-6.3]: Implement or expand school-based sealant program Goal: Document the expansion of a program plan and schedule of schools for the 2013-2014 academic year.

Category 2: Inno vation and Redesign Identifying Project and Provider Information: Title: 2.8.1 Design, develop and implement a program of continuous, rapid process improvement that will address issues of safety, quality and efficiency Unique RHP ID#: 159156201.2.1 - PASS 1 Performing Provider: VHS San Antonio Part ners, LLC d/b/a Baptist Health System Performing Provider TPI: 159156201 Project Summary: Provider Description : Baptist Health System includes five ac ute- (Baptist Medical Center (623 beds), Mission Trail Baptist Hospital (110 beds), North Central Baptist Ho spital (280 beds), Northeast Baptist Hospital (379 beds), and St. Luke's Bapt ist Hospital (282 beds)) which offer 1,674 licensed beds. In 2011, Baptist Health System was recogni zed by U.S. News and World Report for earning more, high performing specialty rankings (5) than any other health system in the San Antonio metropolitan area. All five hospitals have earned Accr edited Chest Pain Center designation, as well as Primary Stroke Center Certification. Medicare has designated each as Texas' only Medicare Value Based Care Centers. The system also includes Ba ptist Regional Children's Center, Baptist Breast Center, HealthLink wellness and fitness center, Bap tist M&S Imaging Centers, community health and wellness programs, ambulatory services, rehabilita tion services, air medical transport, School of Health Professions, and other health -related services and affiliations . It is part of the Nashville, Tennessee-based Vanguard Health Systems. Intervention(s) : Using the enhanced Performance Improve ment capacity created with Project 1.10, Baptist will apply these tools to iden tify clinical care areas and pro cesses to conform to current best practices and reduce variation in treatment plans and health outcomes. Baptist will drive process improvement in at least the following specific clinical areas: 1. Bowel Surgery- Utilization of TPN and ICU 2. Congestive Heart Failure LOS and utilization of pharmaceuticals, imaging and lab diagnostics 3. Variation in diagnostics and treatment patterns among ED pr actitioners for # 1 presenting complaint of abdominal pain Need for the project : The five year goal is to improve patient care and outcomes, reduce cost and variation in processes while impr oving clinical care, patient outcome s and improving the total patient experience. We will target specific clinical proces ses already identified and continue a similar process to improve additional clinical areas which will imp rove patient care and experience. Healthcare quality in Texas overall is low, th ere are critical shortages in provi ders and access, high indigent and Medicaid populations, widespread chronic disease in diabetes and cardiac illness, so focusing on targeted clinical conditions with high volume and/or wide variation, narrows the gap in all of these areas of need. Improving the care and quality also improves access to restricted resources for other patients. These goals meet Triple Aim, the RH P 6 Regional Goals and our RHP Community Needs. We have already evaluated the th ree clinical conditions noted above and found wide variation in significant volumes of patients. Target population : The current Baptist Health System annual volumes for these three clinical initiatives : 616 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Baptist Health System Bowel Surgery = 610 surgeries CHF = 1309 admissions Abdominal pain upon presentati on to ED = 16,245 patients or 7.3% of all Baptist ED visit Surgical Operations improvements will have wi despread impact as BHS performs almost 34,000 annual surgeries. Over 26% of BHS' Inpatient po pulation is Medicaid or Uninsured indigent and another large % have Medicaid supplemental to Medicare. Over 43% of BHS' Outpatient population is Medicaid or Uninsured indigent and another large % have Medicaid supplemental to Medicare. The impact of these quality and cost improvements thr ough standardization and reduc tion in variation will greatly benefit this patient population. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The expected benefit of this project to patients is improved quality of se rvices. Specifically, BHS expects patients having bowel surgery to have redu ced length of stays, reduced usage of TPN, and reduced ICU utilization. BHS also expects patients with chronic heart failure to have reduced length of stays and reduction in variation in usage of pharmaceuticals, imaging and lab diagnostics during treatment of CHF. For Surgical Operations Improve ments the focus with quantifiable impact will be reduction of surgical site infections, reduction in supply cost per case th rough standardization and improved first case on time starts. By DY 5, the go al is to have 20% improvement in measure outcomes for bowel surgery and CHF identified. Howeve r, because of the nature of this project, BHS cannot identify the actual reducti ons in length of stay until DY 2, when the process improvement tools have been developed. Category 3 outcomes: Congestive Heart Failure 30 day readmission rate Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) 30 day readmission rate Project Description: Building on the infrastructure of performance improve ment that will be established under project 1.10, BHS will implement lean and six sigma perfor mance improvement methodology to improve the safety, quality, patient experience, and efficiency in targeted service areas. Specifically, the infrastructure built under 1.10 will give BHS the tools to identify service areas that are in need of performance improvement and an evid ence-based methodology to address those clinical deficiencies. The goal of this project is to apply these tools to identify clinical care areas a nd processes to conform to current best practices and redu ce variation in treatment plans and health outcomes. The tools used under the lean and six sigma methodology include, FMEA, value stream mapping, process mapping, identification and elimination of waste and non-valu e added processes. Using these tools, BHS will drive process improvement in at leas t the following specific clinical areas: 1. Bowel Surgery-we have identified wide variation in the use of TPN (Total Parenteral Feeding) post bowel surgery. Using the Aspen Associati on for Parenteral Feed ings best practice guidelines we will implement best practices for TPN usage post bowel surgery. This will reduce variation, improve pati ent quality and reduce costs. We have also found wide variation in ICU utilization post bowel surgery. Using APACHE criteria we will work to ensure ICU utilizati on is per evidence based medicine. 617 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Baptist Health System 2. Similarly we are in the analysis stage for CHF LOS variances as well as wide variation in the utilization of pharmaceuticals, imaging and lab diagnostics and identify and report on processes for improvement in quality and efficiency/cost. 3. Our third area under analysis for improvement is the variation in diagnostics and treatment patterns among ED providers for patients who pres ent to the ED with a chief complaint of abdominal pain-which is BHS' larges t volume presenting condition in the ED. Other areas scheduled for in dept h analysis include variation in C Section and Vaginal delivery hospital care. Challenges center on changing physician practice patterns . BHS will use the PI tools, include physicians and other practitioners , access Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) studies and protocols or maps and address the challenges with targeted data and analysis that will lead the involved physicians to common solutions reducing variation and improving care. The five year goal is to improve patient care and outcomes, reduce cost and variation in processes while improving clinical care, patient outcomes a nd improving the total patient experience. We will target specific clinical proce sses already identified and continue a similar process to improve additional clinical areas which will imp rove patient care and experience. This project meets the RH P Regional Goals : Triple Aim: assuring patients receive high-quality and patient-centered care, in the most cost effective ways Improve the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of our counties Further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system Improve outcomes while containing cost growth This project meets the following RHP identified Community needs : CN.1 Texas ranks last in the nation on health care quality BHS Operational improvement Office will use P-3 Qu ality Improvement Milestone to further enhance the PI impact on improving care, quality and cost for our patients. Starting Point/Baseline: BHS has identified three clinical focus areas to target for reducing variation in process and/or clinical variation as compared to DY1 outcomes: bowel pr ocedures, congestive heart failure, and top volume ER diagnosis. We will measure progress on these pr ojects over DY3-5 and will identify additional clinical areas to target in DY3. Rationale: Variation exists within health care practices ac ross the RHP 6 area and even within healthcare facilities. This is indicative that evidence based practices are not used consistently. Through project 1.10 BHS will develop the infrastructure, provide training to all levels of staff, and establish a mechanism for employee input. In pr oject 2.8, BHS will define key safety, quality and 618 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Baptist Health System efficiency performance measures and develop a sy stem for continuous data collection, an alysis, and share across levels of our organization. Identifying and improving processes that reduce clinical variation s upports the goals of Texas Waiver 1115, specifically, improving outcomes and containi ng costs, health systems can identify and eliminate waste and non-value added steps. Applyi ng lean concepts, these goals can be achieved. Based on data assimilated and evaluated in DY1, BH S will prioritize to reduce variation in process and/or clinical variation includi ng bowel procedures, congestive h eart failure, and top volume ER diagnosis. Reduction in variation as compared to DY1. Each year additiona l clinical process or practices will be analyzed through lean infr astructure and employee/ physician suggestions. This project certainly is in accord with national initiatives such as Accountable Care organizations. This project is aligned wi th the Triple AIM Goals : Improving patient flow and infrastructure pro cesses increases access for all patients including Medicaid and uninsured patients Improving flow and processes contributes to a more coordinate d delivery system Improving flow and processes, reducing varia tion and increasing care reliability improves patient safety and outcomes and reduces costs, eliminating waste from system The project will involve the following core components: a) Provide training and education to clinical and administrative staff on process improvement strategies, methodolog ies, and culture. b) Develop an employee suggestion system that allows for the identification of issues that impact the work environment, patient ca re and satisfaction, e fficiency and other is sues aligned with continuous process improvement. c) Define key safety, quality, and efficiency performance measures and develop a system for continuous data collection, analys is, and dissemination of performa nce on these measures ((i.e. weekly or monthly dashboard). d) Develop standard workflow process maps, staf fing and care coordinati on models, protocols, and documentation to support continuous process improvement. e) Implement software to integrate workflows and provide real time performance feedback. f) Evaluate the impact of the process improvement program and assess opp ortunities to expand, refine, or change processes based on th e results of key performance indicators This project also aligns with the RHP 6 Community Needs Assessment by improving access, outreach and care for the areas' underserved, diseased pa tient population by equipping BHS leaders and staff and improving the care provided and reduce clinical and process variat ion while reducing the cost of care. This supports CN1 as noted above and will pr ovide eventual benefit to the other community needs. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): IT- 3.2 Congestive Heart Failu re 30 day readmission rate (Stand Alone Measure) IT- 3.5 Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) 30 da y readmission rate (Stand Alone Measure) Cardiovascular disease is the largest caus e of preventable death in Texas in RHP6. Texas is rated \"weak\" in heart disease. 619 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Baptist Health System Relationship to other Projects: This project is related to proj ect 1.1.0, Enhance Performance Impr ovement and Reporting Capacity. Performance improvement tools can al so be used to analyze the data collected as well as develop an improvement plan for improving patient access to Primary Care (1.1), Sp ecialty Care (1.9). Project 2.8 could support 2.3 to redesign primary care, as well as 2.4 redesign to improve patient experience. Lean tools can be ut ilized to improve cycle times in facilities and c linics and improve patient flow and experience by identifying constrai nts, wastes, and non-value-added steps as viewed from the patient's perspective. This project supports the goals of Texas Waiv er 1115, specifically to Improve outcomes while containing cost growth. It is aligned with category 4 projects in that both congestiv e heart failure and the emergency department are areas of focus to redu ce variation in care processes. Lean tools focus on reducing undesirable variation in clinical practices which suppor ts the triple aim concept of optimizing the health system and system integration. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: University, Baptist, Methodist Health systems have all cite d 2.8 Apply Process Improvement Methodology as a DSRIP Initiative. Material opportunity exists to share findings and results and work collaboratively to improve clini cal care and patient outcomes in RHP 6. Plan for Learning Collaborative: Following completion of the RHP plan, University Health System (anchor) will facilitate the formation of working groups of performing provi ders who are pursuing similar projects. These working groups will develop their learning collabor ative structure which may include goals, regular meetings, site visits, conference calls, communicati on plan development, organizing learning event, and adopt metrics to measure success. Project Valuation: Baptist values each project based on the specific needs of the community, the projected impact on the health outcomes of the community, the level of advancement to the healthcare delivery system, and the time, effort, and clinical resources necessary to implement each project. In valuing this project, Baptist took into account the extent to which Apply Process Improvement Methodology would potentially meet the goals of the Waiver (improve outcomes while containing costs, improve the healthcare infrastructure), the ex tent to which it will address the community needs, the population served, and resources and cost necessary to implement the project. The use of PI to improve patient outcomes and experi ence will help address a substantial need in the community since Texas quality of car e has been rated as weak particul arly in cardiac care is the # 1 cause of death in. It also advan ces the Waiver goal of improving outcomes while curbing the risk of healthcare costs, because early intervention and chronic disease management are cost effective methods to increase health outcomes. 620 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Baptist Health System 159156201.2.1 PASS 1 2.8.1 2.8.1 A-F 2.8.1 DESIGN , DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM OF CONTINUOUS , RAPID PROCESS IMPROVEMENT THAT WILL ADDRESS ISSUES OF SAFETY , QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY VHS San Antonio Partners, LLC d/b/ a Baptist Health System TPI - 159156201 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 159156201.3.6 159156201.3.7 3.IT 3.2 3.IT 3.5 Congestive Heart Failure 30 day readmission rate Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) 30 day readmission rate Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P-4] Define operational procedures needed to improve efficiencies in care management Metric 1 [P-4.1]: [Report on at least two operational procedures needed to improve overall efficiencies in care management) Baseline is identify two procedures each for bowel surgery and CHF Data Source: Avega, Crimson, Operational Improvement Department Tracking Tool Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $ 1,137,296 Milestone 2 Milestone 3 [P-3] Compare and analyze clinical/quality/data and identify at least one \"additional\" area for improvement Metric 1 [P-3.1]: [Submission of analysis findings/summary and identification of target area] Baseline is identification of an incremental clinical area, procedure or process for improvement to DY2 procedures (bowel surgery and CHF) Data Source: Avega, Crimson, Operational Improvement Department Tracking Tool Milestone 3 Estimated Incentive Payment: $2,481,459 Milestone 4 [I-13] Progress toward target or goal Metric 1 [I-13.1]: [Number of relevant clinical cases at target] Goal is 10% improvement in measure outcomes for bowel surgery and CHF identified in DY2 Data Source: Avega, Crimson, Operational Improvement Department Tracking Tool Milestone 4 Estimated Incentive Payment: $1,244,336 Milestone 5 [I-14] Measure efficiency Milestone 6 [I-13] Progress toward target or goal Metric 1 [I-13.1]: [Number of relevant clinical cases at target] Goal is 20% improvement in measure outcomes for bowel surgery and CHF identified in DY2 Data Source: Avega, Crimson, Operational Improvement Department Tracking Tool Milestone 6 Estimated Incentive Payment: $ 2,055,860 621 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Baptist Health System [P-6] Implement a program to improve efficiencies and/or reduce program variation Metric 1 [P-6.1]: [Performance improvement events for surgical services) Baseline is incremental events for surgery performed in DY2 Data Source: Avega, Crimson, Operational Improvement Department Tracking Tool Milestone 2 Estimated Incentive Payment: 1,137,297 and/or cost Metric 1 [I-14.1]: [Demonstrate 10% Performance improvement in efficiency and/or cost for surgical services events identified in DY2 and improved upon) Baseline is incremental cost or efficiencies to the analysis in DY2 Data Source: Avega, Crimson, Operational Improvement Department Tracking Tool Milestone 5 Estimated Incentive Payment: $ 1,244,336 Year 2 Estimated Milestone Bundle Amount: $ 2,274,593 Year 3 Estimated Milestone Bundle Amount: $ 2,481,459 Year 4 Estimated Milestone Bundle Amount: $ 2,488,672 Year 5 Estimated Milestone Bundle Amount: $2,055,860 TOTAL ESTIMATED I NCENTIVE PAYMENTS FOR 4-YEAR PERIOD: $ 9,300,584 622 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health System Identifying Project and Provider Information: Title: 2.1.2 - Collaborate with an affiliated Patient-Centered Me dical Home to integrate care management and coordination for shared, high-ri sk patients: Patient-Centered Medical Home Unique RHP ID#: 020844901.2.1 - PASS Provider Name: CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health System TPI: 020844901 Project Summary: Provider Description : CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health Syst em (CSRHS) is a Catholic, non-profit health and wellness system with three adult acute care hospitals, one short-st ay surgical hospital, two free standing emergency departments and several physician joint-venture ambulatory surgery centers. With a combined total of 496 beds, CSRHS currently serves the San Antonio and New Braunfels markets which has a total population of 1.9 million. Intervention(s) : This project will increase access to prim ary care and improve the management of chronic diseases in the comm unity by contributing to the expansion of medical homes. The innovative nature of this projec t centers on the fact that this PCMH involves the integration of multiple, small practices who together act as a single, large integrated PCMH. Need for the project : CSRHS is currently piloting a medical home model with nine practices for its employees. This project will allow CSRHS to increase the number of medical homes and improve access and quality for th e targeted patient population. Target population : The target population is ethnically diverse, lo w-income Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries who ha ve significant impediments to accessing primary care. Hospital utilization data from the previous two fiscal years reveals that almost 39% of inpatient admissions for CSRHS are from the Medicare fee-for-service population. Furthermore, this target population is a key driver for CSRHS' 30-day readmissions: 62% of all heart failure in farction readmissions and 39% of pneumonia readmissions are Medicare beneficiaries. In fact, this target population is a substantial driver for 30-day readmissions for any diagnosis. While the target population only accounts for 10% of Emergency Department visits, almost half (46%) of those visits become inpatient admissions. The Bexar County Community Needs Assessment reve aled that almost one-third (33%) of Bexar county residents do not have a medi cal home or even a primary care physician that oversees their care. Data from internal hospital registra tions during 2011 revealed that 1,475 Medicare inpatients did not have a primar y care physician or medical home. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : This project seeks to incr ease the number of medical homes available to Medicare and Medicaid bene ficiaries by 8 between DY2 and DY5 (2 per year). Additionally this projec t will increase the number of patients assigned to medical homes by 24% (2,136) over baseline in DY3; and 15% (1,970) in DY5. Finally, all participating medical homes will seek NCQA medical home recognition, with the goal of having all medical homes establishe d between DY2 and DY4 NCQA accredited by DY5. CSRHS expects that approximately 5% of the pa tients served by these medical homes will be Medicaid or indigent. 623 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health System Category 3 outcomes: [IT-1.10] The goal is to improve Hb A1c levels for the targeted population in DY4 and DY5. Targets will be determined based on the baseline established in DY3. Project Description: CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health System (CSRHS) w ill take an innovative approach to the Patient- Centered Medical Home (PCMH) by partneri ng with small, independent, geographically distributed primary care practices to create an integrated car e delivery model that improves access to primary care (CN.3) for this vulne rable population group. This project addresses demonstrated public health challenges in the community by catering to the complex, chronic care needs (CN.2) of the population 65 and older; im proving patient adherence to care plans through comprehensive preventive and primary care serv ices; providing active follow-up in-between office visits; and, promoting continuity of care. The target population is ethnically diverse, low- income Medicare beneficiaries who have sign ificant impediments to accessing primary care. Goals and Relationship to Regional Goals: The goal of this project is to improve quali ty access to primary care in the community by contributing to the expansion of medical homes. Th e innovative nature of this project centers on the fact that this PCMH involve s the integration of multiple, sma ll practices who together act as a single, large integrated PCMH. Key Goals: 1) Support the ongoing relationship between the patient a personal physician who provides continuous, comprehensive care; 2) Care to be provided by a team wh ich includes primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, dieticians, care coordinators, me ntal health experts, who collectively take responsibility for patient needs, whether within the practice or through referral; 3) Care that is coordinated a nd/or integrated across all elemen ts of the health care system and the patients community; 4) Care that is facilitated by the use of data registries, information technology, health information exchange, and other systems to assure that patients get care when and where they need it; 5) Expanded access to health practitioners through open scheduling and expanded hours; 6) Provide a reimbursement structure that s upports and encourages th is model of care. This project meets the following regional goals: Triple Aim: assuring patients receive high-quality and patien t-centered care, in the most cost effective ways. Improve the healthcare infrastructure to bett er serve Medicare, Medicaid and uninsured residents of our counties. Further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system Improve outcomes while containing cost growth. 5-Year Expected Outcome for Provider and Patients: 624 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health System As a result of this project, we expect to see a marked increase in access to primary care for this population and a significant improvement in the ma nagement of chronic conditions over the next 5 years. In the implementation of this project, CSRHS will endeavor for continuous quality improvement by monitoring the patient volumes and patient utili zation to ensure that progress is being made towards meeting the project milestones. Add itionally, CSRHS will ensure that all medical homes make ongoing efforts to meet or exceed al l nationally recognized protocol or quality benchmarks for patient-centered medical homes. Starting Point/Baseline: As of December 1, 2011, nine medical home partic ipating groups were identified as a starting point to develop this project. The nine me dical homes currently serve approximately 8,900 active Medicare beneficiaries. The plan is to expand this PCMH network by 4-6 practices. Source: CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Internal Data Rationale: According to the Region 6 Community Needs A ssessment, limited access to primary care (CN.3) and chronic disease management (CN.2) are am ongst the major challenges facing the population. These challenges will be exacerbate d as the population continues to grow and more Texans gain access to health care coverage under the Affordable Care Ac t. There is a growing body of research that concludes that PCMHs deliver more affordable, better quality primary care. Recent evaluations conducted across 20 states shows evid ence of better outcomes, reduced mortality, fewer preventable hospital admissions, lower ac ute care utilization, improved patient compliance with recommended care and lower spending. As previously stated, the target population for this project is ethnically di verse, low-income and has significant impediments to accessing comprehe nsive primary care. Ho spital utilization data from the previous two fiscal ye ars reveals that almost 39% of inpatient admissions for CSRHS are from the Medicare fee-for-s ervice population. Furthermore, th is target population is a key driver for CSRHS'30-day readmissions: 62% of all readmi ssions and 39% of pneumonia readmissions are Medicare beneficiaries. In fact, this target population is a substantial driver for 30-day readmissions for any diagnosis. While the target population only accounts for 10% of Emergency Department visits, almost half (46%) of those visits become inpatient admissions. The Bexar County Community Needs Assessment revealed that almost one-third (33%) of the Bexar county residents do not have a medical home or even a pr imary care physician that oversees their care. Data from internal hospital registrations duri ng 2011 revealed that 1,475 Medicare inpatients did not have a primary care physician or medical home. The PCMH Project involves the collaboration of affiliated patient-centered medical homes to integrate care management and c oordination for shared, high-risk patients. The core project components include: a) Improve data exchange between hospitals and affiliated medical home sites : hospital affiliated medical home sites will implement a common data exchange process where practice performance relativ e to agreed upon quality metrics and protocols can be monitored to ensure compliance. b) Develop best practices plan to elimin ate gaps in the readiness assessment: As part of achieving NCQA certification for each practice, a readiness assessment will be completed 625 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health System and any gaps identified in the assessment will be addressed as part of the process to meet the required NCQA criteria. c) Hire and train team members to create multidisciplinary teams including social workers, health coaches, care managers, and nurses with a diverse skill set that can meet the needs of the shared, high-risk patients: The medical home project will be hiring and/or leveraging other allied health providers to support the needs of each medical home practice to assure that identified high risk patients are appropriately managed to reduce unnecessary utilization of h ealthcare resources and to improve patient outcomes. d) Implement a comprehensive, multidisciplinar y intervention to address the needs of the shared, high-risk patients: the medical home network will have a comprehensive care coordination program, the purpose of which is to identify high risk patients in each practice, establish a relationship with each high risk patient, assure that each identified patient is following the medical intervention plan, the result of which will be to reduce unnecessary utilization, and improve the health of the patient. e) Evaluate the success of the intervention at decreasing ED and inpatient hospitalization by shared, high-risk patients and use this dat a in rapid-cycle improvements to improve the intervention: The medical home network will be co llecting data on all medical home patients for all participating practices on u tilization of services , both outpatient and inpatient, and these data will be compared to establish baseline utilization to determine whether improvements have occurred in the utili zation of healthcare services for high risk patients. f) Conduct quality improvement for project using methods such as rapid cycle improvement. Activities may include, but ar e not limited to, indent ifying project impacts, identifying \"lessons learned,\" opportunities to scale all or part of the project to a broader patient population, and identifying key c hallenges associated with expansion of the project, including special consider ations for safety-net populations: we will implement a system that allows us to track the number of patients, types of patients, utilization of inpatient and outpatient reso urces, patient outcome measures, which will provide us data to measure performance and initiate rapid cycle changes to continually improve our processes. Three major milestones were selected to ensure that this project achieves the intended results: 1) Implement the medical home mo del in primary care clinics: Increasing the number of PCMHs to serve this project is critical to the goal of expanding primary care access. 2) Improve the number of eligible patients th at are assigned to the medical homes: Increasing the number of patients en rolled in this project will be critical to having a true impact on managing this population. 3) Implement PCMH NCQA standa rds into every medical home : Achieving NCQA recognition will ensure that this model de livers high quality and efficient care. This project meets the Triple Aim goals of the Waiver by promoting better health, better patient experience of care, and ultimately better cost-e ffectiveness The PCMH model is a foundation for the ability to accept alternative payment models under payment reform and deliver care aligned with payment reform models. By providing the ri ght care at the right time and in the right setting, patients not only have better access to primary care, they may see their health improved, will rely less on costly ED visits, will incur fewer avoidable hospital stays and report greater 626 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health System patient satisfaction. Unique community need identificati on numbers the project addresses: CN.2 - High prevalence of chronic disease a nd related health dispar ities require greater prevention efforts and improved management of patients with chronic conditions. CN.3 - Lack of access to medical and dental care due to high rates of uninsurance and health care providers shortages. How the project represents a new initiative or significantly enhances an existing deliver system reform initiative: CSRHS is currently piloting a medical home model with nine practices for its employees. This project will allow CSRHS to increase the num ber of medical homes and improve access and quality for the target ed patient population. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-1 Primary Care and Chronic Disease Management IT-1.10 Diabetes Care: HbA1c Poor Control Percentage of patients 18-75 years of age w ith diabetes (type 1 or type 2) who had hemoglobin A1c (Hba1c) control >9.0% Reasons/rationale for select ing the outcome measures: Diabetes is one of the most co stly and highly prevalent chronic diseases in the United States. According to the RHP community needs assess ment (CN.2); a high prevalence of chronic disease and related health disparities requi res greater prevention efforts and improved management of patients with chronic conditions. A major goal of this project is to improve adherence to care plans by offering comprehensive preventative and primar y care services that cater to the complex, chronic care needs of the population 65 a nd older. By using the HbA1c improvement target for this project, providers ca n focus on controlling th is population's diabetes; will drastically improve the hea lth of this population, while also helping to reduce costs. Relationship to other Projects: Through the PCMH model, primary care o ffice hours are expanded, which helps to expand Primary care capacity (1.1); The PCMH focuses on chronic disease management, which reinforces project Expand Chronic Care Management Models (2.2); The basic concept behind the PCMH is to redesign how primary care is delivered, whic h reinforces project Redesign Primary Care (2.3); a direct outcome of the PC MH is patient satisfac tion, which support project Redesign to Improve the Patient Experience (2.4); and through the implementation of standard protocols and achieving NCQA recognition, th e PCMH model will improve quality and efficiency (2.8). Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Nix Healthcare System 627 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health System Plan for Learning Collaborative: Following completion of the RHP plan, University Health System (anchor) will facilitate the formation of working groups of performing provi ders who are pursuing similar projects. These working groups will develop their learning co llaborative structure which may include goals, regular meetings, site visits , conference calls, communication plan development, organizing learning event, and adopt metrics to measure success. Project Valuation: The valuation of CHRISTUS projects use a met hod which ranks the importance of each projects based several key factors. First, CHRISTUS cons idered the extent the project helps further the goals of the Waiver, which are to (a) enhance acce ss to health care, (b) in crease the quality of care, and (c) improve the cost-effectiveness of care provided in the community. Next, CHRISTUS considered the degree of need for th e project in the community as addressed and identified in the Community Needs Assessment. The size of the required investment was also considered, which included considerations of pe rsonnel, equipment, time and complexity as well as the cost of the time, effort, and clinical resources involved in implementing the project. Finally, CHRISTUS reflected on the scope of the project: the number of patients that would be affected, including the type of patients; the number of patient visits or encounters; how many providers or staff members would be added; the costs that would be avoided as a result of the project; and the ripple effect the project would have on all members of the healthcare system. These factors were weighed agains t the amount of funding available. We believe this approach is the best methodology available to assess the imp act of the project, th e investment of the performing provider and the overall value to the community to the extent community resources are available to help fund DSRIP projects. Fina l project valuation and f unding distribution across categories was then determined based on the va luation provisions in the Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol . Medical homes are one of the most effective and proven methods to coordinate primary care and lower costs by reducing unnecessary or duplicative medical proce dures - thus medical homes will allow CHRISTUS Santa Rosa to directly addr ess one of the three main goals of the Waiver. Additionally, Region 6 has a demonstrated need fo r an increase in primary care capacity, which is mitigated by the establishment of medical homes. 628 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health System 020844901.2.1 PASS 1 2.1.2 2.1.2.

With a combined total of 496 beds, CSRHS currently serves the San Antonio and New Braunfels markets which has a total population of 1.9 million. Intervention(s) : The goal of this project is to implem ent a post-discharge transitions program to help patients make a smooth tran sition from the inpatient to the post-acute setting. This project will create smooth transitions of care from inpatient to outpatient settings or to alternative post- acute settings so that patients being discharged understand the care regi men, have follow-up care scheduled, and are at reduced ri sk for avoidable readmissions. Need for the project : Currently, this program does not exis t at CSRHS. By implementing this intervention, CSR will improve care transitions by providing patients with tools and support that promote knowledge and self-management of their c ondition as they move from hospital to home. Target population : This project will focus on patients with the Principal diagnosis of congestive heart failure (CHF), pneumonia (PN) and acute myo cardial infarction (AMI). Nearly 11% of the population in this service area is over the age of 65, which is the ag e cohort most often diagnosed with these conditions. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : In the most recent 12 months, CSRHS has had an estimated 3,692 patients grouped under one of these principle diagnosis codes. This will be a new project that seeks to have 74 patients part icipating in the discharge planning program by in DY3, an additional 75 in DY4, and an additional 77 in DY5. CSRHS expects that approximately 10% of the patients served will be Medicare, Medicaid or indigent. Category 3 outcomes: [IT-3.2] The goal is to decrease the Congestive Hear t Failure 30 day readmission rate. Targets will be determined based on the baseline established in DY3. Project Description: The goal of this project is to implement a post-discharge transitions program to help patients make a smooth transition from the inpatient to the outpatient setting. This project will create smooth transitions of care from inpatient to outpatient settings or to alternative inpatient settings so that patients being discharged understand the care regimen, have follow-up care scheduled, and are at reduced risk for avoidable readmissions. There is a growing body of evidence that suggests discharge planni ng that begins at the time of admission to the hospital, coupled with customiz ed, focused education and programmatic follow up for 30 days post discharge, will prevent or reduce the number of unplanned re-admissions to 631 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health System the hospital. Ineffective disc harge planning, instruction and follow up for the inpatient population results in patient non-comp liance with prescribed care re gimen and often results in re- admission to the hospital. There are a number of well designed, proven di scharge planning/care transitions programs available for use in the hosp ital setting. This project will utilize the Care Transitions Intervention designe d with funding from the John A Hartford and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The Care Transitions Interventi on was designed in res ponse to the need for a patient-centered, interdisciplinary intervention that addresses continuity of care across multiple settings and practitioners. The model is composed of the following components : A patient centered record that consists of the essential elements for facilitating productive interdisciplinary commun ication during the care transition referred to as the \"Personal Health Re cord.\" A structured checklist, the \"Discharge Preparation Checklist\" of critical activities design ed to empower patients before discharge from the hospital. A patient self-activ ation and management session with a \"Transitions Coach\" in the hospital, designed to help patients and family understand and apply the first two elements. And, finally Transition Coach follow up visits to the home and/or Skilled Nursing Facility as well as accompanying phone calls to sustain the first thre e components and provide continuity across the transition. The Care Transitions Intervention focuses on four conceptual areas, refe rred to as the Four Pillars: 1. Medication Self-Management 2. Dynami c Patient Centered Record 3. Follow-up and 4. Red Flags. The Transitions Coach is an RN trained in the Care Transitions Intervention program to be adept at the use of the tools and the process. Goals and Relationship to Regional Goals The overall goal will be to re duce unplanned re-admissions fo r targeted patient populations, specifically congestive heart fail ure, pneumonia and acute myocar dial infarction. Unplanned re- admissions are costly to the pr ovider, our government and to the patient/consumer. Unplanned, avoidable re-admissions consume a significant amount of healthcare resources and can be reduced if discharge planning is done in a co mprehensive, coordinated manner in which the patient and family are empowered through knowledge to successfully manage their disease. The successful implementation of the Care Transitions Intervention will reduce health care costs for the RHP, CHRISTUS Santa Rosa and the patient and family. This project meets the following regional goals: Triple Aim: assuring patient s receive high quality and pa tient-centered care, in the most cost effective ways Further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system Improve Outcomes while containing cost growth. 5-Year Expected Outcome for Provider and Patients: As previously stated, the primary goal of this project is to significantly reduce unplanned re- admissions for targeted patients populations. The pr oject will be piloted at the CHRISTUS Santa Rosa New Braunfels campus with a focus on patie nts with the Principal diagnosis of congestive 632 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health System heart failure (CHF), pneumonia (PN) and acute myo cardial infarction (AMI). Once successfully implemented at New Braunfels, this program will be implemented at each adult campus. In the implementation of this project, CSRHS will endeavor for continuous quality improvement by monitoring the patient volumes and patient utili zation to ensure that progress is being made towards meeting the project milestones. A dditionally, CSRHS will ensure that its care transitions program makes ongoing efforts to meet or exceed all nationally recognized protocol or quality benchmarks for care transitions/discharge planning. Starting Point/Baseline: As of June 30, 2012 the regional, \"predicted\" re -admission rate (as prov ided and calculated by CMS as part of the Value Based Purchasing repo rting) is as follows: AMI - PN - 15.6%. As the number of patients receiving enhanced, appropriate discharge and follow up care increases, it is anticipated that these readmission rates will decrease. Rationale: When a patient's transition from the hospital to home is less than optimal, the repercussions can be far-reaching - hospital readmission, an adverse medical event, and even mortality. MedPAC estimates that the US spends $17.4 billion annuall y for Medicare re-admissions. Of that amount, an estimated $14 billion is attri buted to avoidable re-admissions. It is estimated that 18% of Medicare patients are re-admitted within 30 days. According to the Community Needs Assessment, th e state of Texas ranks last in the nation on health care quality. Furthermore, RHP 6 has iden tified chronic disease as a key issue that must be addressed. The evidence demonstrates that re-admissions in these patient populations can be prevented when patients and families are appropr iately educated, when patients and families participate in the creation of thei r discharge plan, when assistance is provided to assure that the necessary post discharge services are available to the patient and family and when follow - up assistance is provided to assure that the discharge plan is bein g followed. With an organized and consistent approach to discharge in these populat ions deteriorating conditions can be identified early and appropriate interventi ons can be utilized to improve condition and prevent expensive re-admission. Additionally, beginning in federal FY 2013 hospitals will be at risk for up to a 1% reduction in all Medicare payments if they fail to reduce re-admission rates in the heart failure, pneumonia and heart attack patient populations. From a quality of care perspective, low re- admission rates correlate with overa ll clinical excellence as evidenced in a number of studies and databases. A focus on a well planned, well coordi nated and well communicated discharge plan will improve the coordination and effectiveness of care and care transition from hospital to home or skilled nurs ing facility. This project will involve the development, implementation and evaluation of standardized protocols and evidence-based care delivery to im prove care transition. The core components are as follows: a) Review best practices from a range of models (e.g. RED, BOOST, STAAR, INTERACT, Coleman, Naylor, GRACE, BRIDGE, etc.); the proposed program adapt evidence-based best practices from other similar programs to assure smooth program implementation and to achieve improvements in readmission rates. b) Analysis of the key drivers of 30-day readmi ssions using a chart review tool (e.g. the 633 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health System Institute for Healthcare Improvemen ts (IHI) State Action on Avoidable Re- hospitalizations (STAAR tool ) and patient interviews: This program will build in a comprehensive data collection and review process to allow us to assess adherence to program objectives and to monitor impact to readmissions on an ongoing basis c) Integration of information systems so that continuity of care for patients is enabled: The program will utilize the hospital's existing information systems to coordinate the inpatient and post acute care process, so that all caregivers are aw are of the patient's status and compliance with discharge instructions. d) Development of a system to identify a patients being discharged potentially at risk of needing acute care services within 30-60 days: The program will utilize the hospital's existing information systems to coordinate th e inpatient and post acute care process, so that all caregivers are awar e of the patient's status a nd compliance with discharge instructions. e) Implementation of discharge planning program and post discharge support program: the program contemplates developing a comp rehensive discharge planning and post discharge support component, which will use in formation systems to maintain patient data and monitor results. f) Development of a cross-continuum team co mprised of clinical and administrative representatives from acute care, skilled nursing, ambulatory care, health centers, and home care providers: program will put in place a full c ontinuum of post acute services where post and hospital caregivers can effectiv ely communicate about patient status post discharge to avoid potential readmissions to the hospital. g) Quality improvement for using methods such as rapid cycle improvement. Activities may include, but are not limited t o, identifying project impacts, identifying \"lessons learned\", opportunities to scale all or part of the project to a broader patient population, and identifying key challenges asso ciated with expansion of th e project, including special considerations for sa fety-net populations: we will implement a system that allows us to track the number of patients, types of patie nts, utilization of inpatient and outpatient resources, patient outcome measures, which wi ll provide us data to measure performance and initiate rapid cycle changes to continually improve our processes. Three major milestones were selected to ensure that this project achieves the intended results: 1) Implement standardized ca re transition process: The goal is to implement this process in a total of three hospitals between DY2 through DY5. The first implementation will occur in DY2, with the next two occurring in DYs 4 and 5. 2) Develop a staffing and implementation plan to accomplish the goal s/objectives of the care transitions program: a critical component to the success of this project will be staff training. This metric will ensure that an a ppropriate plan is established and implemented to ensure successful project implementation. 3) Implement standard care transition pro cess in specified patient populations: this metric will provide the number of patient s in a defined populations receiving care according to the implemented protocol. Unique community need identificati on numbers the project addresses: CN.1 - Texas ranks last in the nation on hea lth care quality. RHP 6 is challenged to deliver improved quality and patient satisfaction. 634 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health System CN.2 - A high prevalence of chr onic disease and rela ted health dispariti es require greater prevention efforts and improved management of patients with chronic conditions. Leading causes of death in RHP 6 include ca rdiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. How the project represents a new initiative or significantly enhances an existing delivery system reform initiative: Currently, this program does not exist at CSRH S. By implementing this intervention, CSR will improve care transitions by provi ding patients with tools and support that promote knowledge and self-management of their condition as they move from hospital to home. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-3 Potentially Preventable Re-adm issions - 30 day readmission rates IT-3.2, Congestive Heart Failure 30 Day Readmission Rate The number of readmissions (for patients 18 ye ars and older), for any cause, within 30 days of discharge from the index HF admission. Reasons/rationale for select ing the outcome measures: The relationship between hospita l readmission rates and quality of care is well-documented. This project is focused on im proving care transitions by providing patients with tools and support that promote knowledge and self-management of th eir condition as they move from the hospital to home. There is a growing body of evidence that suggests discharge planni ng that begins at the time of admission to the hospital, coupled with customized, focused educ ation and programmatic follow up for 30 days post discharge will preven t or reduce the number of unplanned hospital re- admissions. Congestive Heart Failure is one of the principal diagnoses that will be targeted in this program, which makes this improve ment target a suitable measurement. Relationship to other Projects: The Care Transitions - Intervention Nurse Program supports/reinforces several Category 1 and 2 projects: there is a si gnificant focus on chronic disease mana gement (1.3 & 2.2); this project will create smooth transitions of care fr om inpatient to outpatient setti ngs or to alternative inpatient settings so that patients be ing discharged understand the ca re regimen, have follow-up care scheduled, and are at reduced risk for avoidabl e readmissions; which supp orts the primary goals of project (2.4) Redesign the Patient Experience and (2.8) Apply Process Improvement Methodology to Improve Quality/Efficiency, and it helps patient become more involved in their own health care which reinforces the primary objective of (2.14) Implement person-centered wellness self-management strategies and self direct ed financing models that empower consumers to take charge of their own health care. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Guadalupe Regional Medical Center 635 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health System Plan for Learning Collaborative: Following completion of the RHP plan, University Health System (anchor) will facilitate the formation of working groups of performing provi ders who are pursuing similar projects. These working groups will develop their learning co llaborative structure which may include goals, regular meetings, site visits , conference calls, communication plan development, organizing learning event, and adopt metrics to measure success. Project Valuation: In valuing this project, CHRISTUS Santa Rosa took into account the extent to which a transition of the care program would potentially meet the go als of the Waiver (sup port the development of a coordinated care delivery system, improve out comes while containing costs, improve the healthcare infrastructure), the extent to whic h it would address the community needs, the population served, and resources and cost necessary to implement the project. A program to support discharge planning will meet one of the three main goals of the Waiver by coordinating care. This type of coordination has the long term goal of reducing unnecessary healthcare costs by preventing future hospitali zation due to inappropriate post-discharge placement. This project would also meet a specific need in the community to coordinate care and promote primary care. 636 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health System 020844901.2.2 PASS 1 2.12.1 2.12.1.

Intervention(s) : The project would implement improvements in transitioning patients and coordination of care from inpatient to outpatients, post-acute care, and home care settings . The Transitional Care Program will institute an evidence based risk assessment tool to id entify patients who are at highest risk for 30 Potentially Preventable Re-admissions/Admissions (PPR/PPA). The Transitional Care program will provide for a trained Transitional Care Coordinator as well as established policies and procedures. The goal will be to proactively e ducate the targeted populat ion, monitor and support them through the discharge process to the home, and ensure necessary resources are referred. Need for the project : There is currently no existing community program with dedicated resources designed to act as a patient advoc ate and liaison in transition from acute care to the home. The Transitional Care Program will improve the quality of life of the service area as well as reduce costs by implementing strategies to promote both wellness and patient empowerment. These initiatives will reduce the financial impact of potentially preventable admissions, potentially preventable re-admissions, and ER visits. Target population : GRMC has a CHF readmission rate in the f ourth (worst) quartile in the state of Texas for the period of 2006-2009, as publicly reported by CMS. GRMC will develop a Transitional Care Program to assist with care transitions and medication management Targeting patients with a primary diagnosis of CHF, CO PD, DM, Pneumonia, as well as being highly sensitive to those uninsured, covered by Medica id, or at / below the 2012 HHS poverty level. Based on the capture diagnosis li sted above we anticipate servi ng approximately 540 patients. The high risk patients, as determined by comple tion of a High Risk Assessment Tool, will add approximately 220 patients per year. An estimated 15-20% of patients served are expected to be Medicaid/Indigent. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project seeks to devel op and institute a Transitional Care program, establish baselines, and utilize an evidence based screenin g tool by DY2. By DY 5 we also seek to increase patients enrolled and se rved by the GRMC Transitional Care Program by 35% from the year 2 baseline. Category 3 outcomes: IT-3.1- All cause 30 Day readmission Rate - Our goal is to Achieve a 5% reduction from baseline in unplanne d all-cause readmissions for pa tients 18 years and older as a percentage of total admissions for same age group by DY5. 639 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Guadalupe Regional Medical Center Project Description: Guadalupe Regional Medical Center seeks to im plement / expand a Care Transitions Program The project would implement improvements in transitioning patients and coordination of care from inpatient to outpatients, post-acute care, and home care settings. The Transitional Care Program will institute an evidence based risk a ssessment tool to identify patients who are at highest risk for 30 Potentia lly Preventable Re-admissions /Admissions (PPR/PPA). The Transitional Care program will provide for a trai ned Transitional Care Coordinator as well as established policies and procedur es. The goal will be to proa ctively educate the targeted population, monitor and support them through the discharge process to the home, and ensure necessary resources are referred. The Transitional Care Team has the potential to institute the LACE risk assessment tool on all target population patients. The Transitional Care program will ensure identified target population high risk patients are referred to the Transiti onal Care Program. Through the intervention of the program via the dedicate health care worker ((Tra nsitional Care Coordinator) we will have a material positive effect on the PPA and PPR. GRMC has a CHF readmission rate in the fourth (worst) quartile in the state of Texas for the period of 2006- 2009, as publicly reported by CMS. GRMC will de velop a Transitional Care Program to assist with care transitions and medication management of CHF, COPD, DM, and Pneumonia patients. This program will include: a dedicated resour ces which will utilize and/or facilitate: Discharge checklists Hand off communication tools Pre and post-discharge medication reconciliation/management plans Weight and blood pressure monitoring A focus on health literacy and teach back Physician appointment a ssistance and monitoring Coordination of community resources In home and phone follow-up Quarterly meetings with local nursing homes and assisted living facilities in order to discuss identif ied problems Solve issues related to avoida ble hospital admission/readmission We propose to target the commun ities serviced by Guadalupe Regional Medical Center. This has historically been Seguin and adjacent communitie s with Guadalupe and Adjacent Southern county populations. Goals and Relationship to Regional Goals: The Transitional Care Program at Guadalupe Regiona l Medical Center seeks to promote the Triple Aim of improving the health of our population, e nhancing the patient expe rience of care, and reducing the per capita cost of care. Through the development of a Transitional Care program, targeting patients with a prim ary diagnosis of CHF, COPD, DM , Pneumonia, as well as being 640 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Guadalupe Regional Medical Center highly sensitive to those uninsured, covered by Medicaid, or at / below the 2012 HHS poverty level, GRMC will have a positive material effect on said Triple Aim goals. GRMC has identified a gap in care transitions that create potentially preventable readmissions. Through a Transitional Care Coordinator and established policy and procedures GRMC will educate the targeted population, monitor and support through the discharge process to the home, and ensure necessary resources are referred. Project Goals: As this project moves forward GRMC will identify and implement appropriate best practices from the Partnership for Patients (P 4P) initiative- Texas H ealthcare Engagement Network (HEN) as well as from other progr ams and models of care documented in the literature. Increase number of patients enro lled in Transitional Care Program Reduce % of target population PPA and PPR This project meets the following regional goals: Transform health care delivery from a disease- focused model of episodic care to a patient- centered, coordinated delivery model that improves patien t satisfaction and health outcomes, reduces unnecessary or duplicative services, and builds on the accomplishments of our existing health care system; and Develop a regional approach to health car e delivery that leverages and improves on existing programs and infrastructure, is res ponsive to patient need s throughout the entire region, and improves health care out comes and patient satisfaction. This project address RHP 6 goals by: \"ser ving those who are low income or without insurance and or Suffering with a chronic disease which increa ses the likelihood of preventable admissions and preventable re-a dmissions\". The transi tional Care Program will also address the goal of improving access to primary and specialty care, as well as improving the management of patients with ch ronic disease. This will be accomplished by having dedicated resources, evidence based id entification tools, es tablished policy and procedures, and post hospital follo w up / monitoring protocols. Challenges: Communication of patient needs between the acu te care setting and post- acute care setting is challenging. additionally, patie nts discharged home may have difficulty following discharge instructions due to lack of understanding and/or a lack of resources and access. Focus on Health literacy with in the service area has not been tr aditionally targeted. The primary challenge for this project will be to engage and build trust with patients. Targeted communities have historically been difficult to penetrate, but with proper inte rdisciplinary training, and oversight by a dedicated team, the project has a high likelihood of success. In particular, cultural competency training and the involvement of a variety of innovative provide r types within the care team will ensure GRMC addresses the full spectrum of the participants' needs. 5-Year Expected Outcome for Provider and Patients: 641 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Guadalupe Regional Medical Center The 5 year expected outcome is a 35% increase from year 2 baseline in patients enrolled and served by the GRMC Transitional Care Program. Decrease the number of PPA a nd PPR by 5% in year 5. Starting Point/Baseline: The pilot Transitional Care Program began on Ju ly 17, 2012 and as of October 3rd there were 21 patients being followed by the Transitional Care Coor dinator. The patients were referred to this program through the GRMC Inpatient Case Manageme nt Department. During this time period the Transitional Care Coordinator ha s performed the following patient encounters: 10 visits in the hospital setting, 6 post-hosp italization visits in th e home, and 50 post-discharge phone calls. To date (9/24/12) there have been no re admissions among this group of patients. The GRMC Transitional Care Program currently consists of one RN who reports to the Director of Home Health Services. Due to the infancy status of this program less than 2% of the hospital nurses have been educated about the process. Likewise, less than 2% of the hospitalists and primary care physicians have been educated to date. Rationale: Guadalupe County has a largely rural service area with an es tablished population possessing morbidities and co-morbidities which have sign ificant potential for causing unnecessary utilization of Emergency Room and inpatient services. Thes e morbidities include (but are not limited to) CHF, COPD, DM and pneumonia. In addition, lim ited public transportatio n, a high number of un/under-insured, and serious gaps in health li teracy increase the potential for non-compliance with medication regimens and follow-up care. Also, The Transitional Care Programs at GRMC will serve to compensate for the health provide r shortage identified in Guadalupe County. The GRMC Transitional Care program is starting in the early stages of development. GRMC will develop a Transitional Care Model (TCM) which will address Unique Community Need CN.2 - A high prevalence of chronic disease and related health disp arities require greater prevention efforts and improved management of patients with chronic conditions. Leading causes of death in RHP 6 include cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. The model will integrate transitional care into the discharge process thereby ensuring the id entified population is proactively educated on their chronic disease a nd prepared prior to discharge home. Patients identified as high risk for readmission or Em ergency Room visits will be referred to the Transitional Care Coordinator who will monitor the patient for at least thirty days after discharge from the hospital. This intervention may involve phone calls and/or home visit follow-up and assistance with medication management and the scheduling of primary care appointments based upon individual patient situation and need. The GRMC Transitional care model is in its early stages of deve lopment. There is currently no existing community program with dedicated resour ces designed to act as a patient advocate and liaison in transition from acute care to the home. The Transitional Care Program will improve the quality of life of the service area as well as re duce costs by implementing strategies to promote both wellness and patient empowerment. These in itiatives will reduce the financial impact of potentially preventable admissions , potentially preventable re-admissions, and ER visits. These 642 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Guadalupe Regional Medical Center reductions will contribute to improvement in the qua lity of life for the patients served. Guadalupe County is expected to recognize continued population growth, which will likely exacerbate current health challenges. These challenges include lim ited access to primary and specialty care, unmet mental and behavioral health needs, and high prevalence of chronic disease. The projected Medicaid expansion and use of health insurance exchanges may have significant impact on the health status of residents and related outcomes of RHP 6 initiativ es. The opportunity to implement transformative projects through the 1115 waiver funding will help RHP 6 a ddress the needs of the GRMC served community. As part of the CQI core component GRMC will seek to work collaboratively with other providers. Sharing ideas and improving existing practices w ill be the primary focus of the collaborations. This will be noted in the Year 4 Milestone 3 (P-12.1). In addition, as part of the CQI component, GRMC plans to conduct bi-weekly meetings, conference calls, or we binars organized by the RHP. All webinars, meetings, conference calls etc. will be documented to include copies of agendas, power point slides etc. The investment in learning and sharing of ideas will be central to our goal of continuous learning and improvement. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): IT-3.2 Congestive Heart Failure 30 Day r eadmission rate-Stand-alone measure. Reasons/rational for selecting outcome measures Demographically the GRMC service area has modest to high incidence of primary and secondary DX of CHF and morbidities relating to complications of CHF. As evidenced by Coleman (\"Falling Through the Cracks: Challenges and Opportunities for Improving Transitional Care for Persons with Continuous Complex Care Needs\" and Co leman, Parry et al (\" The Care Transition Intervention: a patient centered approach to ensu ring effective transfers be tween sites of geriatric care\", best practices have been identified which contribute to the triple aim when applied to patients transitioning from the hospital to their residence. Focusing on this outcome will ensure our target population, with partic ular interest in those at/below the 2012 HHS poverty line or who are under / uninsured, are appropriately educated , monitored, and connected to applicable and required resources. This will decrease PPA and PP R, thereby reducing cost, increasing patient satisfaction, and improving long term outcomes. Relationship to other Projects: The implementation of a Transitional Care pr ogram will provide the organization with the structure and processes needed to address many key issues related to quality patient care, patient satisfaction, and healthcare cost containment. The Transitional Care Program at GRMC will support the goals identified in the following RHP projects: 1.3 - Implement a Chronic Disease Management Registry 2.2 - Expand Chronic Care Management Models 2.4 - Redesign to Improve Patient Experience 2.5 - Redesign for Cost Containment 2.6 - Implement Evidence-based Health Promotion Programs 2.8 - Apply Process Improvement Methodol ogy to Improve Quality/Efficiency 2.10 - Use of Palliative Care Programs 2.11 - Conduct Medication Management 2.14 - Implement person-centered wellness self-m anagement strategies and self-directed 643 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Guadalupe Regional Medical Center financing models that empower consumers to take charge of their own health Furthermore the GRMC Transitional Care plan wi ll support and reinforce the following category 4 population focused measures: RD-1 - Potentially preventa ble readmissions-Done through a comprehensive pre-discharge education and post-discharge interaction with emphasis on medication management and physician follow up. RD-2-Potentially Preventable Admissions-T hrough community outreach and education provided by the Transitional Care Coordina tor we will minimize the likelihood of PPA. RD-3 -Potentially Preventable Compli cations- Through follow-up, monitoring, and education pre and post-discharge GRMC will proactively identify and address any areas that may lead to PPC. RD-4 - Emergency Department-A comprehensive Transitional Care program will ensure the ER is utilized in appropriate fashion. Through the efforts of the transitional care program, mainly in the areas of medicati on management, resource identification, and appropriate physician follow-up, a reducti on in ER utilization is projected. RD-5 -Patient Centered Care- The transitiona l care program will s upport Patient Centered Healthcare by ensuring the needs of the pati ent are prioritized in the transition from hospital to home. This will be noted by the improvement in patient satisfaction scores and outcomes. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Two CHRISTUS Santa Rosa hospitals in our region will be focusing on Implementing / expanding Transitional Care. GRMC will reach out to these facilities to establish a collaborative support network. In fact we have identified milest one which will require face to face collaboration with another facility. This metric is: Milestone 4 [P-12-Partcipate in fa ce-to-face learning at least twice per year with other providers in the RHP to prom ote collaborative learning around similar projects. At each face-to-face m eeting, all providers s hould identify and agree upon several improvements. Each provider s hould publicly commit to implementing these improvements. Plan for Learning Collaborative: GRMC and RHP 6 are committed to transforming h ealth care in our region and throughout the service area. University Health System, as the RHP 6 anchor, will promote and facilitate learning collaboratives. GRMC will propose projects and provide feedback throughout the development of the RHP Plan which will supports and reinforce related projec ts and interventions within the RHP Plan. Following completion of the RHP Plan, University H ealth System will facilitate the formation of working groups of performing providers who are pursuing similar projects. These working groups will develop their learning collaborative st ructure which may include the following: Identify participants Establish Learning Co llaborative goals Develop a calendar of regular meetings, site visits, and/or conference calls Develop a plan to communicate ideas, data , and successes across th e region and state 644 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Guadalupe Regional Medical Center Organize a learning event and inv ite experts and other Performi ng Providers from outside the region to share knowledge and best practices Adopt metrics to measure success University Health System will s eek to provide facilitation and administrative assistance as needed to ensure the success of these endeavors. The RHP 6 website will be available to the Learning Collaboratives to network and sh are ideas, challenges, and success stories with colleagues. RHP 6 hopes to make significant transformational progre ss on its project milestones to achieve waiver goals and share what we learn with the rest of the State. Project Valuation: Project 2.12.2- Implement/Expand a Care Tran sitions was assigned high value through consideration of the following criteria: Achieve Waiver Goals: The project will address triple aim, further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system, improve out comes while containing costs, and improve the healthcare model which serves uninsured, Medicaid, and low income residents of the GRMC service area. Address Community Need-The project will address multiple community needs with high impact results. Project Scope-The project will touch numerous patients whose healthcare can be improved through the tenets designed into the program. As such, multifaceted benefits will be recognized to include but not limited to: co st savings, patient centered care, improved quality of life, and reduction in PPA and PPR. 645 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Guadalupe Regional Medical Center 138411709. 2.1 PASS 1 2.12.2 N/A 2.12.2 Implement/Expand Care Transitions Program Guadalupe Regional Medical Center TPI - 138411709 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 138411709.3.2 3.IT-3.1 All Cause Unplanned 30-day Read mission rate for Patients 18 Years and Older Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P-2]: Implement standardized care transition processes Metric 1 [P-2.1]: Care Transition processes Baseline/Goal: submission of protocols Data Source: Policies and procedures of care transitions program materials Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $ 1,159,045 Milestone 2 [P-5]:-Using a validated risk assessment tool, create a patient identification system.

Intervention(s) : The Patient Navigation project will identi fy patients with high utilization of ED services, and assist to match resources; such as physicians, clinics, teaching, behavioral health and prescription assistance. Through decreasing over utilization of chronic i ssues, the ED will be freed up to care for patients with acute illness and injury. Need for the project : Currently the ED is over utilized by patients with chronic medical conditions that could be stabilized through educ ation and ongoing medical care through a clinic or PCP, as well as those pati ents that frequently utilize the ED for non-emergent care. Target population : The target populations are those patien ts with high frequency use of the ED for chronic medical conditions, non-emergent medical needs and behavioral health. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : In calendar year 2012, the Emergency Department saw 36,433 patients of which 30% were classified as eith er Medicaid or Indigent. Also out of those 36,433 patients, approximately 35% of those visits were classified as non-urgent. There were also approximately 9,500 patient en counters that didn't have a prim ary care physician identified. This project expects to enroll 50 % of identifie d patients in the Patient Navigation System and and increase the number of referrals to a PCP for patients without a PCP by 50%. Category 3 outcomes: IT-9.2 - The focus is on Reducing Emergency Department visits for target conditions, behavioral health/subs tance abuse. By implementing the Patient Navigation System, GRMC ED would like to decrease the unnecessary ED visits for behavioral health/substance abuse by 3% by year 5. This will provide patients with behavioral health/substance abuse issues the resources needed to effec tively manage their conditions. Project Description: Guadalupe Regional Medical Center seeks to establish a patient na vigation system to assist high utilizers of the ED to receive coordinated, ti mely and appropriate healthcare services. Development of the Navigation Program will identify high utilizers of ED services. A multidisciplinary care team will be developed fo r patients enrolled in the program, care plans will be developed and each patient will be assign ed a patient navigator to assist patient in obtaining PCP, behavioral healthcare, specialty care as needed and community resources. The role of the multidisciplinary team is to review potential enrollees, review needs and develop and implement care plans. The team is made up ER staff & Medical Director , Case Management, and a Licensed Clinical Social Worker. The goal of this project is to utilize community health workers and case managers to provide enhanced social support and culturally competent care to 649 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Guadalupe Regional Medical Center vulnerable and/or high-risk pati ents, to divert non-urgent care from the Emergency Department to site-appropriate locations. The program woul d also meet regional goals, along with the RHP and CMS's triple aims to improve care for indi viduals; improve health for the population; and lower costs through improvements. The current challenges are high utilizers are give n referrals for community resources and follow up care; many do not follow up with the referral a nd continue to receive care through the ED. GRMC believes that a patient navigation system will allow for timelier ED services for emergency situations, reduce costs and decrease the amount of fina ncial loss due to inappropriate and possibly unfunded ED visits. The program's 5-year expected outcome is to increase patient enrollment in patient navigator system by 50% of identified patients of the targ eted population, as well as a 50% increase in the number of ED patients referred to a PCP who are documented as not having a PCP. The program also hopes to have a reduction in unnecessary ED use related to behavioral health/substance abuse by 3% of baseline by DY5 as referenced in the Category 3 Outcome Measure. Starting Point/Baseline: In August 2012, the preliminary workgroup that included ER staff, Case Management, and Social Services met to discuss ideas geared towards decreasing unnecessary ER visits by identifying high utilizers of the ED. Through Meditech reports, chart review, and as we ll as staff education of navigation project, patients are being identified as potential enrollees in the navigation system. To date a policy and procedure ha s been drafted to identify and enroll patients. As of October 2012, 4 patients have been identified as frequent utilizers of emergency se rvices for chronic pain management. 1 patient has been enrolled in the pr ogram with an identified care plan in place. Rationale: Guadalupe County has a largely rural service area with an es tablished population possessing morbidities and co-morbidities which have significant potential for causing unnecessary utilization of the ED. Patient navigators will help patients and their families navigate the healthcare system and the obstacles that it entails. Services provi ded by the ED patient navigators will include: facili tating more appropriate care options, coordinating care among providers, assisting with obtaini ng follow up care and maintaining relationships with providers. Community health care workers and the ER Case Manager will have close ties to the community and serve as a liaison between the community and the healthcare system. They will also possess the linguistic and cultural skills needed to c onnect with patients from underserved communities. Patient navigators will be: compassionate, sensit ive, and culturally attuned to the people; knowledgeable about the environment and health care system, and connected with critical decision makers inside the system. Project Components: Through the ED Patient Naviga tion Program, we propose to me et all required project components. a. Identify frequent ED users and use navigato rs as part of a preventable ED reduction 650 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Guadalupe Regional Medical Center program. Train health care navigators in cultural competency. Patients using the emergency department for primary care servic es, behavioral health care services, patients without a designated PCP or medical home, a nd patients with social or economic barriers to accessing primary care will be offered navi gation services. Patient Navigators will create care plans that will be associated with the patients' medical record by medical record number. These notes will include sections on reason for services, assessment, subsequent referrals and follow-up activities. Patient navigators will review the care plan with the patient and provid e a copy. All of our naviga tors will undergo training in providing culturally competent care and receive education regarding di sparities and social determinants of health, community out reach, chronic disease management, and recognizing behavioral healthcare crisis. b. Deploy innovative health care personnel, su ch as case managers/workers, community health workers and other types of health prof essionals as patient navigators. We plan to hire Patient Navigators with a background in community health, social services, mental health, or public health with experience providing direct care to disadvantaged populations. Ideally these individuals will be bilingual, from our community, and experienced in identifying community resources. c. Connect patients to primary and preventive care d. Increase access to care management and/or chronic care management - We will have regular contact with area primary care pr oviders and behavior al health for care management services, preventive care, and other educational and social services. Navigators will be available to meet with pr oviders to answer any specific questions. e. Conduct quality improvement for project using methods such as rapid cycle improvement - The navigation workgroup will design a report ing template for the Patient Navigator notes. We will create a data registry for enrolled patients to facilitate follow-up and effectiveness analysis. Reports will be run weekly by the program and shared monthly with ED staff and participating primary care providers. We will hold bi-weekly meetings with navigation workgroup and with ED provi ders quarterly to discuss opportunities for program improvement and expansion. GRMC will develop and expand a patient navi gation system which will address Unique Community Needs: CN.3 - Many residents of RHP 6 lack access to medical and dental care due to high rates of uninsured people and health care provider shortages. CN.4 - There is a shortage of high quality mental and behavioral health services that are integrated with physical healthcare services. Currently, a patient navigation program does not ex ist to guide and connect patients to more appropriate care for the non- urgent medical needs. 651 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Guadalupe Regional Medical Center Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): GRMC has chosen the stand- alone Category 3 Outcome Meas ure IT-9.2: ED Appropriate Utilization. We are going to focus on reducing Emergency Department visits for the target condition of Behavioral Health/S ubstance Abuse. The ED sees many patients who utilize the ED for non-emergent conditions such as medication refills, behavioral health problems, lack of resources relating to substance abuse, etc. The hope is that by implementing the Patient Navigation system, along with the other proj ects (1.1.2 and 2.12) being proposed by GRMC, the amount of unnecessary visits to the ED relating to behavior al health/substance abuse will decrease. Numerator: Number of patients enrolled in the navigator program who have had an ED visit or an inpatient admission Denominator: Total number of patient s enrolled in the navigator program A study completed by the Association for Community Affiliated Plans in April 2007, at least 1/3 of all ED visits are avoidable, meaning non ur gent, and therefore treat able in primary care centers. Over 18 billion dollars ar e wasted annually on avoidable ED visits. In addition, it is shown that emergency departments serving highe r proportions of patients that are Medicaid eligible or uninsured have 25% more non urgent cases presenting. In addition, Guadalupe County is fe derally designated as a mental health professional shortage area. According to a study completed by Salinsk i and Loftis (2007), Ment al health related ER visits increased 75% from 1992 to 2003. An additional example provided by MSNBC in 2009, reported in Austin Texas showed that only 9 pati ents accounted for 2700 ER visits in a one year period. Agency for Healthcare Research and Qua lity also completed a report in 2010 showing that mental disorders/substance abuse related visits equal 1 of every 8 emergency department cases. Not only is this situation traumatic for the psychiatric patient, but it also takes scarce resources away from the patien t with medical emergencies. According to the Texas Department of State h ealth services, 46% of all ER visits have a behavioral health issues as a basic or contributing factor. Relationship to other Projects: This Patient Navigator Project will work in close conjunction to the two other projects being proposed by GRMC. The first proj ect is 1.1.2; expanding care with a free clinic that offers services to the uninsured population in Segui n, Texas and the surrounding areas. Through access to this clinic, patients who normally may have sought care in the ED for non-urgent conditions have another option to seek care. We will be work ing closely with the clinic for follow-up care. The second project is 2.12; Implementing and Ex panding a Transitional Care program. This program will be of great assistance to the populat ion of patients with chronic illness who seek their primary care in the ED. By communicating with the Transi tional Care program, the needs of these patients, there may be other resources that can be offered besides coming to the ED. In addition, GRMC will also collabo rate with Bluebonnet Trails Community Services to assist in providing mental health and subs tance abuse services. Through na vigation services, GRMC with the help of Bluebonnet Trails Community Servi ces will target persons with chronic mental 652 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Guadalupe Regional Medical Center illnesses who are frequent users of the Emergency Department due to behavioral health disorders. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Unknown at this time. Plan for Learning Collaborative: GRMC and RHP 6 are committed to transforming h ealth care in our region and throughout the service area. University Health System, as the RHP 6 anchor, will promote and facilitate learning collaboratives. GRMC will propose projects and provide feedback throughout the development of the RHP Plan which will suppor t and reinforce related projects and interventions within the RHP Plan. Following completion of the RHP Plan, University H ealth System will facilitate the formation of working groups of performing providers who are pursuing similar projects. These working groups will develop their learning collaborative structure which may include the following: Identify participants Establish learning collaborative goals Develop a calendar of regular meetings, site visits, and/or conference calls Develop a plan to communicate ideas, data and successes across the region and state Organize a learning event and inv ite experts and other Performi ng Providers from outside the region to share knowledg e and best practices Adopt metrics to measure success University Health System will seek to provide facilitation and administrative assistance as needed to ensure the success of these endeavor s.

Intervention(s) : This project will provide comprehensive health screening a nd wellness education for at least 500 uninsured (tar geting Medicaid and Indigent in dividuals) employed residents of Hill Country Memorial Hospital's service area by partnering with local businesses who are not able to offer insurance to their employees or wh ose employees are unable to afford the insurance offered due to cost a nd their low incomes. Need for the project : All but one of the counties in Hill Country Memorial Hospital's service area have a higher uninsured rate than the alr eady-high Texas state rate. Gillespie County, in which the hospital is located, is home to more than 4500 uninsured individuals (27.5% of county residents), and the hospital's 8 county service ar ea has almost 30,000 without health insurance. The majority of the businesses in the county and region are small, with fewer than 50 employees, and many are farms. Of small businesses in Texa s, only 37% offer health insurance to their employees, and this region is no different. Target population : The uninsured employees (specifically targeting indigent and Medicaid- funded populations) of local businesse s which are unable to offer hea lth insurance as a benefit to their employees. We anticipate at least 500 of these individuals will be served. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : At least 500 uninsured individua ls (specifically targeting indigent and Medicaid-funded populations) have been screened for eligibility for the following screenings, and then received those as appropriate per USPSTF recommendations : Colorectal Cancer Screening, Screening and Brief Intervention for Alcohol Abuse, Cervical Cancer Screening, Screening for Diabetes, Blood pressure Screening, Screening for Lipid Disord ers, HIV Screening, Breast Cancer Screening, BMI screening for Obesity, as well as Mobility /Strength Screening, Health Risk Assessment and recommendations, Customized healthy lifestyle consult, and Customized Community Resources Consult. Beyond this, patients may receive additi onal screenings as id entified through ongoing program evaluation and target population needs assessments. Category 3 outcomes: Screening for cervical cancer will be provided for 100% of the eligible target population of 500 uninsured individuals. Screening for colorectal can cer will be provided for 100% of the eligible target population of 500 uninsur ed individuals. 657 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country Memorial Hospital Screening for high blood pressure will be provided for 100% of th e eligible target population of 500 uninsured individuals (speci fically targeting indigent a nd Medicaid-funde d populations). Goal: Provide health screening and wellness educa tion for underserved residents of Hill Country Memorial Hospital's service area. Challenges Hill Country Memorial Hospital's service area in cludes 8 counties, all but one of which have a higher uninsured rate than the already-high Texas state rate. Gillespie County, in which the hospital is located, is ho me to more than 4500 uninsured indivi duals (27.5% of county residents), and the hospital's 8 county se rvice area has almost 30,000 without health insurance. The majority of the businesses in the county and regi on are small, with fewer than 50 employees, and many are farms. Of small businesses in Texas, only 37% offer health insurance to their employees, and this region is no different. Even if insurance becomes availa ble to many more individuals in the years ahead, many in these underserved and remote counties will not have access to a local hea lthcare provider. It is already a major challenge for the community physicians to provide needed screening services to the currently-insured population. There are simply not enough licensed independent practitioners in this more-rural region of the state. Preventive care and screenings are low on the pr iority list of many of th ese individuals, who are faced with more pressing current concerns and who do not typically seek medical care except in major illness. Addressing the Challenges Hill Country Memorial has begun to pilot a we llness education and screening program as a additional service of the hospita l, available to businesses wishing to offer their insured employees an employment \"perk\". The vision for the DSRIP project is to develop a companion program that is specifically targeted to th e uninsured employed. This program would focus on the unique health needs and concerns of those w ho may have not had regular health care in many years. Screening services and wellness educatio n would be offered by Hill Country Memorial Hospital staff members and closely linked to community resources th rough a strong case management component. It will be important to insure that this vulnerable population has ongoing access to any needed hea lthcare identified through the sc reening process. The goal of the program will be to provide United States Preventive Services Task Force-recommended screening services along with we llness education and support to employees of local businesses that have uninsured employees, as well as thei r spouses or partners. The program would be offered at a very low cost to the business owner to offer as a bonus or incentive to employees and their partners at no cost to them. The goal of th e program is to start at least 500 individuals on the program by the end of the fifth dem onstration year of the project. This project targets low income, underserve d and uninsured indivi duals who would not otherwise have access to preventive health care. It supports local busin esses who would like to provide opportunities for their employees to re ceive healthcare servic es, but cannot provide health insurance options at all or those that are affordable to their low-income employees. Partnering with the hospital and DSRIP program will allow them to offer health screening and wellness counseling services to their employees and their families, and support them in connecting to ongoing care as needed in the comm unity. It also encourages individuals who may not value preventive care to strongl y consider it since it is bei ng promoted by their employer and colleagues. 658 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country Memorial Hospital The five year expected outcome for our community is that at least 500 uninsured individuals have been screened for eligibility for the follo wing screenings, and then received those as appropriate per USTPSTF recommendations: Colorectal Cancer Screening Screening and Brief Intervention for Alcohol Abuse Cervical Cancer Screening Screening for Diabetes Blood pressure Screening Screening for Lipid Disorders HIV Screening Breast Cancer Screening BMI screening for Obesity Additional screeni ngs and services Mobility/Strength Screening Health Risk Assessment and recommendations Customized healthy lifestyle consult Customized Community Resources Consult While the first year will be at a zero or nominal cost to the employer, bu sinesses will be offered the opportunity to continue in the program at a low cost, providing needed screenings and wellness education to th eir employees annually. Regional Goals Triple Aim: assuring patients receive high-quality and patient-centered care, in the most cost effective ways Improve the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of our counties Further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system Improve outcomes while containing cost growth This project directly impacts all of the region 6 goals. First, th e provision of needed screening services to the key target populati on in the region is being provided at a relatively low cost, given that much of the needed resources already ex ist within the hospital. Expanding staff hours, increasing use of existing space and equipment, and building on patient records systems that already exist allow for economies of scale. Th e services will be provided by highly-trained professionals with a reputation for quality and in a patient-centered way th at also supports local businesses. Many of the target population will not have previously accessed the local resources for receiving healthcare in the safety net or fo r finding funding for their care. Care coordination will be a key service to get these individuals started in a patient centered medical home. Starting Point/Baseline: While Hill Country Memorial Ho spital's companion program for the insured employed of large businesses has had a number of patients complete the program, this pr ogram targeted to the uninsured population has not yet been started. Additional information acquired through outreach and implementation-planning efforts will be key to designing a program that meets this population's unique and ongoing needs. No care providers have yet been trained as the program is still in development. 659 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country Memorial Hospital Rationale: Reasons for Selecting the Project The strength and productivity of our workfo rce and student population depends on the good health of all residents. Unfort unately, many have jobs where hea lth insurance is not offered, and many Texas industries are reduci ng health care coverage. Te xas has a large and diverse population of uninsured and underi nsured individuals, 80 percent of whom work or have a working family member. Under the Affordable Ca re Act, many more people will have access to affordable coverage in 2014. However, due to gaps in programs and the supreme court ruling that a Medicaid expansion is not mandatory, a si zeable population of Texans will continue to be uninsured. The uninsured are less likely to rece ive adequate care and often when they do, it comes later, with serious consequences such as increased mortality and lower quality of life. Furthermore, the uninsured and unde rinsured are less like ly to receive the pr eventive care they need. In addition, small businesses with less than 50 employees constitu te 73 percent of all businesses in Texas. Of these small busine sses, only 37 percent offer insuran ce. This is significantly below the 45 percent national average. Furthermore, onl y 35 percent of employees in small businesses that offered insurance actually enrolled, in comparison with 63 percent of employees in large businesses (IOM, 2003). This could be a result of small businesses offering less appealing or more expensive packages. The uninsured are more likely to be hospitalized for problems that could have been prevented had they received appropriate and timely outpati ent care. In the end, the cost of not seeking preventive care to individuals, employers, and communities, is staggering. Uncompensated care provided by Texas hospitals increased to more than $7.7 billion in 2003 from $3 billion in 1993 (Center for Health Statistics, 2004). Overall, the uninsured receive le ss preventive care, are diagnosed at more advanced stages of disease, and once diagnosed, receive less therapeu tic care than do the insured. Thus, lack of adequate insurance leads to premature death. The case of cancer, the second leading cause of death in Texas, is illustrative of this point. In dividuals who are poor, lack health insurance, or otherwise have inadequate access to quality cance r treatment experience higher cancer incidence, higher mortality rates and poorer survival rates (IOM, 2002). Unique Community Need This project addresses two key RHP community n eeds. The first is CN.2: \"A high prevalence of chronic disease and related health disparities require greater prevention efforts and improved management of patients with chronic conditions . Leading causes of d eath in RHP 6 include cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes.\" The project will very direct ly affect the health disparity in prevention efforts, specifically by pr oviding screening for chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. If these diseases are caught in the pre-disease or early stages, interventions and outcomes are much less costly to the i ndividual and community. The second key RHP need that this project addr esses is CN.3: \"Many residents of RHP 6 lack access to medical and dental care due to high rates of uninsurance and health care provider shortages.\" The project is specifically targeted to populations who are uninsured and takes place within the context of a region that has a provi der shortage in uninsured and publically funded patient primary care. Because there simply are not other options at the moment, this program will be an important \"first step\" into preventive care and wellness educati on, followed by navigation to sources of care for the long-term. New Initiative for the Performing Provider 660 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country Memorial Hospital While Hill Country Memorial Ho spital's companion program for the insured employed of large businesses has had a number of patients complete the program, this pr ogram targeted to the uninsured population has not yet been started. Additional information acquired through outreach and implementation-planning efforts will be key to designing a program that meets this population's unique and ongoing needs. The Quality Improvement process of the project will include a thorough evaluation of program, implementation, and outreach effectiveness to ta ke place in DY4. In DY5, course corrections indicated by this eval uation (the \"check\" stage of the PD CA cycle) will be implemented. In DY5, expansion plans and long- term sustainability of the project will be finalized.

Overview of the Uninsured in the United States: An analysis of the 2005 Current Population Survey. (http://aspe.hhs.gov/hea lth/reports/05/uninsured-c ps/index.htm#Insurance) Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): Projects 136430906.3.1, 136430906.3.2, and 136430906.3.3 have as their goal the completion of 3 specific preventive care screenings for the targ et population, uninsured employees of Gillespie County businesses. These screenings are for cerv ical cancer, colorectal cancer, and high blood pressure, respectively. These goals are directly rela ted to the work of the program, as the plan is to provide these three screeni ng services, among others, to as many of the uninsured target population as are eligible for them per USPSTF gu idelines. We believe that the most effective means to do this within our community is to pa rtner with local businesse s, strengthening their employee health. In 2010, researchers reviewed 36 studies of corporate wellness programs. They calculated that employers saved an average of $6 for every $1 spent, including $3.27 saved in medical costs and an additional $2.73 gained because of reduced absenteeism. An earlier analysis of 56 studies found that health promoti on programs in organizations of all sizes reduced sick leave, health plan costs, and worker comp ensation and disability co sts by about 25 percent. A major meta-synthesis of studies on workpl ace screening and wellness programs found even greater impact in many cases. Eight studies evaluated the impact of wellness programs on healthcare cost and all but 1 study found significa nt decreases. Effects included a reduction in direct medical cost between $176 and $1539 per pa rticipant per year. Four studies evaluated absenteeism costs, as defined by the estimated co st of missed workdays. Each of these studies found significant effects, expressed as an ROI of $15.60 per dollar spent, $1350 saved per employee in short-term disability costs, 0.1% po int risk reduction in il lness days, and $180 saved per participant per year. Since the individuals in our pr ogram's target population are not insured, then we can imagine that the costs attributed to medical cost saving s here would be absorbed by the community while 661 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country Memorial Hospital the increased employee productivity would benefit th e company directly. This means, that for the 500 individuals involved in the pr ogram, we could expect a reducti on in healthcare costs to the community of up to $1,077,300 per year of the progr am. In addition, the savings in prevented lost productivity would equal up to 5% of employee payroll, or around $1,125,000 for 500 employees Also, these studies have shown that the program has positive impact beyond immediate medical cost savings. Long-term benefits include decreased severity of or prevention of chronic disease, improvement in exercise , healthy diet, and phys iologic markers and a decrease in smoking and alcohol use. In th e long-run, a single hosp italization for cancer, diabetes, hypercholestremia, or any of the othe r conditions being tested for would cost about $10,000 (http://www.beckershospitalr eview.com/lists/average-cost- per-inpatient-day-across-50- states-in-2010.html). By identifyi ng these conditions early, at l east 25 such hospitalizations are likely to be prevented in the years after the program, providing at a minimum $250,000 in additional community benefits.

Relationship to other Projects: This project is also relate d to Category 4 population-focuse d measures for Potentially Preventable Admissions, RD-2. It is very likely that, in the short-term and the long-term, uninsured patients with ambulatory care sensitive c onditions will be less frequent visitors to both the emergency room and inpatient units. If th ese conditions are caught early in the disease process, then care can be received in an appropr iate setting. If the conditions are not screened for and noted early, patients are more likely to end up in the emergency or inpa tient setting in either more critical condition or because they have no medical home. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Plan for Learning Collaborative: Lessons learned will be shared in the RHP Lear ning Collaborative and in conferences and other settings which will be set up following comple tion of the RHP Plan. They will be working groups of performing providers who are pursuing similar projects. These working groups will develop their learning collaborative structur e which may include the following: Identify participants, establish Learning Co llaborative goals, develop a cale ndar of regular meetings, site visits, and/or conference calls, develop a plan to communicate ideas, data, and successes across the region and state, organize a learning event and invite experts and other Performing Providers from outside the region to share knowledge and best practices, and adopt metrics to measure success A website will be available to the Learning Collaboratives to network and share ideas, 662 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country Memorial Hospital challenges, and success stories with colle agues. RHP 6 hopes to make significant transformational progress on its pr oject milestones to achieve wa iver goals and share what we learn with the rest of the State. Hill Country Memorial Hospital anticipates significant involvement in contributing to and learning from our learning co llaborative. Lessons learned will be shared along the way, allowing others to make course corrections noted through the experience of other performing providers. Project Valuation: This Category 2 project is valued at $2,625,518 for de monstration years 2-5. It is perfectly in line with the Triple Aim, providing high-quality scre ening and preventive services as well as rich wellness support for uninsured residents of our co mmunity. The program is cost effective due to the ability to utilize many existing hospital servi ces and facilities to provide this important service. In addition, utilizing individuals workin g at the top of their li cense will ensure that patients are receiving best care at lowest possible cost. Within onl y 3 years of implementation, it is our goal to provide a very comprehensive heal th screening to 500 indi viduals, or 16% of the uninsured population in our imme diate community. Once they have been screened and educated, we will also be ensuring that they are connected to ongoing sources of care, helping our uninsured neighbors to navigate their way through the local health system and any funding opportunities for which they may be eligible . Because the program is ongoing, the 500 individuals will have the opportunity to come back year after year if the business finds that it is useful for their employees. This will multiply the impact of the program. There is a wealth of literatu re supporting high value preventiv e care, and increased focus on preventive care has been a major part of h ealth reform discussions. The Partnership for Prevention, who published the paper, \"Greater Use Of Preventive Services In U.S. Health Care Could Save Lives At Little Or No Cost,\" did a cost-benefit analys is of 20 preventive health care services and \"estimated how much in health care co sts would have been saved in a given year if 90 percent of the population had us ed those services. For 2006, th e year selected, the savings were estimated at $3.7 billion\" (Health Affairs, 2010). Workplace wellness programs have been shown to be so successful that the Centers for Disease Control has commissioned an entire program to provide basic toolkits for businesse s interested in providi ng this key service to employees. Though the impact of the program will be on the community as a whole through improved wellness, early disease interven tion, and decreased healthcare cost s, employers participating in the wellness intervention will likely benefit as well. The program will require a number of human re sources, including physician, nurse practitioner, navigator/health educator, outre ach, and administrative. In add ition, existing hospital resources and equipment, such as mammography equipment, building space, lab supplies and staff will be leveraged. Outreach will require significant time a nd cost as the target po pulation will need to be reached in a variety of ways. References: Baicker, K., Cutler, D., & Song, Z. (2010) .

For more than 49 ye ars Methodist has provide d high quality care to patients from San Antonio and throughout South Texas. Intervention(s) : This project aims to improve how patie nts experience the care and the patient's satisfaction with the care provided. One large challenge we face is that positive outcomes in healthcare are dependent not only up on the clinical succe ss of treatment, but also upon a patient's perception of the overall experience, which improves compliance and understanding. This experience is comprised, in part, of communicat ion with the caregivers regarding different aspects of the process, as well as the level of se rvice with respect to clean/quiet environment for healing and a responsive staff ai med at meeting needs in a timel y manner. In order to better partner with our patients to round out this ove rall experience, focus upon patient satisfaction metrics and methods to achieve impr ovement thereof is necessary. Need for the project : A review of Methodist Hospital's patient satisfaction scores and the correlation to quality patient care has shown a n eed in the community for this project. This project was selected due to the identification of a gap in actual versus desired patient engagement, as positive experiences contribut e to positive outcomes. We have a diverse community with specific needs across gender, ag e, race and religion. Identifying the needs and meeting them in a better fashion will help impr ove understanding and end results. In fact, the most recent CMS data uploaded in October, 20 12 indicates that San Antonio is significantly lower in every category than both the Texas and the U.S. averages. While we considered addressing option 2.4.1 as well, we ultimately decided that it was less appropriate for Methodist Hospital as we feel that would be a step backward. The facilities have already initiated significant efforts toward iden tifying the need to focus upon patient experience, collecting the data, engaging a vendor, and identifying paths for improvement. Target population : The project will benefit all patients who have services at Methodist Hospital and submit a patient satisfaction survey. Appr oximately 30% of the total patients seen at Methodist Hospital are either Medica id and/or indigent patients a nd are expected to benefit from this project. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : This project seeks to im prove patient satisfaction scores by 4% by DY 5. The patient experience a ssessed will allow our patients to actively participate in changing the cultu re of healthcare in our hospital. With improvements to the patient experience, we anticipate the quality of care and outcomes to improve in alignment with the patient experience. Approxima tely 7,000 patient satisfaction surveys are completed per year at MHS. MHS will establish a baseline for patient satisfaction sample size during DY 3. It is estimated that the sample size of patient satisf action surveys will increase by 2% of baseline in DY 4 and 4% of baseline in DY 5. Methodist Hospita l estimates that approximately 30% of these patient are indigent and Medicaid patients Category 3 outcomes: 3.IT-6.1- Our goal is to improve 4% over baseline for Customer 667 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Methodist Hospital Engagement scores by DY5. Project Description: This project aims to improve how patients experience the care and the patient's satisfaction with the care provided. We utilize the patient satisfacti on survey tools, as well as other internal, more real-time solutions in order to obtain feedback regarding all aspects of the patient experience. These combined sets of metrics will help us di rect our dedicated executive to improve patient satisfaction scores by 4% by the end of 5 years. A newly created position will spend the next six months working with our current Coach to learn the skills and mechanisms they utilize to train our staff on customer engagement tactics. At the end of the training period, this person will be dedicated to the system, traveling among all our campuses to coach and train our staff and management toward better patient experiences. One large challenge we face is that positive outcomes in healthcare are dependent not only upon the clinical success of treatment, but also upon a patient's perception of the overall experience, which improves compliance and understanding. Th is experience is comprised, in part, of communication with the caregivers re garding different aspects of the process, as well as the level of service with respect to clean/quiet environm ent for healing and a responsive staff aimed at meeting needs in a timely manner. In order to be tter partner with our pati ents to round out this overall experience, focus upon patient satisfactio n metrics and methods to achieve improvement thereof is necessary. Methodist understands that cont inuous quality improvement is at the heart of this project. Therefore, in the implementation of this projec t, Methodist will endeavor for continuous quality improvement by monitoring the patient volumes and patient utilization to ensure that progress is being made towards meeting the project milestones. Additionally, Methodist will ensure that all methodologies used will meet or exceed any appli cable nationally recognized protocol or quality benchmarks. This project is aligned with the following Region 6 goal: Triple Aim: assuring patients receive high-quality and patient-centered care, in the most cost effective ways Starting Point/Baseline: As of December 1, 2011, the MHS system averag ed a 68.7 on the internal patient satisfaction metrics. There was no dedicated ex ecutive to improve these results. Rationale: This project was selected due to the identifica tion of a gap in actual versus desired patient engagement. Our patients are telling us we can and should do better. As positive experiences contribute to positive outcomes, we think this is an important component of our plan. We have a diverse community with specific needs across ge nder, age, race and relig ion. Identifying the needs and meeting them in a better fashion will help improve understanding and end results. The San Antonio area generally la gs the national average in public ly available patient experience and engagement scores. In fact, the most recen t CMS data uploaded in October, 2012 indicates that San Antonio is significantly lower in ev ery category than both the Texas and the U.S. 668 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Methodist Hospital averages. Additionally, Methodist is consiste ntly on the lower end of the spectrum when compared to its local peers. Our campuses of Methodist Hospital have mo st recently individually approached patient experience improvement efforts, with little result . Trends have been flat and unsuccessful at changing the overall tone of the patient's care. We feel that adding a dedicated position with ownership in the system, rather than through a consulting arrangement, will increase buy-in and drive results in a timely and effective manner. This project address the Community Needs Assessment for this item: CN.1 - Texas ranks last in the nation on health care quality. RHP 6 is challenged to deliver improved quality and patient satisfaction. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): TITLE OF OUTCOME MEASURE: IT6.1 Percent improvement over baseline of patient satisfaction scores The intent of the HCAHPS initiative is to provid e a standardized survey instrument and data collection methodology for measuring patients' pe rspectives on hospital care. The surveys are designed to produce comparable data on the patien t's perspective on care that allows objective and meaningful comparisons between institutions on domains that are important to consumers. Public reporting of the survey results is designed to create incentives for institutions to improve their quality of care. Public repo rting will serve to enhance public accountability in health care by increasing the transparency of the quality of in stitutional care provided in return for the public investment. Relationship to other Projects: This project is aligned with the wavier goals a ssuring patients receive hi gh-quality and patient- centered care, in the most cost effective ways for all types of care. This project can interrelate with all Wavier projects. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Unknown at this time. Plan for Learning Collaborative: Following completion of the RHP plan, University Health System (anchor) will facilitate the formation of working groups of performing provi ders who are pursuing similar projects. These working groups will develop their learning co llaborative structure which may include goals, regular meetings, site visits , conference calls, communication plan development, organizing learning event, and adopt metrics to measure success. 669 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Methodist Hospital Project Valuation: In determining the value of this project, Met hodist analyzed the need s of the community, the number of patients reached by the project, the value of the anticipated benefit to health outcomes in the community, the time, the effort, and c linical expertise involve d in implementing the project, the clinical resources required to perform the project, and the anticipated value of the improvement of delivery of care to the community. 670 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Methodist Hospital 094154402.2.1 PASS 1 2.4.2 N/A 2.4.2 REDESIGN TO IMPROVE PATIENT EXPERIENCE Methodist Hospital TPI - 094154402 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 094154402.3.3 3 IT-6.1 Percent improvement ove r baseline of patient satisfaction scores Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P-1]: Appoint an executive accountable for experience performance Metric [P 1.1]: Documentation of an executive assigned responsibility experience performance Goal: Appoint MHS executive to be accountable for experience performance.

For more than 49 ye ars Methodist has provide d high quality care to patients from San Antonio and throughout South Texas. Intervention(s) : This project will improve process met hodology for Sepsis Bundles. Sepsis is a leading cause of hospital mortality in Bexar County. Need for the project : Rationale for selecting this sepsis project is the high mortality rate in this population and the known evidenced-based care bundles for decreasing mortality in this population. The improvement requires significant planning, development of metrics, tools and education of all stakeholders. Target population : Low income patients often have a delay in seeking care for infections which increase the chance for sepsis, and difficulty obtai ning antibiotic therapy initially as well as post discharge. These elements will be measured with protocols developed to minimize these outcomes. A significant percentage of patients are either Medicai d and/or indige nt patients and are expected to benefit from this project. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The expected patient benef it is to improve the number of eligible patients that receive at least one (Resuscitation or Maintenance) Sepsis Bundle by 25% of baseline by DY5. The benefit of this projec t is to decrease the amount of patients who expire with sepsis. Approximately, 2500 patients per year are diagnosed with sepsis. We estimate that 50% of these will be eligible fo r Sepsis Bundles given their blood pressure and initial lactate levels. Approxima tely 18% of the 2500 patients dia gnosed with sepsis annually are Medicaid recipients or uninsured. Category 3 outcomes: Category 3, IT-4.8 Sepsis Mortality. Outcome measure will be Number of patients expiring during current month with sepsis / Number of patients identified that month with sepsis. Goal is to improve the mortality of eligible pati ents by at or below expected (observed/expected mortality ratio to 1.0 or lower) by DY5. Project Description: Sepsis is a leading cause of hospital mortality at Methodist Hospital. Our sepsis mortality are not statistically different than the risk-adjusted expected mortality rates, yet there is still opportunity for prevention, early recognition and aggressive care by well-defined sepsis care bundles. This project involves care in the Emergency Depa rtment (ED), Critical Care Units (CCU), and regular in-patient unit. It involves nursing, la boratory staff, physicians, patients and families. Patients with a diagnosis of Sepsis have a signi ficant mortality. Early diagnosis and aggressive intervention with evidence based care protocols (care bundles) ha ve been proven to significantly lower these patient's mortality. The challenge is to set up systems of care in the Emergency Room and in-patient ho spital to implement these proven stra tegies. The structured education, 674 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Methodist Hospital protocols and electronic health re cord interventions will greatly enhance this process. This requires systems of coordinated, mu lti-disciplinary care that have traditionally been difficult in \"silos\" of the acute care hospital. The proposed interventions listed in th is improvement project will ensure that this evidence-based care is pr ovided in a timely and appropriate manner. Methodist understands that continuous quality improvement is at the heart of this project. Therefore, in the implementation of this projec t, Methodist will endeavor for continuous quality improvement by monitoring the patient volumes and pa tient utilization to ensure that progress is being made towards meeting the project milestones . Additionally, Methodist will ensure that all methodologies used will meet or exceed any applicab le nationally recognized protocol or quality benchmarks. Challenge: Sepsis is a rapid ki ller affecting millions of human population worldwide and studies have recorded that the mortality rate due to sepsis has been as alarming as one in four (or even more). It is a complex disease which is difficult to identify and treat. A challenge will be the ability to clearly define the disease and iden tify the targeted population of patients who will specifically benefit from that intervention. MHS plans to develop management strategies to ensure compliance with the sepsis bundles in order to decrease hospital mortality due to severe sepsis. This project is aligned with the following Region 6 goals: Triple Aim: assuring patients receive high-quality and patient-centered care, in the most cost effective ways Improve the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of our counties Further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system Improve outcomes while containing cost growth Starting Point/Baseline: Baseline will be developed in DY3. Rationale: Rationale for selecting this sepsis project is the high mortality rate in this population and the known evidenced-based care bundles for decreas ing mortality in this population. The improvement requires significant planning, developm ent of metrics, tools and education of all stakeholders. This is expected to be a multip le year process. This addresses Category 2.8.11, Applying Process Improvement methodology to Im prove Quality/Efficien cy. Subsection of Sepsis Mortality IT - 4.8 Sepsis Mortality. This project is time ly for our Hospital and has been identified as a key element in our Clin ical Efficiency (CE) hospital plan. This project address the Community Needs Assessment for these items: CN.1 - Texas ranks last in the nation on health care quality. RHP 6 is challenged to deliver improved quality and patient satisfaction. CN.2 - A high prevalence of chronic disease and related health dispar ities require greater prevention efforts and improved management of patients with chronic conditions. Leading causes of death in RHP 6 include cardi ovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. 675 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Methodist Hospital CN.3 - Many residents of RHP 6 lack access to me dical and dental care due to high rates of uninsurance and health ca re provider shortages. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): Category 3, IT-4.8 Sepsis Mortality. The primary metric is risk-adjusted sepsis mortality. The risk-adjusted expected values for mortality, le ngth of stay, and cost are calculated through regression analysis. Component s include patients age, sex, zi p code, primary and secondary diagnoses. This is a well vali dated tool for risk adjustment. In addition to risk-adjusted improvements in seps is mortality, we will be measuring the use of specific bundles of care (early recognition tool, resuscitation bundl e, and management bundle) in the Emergency Department, Critical care unit, and in- hospital units. Low income patients often have a delay in s eeking care for infections which increased the chance for sepsis, and difficulty obtaining antibiotic therapy initially as well as post discharge. These elements will be measured with prot ocols developed to minimize these outcomes. In Category 2, MHS will be measuring patients us ing the Sepsis Management Bundle [Evidence- based goals that must be completed within 24 hour s for patients with severe sepsis, septic shock and/or lactate > 4 mmol/L (36 mg/dl)] with at least one sepsis bundle- Early Recognition Tool, Resuscitation or Maintenance. In Category 3, MHS will be measuring the number of patients expiring from sepsis divide d by total sepsis patients. Relationship to other Projects: This project is related to other RHP inte rventions MHS 094154402.1.1- Telemedicine (1.7) for early diagnosis and intervention opportunities at remote sites, and expanding Specialty Care Capacity for improved hospital care a nd outpatient infection management. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Sepsis is a common project in other hospitals in the region. The practices and outcomes will be shared across the region as well as nationally in peer reviewed publications. Regional Chief Medical Officers have a regular m eeting to discuss shared clinical improvements, and sepsis is a frequent topic because of its cost and clinical impact Plan for Learning Collaborative: Following completion of the RHP plan, University Health System (anchor) will facilitate the formation of working groups of performing provi ders who are pursuing similar projects. These working groups will develop their learning co llaborative structure which may include goals, regular meetings, site visits , conference calls, communication plan development, organizing learning event, and adopt metrics to measure success. Through the regional Chief Medica l Officers forum sponsored by th e Texas Hospital association, 676 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Methodist Hospital best practices are shared and published on the THA website. The region-wide EMS system can also be involved in pre-hospital diagnosis and ur gent intervention in sepsis. The community can be informed about sepsis th rough local media public relations and hospital newsletters. Project Valuation: In valuing this project, Methodist took into ac count the extent to which the Improvement in Sepsis would potentially meet th e goals of the Waiver (support th e development of a coordinated care delivery system, improve outcomes while containing costs, improve the healthcare infrastructure), the extent to which it will ad dress the community needs, the population served, and resources and cost necessary to implement the project. The Improvement in Sepsis Mortality will save lives of citize ns in the community . This directly addresses the goals by implementing proven evidenced-bas ed clinical methodology to improve care in this devastating illness .

The primary service area is comprised of Bexar County, Texas and parts of th e surrounding seven counties. Intervention(s) : This project will implement the Medical Home Model in at least 1 primary care clinic, to strengthen the clinician-patient re lationship and replace the episodic care with coordinated care and long-t erm healing relationships. Need for the project : Our region has identified community needs of (a) improved quality and patient satisfaction, (b) improved prevention and management of chronic diseases and (c) a documented health care shortage. We feel th is project addresses each of these needs. Target population : The clinic we have identified as bei ng our first Medical Home is staffed by 2 Board Certified Geriatricians, as such, the target population of the clinic will be patients aged 55 and older. Most patients are expected to be Medicare-eligible patients , with approximately 15%- 25% currently either Medicaid-el igible or dual-eligible. With the impending changes to the Medicaid eligibility, coupled w ith the increasing poverty rates am ong the elderly, this rate could be as high as 45-50% within the next few years. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project seeks to obtain Medical Home Accreditation by DY3 and achieve the goal of 85% of clinic patients being able to identify their usual source of care as being managed in a Medical Home by DY5. Since the physicians are new to the market, we expect the patient volume to grow over the next 3-5 years. We are expecting around 1,900 patients by the end of DY2, with a 10% increase annually over the next 3 years: 2,090 by end DY3, 2,299 by end by end DY5. Category 3 outcomes: IT.12.1 Our goal is to improve Breast Cancer Screening Rate (annual mammograms) for women aged 40 to 69 (improvement percentage TBD) IT.12.3 Our goal is to improve Co lorectal Cancer Screening Ra te for adults aged 50 to 75 (improvement percentage TBD) IT.12.4 Our goal is to improve Pneumonia Vacci nation Status for adults aged 65 and older (improvement percentage TBD) 680 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Nix Health Care System Project Description: Project Description Nix Health has recruited 2 new phys icians to the market (Q4 DY1) and they plan to base their Provider Based Clinic around the Patient Center ed Medical Home Model (PCMH). They are Family Practice physicians, and Board Certified in Geriatric Medicine. Their main clinic will be located in the medical offices of Nix Health in Downtown San Antonio, with some potential satellite locations throughout Bexar County. Th e physicians plan to center their practice around patients aged 55 and older. Due to the age of the expected patients for this clinic, we predict that a large percentage of patients will be Medicare-eligible, but we anticipate up to 25% of the patients to be Medicaid-eligible, dual-eligible or medically indigent. The patient navigator, which is a critical part of the PCMH Model, will help patients coordina te and receive the care they need in the most appropriate setting. This will be of particular importance for patients that may lack financial resources or family support. The physicians are new to the market, and will be in a period of growth for 3-5 years while they build their patient base. For the valuation of this project, we are anticipating 1,900 unique patients by the end of DY2, with a 10% in crease each year: end DY4 and 2,529 by end DY5. Texas has one of the highest poverty rates in the nation, and the Supplemental Poverty Measure rel eased by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2011demonstrates that the official poverty measures drasti cally underestimate the poverty level for people aged 65 and older, as it does not take into account variations in health care spending across age groups despite differing health status, insurance covera ge and rising medical co sts in the elderly. As we begin to implement the PCMH Model in this clinic, we will evaluate additional existing or new Provider Based Clinics for the PCMH mode l. The PCMH provides a \"home base\" for patients and a health care team tailors services to a patient's unique health care needs, effectively coordinates the patient's care across inpatient an d outpatient settings, an d proactively provides preventive, primary, routine, and chronic care . In RHP 6, quality improvements, patient satisfaction and the management of chronic diseas es have been identified as key needs for the region (CN.1 & CN.2). The Nix Medical Homes will address all of these issues currently being faced within the region. Goals and Relationship to Regional Goals Over the course of the next 4 years, the Nix Medical Homes will improve patients' access to care by striving to offer same-day appointments and will assist the patients in obtaining routine preventive care services, like annual wellness exams, vision screenings, mammograms, vaccines, etc. The Medical Home Care Team will also ut ilize alternative methods (telephone, group visits, etc.) to communicate wi th the patients. Project Goals: Obtain medical home recognition by a nationally recognized agency Increase the percent of medical home patients th at are able to identify their usual source of care as being managed in medical homes Expand interaction types between patients and healthcare team beyond on-to-one visits to include group visits, telephone visits, a nd other interaction types and focus these efforts on reaching patients w ithin 2 business days of discharge to address any 681 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Nix Health Care System questions or concerns they ha ve regarding their post-disch arge medications and plan on care. The project meets the following regional goals: Improve outcomes while containing cost growth Assuring patients receive high-quality and patient-centered care, in the most cost effective ways Challenges One of the biggest challenges we face in implementing a Medical Home Model is patient education regarding the differences between a Medical Home and a traditional primary care practice. This patient edu cation will be an ongoing task. 5-year Expected Outcomes for Performing Provider and Patients Nix Health expects to see a strengthened clinicia n-patient relationship that replaces episodic care with coordinated care and a long-term healing relationship. The physicians will lead care teams that take collective responsibility for patient care, preventive services, and making arrangements with other health care providers for specific needs. Expected outcomes will relate to the project goals described above. Starting Point/Baseline: Nix Health does not currently operate or partner with any Medical Ho mes, so this project will be a new undertaking with the patients currently se rved by the Medical Home model being zero. We plan to begin implementing the Medical Ho me methodologies and es tablish baselines and targets in DY2. Rationale: Reason for selecting this project Primary care is a critical part of our healthcare continuum. No t only does primary care provide patients and physicians a preferred access point, it is critical to the patient's ability to access needed services and other levels of care in an appropriate and e fficient manner. Being underserved from a primary care standpoint (CN .3) creates barriers for patients, places undue burden on existing providers and en courages inappropriate utiliza tion of health care resources which drives up health care costs and increases inefficiency. This frag mentation can be very confusing and burdensome to patients, especially those with chronic diseases (CN.2). The Nix currently does not operate any Medical Home s so we have electe d Project Option 2.1.1. While patients aged 55 and older are not typically the focus of Medicaid projects, it has been noted that Texas has one of the highest poverty ra tes in the nation at 17.8%. However, a recent report from the U.S. Census Bureau demonstrates that the official pove rty measure drastically underestimates the poverty rate of the elderly, by not taking into considera tion the rising medical costs, declining health status and insurance cove rage. This report shows that the Supplemental Poverty Measure for the elderly was 75% higher than the Official Poverty Measure when these age variables were taken into consideration. 682 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Nix Health Care System Project Components Through the Nix Medical Home project, we prop ose to meet all of the required project components: a) Utilize a gap analysis to assess and/or me asure hospital-affiliated and/or PCP's NCQA PCMH readiness Will compare NCQA PCMH requirements to the existing practices in place in the clinic and identify what woul d need to change within the existing clinic model in order to be compliant b) Conduct feasibility studies to determin e necessary steps to achieve NCQA PCMH status Once we understand the gaps that exist, we will outline the necessary steps in order to become compliant with NCQA's recommendations c) Conduct educational sessions for primary ca re physician practice offices, hospital board of directors, medical staff and senior leadership on the elements of PCMH, its rationale and vision We will educate all key stakeholders on the steps that are necessary and the elements of a PCMH, as well as the expected outcomes. d) Conduct quality improvement for project using methods such as rapid cycle improvement. Activities may include, but are not limited to, identifying project impacts, identifying \"lessons learned,\" oppor tunities to scale all or part of the project to a broader patient population, and identifying key cha llenges associated with expansion of the project , including special consid erations for safety-net populations. As we begin implementation we will con tinually review our results and identify opportunities to apply some or all of the Medical Home Models concepts to other primary care clinics in order to r each a broader patient population. Milestones and Metrics Chosen Since we are starting from a baseline of no Medi cal Homes, DY2's milestones and metrics will focus on implementing the practices of a medical home, building our team, and educating our staff on PCMH change concepts. Once policies and practices are in place, we will begin some improvement milestones in DY3 which will also carry over to DY4 and DY5 with increasing targets in each subsequent year. The first impr ovement milestone we will track is the patient's ability to identify the medical home as their usua l source of care. The re ason we selected this milestone is it speaks directly to the patient's participation in the Medical Home concept. Without patient involvement, the model does not work as intended. Secondly, in DY3 we will implement a process milestone to track the current rate of identifying and reaching out to patients that need to be scheduled for preventive care. This milestone directly relates to our category 3 outcome improvement measures for DY4 and DY5. In DY5, an improvement milestone will be used to ensure we are reaching, at a minimum, the number of patients we expect to be reaching by that point in time. This milestone was chosen for DY5 since the clinic is still in its infancy and working to grow its patient base. And finally , we will also be tracking the process milestone of documented expanded interaction types beyond one-t o-one visits as this is key to the patient feeling that they are getting the information and e ducation in a format that is the most beneficial for them. 683 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Nix Health Care System Unique Community Needs Identificatio n Numbers this project Addresses CN.1 - Improve quality and patient satisfaction CN.2 - Improve prevention and management of chronic diseases CN.3 - Address health care shortage The goal of the PCMH will be to improve quality (CN.1), improve patient satisfaction (CN.1), and improve prevention and management of chronic diseases (CN.2). Give n that the physicians who are partnering with us for the implementatio n of the Medical Home are new to the region, we are also addressing the existing health care shor tage (CN.3). We will identify lessons learned and opportunities to scale all or part of the medical home project to a broader patient population. How does this project represent a new initiative or significantly enhances an existing delivery system reform initiative. Nix Health has not implemented or worked direct ly with any Medical Home Models in the past, so this is a new initiative. This initiative, or rela ted activities, is not be ing funded in whole or part by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-12 Primary Care and Primary Prevention IT-12.1 Breast Cancer Screening: Number of women aged 40 to 69 that have received an annual mammogram during the reporting period IT-12.2 Colorectal Cancer Screening: Number of a dults aged 50 to 75 that have received one of the following screenings: Fecal occult blood te st yearly, Flexible Sigmoidoscopy every five years, Colonoscopy every 10 years IT-12.4 Pneumonia vaccination status for older adu lts: Number of adults aged 65 and older that have ever received a pneumonia vaccine One of the primary functions of the Medical Ho me will be to proactively provide preventive, primary, routine and chronic care and tracking these preventive screening initiatives directly correlates to the goa l of the PCMH. Reason/rationale for selec ting these outcome measures: As is outlined in the RHP6 Community Needs Asse ssment, there is a high prevalence of chronic disease and one of the leading causes of death is cancer. Through IT-12.1 and IT-12.2, patients will be encouraged to be proactive in the sc reening for cancer to improve their outcomes by catching the cancer sooner. The Pneumonia vacc ination provides protec tion for older adults whose health could be jeopardized by pneumonia due to other chronic health conditions. Focusing on prevention improves outcomes and re duces the burden (physical, emotional, and financial) of more extensive disease. This is particularly important in low-income populations. 684 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Nix Health Care System Relationship to other Projects: Given that the 2 physicians that will be operatin g the Medical Home are newly recruited to the region, this project also relate s to projects that fall under Category 1.1: Expand Primary Care Capacity. The physicians were recruited in DY1 a nd relocated to the area in Q4 DY1. However, given the nature of their practice heading toward s the Medical Home Model, we felt it was best represented as a Category 2.1 project and incorp orated the value of the expanded capacity into our valuation methodology. The Nix Medical Home project is directly related to several Category 4 measures: Potentially Preventable Admissions: Thr ough increased access to Primary Care and better methods to monitor patients' chronic conditions, preventable admissions will be reduced (CHF, diabetes, behavior al health, COPD, Asthma, etc.) 30-Day Readmissions: When a patient has acce ss to outpatient care post-discharge, the rate of readmission decreases. It will be vita l to ensure that patients are scheduled for a follow-up appointment with the Medical Ho me physician shortly after discharge to ensure the patient has all of their questi ons answered pertaining to at-home care. Patient-centered healthcare: The Medical Home Model is centered around the patient, so inherently patient satisfaction and medication management will be improved. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Currently, for Pass 1 projects, both CHRISTUS Sant a Rosa and University Health Systems have proposed projects that would allow them to expand their Medical Home Models. Nix Health will reach out to these other performing providers to share lessons learned and identify opportunities for improvement. Plan for Learning Collaborative: We plan to work with other Performing Provide rs from the region and participate in learning collaboratives, whether it be communicati ng via email, phone, webinars or face-to-face meetings. Project Valuation: The Medical Home Model will reduce the occu rrence of duplicate tests and procedures and reduce overutilization of health care services and will reduce ER visits. A recent study on the outcomes of medical homes demonstration projects tracked the hospitaliza tion reduction rate and ER visit reduction and estimated the total saving s per patient enrolled in a medical home model being between $71 and $640 1, with some as high as $1,650 savings per year. For DY2 we have calculated this portion of th e value as 1900 covered lives times $640 per year ($1,216,000 in DY2) and increasing 10% per year over the remaining years of the waiver. Also, since these are new physicians to the market , and their clinic volume is not being valued separately in another DSRIP pr oject, we can also assume va lue above and beyond the medical home model. Through adding Primary Care Clinic s in underserved areas, access to quality care will be achieved. Currently, patients in underser ved areas delay care until the condition worsens, and they seek care through Emergency Rooms whic h is more costly and less efficient. By adding physicians, separate and distinct from th e medical home concept, we will be covering more lives and will see a reduction in ER visits. The geriatric patients they are serving are at 685 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Nix Health Care System higher risk of ER visits and admissions so it is safe to assume each MD seeing patients would result in 20 fewer ER visits per month at a cost avoidance of $1,3182 per avoided ER visit by the end of DY5. Also, through expanded access to primary care on an outpatient setting, patients will be better able to manage their chronic diseas es rather than delaying treatment and ultimately needing hospitalization. For each MD, we are conservatively estimating a reduction in need for admission by 10 per month by the end of DY5 at a cost avoidance of $5,3593 per avoided admission. We recognize that these physicians are new to the market and have not yet established a full patient panel so we have scal ed back the valuation in DY2 to reflect only 4 avoided ER visits per month per MD and 2 a voided Med/Surg admissions per MD, for a DY2 value of $383,760. This, along with the valuation for Medical Homes brings the valuation for DY2 to $1,599,760 and this would in crease to over $3.5M by DY5 Footnotes: 1Patient-Centered Primary Care Collaborative: Th e of Implementing Patient-Centered Medical Home Interventions http://www.pcpcc.net/files/ pcmh_evidence_outcomes_2009.pdf 2Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Medical Expenditure Potentially Prev entable Readmissions in the Texas Medicaid Population Fiscal Year 2010 http://www.hhsc.state.tx.us/reports/2 012/potentially-preventable-readmissions.pdf NOTE - Through our estimation, this project could be valued as high as $3.5M per year by DY5, but in order to stay in line with our Pass 1 allocation, we have valued it at $1,599,759 in DY2, $1,752,374 686 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Nix Health Care System 297342201.2.1 PASS 1 2.1.1 2.1.1.A - D 2.1.1 ENHANCE /EXPAND MEDICAL HOMES : NIX HEALTH MEDICAL HOMES Nix Health TPI - 297342201 (OLD TPI 3.IT-12.4 Primary Care and Cancer Screening Primary Care and Primary Preventi on: Colorectal Cancer Screening Primary Care and Primary Preventi on: Pneumonia vaccination status for older adults Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P-X] Implement the medical home model in primary care clinics Metric 1 [P-X.1] Increase number of primary care clinics using medical home model Baseline: 0 clinics participating in Medical Homes.

The primary service area is comprised of Bexar County, Texas and parts of th e surrounding seven counties. Intervention(s) : This project will utilize continuous rapid process improvement programs to identify and implement best practices that will help improve the safety, quality and efficiency of the care for our geriatric patients during hospita lization. Physicians wi ll be educated on the findings, and encouraged to admit their medica l/surgical elderly patients to the ACE Program (Acute Care for the Elderly) where these proce ss improvement interventions will be applied and the patient will be cared for using an interdisciplinary team approach. Need for the project : Texas as a whole ranks last in the nation in health care quality and our region in particular has a high prevalence of chro nic disease in the elderly. This project will address the patient holistically during their hospitalization rath er than focusing solely on the acute illness. And while patients age 65+ are no t typically the focus of a Medicaid-related program, it cannot be ignored that Texas ranks as one of the hi ghest in the nation for poverty, with the elderly being at great risk for poverty given their declin ing health status and increasing medical costs. A recent report from the U.S. Census Bureau in 2011 demonstrates that the official poverty measure drastica lly underestimates the poverty le vel of the elderly since age- related variables are not taken into consideratio n. The report indicates that the Supplemental Poverty Measure is 75% higher for the elde rly than the official poverty measure. Target population : This project targets mostly Medicare-elig ible patients, but hi storically 15% to 25% of our medical/surgical admissions for patients aged 65 and older have been dual-eligible or medically indigent. However, th e above-referenced U.S. Census Bu reau report indicates that the percent of medically-indigent elde rly patients may be much higher than the percentage that are Medicaid- or dual-eligible. The declining hea lth status and increasing medical costs place the elderly at great risk of poverty and this pr oject's goal of improved health outcomes during hospitalization will help address some of the risk factors a ssociated with poverty in the elderly. With the impending changes to th e Medicaid program, coupled with the increasing poverty rates among the elderly, this rate could be as hi gh as 45-50% within the next few years. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project seeks to ha ve at least 55% of our medical/surgical (non-ICU) patients enrolled in the ACE Program by DY5. In DY1, Nix Health had 1,336 Med/Surg (non-ICU) patients that were aged 65+. This volume is expected to grow, but conservatively we expect to treat 735 patients using th e ACE model annually in DY5. 690 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Nix Health Care System Category 3 outcomes: IT.3.1 Our goal is to reduce all- cause 30-day readmission rates for patients admitted to the ACE Program (improvement target percentage TBD) Project Description: Project Description In DY1, nearly half of the med/surg patients adm itted to Nix Health that were not ICU patients were age 65 and older, and that percentage is expected to grow in the coming years. Recognizing this, and the challenges that ar e faced by elderly patients when they are hospitalized, we plan to test and implement measures related to this group of patients. Similar to the process improvement practices implemen ted by the NICHE program, we will identify evidence based practices that may help improve the safety, quality and effici ency of the geriatric patients during their hospita lization, and work to incorporate th ese practices into the care these patients receive during their stay and post-discharge. Nix Health has begun testing some of these perf ormance improvement initiatives in DY1 with a select group of patients. Intern ally these patients have been categorized as \"ACE\" patients, which stands for Acute Care of the Elderly. We have been operating a Virtual ACE Program (not tied to a specific physical location) for select physicians' elderly patients during a trial period (DY1) and our plan is to expand and open the ACE Program to any physician for their Medical or Surgical patients aged 65+ while we continue to test and implement evidence-based practices to improve their quality and outcomes. In DY1, Nix Health treated 1,336 Med/Surg, non-IC U patients that were aged 65+. As the elderly population grows and Nix development efforts successfully increase Med/Surg volume, we expect that number to increase over the ne xt few years. However, conservatively holding that figure constant, we expect to treat 45% of these patient using these ACE protocols by DY3 (601 patients annually) and increasing to 55% by DY5 (735 patients annually). While patients aged 65 and older are not typically the focus of Medicaid projects, it has been noted that Texas has one of the highest poverty ra tes in the nation at 17.8%. However, a recent report from the U.S. Census Bureau demonstrates that the official pove rty measure drastically underestimates the poverty rate of the elderly, by not taking into considera tion the rising medical costs, declining health status and insurance cove rage. This report shows that the Supplemental Poverty Measure for the elderly was 75% higher than the Official Poverty Measure when these age-related variables we re factored in. Goals and Relationship to Regional Goals Research has shown that the ACE model, which is dedicated to recognizing the unique needs of geriatric patients through a colla borative team-based approach, allo ws elderly patients to avoid the functional decline that can occur during hospitalization. The overarching goal of the ACE program is to allow patients to return to the livin g situation they had been in prior to entering the hospital. Over the course of the next 4 years, Nix Hea lth will implement evidence -based practices aimed at improving the quality, safety and efficiency of care given to these elderly patients. 691 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Nix Health Care System Project Goals: In DY2, we will identify target metrics that we will be tracking, such as LOS, medication costs, falls, discharges to 'home' , etc. and develop a dashboard to allow us to track these metrics effectively over time. Also, we will continue to engage our physicia ns in the concepts of affecting outcomes through evidence-based pr actices and encouraging them to utilize the ACE program for their elderly patients. We will continually review and analyze th e data, and identify at least one area of improvement annually. We will then research and implement evidence-based approaches to impact the identified improvement target. We will subsequently report on our findings to our key stakeholder. To measure our progress toward goal, we w ill annually measure the percent of med/surg admissions (non-ICU) aged 65+ that ar e admitted through the ACE program as a measurement of our physician engagement with the program and its concepts. The project meets the following regional goals: Improve outcomes while containing cost growth Assuring patients receive high-quality and patient-centered care, in the most cost effective ways Challenges The biggest hurdle we face in expanding the prog ram is to educate the physicians on what the program is and how it can benefit their patients. During DY1 we have met with some resistance from physicians who feel that an interdisciplinary team approach to patient care can be intrusive into their thoughts on how to practice medicine, so we are continually educating our physicians on what the program is and the benefits it can have on their patients. 5-year Expected Outcomes for Performing Provider and Patients Through increased physician education and impr oved understanding and by sharing the findings of our own internal process improvements, our goal over the 5 years is to ha ve at least 55% (735) of the Med/Surg patients age 65+ admitted thro ugh the ACE program by DY5. This project is directly related to the regiona l goal of improving quality and patient satisfaction (CN.1) Expected outcomes will relate to the project goals described above. Starting Point/Baseline: Using DY1 (Oct 2011-Sept 2012) as the star ting point, Nix Health had 2,903 Med/Surg Admissions (all ages) and 134 of those were ICU patients. Of the 2,769 non-ICU patients, 1,336 were 65+ (48%). However, only 157 were admitted to the ACE program which equates to 12% of the age 65+ non-ICU admissions. Our goal for DY3 is to have 45% of the age 65+ non-ICU med/surg admissions be admitted to the ACE program, with that percentage increasing to 55% by DY5 (735 patients annually). 692 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Nix Health Care System Rationale: Reason for selecting this project Nix Health feels this project is an integral part of addressing the needs of our community. As stated in the RHP6 Community Needs Assessment, Texas ranks la st in the nation on health care quality (CN.1) and this project wi ll improve both quality and patient satisfaction. Also, there is a high prevalence of chronic disease in our aging population (CN.2) and a ddressing the needs of the elderly during their hospitalization will assist th em post-discharge as well. While this project could have been divided up into other smaller projects, like a stand-al one Care-Transitions Program Implementation, or Medication Mana gement process improvement, we felt the initiatives being undertaken by Nix Health to im prove the safety, quality and outcomes of the geriatric population were best suited to the Category 2.8 project of Design, develop, and implement a program of continuous rapid process im provement that will addr ess issues of safety, quality, and efficiency. This project will allow us to in corporate medication management and care transitions programs, along with other interventions, to addre ss multiple needs of the aging population. And while patients aged 65 and olde r are not typically the focus of Medicaid projects, it has been noted that Texas has one of the highest poverty ra tes in the nation at 17.8%. However, a recent report from the U.S. Census Bureau demonstrates that the official pove rty measure drastically underestimates the poverty rate of the elderly, by not taking into considera tion the rising medical costs, declining health status and insurance cove rage. This report shows that the Supplemental Poverty Measure for the elderly was 75% higher than the Official Poverty Measure when these age-related variables we re factored in. Project Components Through this project, we propose to meet all of the required project components: a. Provide training and education to clinic al and administrative staff on process improvement strategies, methodologies, and culture. Will conduct training sessions with staff who will be involved in implementing, measuring and reporting perfor mance improvement strategies b. Develop an employee suggestion system that a llows for identification of issues that impact the work environment, patient care and satisfaction, efficien cy and other issues aligned with continuous process improvement. All employees will be empowered to provide suggestions for ways we could improve patient care or efficien cies in our workflow. c. Define key safety, quality, and efficiency perf ormance measures and develop a system for continuous data collection, anal ysis dissemination of perf ormance on these measures These key metrics will be identified in DY2 and will be used to build the monthly dashboard that will allow us to tr ack our progress ag ainst our targets d. Develop standard workflow process maps, staffing and care coordination models, protocols, and documentation to sup port continuous process improvement This will be integrated into the training provided to clinical and administrative staff pertaining to the process improvement strategies e. Implement software to integr ate workflows and provide real -time performance feedback As we are able, we will include information into our EMR and nurse documentation 693 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Nix Health Care System system to prompt nursing staff with reminders for specific interventions to provide real- time feedback f. Evaluate the impact of the process impro vement program and assess opportunities to expand, refine, or change processes based on th e results of key performance indicators. Utilizing the dashboard and other tools to measure our progress, we will continually compare our outcomes to what we expected to see based on the evidence-based interventions implemented. As necessary, we will make modifications to our plan and will also continuously evaluate ways that the successful interventions can be applied to other patient populations. Milestones and Metrics Chosen While not a new program, the ACE Program ha s only been in a trial period for DY1 and expanding the program significantly enhances the r each and thereby the benefit it will offer to our patients. The milestones and metrics we have chosen are directly rela ted to the core project components and goals we plan to achieve. Unique Community Needs Identificatio n Numbers this project Addresses CN.1 - Improve quality and patient satisfaction CN.2 - Improve prevention and management of chronic diseases Texas ranks last in the nation on he alth care quality, and the very nature of this project is focused on improving quality and patient satisfaction. Al so, there is a high prevalence of chronic diseases, particularly among the el derly, and through this project we will be address the patient as a whole during their hospitalization rather th an only focusing on their acute ailment and this will help improve the management of chronic conditions. How does this project represent a new initiative or significantly enhances an existing delivery system reform initiative. While not a new initiative, the evidence-base com ponents of the ACE program were just recently implemented at Nix Health during DY1 and th e expansion from 12% to 55%+ signifies a significant enhancement to the existing delivery. Some of the patients currently admitted to the ACE program in DY1 have also been part of a Community-based Care Transitions Program that was funded by a grant from a CMS demonstration pr oject. This funding ended In Sept 2012, so no other federal funds are being used for this pr oject. Nix Health is c onsidering implementing a Care Transitions Program internally for th e ACE patients at high-risk for readmission. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): cause 30 day readmission ra te - NQF 1789 (standalone measure) Reason/rationale for selec ting these outcome measures: Through the ACE program, a collabora tive interdisciplinary team-bas ed approach will be utilized (physician, case manager, physical and occupation al therapy, pharmacy, etc.) to address the full spectrum of the patient's needs during their sta y. Through improved processes regarding patient and family education and post-discharge follo w-up, the readmissions for this population should be reduced. 694 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Nix Health Care System Relationship to other Projects: This project is directly related to our Medical Home Project (Cate gory 2.1) in that the patients of the Medical Home physicians will be admitted through the ACE program and will be managed during their stay by an in terdisciplinary team. Also, this project directly relate s to several Category 4 projects: Potentially Preventable Admissions: By treating the whole patient, and not just the current alignment, we will be reducing the need for further hospitalization. Involvement of the family and care givers during the hospitali zation and with the patient education is crucial to helping th e patient stay healthy when at home post- discharge. 30-Day Readmissions: During the admission to the ACE program, the interdisciplinary team will do a thorough review of the patient' s medication and will perform a 'reset' to ensure the patient is not discharged with duplicative or redundant medications. Research has shown that patients who are di scharged on 5 or more medications have a higher rate of readmission, most likely due to the confusing nature of having to take multiple medications on various schedules. Patient-centered healthcare: By addressing the full needs of the patient and working diligently to ensure that they do not lose unnecessary daily living skills during their hospitalization, patient satisfa ction will be increased. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Other performing providers are planning projects th at fit within Category 2.8, but the details of those projects are not yet fully disseminated. While performance improvement projects may be a shared theme, the details of th e specific projects may not lend th emselves as easily to learning collaborative opportunities within the region, but we will utilize other resources that are closely related to the ACE or NICHE type programs. Plan for Learning Collaborative: TBD Project Valuation: The Nix Health ACE program will coordinate tr eatment plan amongst providers and reduce LOS by 1 day (cost avoidance of $1,9001 per day) and through collaborat ion will result in a reduction of Adverse Drug events by 7 per 100 admissions (cost avoidance of $16,0002 per ADE). Improvement in patient satisfaction can be related to improvement in communication and increased patient/family involvement in their care. Patients that are more involved in their care and understand their discharge instructions will be less likely to be readmitted within 30 days. The use of the ACE model also reduces the in cidence of delirium from 40.8% down to 26%3 with a savings of $2,1813 per case. In addition, the cost of caring for patients post-discharge (home medications, post-acute facility costs, etc.) will be decreased at an annual savings estimated at $5004 per patient. Conservatively assuming volume is flat and meeti ng targets of ACE patients as percent of total age 65+: - Reduced LOS by 1 day per patient enrolled in program ($1,900 1 each) - Avoid 7 ADEs per 100 admissions to the program ($16,0002 each) - Reduce readmission rate through medication evaluation and total 'reset' and improved 695 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Nix Health Care System communication with patient, fa mily and care givers ($9,600 each5) - Reduce delirium rate 40.8% down 26% ($2,1813 each) - Reduce post-discharge costs (home medicati ons, post-acute care facilities, etc. ($5004 per patient) Goal for DY2 would be 40% of the age 65+ non-ICU med/surg admissions would be admitted through the ACE program (approximately 44 patie nts per month in DY2). Applying these values, the total value for DY2, would be $2,440,299 a nd this would increase as the volume of patients admitted through the ACE program conti nues to increases. The goal for DY3 would be 45%, DY4 50% and 55% by DY5.

The primary service area is comprised of Bexar County, Texas and parts of th e surrounding seven counties. Intervention(s) : This project will implement a Patient Navigator Program to assist patients in taking control of their chronic diseases Need for the project : Our region has a shortage of medical and mental health care providers, as well as the lowest scores in the nation for h ealthcare quality. Through the Patient Navigator Program, we will facilitate connect ions between patients and the resources they need, including Primary Care Physicians, Specialists, Behavior al Health service and community programs. Target population : This project targets patients with ch ronic diseases and those that are at greatest risk of disconnect from the health care system. Our over all patient base is roughly 20% Medicaid-eligible/medically indige nt, but we anticipate that Medi caid and/or medically indigent patients will comprise at least 50% of the patients enrolled in the program. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project seeks to have 600 unique patients enrolled in the program by DY3, with that figure increasing to 900 by DY5 Category 3 outcomes: IT.9.2 Our goal is to reduce ED uti lization for diabetes-related issues among enrollees of the Patient Navigato r Program (reduction percentage TBD) Project Description: Project Description Nix Health plans to implement a Patient Navigato r Program to help patients and their families navigate the fragmented maze of the healthcar e system, including primary care physician offices, specialists, preventive screeni ngs, diagnostic testing, inpatient admissions, payment systems, and community resources. During DY2 we will con duct studies within our Provider-Based Clinic offices to identify the targeted patient populations and chronic conditions that we will be focusing on through the Patie nt Navigator Program. Goals and Relationship to Regional Goals Over the next 4 years, Nix Health will strive to serve our patients better through the Patient Navigator Program to improve outcomes, increa se patient satisfaction, and reduce fragmentation of care. The primary goal of the Patient Navigato r will be to allow the patient to focus on taking charge of their chronic diseases rather than focusing their efforts on finding their way through the health care system. 700 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Nix Health Care System Project Goals: Define and implement a Patient Navigator Program Work with our physicians to educate them on the role of the Patient Navigators so they can understand who and when to refer to the program, thereby increasing enrollment and the number of lives we can im pact through this initiative Monitor ED utilization and identify high ED ut ilizers or patients that are using the ED for episodic care and educate them on availa ble Primary Care Physicians available to them The project meets the following regional goals: Improve outcomes while containing cost growth Assuring patients receive high-quality and patient-centered care, in the most cost effective ways Challenges There are several patient populations that could be drastically improved by a Patient Navigation Program, so they first challenge we will face wi ll be to identify how and where to start the program so we can be efficient and targeted. Patient Navigation is most predominant in cancer programs, but we plan on expanding it to other dis eases, like diabetes or COPD. While it will be tempting to address all conditions , this would prove impractical and would spread our staff too thin and the assistance provided to patients would be less effective than if we take a targeted approach. As we learn about th e implementation process, we can then roll the process out to other patient populations. Another challenge we will face will be patient compliance. We will be working with patients that are highly vulnerable and at risk of being disconnected fro m the health care system. Our challenge and goal will be to get these patients engaged in their own health so that we can provide as much assistance as possible and make the most impact on their outcomes. However, due to their high risk and vulne rability, it may prove challenging to keep them engaged for the long term. 5-year Expected Outcomes for Performing Provider and Patients Nix Health expects that this project will strengthen the rela tionship between patients and physicians and will allow physicians more time to dedicate to patient care by providing an extension of their practice to their patients. E xpected outcomes will relate to the project goals described above. Starting Point/Baseline: Nix Health does not currently operate a Patient Navigator program, and plan to research and begin implementation during DY2 Rationale: Reason for selecting this project Fragmentation is prevalent in our region's health care delivery system. Patients can easily get lost and overwhelmed by this fragmentation, wh ich can create barriers to timely care, cause patients to delay seeking treatment, and ultimately result in poorer outcomes. Nix Health sees Patient Navigators as a way to reduce this frag mentation and allow patients to receive timely care and improve outcomes. Given that Nix Health does not currently operate a Patient Navigator Program, we have elected Project Option 2.9.1. 701 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Nix Health Care System Project Components Through this project, we propose to meet all of the required project components: a. Identify frequent ED users and use navigators as part of a preventable ED reduction program. Train health care navigators in cultural competency Nix Health is opening an ED in late 2 012 and will immediately begin tracking ED utilization rates. As we begin building th e Patient Navigator Program, they will play a key role in helping these ED high utilizers und erstand the other primary care options that are available to them. b. Deploy innovative health care personnel, such as case managers/workers, community health workers and other types of hea lth professionals as patient navigators. As we research and define our Patient Navi gator Program, we will identify the types of care providers that will be needed for the progr am. We expect it will be a mix of types of health professions. c. Connect patients to primary and preventive care. One of the main goals of the Patient Navigato r Program will be to connect patients with primary care physicians and clinics and educat e them about preventive care options. While we have not yet identified the patie nt population that the Patient Navigator Program will serve, it will undoubtedly be pati ents with some chronic conditions and primary and preventive care will play a ke y role in the outcomes for these patients. d. Increase access to care management and/ or chronic care management, including education in chronic di sease self-management Chronic care management will be essential to helping the Patient Navigator Program enrollees take charge of their healthcare. We will work with community resources and our own internal resources to identify edu cation opportunities for patients to meet their needs. e. Conduct quality improvement for project using methods such as rapid cycle improvement. Activities may include, but ar e not limited to, identi fying project impacts, identifying \"lessons learned,\" opportunities to scale all or part of the project to a broader patient population, and identifying key c hallenges associated with expansion of the project, including special considera tions for safety-net populations. As part of the implementation, and throughout the life of the Patient Navigation Program, we will continually assess the impacts our interventions are having and review the lessons learned. As necessary, we will make changes to our approach and look for ways to expand the project to reach a broader set of patients. Milestones and Metrics Chosen The milestones and metrics we have chosen are di rectly related to the core project components and goals we plan to achieve. Unique Community Needs Identificatio n Numbers this project Addresses CN.1 - Improve quality and patient satisfaction CN.2 - Improve prevention and management of chronic diseases CN.3 - Improve access to medical care fo r those underinsured by facilitating the 702 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Nix Health Care System connection between patient and physician to minimize the impact of the provider shortage CN.4 - Minimize shortage of mental and beha vioral health services by helping patients navigate to available services that meet their needs. CN.6 - connecting patient with preventive se rvices, like screening and vaccinations, will help address the high rates of vaccine-preventable diseases Our region has a shortage of medical and mental health care providers, as well as the lowest scores in the nation for healthcare quality. Through the Patient Navigator Program, we will facilitate connections between patients and th eir needed resources, ranging from Primary Care Physicians, Specialists, Behavioral Health serv ice and community programs. This program will be targeted at patients that ar e at great risk of disconnect fr om the health ca re system. How does this project represent a new initiative or significantly enhances an existing delivery system reform initiative. Patient Navigators were introduced into the healthcare setting for patients that had been diagnosed with cancer as a way to help these patients deal with the complexities of their diagnosis and treatment options and with the goal of saving liv es by ensuring barriers were eliminated and appropriate care was received timely. In that cont ext, Patient Navigators have played a vital role in the lives of many can cer patients. Embracing that philosophy, Nix will embark on a new initiative of providing Patient Na vigation Services to pa tients who are suffering from other chronic diseases that could also benefi t from a personal \"guide\" to help them navigate through the maze of the health car e system with the overall goal being to improve outcomes and patient satisfaction. This initiative , or related activities , is not being funded in whole or part by the U.S. Department of H ealth and Human Services. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-9 Right Care, Right Setting IT-9.2 ED appropriate utiliz ation (Standalone measure) Reduce Emergency Department Vi sits for targeted conditions: Diabetes Reason/rationale for selec ting these outcome measures: Through the Patient Navigator Program, patients w ill be aided in finding health care resources and providers for their needs, and they will be educated on the community resources that exist pertaining to their chronic dis eases. Through this navigation a ssistance, patients will be less likely to need to present to the ED for treatment of their chronic diseases since these will be better managed on an outpatient basi s proactively. Diabetes, in par ticular, is very prevalent in our patients and we expect to make a large impact with these patients through our Patient Navigator program. Relationship to other Projects: This project overlaps with our Medical Home Model Project and our Performance Improvement project for geriatric patients with respect to pa tients from either of those projects having the potential to be referred to th e Patient Navigator Program. Also, this project directly relate s to several Category 4 projects: Potentially Preventable Admissions: By aligning the patients with resources to address 703 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Nix Health Care System their chronic diseases, preventable admissions will be reduced. 30-Day Readmissions: During admission, if a pa tient is identified at high risk of readmission, they may be referred to the Pa tient Navigator program and post-discharge resources will be made available to the pa tient to reduce the likelihood or readmission within 30 days. Patient-centered healthcare: By addressing the full needs of the patient and working diligently to ensure that the patient's needs are addressed, we are taking steps necessary to center health care around the patient Emergency Department: By assisting the patients with chronic conditions find help through other means besides the ED, the throughput in the ED will likely improve, and will benefit the patients in the ED and reduce the Admit-Decision time. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Other performing providers are planning projects th at will either Expand or Establish a Patient Navigation Program. As members of the RHP, we will work with these other providers to discuss our implementation initiatives, share be st practices and new ideas, and work towards implementing solutions to identified problems. Plan for Learning Collaborative: TBD Project Valuation: The Patient Navigator Model, originally implemen ted for cancer patients, has proven invaluable as a way to help patients navigate through the he alth care system. Ofte ntimes patients need an advocate who understands the medical system and can help direct them to resources that they may otherwise be unaware of. The goal is to he lp and support patients in need of coordinated care navigate through the continuum of health care services so that patients can receive coordinated, timely services when needed with smooth transitions between health care settings. The Medical Home Model has incorporated the Patie nt Navigator into their model but we plan to take it a step further an off a Pa tient Navigator to patients of our health care system as a whole - a concierge of sorts. Someone w ho can assist patients in understan ding each step on their road to recovery or help them better ma nage their chronic conditions. The value of this coordinated effort is challenging to quantify since a large part of its value will be seen in the reduction of frag mentation and the improvement in patient satisfaction. However, for each patient that is enrolled into the Pa tient Navigator Program the value would be $1,200 per year minimum. Patients would be identified as being at the most risk by their PCP or attending physicians during an inpatient stay, and they would be enrolled in the Patient Navigation Program. We anticipate that conservativ ely our provider-based primary care physicians cover nearly 30,000 patient lives and assuming 3% of the pati ents are referred to the Patient Navigator program each year, the value would be $1 M (0.03*30,000 = 900*$1,200 annually = $1,080,000). However, the referrals to the Patien t Navigator Program would not be limited to only our Provider-Based PCPs. Patients identif ied through the ED or dur ing inpatient admission 704 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Nix Health Care System as being vulnerable or at high-risk could be referred to the program. The $1,200 annual savings per enrollee is a conserva tive estimate taking into account reduced ED visits (estimated cost avoidance of $1,318 1 per avoided ER visit), reduced admissions (estimated cost avoidance of $5,3592 per avoided admission), less fragmentation of care, and fewer life-years lost due to lack of access to care. 1Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Medical Expenditure Panel Survey: Potentially Prev entable Readmissions in the Texas Medicaid Population Fiscal Year 2010 http://www.hhsc.state.tx.us/reports/2 012/potentially-preventable-readmissions.pdf NOTE - Through our estimation, this project could be valued as high as $1.5M per year, but in order to stay in line with our Pass 2 a llocation, we have valued it at $1,075,916 in DY2, 705 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Nix Health Care System 112676501.2.3 PASS 2 2.9.1 2.9.1.

The population for Kerrville (2011) wa s listed as 22,423 and the p opulation for Kerr County (2011) was 49,783. Kerr County is a total of 1,108 sq miles (45 persons/s q mile) with only 20.3 (1,100.7 persons/sq mile) of that belonging to Kerrville. PRMC provides healthcare and medical resources to nine surrounding counties with a total population of 187,293. Kerr County has been listed as a Healthcare Provider shortage area ; this however is magnified by the fact that the majority of surrounding counties is also listed as shortage areas, and/or is unable to provide any healthcare services at all. It was found in our Community Health Need s Assessment held in October of this year that 28% of Kerr County's population is unfunded, which is much higher than the national average of unfunded population which was found to be 16% and the national benchmark 11%. Of PRMC's ation visits, Medicaid/Indige nt/Self-pay comprised 11%. Intervention(s) : This project will utilize recommendations from several evidence base practice models to implement a new discharge and care transition process for th e targeted population (Diabetic patients) at PRMC. A Registered Nurse acting as the Discharge Advocate (DA) will coordinate the patient's discharge education tailored to meet the needs of each individual patient, arrange follow-up appointments with primary car e providers and specialists, and post hospital discharge follow-up calls. The DA will promote a patient/family-centered environment that will encourage the patients and their fa mily members/caregivers to particip ate more in their health care and treatment plans. The goal of this project is to use the DAs, hospital medical staff, and pharmacists to provide collaborative patient and fa mily-centered care during transition. This will be accomplished by enhancing care coordination, community outreach, social support, education using appropriate level of health care literacy, a nd culturally competent care to diabetic patients. The DA will ensure adequate planning and arranging of discharge needs has occurred, as well as confirming patient and family understanding of diseas e specific self management care at home. The DAs will also be required to participate in outreach activities and collaboration with multi- disciplined stakeholders from all over the county and any outside of the county that will be willing to collaborate with our organization. Need for the project : This project was chosen to address PRMC's currently fragmented discharge process, 19% of total diabetic population visits at PRMC were seen in our ED, and rapidly increasing population growth rate of diabetes in Kerr County. Kerr County went from being ranked 196th (out of 254 Texas Counties) in 2011 to 246th in 2012 in the diabetes category. Given shorter lengths of stay in acute care, the clinical team is pressured to prep are patients to perform more complex self-management tasks that are ofte n difficult at best for patients to understand. Target population : One of the nation's leading killers, diabetes is a costly, chronic disease that, if not diagnosed and treated properly, over the course of time can lead to serious complications such as heart disease, stroke, b lindness, lower-limb amputation, ki dney failure, disability, and premature death. As stated in the above pa ragraph, Kerr County went from being ranked 196th (out of 254 Texas Counties) in 2011 to 246th in 2012 in the diabetes categ ory. If that alone wasn't 708 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Peterson Regional Medical Center ample enough of a reason to target this population in our community, the reality of how many of our community residents are unf unded/underfunded compounds the complexity of being able to care for these patients with any kind of magnitude or degree of quality value extremely difficult. It was found in our Community Health Needs Assessment held in Octobe r of this year that 28% of Kerr County's population is unfunded, which is mu ch higher than the national average of unfunded population which was found to be 16% and the national benchmark 11%. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : This project seeks improve th e percentage of patients in defined population receiving standardized care a ccording to the approved clinical protocols and care transitions policies establishe d in DY1-DY2. In DY4, we plan to improve percentage of the targeted population to reach 75%. In DY5, we an ticipate meeting the disc harge needs of 95% or more for this same group. Category 3 outcomes : OD-9 Right Care, Right Setting IT -9.2 Reduce Emergency Department visits for target condition - Diabetes will be ex ecuted in DY4 and DY5. 19% of total diabetic population visits at PRMC were seen in our ED in calendar year 2012. DY4 improvement target is to reduce ED visits as a percen tage of total diabetic population visits by 5%. DY5 improvement target is to reduce ED visits as a percentage of total diabetic population vi sits by 5% for a total of 10%. Project Description: Peterson Regional Medical Center proposes to improve the discharge planning and transitioning of care processes through applying an evidence-based best practice model for a targeted chronic disease population. This project will implement a new disc harge and care transition process. Recommendations of patient care guidelines were conquered from several evidence-based practice model sources. We have chosen to mirror the Project Re-Engineered Discharge (Project RED) model created by Boston University Medical Center. Founded on 11 discrete, mutually reinforcing components, Project RED has been proven to reduce rehospitalizations while also generating high rates of patient satisfaction. Components incorporate patient education, care coordination, primary care physician (PCP) prea rranged follow-up, and telephone follow-up calls from both the Discharge Advocate (DA) and a Pharmacist. Improved patient understanding of discharge needs and timely follow-up care; we aim to decrease unnecessary emergency room usage and readmissions for patients of the target ed population. Chart reviews will be completed on all targeted patients readmitted to the hospita l within 30-days, results from review will be utilized for process improvement activities. A Registered Nurse will play the role of the DA. The DA will collaborate with other healthcare providers in caring for targeted popul ation. These patients will also receive an 'After-Hospital Care Plan' folder. This folder will be tailored to meet the needs of each individual patient and their post hospital care and treatment plans. Information within the folder will be designed to clearly present the informa tion patients need to prepare them for the days between discharge and the first visit with their PCP. The DA will oversee the discharge process to ensure relevant patient information has been entered into a dedicated, electronic program that will serve as the nexus of all information rega rding patient discharge and follow-up care. The plan will contain information about the discha rge diagnosis; a list of discharge medications, including why and when the patient needs to ta ke each medication; a daily medication schedule that indicates visually what ti me medications should be taken; instructions about what the patient should do if his or her condition ch anges, including phone numbers of outpatient providers; a schedule indicating a ppointments with outpatient provi ders and/or follow-up tests; 709 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Peterson Regional Medical Center information on diet, exercise, and home equipment; and information to enable the patient to take an active role in follow-up care. Efforts will also be made to further preven t any medication related preventable patient harm by having a pharmacist call patients from this targeted group discharged using the RED process when appropriate. Pharmacist will review their medications, assess whether they are taking the medications as prescribed, determine whether they understand how and when to take them, verify the dosage and times of day the pa tient should take the medications, explain the potential for adverse events such as drug-drug or drug-food interactions , and intervene when necessary. Specific improvement targ ets are described in the table. Goals and Relationship to Regional Goals The goal of this project is to use Discharge Advocates, hospital medical staff, and pharmacists to provide collaborative patient and fa mily centered care during transition. This will be accomplished by enhancing care coordination, community outreach, social support, education using appropriate level of health care literacy, a nd culturally competent care to diabetic patients. The DA will ensure adequate planning and arranging of discharge needs has occurred, as well as confirming patient and family understanding of dis ease specific self management care at home. Support will be given to these patients and th eir family members to navigate through the healthcare continuum in transition of care. By utilizing this DA as a transition specialist, the discharge process for the targeted group will increase patient safety and improve the quality of our discharge process. Project Goals: This project will not only meet the health ne ed challenges of Kerr County but also hospital specific challenges such as a fragmented discha rge process, unclear discharge instructions, staffing, and gap between healthcare providers during transition of car e. Goals include: Creating a patient/family-centered environment that encourages participation in their health care and treatment plans; Improve the patie nts hospital and discharge experience Improve quality and safety of patient care; Promoting better health for beneficiaries Early collaboration with outside providers, especially for Me dicaid, Indigent and Self-pay patients, to ensure all resources are arranged and post hospital needs are met Decrease the amount of wasted healthcare m oney and resources from readmissions and unnecessary Emergency Department visits caused by a lack of follow up, inability to obtain needed medications, etc. Implementing interventions that result in process improvements in medication management, post-discharge follow-up, communication and c oordination of care Interacting with leader s and innovators in the field of Ca re Transitions during a statewide collaborative of providers sharing best practices Integration of an information system capable of securely and easil y transfer important patient care and treatment documents to other healthcare providers across the continuum of care Encourage community collaboration with other ag encies and influential leaders to meet the needs of our target population Increase patient understanding of post hospital care instructions, improve care transitions from hospital to home, and promote self-health management This Project Meets the Following Regional Goals: Triple Aim: assuring patients receive high-quality and patient-centered care, in the most cost effective ways 710 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Peterson Regional Medical Center Improve the health care infrastructure to bett er serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of our counties; Improve outcomes while containing cost growth Further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system Thus we expect to see improved patient sa tisfaction, better health outcomes, reduced healthcare cost, decreased readmissions, and prevent unnecessary emergency department use within the defined diseas e specific population group. Challenges Current challenges discovered in our Comm unity Health Needs Assessment found that Kerr County has a much older popula tion than the average for both Texas and United States. This older population is going to generate a higher de mand for healthcare services. With Type II Diabetes being directly related to obesity, anot her challenge PRMC will face is that obesity is considered the top problem Kerr County faces (as reported by Stratasan in County Health Needs Assessment). To address these challenges an action plan will be implemented to ensure all are considered during creation of Project RED's policies and pro cedures that will include a comprehensive and reliable discharge plan that will help to reduce readmission rates pl us unnecessary Emergency Department visits, improve health outcomes, and en sure quality transitions. A template for disease specific discharge education material will be crea ted using appropriate literacy level for targeted population, which will allow for adjustments as n eeded. Information gained while collaborating with other stakeholders whom ha ve had previous experience with making this type of process change will also be considered. Once policies have been approved, the positions will be opened up to those interested in applying, qualified appl icants will be hired to fill role of the DA. Outreach and collaboration with multi-disciplined st akeholders from across the county will be of great importance over the next four years. Diabetes is one chronic condi tion whose treatment and outcomes are heavily dependent on how well the patient monitors a nd manages the disease outside the health care setting. An important approach to quality improvement for di abetes is improving pati ent self-management. This project will include components of a diabet ic specific 'Self-manage ment program'. The DA along with other Health care profe ssionals will work with patients to build their confidence in managing their own disease, in wo rking within the health care system and the community to have their needs met, and in managing the emotional eff ects of their illness. Patients are informed about their disease and trained using evidence-based information in how they should manage their condition. 5-Year Expected Outcome for Provider and Patients: PRMC expects to see improvements in safety, quality of care and heal th care outcomes of diabetic patients that participate in the innovati ve discharge process. PRMC expects to see improve in the patient's ability to maintain se lf management at home in their own environment and when/where they should seek care if conditi ons change; providers en couraging patient and family involvement in their care; a standardized discharge process that is closing the gaps during transition and preventing potential adverse outco mes, and/or patients falling through the cracks being forgotten about and never followed back up with. Expected outcome s will relate to the projects goals described above. 711 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Peterson Regional Medical Center Starting Point/Baseline: Currently there are no clients/patients served by the proposed project or any of the included process/improvement milestone interventions. At this current time, we also do not have any providers trained in this area/proj ect. Therefore, the baseline for numb er of participants as well as the number of participating providers begins at 0 in DY2. PRMCs baseline diabetic population in calendar year 2012 is a total of 3,719 patients with 12% or 1,226 visits ha ving an inpatient stay. Rationale: Option 2.12.1 was chosen to address currently fragmented discharge process, increased unnecessary ED visits within the high risk diabetic population group, an d increasing population growth rate of diabetes in Kerr County. When a patient's transition is less than optimal, the repercussions can be far reaching \u2014 hospital readmission, an a dverse medical event, and even mortality. Without sufficient information and an understanding of their diagnoses, medication, and selfcare needs, patients cannot fully participate in their care during and after hospital stays. Additionally, poorly designed discharge processes create unnecessary stre ss for medical staff causing failed communications, rewo rk, and frustrations. Expect ations for self-care health management after hospitalization are becoming mo re challenging for patients. Given shorter length of stay in acute care, the clinical team is pressured to prepare patients to perform more complex self-management tasks that are often di fficult at best for patients to understand. Therefore, it makes sense to develop a discharge process to efficiently and reliably provide a patient with the tools and understanding to comply with their healthcare needs. Residents of rural counties tend to be older a nd less educated, experien ce lower per capita income and more poverty than the region as a whole, further com pounding the healthcare challenges faced here (Stratasan, 2012). Kerr County has a much older population than the average for other counties across Texas. This alone generates a much higher demand for money spent on healthcare services (Strat asan, 2012). Inpatient services ar e being utilized more in Kerr County than any other county in Texa s, while outpatient services ar e utilized less than the average utilized across the state of Texa s (Stratasan, 2012). Kerr County provides clinical care to 28% of the population that are uninsured. The Texas av erage of uninsured population is 26% and the National Benchmark is 11% (Stratasan, 2012). Pe terson Regional Medical Center alone provides on average $2 million a month in charity care to he lp meet the medical needs for this population. One of the Nation's leading killers, diabetes is a costly, chronic disease that, if not diagnosed and treated properly, over the course of time can lead to serious complications such as heart disease, stroke, blindness, lower-limb ampu tation, kidney failure, disability, and premature death. Texas ranks 34 th of 50 states with 9.7% of the popul ation suffering from diabetes, the national average is only 8.7% (Americas Health Rankings, 2011). Kerr county went from being ranked 196th (out of 254 Texas counties) in 2011 to 246th in 2012 in the diabetes category (County Health Rankings, 2012). Project Components Through the Discharge and Transition of Care Pr ogram, we propose to meet all required project components. a) Review best practices from a range of models - Components from each RED, BOOST, and STAAR discharge and transition of care program will all be referred to during the planning stages. The DA will be trained to use com ponents from each model. Implementation of evidence based elements within models will outline a safe discharge plan and supporting transitions of care which will help achieve im proved patient satisfaction, patient outcomes, 712 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Peterson Regional Medical Center decreased overall healthcare cost an d reduced preventable readmissions. b) Conduct an analysis of the key drivers of 30 day hospital readmissions using a chart review tool - The Care Coordination Department co llects this readmissi on data during their assessment of the patient and their discharge needs and documents it within the organizations EMR. Meaningful data cannot cu rrently be extracted at this time. In order for this information to be reported in a useful format PRMC will need to contract with an outside resource. c) Integrate information systems so that c ontinuity of care fo r patients is enabled - In the attempt to ensure a smooth transfer of data from provider-to-pr ovider, and agency-to- agency a request has been made for a new soft ware package. This software is the same that Home Health, Hospice, most of the PCPs in the community use, as well as each of the Nursing Homes. It is fully integrated; web- based solutions that simplify and consolidate utilization management, discharge pla nning, and outpatient care management, documentation integrity, quality management and risk management. d) Develop a system to identify patients being disc harged potentially at risk of needing acute care services within 30 60 day - All patients in the diabetic targeted population group will receive the discharge planning and transition of care process as implemented. PRMC will identify and collect data on all patients with diabetes as a primary diagnosis or co- complication. From this overall population group we will further separate data for patients with a payer source of Medicaid, Indigent a nd Self-pay. Adjustments to their discharge education and arrangements by the DA will be made as determined during patient assessment. Each of these targeted patients will also receive follow-up from several sources even after they are discharged, such as: the follow-up phone call from the DA, the follow-up phone call and medica tion education from the pharmacist, and the follow-up appointments and frequent communication fr om/with the Chronic Disease Management Nurse. All patients will be scheduled their follow-up appointment with their PCPs and any other specialists with-in 3-7 days after discharge. If it is still felt that the patient will need some additional follow-up from a medical provide r, home health will be arranged to check in on patient the days that they are not bei ng followed up with from any of the providers mentioned above. e) Implement discharge planning program and post discharge support program - The DA will make their first contact with the targ eted patient population within 24 hours after admission. Over the course of the patients sta y, they will meet with the DA multiple times to discus and plan for the patient's discharge. The DA will also attend our daily multi-disciplinary meetings (which also includes all hospitalists) for fu rther discussion of discharge needs with the rest of the medical team. During their orientation, the DA(s) will be introduced to outside community agencies and local community leaders. It will be important for them to start networking early to create these bonds w ith the people/agencies that will be assuming care of the patient once discharged home. When program is up and fully running the DA will continue to keep in close contact with these community providers and advocate for any additional patient needs as needed. f) Develop a cross continuum team comprised of clinic al and administrative representatives from acute care, skilled nursing, ambulatory ca re, health centers, and home care providers - The Care Coordination Depart ment currently holds quarterly collaboration meetings with the local Nursing Home Administrators. Th ese meetings have created a partnership between these two groups and successfully improve patient care, safety, quality, and 713 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Peterson Regional Medical Center transition of care. With the commencement of this new program, additional members will be invited to the meetings. New members will include administrators from the local home health and hospice agencies, as well as th e practice managers from local primary care practices. g) Conduct quality improvement for pr oject using methods such as rapid cycle improvement. Activities may include, but ar e not limited to, identifying project impacts, identifying \"lessons learned,\" opportunities to scale all or part of th e project to a broader patient population, and identifying key challenges associ ated with expansion of the project, including special considerations for safety net populations - Collaborative self- management support (CSMS) means that everyon e works together to help the patients manage their condition. CSMS is centered on the patient's specifi c needs, abilities, values, and preferences. Families and others in their support network are welcomed to participate. To maintain healthy lives, people with chroni c or long-term conditions and their families have to manage their condition from day to day. Self-management often involves medical treatments and therapies. It can also mean ma king lifestyle changes, such as eating better, reducing stress, or increasing exercise. This care planning process is done together in a patient-centered environment. The unique community need identification numbers the project addresses are: CN.1 - Deliver improved quality and patient satisfaction. CN.2 - Greater prevention efforts and impr oved management of patients with chronic conditions CN.3 - Access to medical care for pati ents regardless of payment status How the project represents a new initiative or enhances an existing delivery system reform initiative The project is not currently being used in clinical practice. All components (milestones and metrics) of this project represent new initia tives for the performing provider. It was also discovered that recently Projec t RED has lost their funding fr om AHRQ, which was caused by government budget cuts. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-9 Right Care, Right Setting and IT 9.2 was chosen as the projects outcome domain based on 19% of overall diabetic population visi ts were Emergency Department setting. High volumes of diabetic patients using the Emergency Department as their primary source of care increases health care cost and fragments continu ity of care which should be provided in less costly settings. Proper implementation of Category 2 process improvements within the diabetic population group will improve transiti on of care resulting in an expected decrease in emergency department visits by 5% in DY4 and an additional 5% in DY5. Recent studies evaluating hospital discharges ha ve associated the risk of adverse events with deficiencies in health literacy, patient e ducation, communication among health care providers within and between sites of care, appropriate medical follow-up, a nd any number of issues related to medications; all which also affect patient sa fety during transition of care Components of the project will center attention on co st effective affordable care to include and not limited to post hospital follow-up, medications, supplies, and receivi ng the right care in th e right setting at the right time. Relationship to other Projects: For Pass 1, PRMC was only required to complete one project for Category 1 and 2. Related Category 4 measures include Populat ion-focused measures: RD-1.2 Potentially 714 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Peterson Regional Medical Center Preventable Admissions - Diabet es Admission Rates; RD-2.2 Diab 3 Potentially Preventable Complications; RD-4.1 Patient-centered Healthcare - Patient Satisfaction and Medication management; and RD-5 Emergency Department Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: From the \"draft\" list provided, providers in th e RHP that are establishing programs similar to ours are: UTHSCSA 2.2 Expand Chronic Care Management Models, and 2.4 Redesign to Improve Patient Experience University Health System 2.2 Expand Chronic Care Management Models, and 2.4 Redesign to Improve Patient Experience Methodist 2.4 Redesign to Improve Patient Experience Methodist 2.4 Redesign to Improve Patient Experience Bluebonnet 2.9 Establish/Expand Patient Navigation Program Plan for Learning Collaborative: University Health System, as the RHP 6 an chor, will promote and facilitate learning collaboratives. Following completion of the RHP Plan, University Health System will facilitate the formation of working groups of performing providers who are pursuing similar projects. These working groups will develop their learning collaborative structure which may include the following: Identify participants; Establish Lear ning Collaborative goals; Develop a calendar of regular meetings, site visits, and/or conference calls; Develop a plan to communicate ideas, data, and successes across the region and state; Organize a learning event and invite experts and other Performing Providers from outside the region to share knowledge and best practices; Adopt metrics to measure success. 715 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Peterson Regional Medical Center Project Valuation: Peterson Regional Medical Center is licensed for 125 acute care beds. The diabetic population in calendar year 2012 consisted of 3719 patients. 11 % of the visits were provided for the Medicaid/Indigent/Self-pay subpopulation. The imp lementation cost of this project for DY1- DY2 is estimated to be $434,292. Each year th ereafter has an estimated cost of $267,272. In calendar year 2012 PRMC's baseline diabetic po pulation group had a total of 3,719 patients with 1,226 inpatient admissions for a total of $28.8 milli on in charges. Once project outcomes have been reached, we estimate an average annual community healthcare savings of $2.9 million by reducing the rate of inpatient admissions (as a percentage of the tota l diabetic population) by 10%. Currently, PRMC has 0 patients receiving standardized care processes related to project RED. In DY2 we will begin implementation of program for focused patient population and initial patients receiving standardized care pro cesses related. In DY4 we will improve the % of patients in defined population receiving standard ized care according to Policy & Procedure by 75% and to 95% in DY5. This project will address many of the di scovered community health care needs by strategically implementing components of an evid ence-based care transition model. Project Re- engineered Discharge (Project RE D) began at Boston University Medical Center and was designed to improve the hospital discharge process in a wa y that promotes patient safety and reduce re- hospitalizations. The Project Red model is suppor ted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This model will be used to assist in closing the gap in health care services of Kerr County residents causing them to utilize more costly inpatient services versus less costly outpatient services. The shortage of primary care physicians in Kerr County has contributed to an increase use of ED visits often resulting in inpatient services. Patients w ith chronic diseases who are not established with a primary care pr ovider are more likely to show up in the emergency department in crisis, which often results in an inpatient admission. The components of Project Red will prepare patients to better understand their dise ase process and address individual needs enabling them to better care for themselves. After a patient has been admitted to the hospital they are usually motivated to learn more about their illnes s; it is crucial that h ealthcare providers take advantage of this opportunity to educate and coordinate care during and beyond the hospital setting. This will allow patients to feel more involved and increase potential compliance with their own healthcare needs. By utilizing a more patient-centered discharge model patients will experience more buy in to improve and maintain their own health at home. 716 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Peterson Regional Medical Center 127294003.2.1 PASS 1 2.12.1 2.12.1.A-G 2.12.1 Develop, implement and evaluate standardized clinical protocols and evidence-based care delivery model to improve care transitions Peterson Regional Medical Center TPI - 127294003 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 127294003.3.1 3.IT-9.2 IT-9.2 Reduce Emergency Department vis its for target condition - Diabetes (Standalone) Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P-1]: Develop best practices or evidence based protocols for effectively communicating with patients and families during and postdischarge to improve adherence to discharge and follow up care instructions Metric 1 [P-1.1]: Care transitions protocols Baseline : No protocols in place Goal : Development and submission of evidence-based protocols for Project RED program Data Source : NIH, AHRQ, HCPro, Texas Hospital Quality, IOM, IHI, PCORI Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment : $1,555,399 Milestone 2 [P-7]: Develop a staffing and implementation plan to accomplish the goals/objectives of the care transitions program Metric 1 [P-7.1]: Documentation of the staffing plan.

Unique RHP ID#: 136491104.2.1 - PASS 1 Provider Name: Southwest General Hospital TPI: 136491104 Project Summary: Provider Description : Southwest General Hospital is a 327-bed, acute care hospital in San Antonio, Texas serving residents of RHP 6 and surrounding areas. RH P 6 encompasses 20 counties and covers 24,734 square miles, comprising about 9.5% of the total land area of Texas. Intervention(s) : The project encompasses the de velopment, implementation, and evaluation of an evidence based health promotion strategy through the use of a mobile car diovascular screening program for RHP 6 and surrounding rural community residents. Need for the project : Currently at Southwest General Hospital, 45% of patients are Medicaid recipients or uninsured. The Mobile Cardiovascular Screen ing Program will assist with improving the early identification of cardiovasc ular health issues and the care delivery infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured resi dents of South San Antonio and surrounding rural communities. Cardiovascular disease is one of the lead ing causes of death in RHP 6. Early disease identification, intervention and management are critical to reduce this potentially preventable disease. RHP 6 has a higher percentage of patients w ho are unable to access primary care due to the high cost, as compared to the Texas average from 2007-2010. Access to affordable care has been an issue within the region, leading to poor health outcomes and a high percentage of preventa ble hospitalizations. Healthcare impact of a major oil/gas play in a rural environment.- oil and gas business in South Texas to include South San Antonio, At ascosa, and Wilson counties, have presented a new, large population to the RHP 6 regi on. A large pool of uninsured workers will impact the numbers in need of cardiovasc ular screening. Excluding the oil and gas employees, 24% or 471,000 residents of RHP cu rrently lack health insurance coverage. Small firms in rural areas cannot afford to in sure employees or most are self employed. The potential numbers for cardiovascular scr eening is difficult to project based on the rapid population growth in the Eagle Ford Sh ale region of RHP 6. The shale activity is projected to create near ly 117,000 full time jobs by 20217. Nearly every county in RHP 6 is designated as a Health Provider Shortage Area for primary care Target population : The target population is RHP 6 rural community residents with the focus on Medicaid and uninsured residents of South San Antonio and rural communities with unsuspected or 720 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Southwest General Hospital undiagnosed cardiovascular disease. As stated above, the rapidl y increasing population of this area impacts the ability to project numbers benefitting from the screening project. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : Early identification of potential and/or actua l cardiovascular diseas e processes requiring medical or surgical intervention. Category 3 outcomes: Reduction of emergency department visits of targeted population by 5% from year 3 to year 4. Reduction of emergency department visits of targeted population by 7% from year 4 to year 5. Adequate blood pressure control demonstrated by 5% of patients on follow-up visits from year 3 to year 4. Adequate blood pressure control demonstrated by 7% of patients on follow-up visits from year 4 to year 5. Project Description: Southwest General Hospital proposes to impl ement an innovative evidence based health promotion strategy through the development, implementation, and ev aluation of a mobile cardiovascular screening program. Through the implementation of a mobile cardiova scular screening progr am, the surrounding rural communities will have the opportunity to access a vital health resource to identify potentially serious cardiovascular events in a timely and co st effective manner. The program will provide a mobile vascular screening service which will provide non-invasive screenings. Tests will be performed by vascular technologists with results and a follow-up plan, as necessary, provided at the time of screening. Through the goal of improving cardiovascular health for the residents of RHP6 through a mobile screening program, the project will impact the following: Enhance availability of resources to assess and refer residents of rural communities for cardiovascular healthcare resulti ng from mobile screening assessment Establish referrals to cardiovascular specia lists within the Sout hwest General physician community to provide specialty care to high ri sk residents Quality improvement efforts will focus on us e of rapid cycle improvement methodologies to identify and quickly address project barr iers and/or implementation barriers which would include the impact of marketing stra tegies on reaching target communities which will direct ongoing plan revisions and/or targ et market. CQI activities will also include weekly team huddles to identify areas of strength and weakness re lated to screening program operations and immediat e revisions as necessary. Goals and Relationship to Regional Goals: The goal of this project to develop and implem ent innovative, evidence based screening program to identify high risk patients in need of specialty care services (Cardiovascular) and to provide 721 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Southwest General Hospital care for high risk cardiovascular problems iden tified by outreach vascular screening programs to RHP 6 rural communities. Project Goals: Develop, implement, and evaluate a mobile Cardiovascular Screen ing Program for the RHP 6 region Increase access to care for RHP 6 rural comm unity residents to identify potential and/or actual cardiovascular disease processes requ iring medical or surg ical intervention This program meets the following regional goals: The Mobile Cardiovascular Screening Program will contribute to assuring patients receive high-quality, patient centered care with the goal of early disease identification and intervention for cardiovascular problems th rough improved access to care provided by the Mobile Cardiovascular Screening Program. The Cardiovascular Screening Program will assist with improving the health care delivery infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid a nd uninsured residents of South San Antonio and surrounding rural communities. Currently at Sout hwest General Hospital, 45% of patients are Medicaid recipients or uninsured. The program will build on the existing cardiovascul ar specialty service which is comprised of private and 501a employed cardiologists. Outreach efforts will serve to identify and reach key rural areas currently experiencing difficulty with access to care. Challenges/Issues Faced By Provider: o Identifying vendor most capable and compa tible with existing re sources - Southwest General Hospital currently contracts with a company for vascular ultrasound services. The contract will be reviewed to include th e Cardiovascular Screening program in the services provided to SWG. In collaboration with this company the hospital will, in the near future, be evaluated for ICAVL accreditation.

Starting Point/Baseline: Starting Point/Baseline: Currently, a mobile cardiovascular screening program does not exist for patients at Southwest General Hospital. Th erefore, the baseline fo r the number of RHP 6 residents eligible for screening at 0 for DY2. The Cardiovascular Center at Southwest Ge neral Hospital has provi ded cardiovascular and peripheral vascular care to the South Sa n Antonio area and surrounding communities with excellent outcomes. We have the ability and knowledge to provide outlying communities through early identification and referral to appropriate resources needed to manage Cardiovascular dysfunction identified thr ough community screening. The ability to establish mobile outreach screen ing programs served by cardiovascular specialty staff in key rural areas will provide improved access to care, and specialist management of cardiovascular diagnosis and symptoms, as required. Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death in RHP 61. Early disease identifica tion and management is cr itical to reduce this potentially preventable disease. Early identificat ion and intervention is a desired outcome of the proposed initiative. Through the im plementation of a mobile screen ing strategy, it is projected the screening encounters will increase by 10% fr om Year 4 to Year 5 through expansion of rural counties in which screeni ng program is provided. 1 RHP 6 Community Needs Assessment, July 2012. Rationale: RHP 6 has a higher percentage of patients who ar e unable to access primary care due to the high cost, as compare to the Texas average from 2007-20102. Access to affordable care has been an issue within the region, leading to poor health outcomes and a high percentage of preventable hospitalizations. According to the Agency for Healthcare Research Quality's 2011 report, Texas ranks last in the nation on health care quality. The report is base d on 155 quality measures which include disease prevention measures. Texas scored weak on preven tive measures and under the category of \"care by clinical area, Texas scored weak on heart disease measures3. The shortage of health care 723 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Southwest General Hospital providers has led to high emergency room utilizati on. This is a very costly means of health care delivery, and often results in a delay seeking tr eatment until the illness is severe and advanced4. In addition, access to primary care has become incr easingly difficult within the region, resulting in poor overall management of the population's health. This issue will only continue as the populat ion increases at its current rate. Improving identification and early intervention of cardiovascular problems will decrease misuse of the ED and lower healthcare costs. Across the state of Texas, ED visits increased by 28.6% with RHP 6 following this trend. Cardiovascular disease is one of th e leading causes of death in RHP 6 5. Early disease identification and management is critical to redu ce this potentially prev entable disease. Early identification and interventi on is a desired outcome of the proposed initiative. RHP 6 encompasses 20 counties and covers 24,734 square miles, compromising about 9.5% of the total land area of Texas6. In some areas, it may take patie nts hours to drive to Performing Provider facilities. Therefore, a mobile cardiovasc ular screening clinic offers the benefits of taking the services to the patients, which will he lp keep them healthy proactively. Establishing a mechanism for timely, affordable care would lead to improved outcomes and would provide patients with education on how to manage their condition. Unique community need identification number the project addresses: CN.1 - Texas ranks last in the nation on health ca re quality. RHP 6 is challenged to deliver improved quality and patient satisfaction CN-2 - A high prevalence of chroni c disease and related health disparities require greater prevention efforts and improved management of patients with chronic conditions. Leading causes of death in RHP 6 include cardiovascular disease. As stated previously, the Card iovascular Center at Southwes t General Hospital has provided cardiovascular and peripheral vascular care to the South San Antonio area and surrounding communities with excellent outco mes. We have the knowledge and ability to provide outlying communities screening, early probl em identification, and referral to appropriate resources to manage Cardiovascular dysfuncti on. Outcomes of the interv ention will improve the care of residents and decrease the use of the Emergency Department for the first \"screening\" assessment for disease. 2RHP 6 Community Needs Assessment, July 2012. 3RHP 6 Community Needs Assessment, July 2012. 4RHP 6 Community Needs Assessment, July 2012. 5RHP 6 Community Needs Assessment, July 2012. 6RHP 6 Community Needs Assessment, July 2012. 7RHP 6 Community Needs Assessment, July 2012. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): Proposed Category 3 Outcome Measures: 724 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Southwest General Hospital IT 9.2 - ED appropriate utilization Reduce ED visits for target conditions: Cardiovascular Disease/Hypertension The shortage of health care providers and the iden tification of early disease processes have led to high emergency room utilization. This is a very co stly means of health care delivery, and often results in a delay seeking treatment un til the illness is severe and advanced 7. In addition, access to primary care has become increasingly difficult within the region, resulting in poor overall management of the population's health. Through th e development of a mobile cardiovascular screening program by Southwest General Hospital, the surrounding rural communities will have the opportunity to access a vital health resource to identify potentially serious cardiovascular events in a timely and cost effective manner. Re sults and follow-up plan, as necessary, are to be provided at the time of screening. The proposed out come of this project is early identification and referral of positive findings to a Cardiovascul ar specialist prior to acute manifestation of a clinical problem. The end measureable outcome being the decrease ED utilization for Cardiovascular symptoms due to early identifica tion and management of po tential life threatening cardiovascular conditions. 7 RHP 6 Community Needs Assessment, July 2012. Relationship to other Projects: A mobile cardiovascular screening program focu sed on health promotion, screening and access to disease management specialists would: 1.9: Expand our specialty care capacity along with several other initiativ es pertinent to the RHP. The mobile unit would id entify patients in need of furt her follow up with a specialty clinic. The project aligns with Categor y 4 Population focused measures which are the following: RD-1 Potentially Preventable Admissions related to Congestiv e Heart Failure and Hypertension admission rate; and RD0-3 Po tentially Preventable complications. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Potential members of learning collaborative based on early review and iden tification of projects. Further detail required to assess comparab ility and potential for collaboration.

The potential for collaboration with above identified pr ojects and providers is cr itical to best practice identification and performan ce improvement projects. Project Valuation: Achieve Waiver Goals: Waiver goals include increasing the capacity to provide specialty ca re services and the availability of targeted specia lty providers to better accommoda te the high demand for specialty care services so that patients have in creased access to spec ialty services. In support of the goal, Southwest General Hospita l will develop a mobile program dedicated to vascular screening. Through this service th e surrounding rural communities will have the opportunity to access a vita l health resource to identify potentia lly serious cardiovascular events in a timely and cost effective manner. The program will provide a mobile vascular screening service which will provide non-i nvasive screenings. Tests will be performed by vascular technologists. Results and follow-up plan, as nece ssary, provided at the time of screening. Addresses Community Needs: As previously stated, early identification a nd management of potential life threatening cardiovascular conditions (Stroke; Carotid Artery Disease: Peripheral Vasc ular Insufficiency, as well as access for services and treatment otherw ise not available is critical to meeting the healthcare needs of RHP 6. The shortage of health care providers has led to high emergency room utilization. This is a very costly means of health care delivery, and often re sults in a delay seeking treatment until the illness is severe and advanced 9. In addition, access to primary care has become increasingly difficult within the region, resulting in poor overall management of the population's health. Through the development of a Mobile Sc reening Program by Southwest General Hospital, dedicated to vascular screeni ng, the surrounding rural communities will have the opportunity to access a vital health resour ce to identify potentially serious card iovascular events in a timely and cost effective manner. Project Scope: Southwest General Hospital has provided care to the residents of South San Antonio since 1978. In late 2012, the organization achieved Chest Pain Accreditation and currently is preparing for PCI Accreditation with the Center. The expansio n of the program to outlying communities will further enhance care but also ex tend high quality preventive care and education for the region. The program framework for cardiovascular servi ces is developed and su pports acute care needs for the area. Program development requires the expansion and planning to serve and identify a larger patient base and establ ish outreach programs to impact care for the patient population. Through the development of a mobile cardiovasc ular screening program by Southwest General Hospital, the surrounding rural communities will have the opportunity to access a vital health 726 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Southwest General Hospital resource to identify potentially serious cardiovascular events in a timely and cost effective manner. Project Investment: Many of the resources required to support the physician component of the proposed project is in place. The need to recruit and hire midlevel car e providers is a key investment in manpower to support the endeavor. The purchase of additional noninvasive diagnostic equipment and a van to support the program will be a $190,000 investment by Southwest General Hospital to launch the program for its current patient popula tion and the RHP 6 proposed project. 9 RHP 6 Community Needs Assessment, July 2012. 727 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Southwest General Hospital 136491104.2.1 PASS 1 2.6.4 N/A 2.6.4 Implement an innovative, evidence based health promotion strategy through the development, implementation and evaluation of a mobile ca rdiovascular screening program.

Intervention(s) : This project will: a) increase targeted testing for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in high risk minority communities, b) provide routin e testing for LTBI with interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) instead of tuberculin skin testing to minimize false positive tests in BCG vaccinated patients and avoid unnecessary LTBI therapy, c) provide routine treat ment of LTBI through a 12 dose, 12 week regimen administered by DOT to improve patient adherence and co mpletion of LTBI therapy, d) facilitate hospita lization for TB care of those few patient s who cannot be successfully treated as outpatients. Need for the project : TB continues to be a sign ificant and expensive public h ealth problem in TX. This project represents collaboration between three ent ities, TCID, University of Texas Health Science Center, Tyler (UTHSCT) and TX Department of State Health Services (DSHS), with renowned physician expertise that will deliver improved TB car e for minority populations. The project includes targeted testing for LTBI, effective treatment of LTBI in order to prevent future cases, and case identification with referral for appropriate therapy (inpatient or outpatient). The project will be implemented in two public health regions of Texas, one urban and one rural in order to capitalize both on the expertise of providers and also to demons trate a model of case identification and treatment delivery that is effective in reducing the spread of the disease while providing better health outcomes with improved patient satisfaction. Target population : In 2011 in Public Health Regions 4 & 5N and 8, 1310 individuals underwent testing for LTBI including 833 as part of contact investigati ons which in the context of limited resources take priority over other recommended indications for LTBI testing. Only 573 re ceived therapy with approximately 67% completing LTBI therapy. 178 pa tients were diagnosed w ith active TB with approximately 80% completing therapy. Economi cally disadvantaged minority populations suffer disproportionately from LTBI and active TB. Shorte r, effective new LTBI tr eatment regimens are available however, not implemented broadly enough at this time to redu ce the spread of the disease. People who do not have access to primary care services are the least likely to be diagnosed with LTBI and therefore, present a risk of developing and then spreading TB. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : Evidence-based CDC and DSHS treatment guidelines insure avoidance of unnecessary and costly diagnostic and tr eatment strategies while the application of new diagnostic (IGRA testing) and treat ment strategies (12 week LTBI th erapy) further reduce costs by focusing resources on interventions of proven public health value at a lower financial cost. This project will provide, a) enhanced access to a comprehensive fu lly integrated TB care process that utilizes the existing DSHS public health infrastructure and p hysician expertise from UT, b) implementation of universal LTBI testing with IGRAs thereby limiting the expense and potential dr ug toxicity of false + TSTs in BCG vaccinated populations, c) implemen ting universal 12 week, 12 dose LTBI therapy to improve LTBI treatment completion rates and decreas e future TB burden. Of the 1310 individuals with LTBI in this clinical cohort we will utilize IGRA 's to improve specificity of identification of LTBI 730 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Texas Center for Infectious Disease cases and with universal application of superv ised 12 week, 12 dose LTBI therapy we will improve completion rates for LTBI therapy over baseline by 3% in DY 4 and 5% in DY 5. Of the 178 patients with active TB we will increase tr eatment completion rates over baseline by 3 % in DY4 and 5% in DY5 with universal application of direct ly observed therapy and sele ctive use of inpatient therapy. Category 3 Outcomes : Our goal in DY4 is a 3% improvement in LTBI treatment completion over baseline for LTBI and 3% improvement in therapy of active TB over baseline in urban and rural minority populations and in DY5 a 5% improvement in LTBI treatment completion over baseline and 5% improvement in therapy of active TB over ba seline in urban and rural minority populations. The DY 4 and DY 5 targets for the proposed strate gies were determined by considering re cent trends in LTBI and TB disease epidemiology in Texas and the funding available for the st ate TB program, both of which have been relatively unchanged with a realistic assessment of the potential for any intervention to significantly improve in the context of these static trends. Project Description: Implement a strategy for comprehensive , cost-effective and integrated management of tuberculosis (TB) infection and disease in ur ban and rural minority communities through a partnership between the Texas Center for Infectio us Disease (TCID), the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) and the Univers ity of Texas Health Science Center, Tyler (UTHSCT). Goals and Relationship to Regional Goals: Collaboration between these 3 entities focu ses a full scope of expert physician support of DSHS, with the goal of improved TB care for minority popul ations including targeted testing for latent TB infection (LTBI), effective treatmen t of LTBI for prevention of future TB cases, TB case identification with appropriate outpatient and/or inpatient TB therapy and aggre ssive contact investigation with treatment of LTBI associated with active TB cases. These goals w ill be accomplished according to CDC and DHHS evidence-based strategies with an em phasis on cost-effectiveness. These goals will be accomplished through the application of new and cost-e ffective diagnostic tests such as the interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) and the use of new co st-effective treatment strategies such as the 12 week, 12 dose treatment strategy for LTBI. The projec t will be guided by physicians with the most TB experience in the state. This comprehensive appr oach will not only improve outcomes long term, but will also decrease costs for TB manageme nt in both the short and long terms. The project will take a dvantage of existing DSHS infrastructure and policy for basic public health functions, namely the use of directly observed ther apy (DOT) for treatment of active TB disease, and contact investigation to identify LTBI cases associat ed with active TB disease cases. In addition all patients who otherwise would have been evaluated with a tuberculin skin test (TST) will be evaluated instead by an IGRA. The IGRAs have been repeated ly shown to be more specific than TST when testing BCG vaccinated populations. Although the IG RAs are somewhat more expensive than TSTs from the perspective of initial costs, they pr oduce net savings long term by avoiding unnecessary therapy for patients with false positive TSTs due to previous BCG vaccination who represent the majority of patients diagnosed with TB in the U.S. The IGRAs have no cross reactivity with BCG as do the TSTs. Additionally, for those patients who ar e found to have LTBI, the standard treatment will be a 12 dose, 12 week regimen with rifapentine a nd isoniazid (INH). Although the rifapentine is a relatively expensive medication, this regimen also produces long term net savings resulting from better patient adherence with the regimen compared to INH and, therefore, fewer cases of active TB in patients identified with LTBI. Treatment completion rates for INH regimens are routinely in the 60% range, whereas recent data utiliz ing the 12 week 12 dose regimen by DOT shows treatment completion in the 80% range. The logical anticipated outcome of improved LTBI adherence and treatment 731 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Texas Center for Infectious Disease completion would be decreased TB disease rates in th e future. Overall, the combination of routine IGRA use and application of the 12 week LTBI treatment strategy offe rs the potential for significant cost savings without sacrificing be nefit to individuals and the public health in general. Additionally, the expertise of the supervising UT physicians a llows efficient and cost-effective diagnostic and therapeutic decisions throughout the course of TB disease or LTBI for all patients. We propose that UT physicians coordinate all aspects of TB care in 2 DSHS Health Service Regions (Health Service Regions 8 and Regi on 4/5N) between DSHS personnel UTHSCT, TCID, HNTC and DSHS promotes optimization of medically effective and cost- effective care and can serve as a model for manage ment of TB throughout th e state of Texas with partnerships between DSHS and other UT health components. The advantages of the system of cooperation between UTHSCT and DSHS include the following. 1) There is a central authority (i.e. UTHSCT) that DSHS personnel can access for questions regarding TB patients (either with active dise ase or LTBI). In emergency situa tions, UTHSCT physicians can be reached 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. A major problem throughout the state is the easy identification of a responsible physician for handling TB patients and difficult management questions. If this proposal is implemented, DSHS personnel will never be left without physician support or with the prompt identification of a phys ician responsible for a specific problem. When appropriate, the UTHSCT personnel also facilita te inpatient TB therapy. 2) There are identified and coor dinated inpatient facilities (UTH SCT and TCID) for those few TB patients requiring referral or transfer on either an elec tive or emergency basis. 3) There are designated UTHSCT p hysicians, expert in the care of TB, available to support DSHS personnel in the management of any TB patient at all levels including telephone consultation, outpatient management and inpatient care if necessa ry. All patients with TB disease and LTBI are managed by a centrally located, expert staff acco rding to national and DSHS guidelines. The physicians provide evidence based care consiste nt with national a nd state guidelines. 4) Statewide adoption of this model (DSHS mana gement of TB and LTBI supported by UT faculty) would offer the same benefits described above to minority populations and DSHS personnel throughout the state. DSHS personnel would have rapid access to reliable and expert physician support and easily obtained admission of patients to re spiratory isolation if necessary. There would be no ambiguity about the responsibility for management of the patient. The DSHS personnel coul d go directly to their designated UT facility for support in cluding consultation and hospitalizat ion. Access to the entire UT system would add a dimension missing in the current proposal that is limited to 2 DSHS regions, that is, access to multiple medical special ties (especially surgical subspecial ties), and, therefore, the ability to provide total care to the patient with TB. The majority of hospitalized TB patients would still be treated at TCID after stabili zation at local UT facilities. Project Goals: Provide predictable and reliable expert physician support for DSHS personnel at all levels of TB care. Increase overall access to TB care in minority populations. Increase targeted testing for LTBI in high risk minority communities. Provide routine testing for LTBI with interferon gamma release assays instead of tuberculin skin testing to minimize false positive tests in BCG vaccinated patients and avoid unnecessary LTBI therapy. Provide routine treatment of LTBI through a 12 do se, 12 week regimen administered by DOT to improve patient adherence and completion of LTBI therapy. 732 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Texas Center for Infectious Disease Provide expert consultation and direct pa tient oversight of all active TB cases. Facilitate continuity of TB care through all phases includ ing LTBI therapy, outpatient TB therapy and, when necessary, inpatient therapy. Facilitate hospitalization for TB care of those few patients wh o cannot be successfully treated as outpatients. Provide a model for statewide TB management through complete integration of TB resources between DSHS (TCID) and UTHSCT, including HNTC. This project meets the following regional goals: Further develop a coordina ted care delivery system Challenges: The high percentages of minority patients with TB compared to white, has remained stubbornly, frustratingly and consistently high. Th ere are likely multiple explanations for this observation including distrust of th e medical establishment, fear of legal reprisal fo r non-citizens and lack of culturally appropriate educ ation and outreach materials. To some degree these challenges can be overcome with increased resources focused on th e minority communities, a nd identification of the TB control effort with one trusted and non-threaten ing entity, the University of Texas. There are obstacles to the statewide applicatio n of this model that would need to be addressed. First, there are Texas Health Service Regions (HSR s) without a UT aff iliated facility. Appr opriate alternative treatment agreements would have to be made in those areas. Again, transfer of long-term care patients to TCID would be anticipated. Second, some HSRs have multiple (or complex) layers of Health Department authority that might th wart easy assignment of authority to UT. Third, some HSRs have long-term and ongoing associations with academic instit utions other than UT (even in Regions with a major UT health care facility). Not all HSRs lack adequate physician support. These physicians would need to be covered under the broad umbr ella of UT physician management oversight. 5-Year Expected Outcome for Provider and Patients in HSRs 8 and 4/5N: 1) Full integration of TB care at all levels (LTBI test ing, LTBI treatment, TB case identification, TB case management) in HSR Regions 8 and 4/5N coordinated between DSHS and UT physicians (UTHSCT, TCID, HNTC) 2) Increased numbers of minority persons (Black and Hispanic) screened for LTBI 3) > 90% completion of therapy for active TB 4) > 95% therapy of active TB by DOT 5) >10% increase in identification of LTBI patients 6) >10% improvement in LTBI treatment completion 7) > 10% reduction in overa ll active TB disease rates Starting Point/Baseline: 1385 cases of TB disease were reported in Texas in 2010, a rate of six per 100,000 population. The number of cases fell only to approximately 1300 cas es in 2011. TB can strike anyone, but is more likely to be found in those born in a foreign countr y, people with diabetes, pe ople with HIV/AIDS, the homeless, and those that work in he alth care. Alcohol abuse is associat ed with more than 21 percent of TB cases and 11 percent of cases are associated with detention facilities. Fo r U.S. born citizens, there is an alarming disparity in TB incidence rates be tween whites and minority communities. In Texas, 51.3 percent of reported TB cases in 2010 were among Hispanics, 18.4 percent were among African Americans, 14.8 percent were among Whites, 14.8 per cent were among Asians. As can be seen in the accompanying table, the TB case percentage among African Americans was considerably higher than the state average in Department of State Health Se rvices (DSHS) Health Service Region (HSR) 4 while the TB case percentage for Hispanics was considerab ly higher than the state average for HSR 8. These two ethnic minorities are clearly disproportionately a ffected by TB compared with white Texans based 733 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Texas Center for Infectious Disease on their respective representation in the general Texas population. This disparity is magnified given the more robust declines in TB incidence in the wh ite populations in the last decade compared with the minority communities. An estimated 4.2% of the U.S. popula tion or ~11 million persons have latent M. tuberculosis infection (LTBI) according to a 1999-2000 t uberculin skin test (TST) survey. Reactivation of LTBI accounts for ~70% of incident TB disease in the U.S. For each 1% lifetime risk of react ivation TB disease in this group, 110,000 TB cases might be ex pected from this reservoir of LTBI over the next 40 years (1/2 the population's life expectancy). Eliminating TB in the U.S. and Texas will requir e preventing these cases. Appropriate targeted testing of hi gh risk populations including aggr essive contact investigation around active TB cases is a vital part of the TB elimination strate gy. The use of interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) instead of tubercu lin skin tests (TSTs) will eliminate the need to treat BCG vaccinated patients with false positive TSTs. In prin ciple, treating LTBI wi th 6-12 months of isoniazid (INH) can substantially reduce TB incidence, however, patient adherence with INH self-administered regimens is poor so that avoidance of TB disease is suboptimal wi th this strategy. With the new 12 dose 12 week INH/rifapentine regimen, patient completion rates are si gnificantly better than with INH al one due both to the need to administer the 12 week regimen by di rectly observed therapy (DOT) and because of better patient tolerance of the therapy. It is clear that aggressive identification of LTBI cases followed by effective LTBI therapy is an effectiv e strategy for preventing new cases of active TB disease. Aggressive targeted LTBI testing strategies in high risk popu lations such as minoriti es (Black and Hispanic populations) are clearly effective in reducing TB case ra tes. Three entities have the most influence and impact on TB care in th e state including UTHSCT, TCID and the Heartland National TB Center. Aside from unwavering dedication to TB co ntrol in Texas, the uniting factor fo r each of these organizations is that they are all staffe d by UTHSCT faculty. UTHSCT has been involved with TB care in Texa s for more than a half century. UTHSCT maintains the capability to safely evaluate and if necessary hospitalize contagious TB patients in respiratory isolation. Currently, faculty at UT HSCT include 5 board certified pul monary physicians (4 adult and 1 pediatric), and 2 board certified in fectious disease specialists, each with decades of experience treating TB. UTHSCT is now also the home of a large P ublic Health Laboratory th at performs interferon gamma release assays for diagnosis of LTBI. The Texas Center for Infectious Disease (T CID) has provided inpatient TB care for nearly 60 years and is currently the only free standing inpatient faci lity dedicated to TB care in the U.S. TCID hospitalizes persons with th e most complicated TB cases. TCID trea ts the majority of the 4-6% of TB patients in Texas who need hospitalization. Reas ons for admission to TCID include non-adherence with outpatient therapy, court orde red (quarantined) TB treatment where a patient's non-adherence 734 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Texas Center for Infectious Disease with TB medication regimens has proven to be a thre at to public health or safety, TB drug toxicity, management of co-morbidities such as HIV infecti on or diabetes and manageme nt of drug resistant TB cases. TCID is unquestionably the premier facility in the U.S. for inpatient management of patients with drug resistant TB. TCID is Texas' designate d hospital for TB. The 3 In fectious Diseases (ID) board certified physicians providing the inpati ent TB care at TCID are UTHSCT faculty . The Heartland National TB Center (HNTC) is a partnership between DSHS and UTHSCT and one of four national TB centers funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). HNTC was originally funded in 2005 to provide TB traini ng, technical assistance, product development, and medical consultation to a 13-state re gion and two big cities from the border with Mexico to the border with Canada. The HNTC is housed at TCID in San Antonio, Texas. HNTC also supports CDC efforts to address health equity by resear ching and using information/data on health disparities and social determinates to identify communities disproportiona tely affected by TB. Therefore, training and product development, implementation, and evaluation incl ude social determinates of health and ensure culturally appropriate interventi ons for target audiences. All employees at HNTC including the physician medical director and assistant medical director ar e UTHSCT faculty. UTHSCT faculty has the mo st experience, the greatest expertis e and the most infl uential positions related to TB care in the state. This project would brin g about a direct line of shared responsibility between UTHSCT physicians and DSHS personnel on the fron t line of Texas TB care in two DSHS HSR regions. This project will hopefully serve as a model for TB care in the entire state. Rationale: This project will comprehensively improve TB control in urban (DSHS HSR 8) and rural (DSHS HSR 4/5N) minority communities in Texas. The curren t process for TB control is under the aegis of DSHS, but also involves multiple frequently over- lapping jurisdictional boundaries with roles and responsibilities not always clearly defined. Personnel from va rious components of the Texas public health system (city, county, state) can be faced with demanding res ponsibilities without the accompanying specific authority or support to adequately address those responsibilities. This proposal offers a clear and comprehensive mechanism for cost -effective management of all aspects of TB care in minority populations in the state, the most im portant demographic for TB in Texas , through a partnership between the three most experienced providers of TB ca re in the state, DSHS, TCID, UTHSCT. This project will fully integrate the core public health functions of DSHS, such as TB therapy by DOT and contact investigation, with the formidable a nd unparalleled TB expertise available under the aegis of UTHSCT. Improving TB outcomes through existing agenci es and relationships presen ts several challenges. The DSHS TB control funding has been essentially flat, in real dollars, for several years. In the context of attrition of experienced personne l through retirement etc. and flat funding, it is unlikely that DSHS can maintain its current level of TB expertise and experience much less significantly expand its effort with current resource levels. The TB case rate in Texas has been steadily declining for more than a decade, but in the last 2 years there has been only an anemic decline in TB incidence that may presage a plateau in the previously encourag ing progress, or worse, a reversal of that progress. The number and availability of TB experts in the st ate is declining due to attrition (reti rement, etc.), so that identification of these experts will only become more difficult. The percentages of minority patients (black and Hispanic) with TB and LTBI are also disturbingly high and consistently flat compared with white patients suggesting at least a relativ e lack of progress in these populati ons . Blacks and Hispanics have an approximately 8X higher TB rate than white s, clearly disproportionately high based on their respective percentages of the populat ion. It would be difficult for DSHS with its pr esent state of funding and staffing to dedicate the resources to narrow this gap. We will provide in DY3 the 735 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Texas Center for Infectious Disease necessary education and traini ng for DSHS personnel to succe ssfully implement the new and innovative LTBI diagnosis and treatment strategi es through face to face trainings and web based education opportunities. We will also reinforce evidence-based and CDC/DSHS approved treatment strategies for TB disease. Unique community need identificati on numbers the project addresses: RHP 6 CN.2- Chronic disease a nd related health disparities RHP 1 CN.1-Insufficient access to primary and specialty health care services This project will implement a strategy for comprehens ive management of TB infection/disease in DSHS HSR 8 and 4/5N. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-11 Addressing Health Disparitie s in Minority Populations: IT-11.1 Improvement in Clinical Indi cator in identifie d disparity group Reasons/rationale for selecting the two Outcome Improvement Targets: Category 3 process outcomes selected for DY2 and DY3 are directly rela ted to initial components of the initiative to achieve comprehensive, eviden ce based TB care of TB for urban and rural minority communities in Texas. This initia tive will undertake a series of step s which incorporate core project components to achieve this collaboration between DSHS, UTHSCT, TCID and HNTC. Category 3 process outcomes include project planning (P-1) in DY2, establishing baseline rates (P-2) in DY3, and conducting a PDSA cycle to improve data collecti on and intervention activit ies (P-4) as a quality improvement effort. In DY4 and DY5, the standalone measure selected is IT 11.1 Improvement in Clinical Indicator in identified disparity group. Two clinical indicat ors to be improved and disparity groups have been determined by the provider. Th e disparity group is minority (Black and Hispanic) urban and rural populations at risk for TB in DSHS HSR #8 and #4/5N. The clinical indicators to be improved include percentage of TB patie nts receiving therapy of active TB by DOT and improved LTBI treatment completion rates . As a non-acute care hospital without an emergency department or intensive care unit TCID has no statistically significant data to report on any of the Outcome Domains 1-3 or 5 in Category 4. Relationship to other Projects: The project team will work with the anchors in both RHP regions (6 and 1) to share information about new treatment regimes for persons with active and LTB I as well as referral for specialty consultation and care with other performing providers. Relationship to Other Perf orming Providers' Projects in the RHP: This project is a collaborative with an academic medical center performing provider in RHP1; it will serve as a referral destination for other projects in RHP 6 that provide primary and behavioral health care services. Plan for Learning Collaborative: The leadership team for this project will actively participate in the face-to-face meetings and other opportunities to share challe nges and lessons learned with other health care providers in both RHP 6 and 1. Project Valuation: This represents an innovative and ambitious projec t to enhance and expand the control of TB in minority communities in 2 HSRs in Texas that encompass both urban and rural minority populations. This proposal incorporates the ex isting public health infrastructure of DSHS and the extensive TB expertise of UT physicians at UTHSCT, TCID and HNT C in a collaboration that promotes expert, cost- effective, evidence-based TB control with seamless con tinuity of care at every level. The expertise of 736 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Texas Center for Infectious Disease UT physicians with evidence-ba sed CDC and DSHS treatment gui delines insures avoidance of unnecessary and costly diagnostic an d treatment strategies while th e application of new diagnostic (IGRA testing) and treatment strategies (12 week LTBI therapy) further reduce costs by focusing resources on interventions of proven public health value at a lower financial cost. Improved completion rates for LTBI therapy will also decreas e the number of LTBI patients progressing to active TB and avoid the considerably highe r costs associated with treating ac tive TB. The value of this project is justifiable on the basis of : 1) Enhanced access to a comprehensive fully inte grated TB care process that utilizes the existing DSHS public health infrastructu re and physician expertise from UT. 2) Implementation of universal LTBI testing w ith IGRAs thereby limiting the expense and potential drug toxicity of false + TSTs in BCG vaccinated populations. 3) Implementing universal 12 week, 12 dose LTB I therapy to improve LTBI treatment completion rates and decrease future TB burden. 4) Insure universal application of evidence ba sed treatment guidelines from CDC and DSHS for LTBI and TB disease 5) The ultimate value of this project is decreased TB morbidity in Texas with an attendant significant decrease in healthcar e and public health costs.

It serves as the primary teaching hospital for the University of Texas Health Science Ce nter San Antonio, and the lead Level I Trauma Center and safety net provider for the estimat ed 2 million residents of Bexar County and South Texas. Over the past two decades University Health System has expanded access to primary, specialty the preventive health care services, and currently operates 19 hea lth centers and clinics throughout Bexar County. Intervention(s) : This project will implement a care tran sitions program specifically to improve access and will involve follow up calls to and/or home visits to better activate patient engagement by a transition coach following a ro utine visit and or discharge from an acute setting. This will be part of a broader model of care coordination tailored to improve and meet patient preferences and thus avoiding an emer gency department visit. Currently, automated telephone calls post discharge are conducted through Illuminate, which will route the user to be contacted by a transition coach within 48 to 72 hours, if the user indicates dissatisfaction or a concern. Need for the project : Currently there is no consistent pr ocess for identifying and addressing patients at risk for readmission. There is incr easing evidence to support the need for immediate follow-up for patients post discharge from acute care, to address the need ed education not heard or understood during the discharg e process and to assure that services coordinated in the discharge process have been delivered. A sampling of data specific to all Medicare and Medicaid discharges between December 2010 and Nove mber 2011 reflects larg er percentages of readmissions within the first 14 days post discha rge, often times before the scheduled follow-up provider appointments. Target population : The target population will include the Medicaid funded and uninsured patients who comprise 62% of patients who rece ive services at University Health System including those patients identifi ed as high risk for readmission discharged from University Hospital Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : In DY2, best practices (such as Partnership for Patients discharge checklists and protocols) wi ll be implemented for effectively communicating with patients and families during and post discharge. Dedicated coaches to this program will be utilized to improve adherence to discharge and follow-up care instructions. In DY3 through DY5, care transitions processes will be reevalua ted for improvement, hardwired and expanded resulting in improved care coordina tion and transition of patients. 741 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Category 3 outcomes: 136141205.3.11 IT-2.13 Other Admission Rate (Stand-alone measure) DY4 - Reduced rates of readmission by TBD% fo r patients identified and managed by the Transitions of Care Project. DY5 - Reduced rates of readmission by TBD% fo r patients identified and managed by the Transitions of Care Project. Project Description: The goal of the project is to implement a care transitions program specifically to address the window of time between discharge an d either a return EC visit and/ or PCP clinic visit. It is during this window of time that patients struggle with discharge instructions, understanding and access to medications, and access to ambulatory clinic /provider visits. This project was selected for needed approaches to improving the pa tient experience and health outcomes by early/proactive identification of high risk populations for r eadmission before discharge, improving the discharge process, improving comm unication and handoffs with Ambulatory and post acute providers during the tr ansition period, and assuring pa tient engagement especially within the first 48 hours of discharge, a nd, as necessary, making home visits. The initiative/project will utilize all co re project components (a-g) as follows: a. Review and implement best practice models for the population serv ed that addresses readmission rates, reasons and time fram es for readmission and post discharge support/calls. b. Utilize the IHI STAAR chart re view tool to identify key drivers for readmissions. c. Develop and utilize Allscripts (Care Coordina tion software), to facilitate continuity of care for patients across all settings. d. Establish dedicated roles to design impleme nt and hardwire processes including post discharge support to improve the window of time between discharge and access to providers. e. Incrementally implement post discharge pla nning support based on select interventions from Project RED, the Coleman Model, and Boost based upon lessons learned. f. Assemble and work with prioritized post acute providers to improve processes for patients in transition g. Regularly identify lessons learned and, utilizi ng Lean processes, work to eliminate waste and improve transitions of care processes. Five year expected outcomes include improved cl inical outcomes for patients, and decreased EC visits, admissions, and readmissions. The orga nization will benefit through future cost avoidance and financial penalties. Current challenges facing University Health System includes the lack of: A coordinated infrastructure to support the initiative Definition of roles and responsibilities with accountabilities speci fically ingrained to support transitions of care Policies and procedures, and t hus, variation in processes Limited patient engagement with unique socioeconomically challenged population 742 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Starting Point/Baseline: A Transitions of Care Committee was estab lished in 2010 with the following results: Dedicated appointments can now be establishe d within provider te mplates within the EMR as \"post hospital discharge appointments.\" Implementation of an automated message thr ough the ADT system to advise providers via a secure health message of his/he r hospitalized patients and discharges Establishment of post discharge calls 24 a nd 72 hours post discharge. Post discharge calls at 24 and 72 hours have recently switc hed to the Illuminate automated telephone system. Variation and inconsistency continue in thes e process flows. Curre ntly, 35% of patients discharged from University Hospital receive a ca ll to assess the patients understanding of the medical regiment, follow up appointments, and me dication reconciliation; this number is based on one specific service line that aggressively inpu ts the consult needed for activation of the post discharge call. Presently, the follow-up disc harge appointment has a 20% no-show rate, and there is no current understanding of the reas ons for failure to keep appointments. In 2012, acute care coordination staff became predominantly unit-based in order to better align with Nursing regarding plan of care and discharge processes. There were two Lean events dedicated to the discharge process. The first ev ent was dedicated to the discharge process on one pilot unit with no evidence of hous e-wide impact to date. The second, a Value Stream Analysis, occurred in October to prioritize transitions of ca re needs and assign the type of Lean effort per project, accordingly: Standardization of the post discha rge process for internal providers Improve Access to CareLink for acute population Standardize process between Ambula tory Connections and Access Plus Standardize post discharge paperwork, appoint ment information, letter, medical home. Develop a Care Coordination Cl inical Summary in the EMR Develop and implement a post discharge call methodology with designated staff and support processes Rationale: The Transitions of Care project enables University Health System to continue to prioritize needed attention to processes from discharge until follow-up appointment in order to better engage the patient, coordinate care and improve clinical outcomes. This project addresses a high prev alence of chronic disease and re lated health disparities that require greater prevention effort s and improved management of pa tients with chronic conditions, which is in line with community need, CN.2. Th e project also addresses the lack of access to medical care due to high rates of un-insura nce, reflective of community need, CN.3. The project will \"significantly enhance\" pre- exis ting efforts as stated per the baseline above. Although the work was thorough and fruitful, the fo llowing gaps remain, which will be rectified with the proposed program: 743 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital how to better identify patients at high risk before discharge and at home education at discharge a nd via post discharge calls referral processes improved internal and external handoffs and communication, and patient engagement. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): There is increasing evidence and logic to suppor t the need for immediate follow-up for patients post discharge from acute care, not only for pati ent satisfaction, but more importantly to address the needed education not heard or understood du ring the discharge process and to assure that services coordinated in the disc harge process have been delivere d. A sampling of data specific to all Medicare and Medicaid discharges betw een December 2010 and November 2011 reflects larger percentages of readmissions within the firs t 14 days post discharge, often times before the scheduled follow-up provider appointments. Medicaid Medicare FFS Overall Discharges % Mcaid Discharges% Mcare FFS Discharges % Overall Readmits 65 17.9% 68 33.5% 124 34.1% 631 34.5% The purpose of selecting the outcome measure in category three will be to measure the impact of the transitions of care project on a decrease in admissions, EC utilization, and readmissions for patients impacted by the project.

Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: In addition to University Health System, CHRISTUS Santa Rosa and Guadalupe Regional Medical Center are also addressing the need for tr ansitions of care programs. As projects evolve, there may be the opportunity for sharing best pr actices, ideas, and solutions across the RHP.

As projects evolve, there may be the opportunity for sharing best pr actices, ideas, and solutions across the RHP. Project Valuation: Project valuation for an efficient and compre hensive Patient Care Transition Program is prioritized as a Pass 1. As there are approximately 22,000 or more discharges a year, around 55,000 EC visits, and > 580,000 Ambulatory visits expe cted in 2013, better transitions of care impact is defined through cost avoidance, a re duction of admissions and readmissions as well as a decreased EC utilization. 745 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital 136141205.2.1 PASS 1 2.12.1 2.12.1 A - G 2.12.1 DEVELOP , IMPLEMENT , AND EVALUATE STANDARDIZED CLINICAL PROTOCOLS AND EVIDENCE -BASED CARE DELIVERY MODEL TO IMPROVE CARE TRANSITIONS University Hospital TPI - 136141205 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 136141205.3.11 3.IT-2.13 Other Admission Rate (Stand- Alone Measure): Admission rate of patients managed by TOC project Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P-1]: Develop or implement best practices or evidence-based protocols (such as Partnership for Patients) for effectively communicating with patients and families during and post-discharge to improve adherence to discharge and follow-up care instructions.

Intervention(s) : - This project will develop and impleme nt a comprehensive patient - centered training program based on Planetree/NRC Picker protocol. This protocol was developed based on responses by 90 anonymous focus groups (repre senting 35 hospitals and 645 patients). The program will build a culture centered on providing a positive experience for all patients cared for within the Health System. Need for the project : - Enhancing awareness and unders tanding, among University Health System staff regarding patient-cen tered care, are critical to deliv ering high quality care that is efficient, timely and safe. A review of Univer sity Health System' patient experience scores demonstrate a need to develop and implement a comprehensive orientat ion on key aspects of patient-centered care. Hospitals around the country have seen success from this ty pe of approach: Arkansas Children's Hospital now ranks in the 90th percentile in patient and employee satisfaction Florida Hospital for Children, a 1,200 bed facil ity, went from the bottom 10% in patient satisfaction into the high 90th percentile nationwide Target population : - The target population will include a ll University Health System patients who are economically underserve d or uninsured.

The target population and their families will benefit from this project by be ing empowered to participate in their care. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : - Adopting a patie nt-centered approach to care at University Hospital will allow the patient and family to feel empowered and to more fully participate in treatment plans. University Hea lth System will be providing high quality care at every encounter and will be meeting national patie nt safety guidelines. Patient-Centered Care strengthens relationships and collaboration betwee n patients, their families and their caregivers. It actively promotes family involvement and se ts the foundation for quality care delivered in a 748 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital safe environment. Category 3 outcomes: - IT-6.1 - The goal is to increase patient satisfaction scores. DY4 - Increase patient satisfaction by 2%. DY5 - Increase patient satisfaction by 2%. Project Description: The goals of the program are to develop and implement a comprehensive patient experience training program for University Hospital. The Ex ecutive Director of Patient-Centered Care will write and disseminate a strategic plan on how th e health system will be hard-wired towards a patient-centered approach. A steering committee will be created and comprised of health system leaders, staff, patients and their families. Monthl y meetings will focus on directing this initiative using the Patient-Centered Care Improvement Guide (Planetree, Inc and Pick er Institute). Patient - centered care will be coordi nated and monitored on an on-goi ng basis. Re-design to improve patient experience includes appointing an executive director to lead the health system through a culture change, by working in coordination with the Center for Learning Excellence department to develop and implement training progr ams focused on patient-centeredness. Getting buy-in from all stakeholders and educatin g the new concept of patient-centered care is our primary challenge. Getting the right people on board will be crucial, as will having the right patients and family members on the steering co mmittee team. Improving the patient experience is in actuality a re-orientation of the health care delivery system as it is practiced through out our health system. The challenge comes not only wi th teaching and modeling the patient centered philosophy but in hardwiring all cu rrent staff and future employees. Each staff member must be willing to re-think and comprehend that being pa tient centric and delivering customer service excellence at the highest level is essential for both quality care and safety. The cost to educate staff (over 5,000 employees) and provide trainers will also be a challe nge. This project will address these challenges by continuous pro cess improvement of competencies, employee mentoring and training for new employees (Disne y's Model - Building a Culture of Healthcare Excellence). The expected 5 year outcome will be a comprehens ive customer service training program that is effective in shifting our culture and responsiv e to the training needs of current and new employees (5000 employees). With this accomplishment we expect improvements in patient satisfaction results by 2% annually from baseline. Patient Centered Care aligns well with the Triple Aim Plus which is reflec ted in regional goals. The proposed program meets criteria for improv ing patient experience and improving quality outcomes. Starting Point/Baseline: Currently there is no program in place for traini ng or educating staff on improving the patient experience. Roles and responsibil ities are being developed and ar e expected to be established during DY2 along with a comprehensive strategic plan to shift our culture to a patient - centered model. 749 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Rationale: The reason for adding an executive director with a focus on patient-centered care and implementing on-going training may seem like an obvious approach. However, healthcare is a complex system that is often-times difficult for the community at large to access or even understand. This project represents a new initiative for our health system and a change from the culture of \"we've always done it that way\" to partnering with our patients and their families. With the development and introduction of HC AHPS and CGCAHPS there is now a tool to evaluate the way care is delivered using a phi losophy that it is provided from the patient's perspective. UT House Staff and Medical St udents are all oriented on HIPAA regulations, Patient Centered, Cultural Diversity and Infection Control. UT Medicine - has recently engaged a consulting firm \"Turning Point\" to assist th em in improving their customer service. UT Medicine physicians are also e ngaged in nursing shared governance as well as recently attending Patient Centered conference and HCAHPS boot camp. Components: Organizational Integration and Prio ritization of patie nt experience Data and Performance Measurement using HCAHPS Implement processes to improve patien t experience accessing clinical practice Develop process to certify independent survey vendors Implementation of the components will be done by writing and disseminating a patient/family experience strategic plan (P.2, DY2), developi ng a training program on patient experience (P- 15,DY2), integrating the patient experience into employee training (P-4, DY3), developing a new patient experience tool or revising and improving the current one (P-8, DY3), develop a plan to roll out a the collection of patient experience info rmation from an area in the organization that does not currently collect such data (P-9, DY4), and improving patient satisfaction improvement scores (I-16.3, DY5). The project will guide us through those topics th at are important to the healthcare consumers using our facilities. Using the HCAHPS and CGC AHPS tools to both guide and measure will be key to the program's success. In healthcare where evidence-based practice is so important, we will be systematic and rigorous in the study and implementation of patient-centered care. Creating a positive patient experience will be a priority and will be implemented using the Patient Centered Care Improvement Guidebook as a road map to successfully improving patient experience. Progress will be measured and monitored using the NRC Picker (HCAHPS and CGCAHPS) surveys. This project addresses CN.1 Improve quality of healthcare delivery and patient experience. The University Health System provider group (C ommunity Medicine Associates) as employed providers take part in all or ientation and Customer Service training or initiatives. A new initiative will be to work with Federally Qualified Health Centers where University Health System providers and patients are assigned to ro ll-out the use of NRC Picker surveys to gather data on the patients experience served in the FQHC areas. Un iversity Hospital has begun and will continue to use a curriculum of Customer Service training focused on the Disney model of Customer Service - Building A Culture of Healthcare Excellence . This new initiative will be a 750 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital great start to get all University Health Syst em employees on the same page by teaching the basics of Customer Service (required of all employees). The Executive Director of Patient Centered Care in collaboration with other depa rtments (Learning Resources, Human Resources, Patient Care Services and Patient Satisfac tion) will monitor and be accountable for the sustainability of this program. Historically, cu stomer service programs have not sustained as there has been no one individual or department assigned to monitor. This will be the primary focus of the Executive Director of Patient - Center ed Care. Key to this effort will be that employees have an understanding of the philosophy of Patient-Centered Care and that applicants with outstanding customer service skills are hire d to fill vacancies. We will know that we are improving, when we become the health system of choice and our customer service scores continue to improve. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): IT-6.1 Percent improvement over baseline of patient satisfaction scores for one or more of the patient satisfaction domains that the provider targ ets for improvement in a specific tool. Certain supplemental modules for the adult CG-CAPHS survey may be used to esta blish if patients: are getting timely care, appointments, and inform ation; how well their doctors communicate; patient's rating of doctor access to specialist; patient' s involvement in shared decision making, and patient's overall health status/functional status. RHP Priority This outcome addresses the triple aim plus as presented in the RH P, by improving patient experience and improving quality outcomes. Evidenced Based Rationale This category 2 project of improving the patient experience initiative is using evidenced based best practices learned from Disney's Model- Building A Culture of healthcare Excellence and Patient Centered Care philosophy. The foundation developed in this project will help position the organization to drive the outcomes of improv ement in NRC Picker outcomes in our category 3 project. Relationship to other Projects: This project inter-relates with al l of the DSRIP projects as a part of our Triple Aim Plus model for patient-centered care and specifica lly RD-4. - Patient Satisfaction. 136141205.1.3 Implement a Chronic Disease Management Registry This project will help monitor cu rrent and future patient population in University Health System medical homes to improve healthcare outcomes. 136141205.1.4 Introduce, Expand, or Enhance Telemedicine/Telehealth Telemedicine can be utilized to expand se rvices and access to new clinical sites. 136141205.1.5 Expand specialty care; Beha vioral health services Mental health conditions are prevalent among th e population University Health System serves.

Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: 92414401.1.1 Expand training of the primary care workforce Training future providers in primary will assist w ith filling the need to create more access for patients and having newly trained provider s to staff additional clinical sites Plan for Learning Collaborative: This project lends itself to pa rticipation in learning collabora tive as other Performing Providers in RHP6 seek to develop and expand customer sa tisfaction programs and measures in other parts of the region for similar patient populati ons. Processes and techniques developed and implemented during this project will be docum ented by the project team. Successes as well as lessons learned will be shared with regional co llaborators who are also working to improve patient care experience. Project Valuation: The project achieves the waiver goal and m eets community needs by measuring patient experience throughout the system as University Health System expands primary care in a predominantly Hispanic, underserved area of Bexar County. This program strengthens University Health System's know ledge of patients' perception of our new healthcare linkages with local community partners, defines barriers to care and a ssures improved quality care services to a target population th at struggles with poverty, receiv e acute or emergency healthcare services only, and do not have usual providers. Patient satisfaction measures will be the predominant metric to understa nd how effective health system changes are being implemented and serve as the most useful tool to gui de program improvement decision making. 752 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital 136141205.2.2 PASS 1 2.4.1 2.4.1 (A-D) 2.4.1 IMPLEMENT PROCESSES TO MEASURE AND IMPROVE PATIENT EXPERIENCE : UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - THE NEW \"U\" University Hospital TPI - 136141205 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 136141205.3.12 3.IT-6.1 Percent improvement over base line of patient satisfaction scores Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P.2] Write and disseminate a patient/family experience strategic plan Metric 1 [P-2.1]: Submission of a strategic plan and documentation of the dissemination of that plan throughout the organization.

It serves as the primary teaching hospital for the University of Texas Health Science Ce nter San Antonio, and the lead Level I Trauma Center and safety net provider for the estimat ed 2 million residents of Bexar County and South Texas. Over the past two decades University Health System has expanded access to primary, specialty and preventive health care services, and currently operates 19 health centers and clinics throughout Bexar County. Intervention(s) : This project will establish new operatio nal standards within each department based on transparent key perfor mance indicators (KPIs). Visu al management boards will be designed specifically for each department so th at staff, administration, physicians, and even patients can understand and be enco uraged to evaluate the perfor mance for a given department. There will also be a continued focus on training staff/provide rs on Lean Healthcare Methodologies. Need for the project : The National Strategy for Qualit y Improvement (developed under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) ha s identified the current state of the American health care system as being highly fragmented due to poorly designed clini cal care processes that has subsequently translated into unnecessary duplication of services, poor pa tient clinical care, and experience. As a result, the National Quality St rategy calls for health systems to deliver high quality, efficient, safe, patient-centered care. Target population : The target population will include all UH patients and staff. Medicaid funded and uninsured patients comprise 62% of patients who receive services at UHS. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : This project will implement a quality improvement initiative to improve inefficien cies and/or reduce program variat ion in DY2. A series of rapid improvement projects will be implemented as we ll as recruitment of quality improvement champions in DY3 and DY4 culminating in the co mpletion of at least 60 process improvement events by DY5. Patients and staff will directly benefit from quality improvement methodologies including Lean that will help to identify waste in the system resulting in enhanced quality of care, more efficient processes, a nd standardization of procedures. Category 3 outcomes: 3.IT.5.1 Percent improvement over baseline of cost savings DY4 - Demonstrate cost savings in care deliver by TBD% ov er established baseline. DY5 - Demonstrate cost savings in care deliver by TBD% over es tablished baseline. 756 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital 3.IT.6.1 Percent improvement over baseli ne of patient satisfaction scores DY4 - Increase Patient Satisfaction Scores by TBD% over established baseline of patient satisfaction scores. DY5 - Increase Patient Satisfaction Scores by TB D% over established baseline of patient satisfaction scores Project Description: The salience of making American healthcare more efficient and integrat ed was elevated by the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). This in an era where the curr ent state of health care delivery is considered to being highly fragmented due to poorly de signed clinical care processes that has subsequently translated into unnecessary duplication of services, poor patient clinical care, and experience. As part of an effort to enhance both quality care and the patient experience, University Health System will implement the Lean methodology to determine the use of materials and human resources, improve value to the patient, and distinguish how and why inputs into certain processes translate into value, and find ways to eliminate wasteful components. University Health System's Operational Excellen ce initiative will serve as the vehicle to drive continuous process improvement. Through applic ation of the Lean methodology, staff will engage in problem solving techniques based on quantitative data aimed at improving day-to-day work processes that result in better patient care. Target areas already identified are the surgical ICU, the discharge process, pharmacy, ED, and the OR. Projects include management excellen ce, patient throughput analysis, workflow improvement, and medication management. Goals and Relationship to Regional Goals The goal of this project is to establish new ope rational standards within each department based on transparent key performance indicators (KPIs) . Visual management boards will be designed specifically for each department so that staff, administration, physicians, and even patients can understand and be encouraged to evaluate the performance for a given department. Project Goals: Implement a quality improvement initiative to improve inefficiencies and/or reduce program variation. Implement a rapid improvement project using a proven methodology. Implement at least one patient care-centered process improvement project in the health system. The project meets the following regional goals: CN . 1 - Improve quality of healthcare delivery and patient experience. Challenges: 757 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital The primary challenge to this project will involv e having the health system incorporate and adopt a new organizational 'mindset' that is focu sed on identifying and solving operational inefficiencies alongside intensive change mana gement that is focused on improving processes that add value to patient care and experience. Many processes are not centered on the patien t but around antiquated workflows, physician preference and nurse preference. These have resu lted in \"workarounds\" that have consequently lead to greater downstream inefficiencies resu lting in disconnected and broken processes that introduce waste and diminish human potential. Un iversity Health System will progressively improve performance by evaluating human, proce ss, and system performance to center around the patient's overall health service experience. Another challenged faced is the ability to collect data to su stain performance and measure success. Lean process improvement is metric an d data driven and will create a more \"date- driven\" mindset. The health system will have to engineer new ways, either manual or automated, to gather data which grows are platform for da ta collection. The health system struggles with inconsistent data due to in effective communication between the EMR and supporting programs. UH has adopted the \"best of breed\" approach with clinical programs. The health system has purchased specific operating suites for specific func tions and has chosen not to stay uniform in vendor, where applicable. Monitoring data acro ss multiple clinical departments will require increased awareness of its importance and di ligence. UH will look into purchasing a project management program to keep data centralized and organized. Eventually, a comprehensive dashboard will be built to display a portfolio of all projects to track resu lts on a global scale. 5-Year Expected Outcome for Provider and Patients Through design, development and implementation of the Lean methodology, University Health System expects to see improvements in the quality and health service experience of its patients. Further, University Health System plans to ha ve 30% of providers/staff educated in the Lean methodology, a total of 60 rapid process improveme nt events completed, and a culture that values taking initiative for c ontinual problem solving. Expected outcomes related to project goals are described below. Starting Point/Baseline: Currently an orientation of th e Lean methodology is underway at University Health System. University Health System will develop a new L ean department devoted to training staff to undertake performing process improvement within their respective areas. Therefore the starting point/baseline for implementing a program to im prove inefficiencies and/ore reduce program variation is 0 in DY2 Rationale: With roots in manufacturing, the Le an methodology requires all staff to be involved in helping to redesign processes to improve flow and reduce waste. Lean methodology also incorporates a patient focused approach by helping to identify and remove non-value ad ded activities (waste), allowing more time for value added work (enhanc ing the patient experience of direct patient care). The rationale is to reduce variation in experience and treatm ent, focus more on quality and outcomes based on metrics and performance, and cr eate a more efficient and satisfying working environment for staff and physicians. University H ealth System will also ev aluate care patterns to find areas of underuse of services, overuse of services, misuse of serv ices, and disparities in 758 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital quality of care delivered. Project Components The design and strategy of the proposed quality improvement process will be accomplished by meeting all required project components. a. Provide training and orientation to the Lean methodology to clinical and administrative staff in order to elevat e the importance of undertaking process improvement strategies, developing and utilizing metrics, methodologies, and culture change. b. Develop an employee suggestion system th at allows for the identification of issues that impact the work enviro nment, patient care and satisfaction, efficiency and other issues aligned with continuous process improvement. c. Define key safety, quality, and efficien cy performance measures and develop a system for continuous data colle ction, analysis, and dissemination. d. Develop standard workflow process maps, staffing and care coordination models, protocols, and documenta tion to support continuous process improvement e. Implement software to integrate workfl ows, performance metrics and provide real-time performance feedback. f. Evaluate the impact of the pro cess improvement program and assess opportunities to expand, refine, or change processes based on the results of key performance indicators. Unique Community Need Addressed: Implementation of this quality process improvement methodology responds to unique community need CN. 1 - Improve quality of healthca re delivery and pa tient experience. As stated previously University Health System is currently developi ng the Lean program to include visual management boards for de partments. The will be designed around key performance indicators selected by departmental leadership, oper ational dashboards, quality of care performance measures for staff to quickly review and understand th e performance of the department. This level of transparency is new to Univer sity Health System and will guide our process improvement initiatives. Process improvement events will focus on improving workflows, processes, and policies to bring more value to th e patient. Process improvement events will also drive higher quality to the patients. As Universi ty Health System reduces waste and redesigns processes to streamline each patien t experience, it allows for clinicians to focus more on direct patient care instead of being de terred by inefficiencies within e ach process or system. Being the lowest ranked state on healthcare quality, University Health System, as a county hospital, should be a leader in system redesign that strengthens quality care for patients and advances efforts to become a high performing h ealthcare delivery system. 759 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-5 Cost of Care IT5.1 Improved cost savings: Demonstrat e cost savings in care delivery (standalone measure for 2.5 only. For all other projects - Non-standalone measure) a. Numerator: Type of analysis to be determin ed by provider from following list: Cost of Illness Analysis, Cost Minimization Analysis, Cost Eff ectiveness Analysis (CEA), Cost Consequence Analysis, Cost Utility Analysis, Cost Benefit Analysis b. Data Source: TBD by provider as appropriate for analysis type Reasons/Rational for Select ing the outcome measures: Lean process improvement initiatives will streamlin e processes. Part of reducing waste includes cost minimization because fewer resources ar e being devoted towards 'non-value added' activities. As processes are improved, employees will have more time to spend on value-added activities and focusing on maximizing the patient' s experience. There will be a reduction in the amount of time spent on inefficient or unnecessary steps in the process of caring for patients. Through the different type of cost studies, UH e xpects to see cost improvement in care delivery as Lean management philosophies are developed throughout the system. The process milestones for this category 3 outco me measure represent the build up to reaching the improvement target. Essentially, cost minimi zation adds value to th e tax-paying citizens of Bexar county. As the county hospital, University Health System has a fiscal responsibility to use the resources given by the county as efficiently as possible. Lean process improvement focuses on reducing waste, one of which is unnecessary cost. OD-6 Patient Satisfaction IT6.1 Percent improvement ove r baseline of patient sa tisfaction scores ( all questions within a survey need to be answered to be a standalone measure) Percent improvement over baseline of patient satisf action scores for one or more of the patient satisfaction domains that the provider targets for improvement in a specific tool. Certain supplemental modules for the adult CG CAHPS survey may be used to establish if patients: (1) are getting timely care, appointments, and information; (Standalone measure) (2) how well their doctors communicate; (Standalone measure) (3) patient's rating of doc tor access to specialist; (Standalone measure) (4) patient's involvement in shared decision making, and (Standalone measure) (5) patient's overall health status/functional status. (Standalone measure) a. Numerator: Percent improvement in targeted patient satisfaction domain b. Data Source: Patient survey c. Denominator: Number of patients who were administered the survey Reasons/Rational for Select ing the outcome measures: The patient satisfaction outcome measure was select ed due to its consider ation as a valid self- report rating by the patient in regards to the qual ity of care received during their most recent appointment. 760 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Further, the intent of the HCAH PS initiative is to provide a sta ndardized survey instrument and data collection methodology for m easuring patients' perspectives on hospital care. The surveys are designed to produce comparable data on th e patient's perspective on care that allows objective and meaningful comparisons between in stitutions on domains that are important to consumers. Public reporting of the survey results is designed to create incentives for institutions to improve their quality of care. Public reporting will serve to enhance public accountability in health care by increasing the transparency of the quality of institutional care provided in return for the public investment. With a service catchment area of 1.7 million reside nts, University Health System is the major safety-net hospital for Bexar County, Texas. En suring that timely, efficient, equitable, high quality care is delivered to the population wi ll be strengthen by ta king into account and measuring the patient perspective thus transl ating into better health for the community. Relationship to other Projects: The project's emphasis on implementation of continuous, rapid process improvement will strengthen University Health System's mission to achieve best care by becoming cost-effective and efficient further reinforces and enables the following projects. Category 1: (Project ID: 92414401.2.2) Expand Primary Care Capacity - Improvement in patient flow and reducing waste in process will provide more mi nutes in every day for value-added activity (patient care). University Health System could expand capacity through efficiency. Category 2: (Project ID: 136141205.2.1) Enhance/expand medical homes - Lean methodologies will help create the new processes in the medical home model. (Project ID: 136141205.2.8) Conduct medication manageme nt - This area is already indentified as a target for rapid process improvement. Category 4: RD-4 Patient-centered Healthcare 1. Patient Satisfaction The reporting of the measures must be limited to the inpatient setting onl y. All of the HCAHPS' questions included for the themes listed below are required to be included in RHP plans for PPs required to report for DY 2 5, or if HCAHPS not in place in DY 2, starting DY 3. a. Each HCAHPS theme includes a sta ndard set of questions. The following HCAHPS' themes will be reported on: Your care from doctors; Your care from nurses The hospital environment; When you left the hospital. b. Data Source: HCAHPS296 761 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Other systems are leading similar projects to expand specialty care. Baptist Medical Center, Methodist Hospital, and Nix Hea lth Care System are systems w ithin San Antonio that have targeted this for improvement. Targeted areas may be similar across each hospital. In the spirit of the waiver, University Hospital will work in co njunction with these health systems as they are serving the same targeted population. University Health System will attempt to collaborate and learn from these partnering projects. Plan for Learning Collaborative: Operational Excellence will be based on best pract ices developed outside our region that could be effectively implemented in our region. Lean incorporates best practices and national benchmarks to measure success. Most of these identifiers are standard ized across the country lending this project to: Developing a plan to communi cate ideas, data, and successes across the region and state Stay current on best practices and benchmar ks to adopt pertinent metrics to measure success Organize and participate in learning events ac ross the RHP to invite experts to share knowledge regarding quality impr ovement and patient safety. Project Valuation: Achieves waiver goals: This is aligned with the overall strategy of the waiver by impr oving the healthcare infrastructure to serve the patients of Bexa r county and surrounding areas. As University Health System reduces waste and redesi gns processes to streamline each patient experience, it allows for clinicians to focus more on direct patient care instead of being deterred by inefficiencies within each process or system. It further maintains and supports a more coordinated delivery system bringing value to the patient. Addresses community needs: This will address community need 1 (as de fined by RHP 6):\"Texas ranks last in the nation on healthcare quality. RHP 6 is challenge d to deliver improved quality and patient satisfaction.\" The impact will be to improve the patient experience as they receive care in a culture of continuous improvement focused on value-added activities. Project scope: The outreach of this project is large scope as it will affect all patients entering our system. University Health System is creating a culture of Operational Excellence that will provide consistency for the patient in all interactions and across the continuum of care - from direct clinical care, to th e registration process, to nur sing units to discharge. Project investment: The investment is considered a strategic imperative that addresses the triple aim in health care and so therefore this progr am will be extensive simply due to the time investment of leadership, physicians, and staff. Rapid impr ovements, while extremely effective, take considerable amounts of concentrated time. Un iversity Health System will hire a Lean Director and a Lean Data Analyst to help f acilitate the different projects involved, which is a financial commitment from the Health System. 762 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital 136141205.2.3 PASS 1 2.8.1 2.8.1 A-F 2.8.1 Design, develop, and implement a program of continuous, rapid process improvement that will address issues of safety, quality, and efficiency University Hospital TPI-136141205 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 136141205.3.13 136141205.3.14 3.IT-5.1 3.IT-6.1 Improved Cost Savings: demonstrate cost savings in care delivery Percent Improvement over baseline of patient satisfaction scores Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 P-6 [Implement a program to improve inefficiencies and/or reduce program variation] Metric 1: P-6.1 Performance improvement events Baseline: 0 Goal: number of performance improvement events.

It serves as the primary teaching hospital for the University of Texas Health Science Ce nter San Antonio, and the lead Level I Trauma Center and safety net provider for the estimat ed 2 million residents of Bexar County and South Texas. Over the past two decades University Health System has expanded access to primary, specialty the preventive health care services, and currently operates 19 hea lth centers and clinics throughout Bexar County. Intervention(s) : This project will establish a patient navigation model comprised of social workers and case managers within the ambulatory setting to enhance quality of care, and access to clinical and social support for medically complex patients. Need for the project : The University Health System ambulatory network is comprised of regional developing patient-center ed medical homes that are locat ed in an area of the county where large segments of the population are ec onomically underserved, uninsured and who have been diagnosed with multiple chronic health cond itions. Medically complex patients in particular carry a higher burden of diseas e and require extensive care coordination support to ensure adherence to clinical preventive care and treatm ent. The proposed patient navigation model will enhance the system's effort to redesign delivery of care in a ma nner that provides the right care in the right setting. Target population : The target population will include th e medically complex Medicaid funded and uninsured patients who comprise 62% of pa tients who receive servi ces within the health system and who frequently utilize the emergency room. This segment of patient more often carry higher disease burden (clinical and behavioral) that with appropria tely tailored patient-navigation interventions can benefit both in terms of acce ss to appropriate clinical care and community resource support. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : Provision of patient navi gation services tailored to medically complex patients will occur in DY2 to DY 4 resulting in a 15 percent reduction in EC utilization by patients enrolled in the patient navigation mode l by DY5. The secondary goals are to enhance care coordination and reduce overall emergency room visits, hospital admissions, and hospital readmissions. Category 3 outcomes: 136141205.3.15 3.IT.9.2 ED appropriate utilization DY4 - Decrease ED visits by TBD% for targeted conditions 767 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital DY5 - Decrease ED visits by TBD% for targeted conditions. Project Description: 2.9.1 - Implement and provide navigat ion services to targeted pati ents who are at high risk of disconnect from institutionalized health care (for example, patients with multiple chronic and behavioral health conditions, c ognitive impairments and disabilities, limited English proficiency, recent immi grants, the uninsured, those with low health literacy, frequent visitors to the ED, and others). The project will work towards establishing and enha ncing patient navigators consisting of social workers and case managers beyond acute care an d within the emergenc y center and defined ambulatory clinics to support the patients within the region. The projec t will work as a support network and educational system to aid and fac ilitate patient activation and empowerment. The emergency room is the front door of acute care today for patients without funding and thus, access to health services. A bigger challenge for University Health System is that many patients who are hospitalized and w ho frequent the EC are considered hi gh users. Data is plentiful via Crimson and IDX, and cross continuum collabora tion is beginning to occur but the challenge remains that due to limited access to ambulatory primary and specialty services, high volumes of patients continue to seek car e in the EC and hospital. Goals of this project will be to provide a programmatic appr oach encompassing but not limited to: Stakeholder engagement per setting Education Identification and individual: o social support o culturally competent care o alternative resources to EC and acute hospitalization The navigation team will work diligently to provide seamless, coordinated, timely, and site specific care for the patients in the program. We will continuously review our program for effectiveness and will incorporate changes as needed. We will develop various dashboards to track our progress. The secondary benefit to Un iversity Hospital will be future cost avoidance. Relationship to Regional Goals This project will further achievement of th e regional goals of the Triple Aim; improved health care infrastructure to better serve Medicaid and currently uninsured residents in RHP 6; reduce health disparities; further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system; and improve outcomes while containing cost growth. 768 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital 5 Year Expected Outcome for Provider and Patients: For patients identified and managed by the Pa tient Navigation/Care Coordination program, the goal is to decrease EC utilization by 15%. Starting Point/Baseline: Beginning in June 2012, the Department of Care Coordination added five RNs and four Social Workers to the Emergency Center for 24/7 c overage. University Hospital Emergency Department is a Level 1 Trauma Center with a 2012 volume of over 68,000 patient visits. Two RN case managers were initiated as a pilot in June, 2012, in two ambulatory settings. Four Social workers have been present and are centralized at the Robert B. Green Campus (the largest University Health System ambul atory site), providing telepho nic support to other ambulatory clinics as needed. Initial reports have been r un but baselines are still being defined for \"high- utilizers.\" Discussions are just beginning regarding possible tools for encounter captures in the EC and clinics via Allscripts, Care Coordination so ftware. The baseline is 0 because it is still being defined. Rationale: This project was selected to significantly e nhance the existing naviga tor/care coordination program that was established in mid 2012, as a means of expanding health care throughout the health continuum, reaching into the ED and out to other ambulatory settings and providers within the community. The expansion of the navigator/ Care Coordi nation program includes nurses, social workers, and other identifie d and trained healthcare workers who work collaboratively with clients/patie nts, and other healthcare worker s to facilitate and coordinate care. Through the Patient Navigation prog ram, we propose to meet all required project components: a. Identify frequent ED users and use navi gators as part of a preventable ED reduction program. Train health care navi gators in cultural competency. b. Deploy innovative health care personnel, such as case managers/social workers, community health workers and ot hers as patient navigators. c. Connect patients to primary and preventative care. d. Increase access for patients to care mana gement and/or chronic care management, including education in chronic disease self-management. e. Ongoing quality improvement such as ra pid cycle improvement. Activities may include, but are not limited to, identifying project impacts, identifying \"lessons learned\", opportunities to scale all or pa rt of the project to a broader patient population, and identifying key challenges associated with expansion of the project, including special consider ations for safety-net populations. This project specifically addre sses CN.3 which states many residents of RHP 6 lack access to medical care due to high rates of un-insura nce and healthcare provider shortages. 769 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-9 Right Care, Right Setting IT-9.2 ED appropriate utiliz ation (Stand-alone measure) d. Reduce Emergency Department vi sits for targeted conditions e. Data Source: EMR/IDX/Crimson/Truven Health/Allscripts Reasons/rationale for selec ting the outcome measure: A recent study conducted at a university tertiary health care facility showed that 15.8% of patients presenting to the emergency center for care had no emergent needs and were misusing the emergency center. Other studies have repo rted that non appropriate patients present to emergency centers due to lack of resources, acces s to care, or have a misunderstanding or are unaware of other resources available. Because th e ED at University Health System continues to experience high patient visits, this project outcome was selected with the in tent to respond to the individual patient need(s) and optimally, decr ease misuse of emergency center visits and hospitalizations for patients whose needs can be addressed otherwise. Patients will be identified as high-utilizers of the Emergency Center a nd will be targeted fo r navigation services. Relationship to other Projects: The project has multiple inter-relatedne ss to other projects within the RHP: A. 92414401.2.2 - Enhance/expand the medical home a. The Navigation Program will support the me dical home by navigating the patients in need of additional resources, specialty care, and appropriate resource utilization. The intent of the program w ill be to facilitate care throughout the care continuum while appropriately utilizi ng University Hospital resources. B. 92414401.2.1 - Expand chronic care management models a. The Navigation Program is a component of the Care Management Model; as patient are identified as needing additiona l resources or education, the navigation program will aid in facilitating the necessary care. C. 136141205.2.5 - Use palliative care programs a. Navigation Services will be supporting a Palliative Care program through the Emergency Department as well as th rough the primary care clinics. The navigation program will aid in identifying patients in need of those resources. Category 4 measures include emergency departme nt in RD-5 and patient-centered healthcare, including patient satisfaction a nd medication management in RD-4 Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Bluebonnet trails and University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio are planning to establish or expand upon patient na vigations services. As project definitions evolve, it is anticipated that even though th e term \"navigators\" implies different roles per populations identified, there remains opportunities to share lessons learned, ideas, etc. 770 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Plan for Learning Collaborative: University Health System is very interested in sharing best pr actices, lessons learned, and other ideas to improve patient navigation services. We will participate in face-to-face meetings and/or conference calls to regularly share data related to the efficacy of various practices along with lessons learned as we implement this program. Project Valuation: Via the system created to weigh all University Health System projects, this project was rated very high (18) due to the anticipated volum e of patients touched who will receive case management and social services support. Cost avoidance is the anticipa ted end result secondary to a reduction of admissions and readmissions as well as a decrease in EC utilization. This project achieves the Waiver goals by a) improving the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of the c ounty; b) further developing and maintaining a coordinated care delivery system; c) contributin g to patients' receivi the most cost-effective way; a nd serving as a powerful tool to help providers improve outcomes and reduce ED utilizat ion (containing cost growth). 771 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital 136141205.2.4 PASS 1 2.9.1 2.9.1 A-E 2.9.1 Provide navigation services to targeted patients who are at high risk of disconnect from institutionalized health care: Establish a Patient Care Navigation Program for University Health System University Hospital TPI - 136141205 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 136141205.3.15 ization 9/30/2013) (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P-X (QI)]: Designate and/or hire personnel or teams to support or manage the project and/or intervention.

Care/Palliative Medicine Service Unique RHP ID#: 136141205.2.5 - PASS 1 Performing Provider: University Hospital Performing Provider TPI: 136141205 Project Summary: Provider Description : University Hospital (UH) is the 496-be d acute care hospital of University Health System, owned by the people of Bexar C ounty. It serves as the primary teaching hospital for the University of Texas Health Science Ce nter San Antonio, and the lead Level I Trauma Center and safety net provider for the estimat ed 2 million residents of Bexar County and South Texas. Over the past two decades University Health System has expanded access to primary, specialty, and preventive health care services, and currently op erates 19 health centers and clinics throughout Bexar County. Intervention(s) : This project will increase the quality of palliative care services and expand education regarding palliative medicine among pr imary care providers at University Hospital. The project will improve the quality of life fo r patients and families facing serious illness through earlier advanced care planning, better communication, as well as improved pain and symptom management and coordination of care. Need for the project : Currently, less than one-third of palliative medicine consultations occur early in the course of hospita lization (within 72 hours after admi ssion) at University Hospital. Late consultation results in missed opportunities to improve pain and symptom management, to establish a relationship with patients and famili es, and to promote patient and family-centered goals that might prioritize co mfort over aggressive therapy. Target population : The target population comprises patien ts with life-threat ening or chronic progressive illnesses who would benefit from palliative care services including those with cancer, brain injury, trauma, cardiovascular dis ease, dementia, COPD, cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease. Medicaid funded and uninsured individuals represen t 62% of the patient population served by the Health System. Category 2 expected patient benefits : The project will provide training and education in palliative care services to over 150 primar y care physicians by DY2, 300 by DY3, 360 by DY4, and400 by DY5.The project will provide effective pain screening to over158 patients by DY2, 319 by DY3, 382by DY4, and 479 by DY5.Benefits to the patient population include an increased awareness and access to palliative care services and the standardization of effective screening tools that increase the quality of care and improve the patient experience.

DY5 - Provide comprehensive clinical asse ssments, documentation of life sustaining preferences, and spiritual/relig ious concerns for at least 90% of eligible patients(574). 776 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Project Description: The purpose of implementing an expanded Palliative Care program within University Hospital is to provide access to comprehens ive supportive care serv ices for patients in Bexar County who are at risk for serious illness and to improve quality of life for patients and families facing serious illness through intensiv e communication, pain and sympto m management, advanced care planning, and coordination of care. The high prev alence of chronic disease in the Bexar County and throughout RHP Region 6 results in patients with cancer and chroni c progressive illness. University Hospital is implementing a Pallia tive Care program known as LIFE (Lifelong Intensive Family and Emotional) Care/Palliativ e Medicine. The LIFE Ca re/Palliative Medicine program seeks five-year expected outcomes that will serve to mend gaps in comprehensive supportive services for the most vulnerable patie nt populations including patients with cancer, brain injury, trauma, and chronic progressive illn ess such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, dementia, COPD, cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease. To meet the challenges of providing broad access to supportive services for these patient populations, the LIFE Care/Palliative Medicine program will build on existing resour ces while developing th ree interconnected and interdisciplinary service lines\u2014inpatient care, outpatient care, and advanced care planning\u2014 with an emphasis on the followi ng goals through quality improveme nt initiatives driven by data collected from the actual patient population: early identification, planning, and support for at-risk patients and families across University Health System facilities and beyond; enhanced assessment, management, and documentation of pain and other symptoms; increased patient safety through education and documentation relate d to coordination of care and safe uses of medications; improved patient outcomes includi ng patient and family satisfaction, ICU and hospital mortality, hospital readmission, and hospice referral. Benefits to the patient population include increased awareness among providers and pa tients as well as better access to palliative care services and standardization of effective sc reening tools for pain a nd other needs. All of these initiatives will lead to improved continuity of care across settings, earlier and safer pain and symptom control, patient empowerment, incr eased access to sources of social and spiritual support, and higher patient and family satisfaction. Starting Point/Baseline: University Hospital started the inpatient and outp atient service lines for the LIFE Care/Palliative Medicine program in July 2011. The service is currently staffed by Hospice and Palliative Medicine Board Certified and Board Eligible (A merican Board of Intern al Medicine) physicians and a Registered Nurse with advanced training in Palliative Care, as well as a dedicated Palliative Care Social Worker and Chaplain wh o joined during the spring and summer of 2012 respectively. During the calendar year 2012, th e LIFE Care/Palliative Medicine program provided 638 inpatient consultations and over 120 outpatient clinic visits. Currently, education in Palliative Care for primary care providers is sorely lacking and education for physicians-in- training is neither systematic nor embraced as a central part of the core ACGME curriculum. Rationale: Palliative Care is an e ffective tool for meeting the needs of patient populations who are at risk for suffering and progressive illne ss. Hundreds of well-designed st udies have demonstrated that 777 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Palliative Care improves family satisfaction a nd patient quality of life while reducing symptom burden and costs associated with non-beneficial medical care.48 For this reason, many states are attempting to remedy the status quo through Palliat ive Care initiatives. Milestones and metrics for this project were selected according to the like lihood that they would promote awareness and access to supportive services, improve skills acro ss the healthcare system, and ensure effective use of screening tools. Project Components (a) and (b) have been fulfilled during the first year of the LIFE Care/Palliative Medi cine program through the following: development of a business case for a palliative care servic e and transitioning patients from the acute care setting into home care and hospice. Project Components (c) and (d ) will be addressed through the implementation of a screening process regardi ng pain management as well as the implementation of quality improvement initiatives to identify project impacts, lessons learned, and key challenges associated with expansion of the project. Proce ss Milestone 2.1 (Educate primary care specialties in Palliative Care) will be used for DY 2-5 and will engage clinicians and residents across primary care specialties. This strategy will allo w the LIFE Care/Palliative Medicine team to focus on clinical care for patients with comple x care needs while also influencing the next generation of practitioners. Improvement M ilestone I-11.1 (Pain screening) will promote standardization of effective scre ening tools that improve safety and enhance patient experiences. State report cards issued by the Ce nter to Advance Palliative Ca re reveal that Texas improved from a \"D\" in 2007 to a \"C\" in 2011 as a result of more hospitals investing in palliative care services, University Hospital among them, but this still remains low.49 This program addresses both Co mmunity Need CN.1 (poor health care quality) and Community Need CN.2 (high prevalence of chronic diseas e, including cancer) identified in the RHP 6 Community Needs Assessment. The LIFE Care/Pal liative Medicine program was started in mid- 2011, but continues to grow due to the demand for services. Analysis of an internally maintained database shows less than one-third of LIFE Care/P alliative Medicine consu ltations occur early in the course of hospitalization (w ithin 72 hours after admission). All of the patients who were consulted late in th e course of hospitalizatio n suffered from a set of comorbidities and acute conditions that were identifiable at the time of admission. Late consultation entails a missed opportunity to improve pain and symptom management, to establish a healthy rapport with patients and fami lies, and to promote patient and family-centered goals that might include priori tizing comfort over survival-at-al l-costs. When patients who received an inpatient LIFE Care/Palliative Me dicine consultation are matched by diagnoses and severity of illness to patients who did not rece ive a consultation, a si gnificant disparity is revealed: for every LIFE Care/Palliative Medicine consultation there are at least five equally ill and distressed patients and families who were not introduced to the LIFE Care/Palliative Medicine team. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): For Category 3 outcomes, the three non-standalo ne metrics (chart documentation of pain assessment, treatment preferences, and documentati on of spiritual concerns) reflect some of the core quality measures needed to achieve excellen ce in patient care. These metrics also correlate 48Zimmermann C, Riechelmann R, Krzyzanowska M, Rodin G, Tannock I. Effectiveness of specialized pall care: a systematic rev iew. JAMA .

There is documented evidence of problems with hospital symptom manageme nt and continuity of care: 1 in 2 patients describe thei r hospital care as \"suboptimal\"50 1 in 4 patients report inadequate trea tment for pain and shortness of breath51 1 in 3 families report inadequate emotional support52 1 in 3 patients state they ar e poorly educated for pain and other symptom management after hospital discharge53 1 in 3 patients are not provided plans for follow-care after hospital discharge.54 Over 50% of deaths in Ameri ca occur in the hospital setting.55 Over 70% of patients who die in the hospital were admitted to the hospital in the previous six months.56 Only 40% of public hospitals have a ccess to Palliative Care specialists.57 About 33% of patients enrolled in hospice die within one week.58 Improving access to LIFE Care/Palliative Medici ne services involves implementation of a comprehensive supportive service that inevitabl y relies on changing the culture in which the service is practiced. Referring physicians and physicians-in-training need to understand and appreciate the role that Palliativ e Care can play in improving patie nt and family satisfaction, pain and other symptom management, and in promoti ng patient and family-centered care. Education of referring physicians, especially primary car e physicians and physic ians-in-training, can deepen the appreciation for supportive care. Educa tion in Palliative Care can also promote best practices and broad patient access to competent deliv ery of basics in Palliative Care, such as the safe use of opioids, emotional and spiritual aspects of care, and ethi cal issues related to surrogate decision-making and withdr awing or withholding life- sustaining interventions. Relationship to other Projects: 136141205.1.2 Expand Primary Care Capacity: Implementation of education for primary-care providers, expanded outpatient Palliative Care se rvices, and advance care planning efforts will help to relieve the time and resource-intensive obligations that primar y care clinics face when caring for seriously ill patients and their familie s. Enhanced knowledge about safe-prescribing practices and available resources such as hospice can help primary care physicians navigate more confidently through the plan of care for their most vulnerable patients. 136141205.1.7 Enhance Interpretation Services and Culturally Competent Care: Cultural competence in health care describe s the ability of systems to provide care to patients with diverse values, beliefs and behaviors, in cluding tailoring care delivery to meet patients' social, cultural, and linguistic needs. Inpatient and outpatient Palliative Care services focuses on culturally competent communication among patients, families, and providers. Opportunities for patients and families to voice their questions and concerns , particularly during family meetings, are key elements of promoting education, understanding, and empowerment. 92414401.2.2 Enhance/Expand Medical Homes: Outpatient Palliative Care services staffed by 50Covinsky KE, Goldman L, Cook E, et al.

The LIFE Care/Palliative Medicine team is tracking data related to pati ent encounters, hospitalizations and readmissions, and symptom management, all of which can be used to gauge the success of a supportive medical home model. 92414401.2.1 Expand Chronic Care Management Models: Chronic disease management interventions are geared toward improving eff ective management of chronic conditions and ultimately improving patient clinical indicato rs, health outcomes and quality, and reducing unnecessary acute and emergency care utilization. Outpatient Palliative Care helps promote continuity across settings and reduce medical er rors by ensuring that patients with advanced illness are seen by Palliative Care specialists soon after hospital discharge or as needed when referred by other specialists such as cancer doctors or surgeons. 136141205.2.2 Redesign to Improve Patient Experience: The service lines for the LIFE Care program will improve how the patient experien ces healthcare and the patient and family satisfaction with the care pr ovided. Symptom management, comm unication, continuity of care, and respect for patient preferences are all primary targets for improved experiences. Related Category 4 measures include the following: Potentially Preventable Admissions (RD-1) 30-Day Readmissions (RD-2) Patient-centered Healthcare (RD-4) Advance care planning in patients with chronic pr ogressive illness has been shown to improve patient and family satisfaction a nd is also likely to save medi cal costs by reducing the use of unnecessary medical treatments su ch as prolonged ICU stays at the end of life, and increase hospice utilization in patients with life-limiting illness. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: The LIFE Care/Palliative Medicine project serves a si milar population found in other parts of our RHP 6. We will attempt to collaborate on the pr ogress, learn from our mutual projects, and support a learning collaboration should one be form ed on this topic. An analysis of regional projects submitted for RHP 6 includes the selection of project options by multiple performing providers which are related to the aims of palliative care program. These include: 1.1 Expand Primary Care Capacity 1.2 Increase training of Primary Care Workforce 2.1 Enhance/Expand Medical Homes 2.2 Expand Chronic Care Management Models 2.4 Redesign to Improve Patient Experience Additionally, another performing provider has chosen the Use of Palliative Care Programs among their submissions and will be part of a regional learning collaborative to network and share ideas, challenges, and success stories with partner institutions. 92414401.1.1 Increase training of Primary Care Workforce: Implementing and developing the LIFE Care/Palliative Medici ne service at University Hosp ital will provide opportunities for primary care physicians-in-training to rotate with Palliative Care specialists and promote skills that will be increasingly impor tant as the population ages. 780 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Project Valuation: University Hospital has valued th is project through its ab ility to achieve the waiver goals, meet community needs, meet the level of required invest ment, and include the value of palliative care in the context of both the inpatient and outpati ent setting. In 2011, Univer sity Health System cared for over 233,000 unique patients, includi ng about 67,000 Emergency Center visits, 400,000 outpatient clinic visits, and 20,000 inpatient discharges. The pr imary inpatient facility in University Hospital, which operates 496 beds and will expand to about 750 beds when the new University Tower is completed in 2014. South and Central Texas have some of the nation's highest rates of diabet es and obesity. University Hospital is a Level One Trauma Center, a world-renowned solid organ transplant center, and a referral center fo r a broad array of life- threatening conditions including me tastatic cancer, end-stage re nal disease, cirrhosis, heart failure, AIDS, and vascular disease. During th e calendar year 2012, the LIFE Care/Palliative Medicine program provided 638 inpatient consulta tions and over 120 outpa tient clinic visits. Preliminary analysis from an internal database reveals that 50% of these patients suffered from advanced cancer, 30% had brain injury or polyt rauma, and 30% faced end-stage organ disease such renal failure and cirrhosis, with some overlap among these groups. The ultimate goal for the LIFE Care/Palliative Medicine program is to support as many patients as possible early in the course of their life-threatening or disabling illnes ses. In order to maximize the reach and impact, referring health care providers in both the outpatient and inpatient se ttings must (1) be capable of delivering excellent primary pa lliative care and (2) know when a nd how to refer to specialty services. Education is essentia l to success for both of these pr actices. As of 2012, approximately 300 primary care attending physicians and 300 prim ary care residents work within University Health System. The LIFE Care/Palliative Medi cine aims to develop a comprehensive and effective educational program fo r as many of these providers as possible. While curriculum development will require time and energy on the fr ont end, a strategic and sustained educational program can potentially improve the lifelong prac tices of the current and next generations of physicians. The value of education for improve d health outcomes cannot be overstated: education represents a commitment to transfor ming the culture while yielding an immediate and sustained ripple effect of improved patient sa tisfaction, continuity of care, safe use of medications, and meaningful use of resources fo r the hundreds of thousands of patients who seek care from University Health System each year. Education can also improve outcomes related to the delivery of specialty serv ices. Currently, less than one-t hird of palliative medicine consultations occur early in the course of hos pitalization (within 72 hours after admission) at University Hospital. Late c onsultation results in missed opportunities to improve pain and symptom management, to establis h a relationship with patients and families, and to promote patient and family-centered goals that might pr ioritize comfort over aggr essive therapy. Teaching residents when to ask for specialty support can foster a culture of early collaboration and consultation. Additionally, pain control is incr easingly recognized as a primary outcome in hospital care and this project offers strategies for demonstrating improvement in this area. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality sugge sts that patient safety and satisfaction cannot be optimized in hospital-based ca re without first raising the bar for pain assessment. The authors note that the scope of the problem is vast: 62% of the 35 million discharges from U.S. hospitals 781 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital include surgery or inte rventional procedures, and over 80% of these patients experience post- operative or procedural pain.59 These patients are at risk for adverse cardiac events, swings in blood sugar, the development of chronic pain and addiction, and psychological distress such as anxiety and sleeplessness. The American Academy of Pain Medicine also notes that patients who experience uncontrolled pain e xperience higher absenteeism and lost productivity, with an annual estimated cost of about $300 billion.60By combining targeted education with specialty symptom and decision support, the LIFE Care/Palliat ive Medicine team will help to ensure that the University Health System achieves its st ated mission of \"promoting the good health of community by providing the highest quality of car e\" and \"teaching the next generation of health professionals.\"Cost-savings or cost-avoidance is increasingly r ecognized as a secondary outcome associated with Palliative Care programs. When patients and families are provided early supportive care, the culture of automatic escalation of care is mitigated. Th is can result in cost- savings, improved quality of life, and even prolongation of life. 61 One large multi-institutional study that matched patients by severity of illne ss (propensity scores) showed that inpatient Palliative Care consultation significantly reduced direct and variable costs.62 For patients who were discharged alive, Palliative Care consulta tion correlated with an adjusted net savings of $1,700 per admission. And for patients who died in the hospital, savings exceeded $4,900 per admission. When these savings are multiplied ac ross hundreds of consultations per year, and increased ICU bed availability is included, the sa vings to the healthcare system are substantial. Those savings can be used to further improve and expand supportive care for all patients. At University Hospital, early analysis demonstrat es similar cost-savings . One-hundred and seventy patients seen by the LIFE Care/Palliative Me dicine team during a six month period were matched to about 9,000 patients with similar diagnoses and severity of illness. With conservative assumptions and excluding outliers, reduced di rect and variable savings averaged $5,600 per admission. Consultations performed within 72 hours of admissions yielded an even higher cost- savings of $12,600 per admission, which further illust rates the need for early Palliative Care consultation. For the 638 consults performed in 2012, the estimated cost-savings exceeded $5 million. Opportunity costs not included in this analysis includes ICU bed days, which also decreased by an average of one day per admission and likely resulted in reduced ICU mortality and better Emergency Center th roughput. Early palliative care involvement is the goal, which offers the greatest ability to improve health ou tcomes, patient experience, and cost avoidance. The project offers a synergistic strategy for op timizing local clinical practice guidelines through palliative care education for primary care physic ians, pain screening fo r all palliative care patients, optimized pain management, docum entation of life sustaining preferences and religious/spiritual and McCaffery, \"Chapter 17: Improving the Qual ity of Care Through Pain Assessment and Management\" in the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality \"Patient Safety an d Quality: An Evidence-Based Handbook for Nurses,\" ed Ronda Hughes, April 2008.

It serves as the primary teaching hospital for the University of Texas Health Science Ce nter San Antonio, and the lead Level I Trauma Center and safety net provider for the estimat ed 2 million residents of Bexar County and South Texas. Over the past two decades University Health System has expanded access to primary, specialty and preventive health care services, and currently operates 19 health centers and clinics throughout Bexar County. Intervention(s) : The Health System will enhance access to evidence-based preventive screenings for the residents of Bexar County, Texas by worki ng with regional providers, health centers and community-based organizations to collaborate coordinate and establish a strategy that encourages adherence to cancer prevention scre ening in under and uninsured segments of the population. The outlined intervention also directly responds to the Health System's Triple Aim Plus objectives of improving access across the care continuum, quality and outcomes, efficiency and patient experience. Need for the project : In Texas, cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death for persons 85 years of age and younge r. Screening and early detection continues to be the most effective method of reducing cance r mortality. In South Texas (Public Health Service Region 8), prevalence data indicates that only 67% of women age 40 and older have had a mammogram within the past two years, 74% of adult females reporting having a cervical screening within the past three years and 66% of adults ages 50 and older report ever having a Sigmoidoscopy or Colonoscopy. For example, while the overall average annual age-adjusted incidence and mortality rates pe r 100,000 for breast cancer for women in this region is slightly lower (113.1and 20.8) than the rest of Texa s (115.5 and 22.2, respectively), among Hispanic females both the incidence (98.3) and mortality ( 18.1) associated with breast cancer is higher when compared to Hispanic females living in the rest of the state (92.7 and 17.1, respectively). Therefore, despite the benefits of screening, economically vulner able and uninsured and minority populations are less likely to be screen ed and therefore at risk for cancer. The demand for primary care visits in the Health System's service area has been growing at a rapid rate. This is also occurring in areas wh ere a majority of low-income, under and uninsured residents are concentrated in se ctors where access to primary care and social services are limited. The rate of uninsured in Bexar County is 23%, highlighting the need for increased access. In addition, access to timely clinical preventive sc reenings can prevent and detect illnesses and diseases in their earlier, more treatable stages, which can lead to reduced risk of illness, disability, early death, an d medical care costs. Target population : This project will focus on reaching various segments of eligible patients (i.e., 786 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital economically underserved, uninsured, or working women) through screeni ng/health education events held at community, workplace, and faith-based venues. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The anticipated 5 year goal is to increase the number of individual that are screened through this innovative evid ence-based program by 20% over baseline (or 6,029 individuals). The secondary goal is to support coordina tion of services that improve timely access related evidence-based ca ncer prevention screening (breast, cervical, colorectal). Category 3 of indivi duals who receive a preventive screening by TBD% from esta blished baseline of DY 2; DY5 - Increase number of eligible individuals who receive a preventive screening by TBD% from established baseline of DY2 Project Description: In Texas, cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death for persons 85 years of age and younger. Screening and early detec tion continues to be the most effective method of reducing cancer mortality. In South Texas (Public Health Se rvice Region 8), prevalence data indicates that only 67% of women ages 40 and older have had a mammogram within the past two years, 74% of adult females reporting having a cervical screeni ng with the past three ye ars and 66% of adults ages 50 and older report ever having a Sigmoi doscopy or Colonoscopy. For example, while the overall average annual age-adjusted incidence and mortality rates per 100,000 for breast cancer for women in this region is slightly lower (113.1 and 20.8) than the rest of Texas (115.5 and 22.2, respectively), among Hispanic females bot h the incidence (98.3) and mortality (18.1) associated with breast cancer is higher when comp ared to Hispanic females living in the rest of the state (92.7 and 17.1, respectivel y). Therefore, despite the bene fits of screening, economically vulnerable and uninsured and minority populations ar e less likely to be scr eened and therefore at greater risk for cancer. The project will be to implemen t an innovative community-based intervention model to increase access to clinical preventive services throughout Bexar County, Texas. The primary objective will be to encourage regional pr oviders, health centers and community-based organizations to collaborate and coordinate on cancer prevention a pproaches that will focus on reaching various segments of eligible patients (i.e., economically underserve d, uninsured, or working women) through screening/health education events he ld at community, workplace, and faith-based venues. Through this process vulnerable/uninsured or un derinsured populations in need of evidence- based preventive screening will be referred to low- cost or free mammograms, cervical screenings and or colorectal screenings. Breast Health Services provides screening and diagnostic follow-up in women 40 years of age and older as well as wo men referred with a need for diagnostics who reside in economically underserved areas of Bexar County, Texas. Access to preventive screenings (cervical can cer screening, colorectal cancer screening) will be made possible through the introduction of a mobile mammography unit alongside patient navi gation services and development of a coalition of community-bas ed cancer prevention, screening and treatment partners located within the pr oposed target service area. The project's goal of implementing evidence-based strategies that address chronic disease risk and thereby increase delivery of clinical preventive services for targeted populations (e.g., 787 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital mammography, cervical and colorectal screens, bl ood pressure, and immunizations, etc.) firmly coincide with national and regi onal health improvement goals ( Healthy People 2020 , Bexar County Community Health Improvement Plan, 2012) . These goals aim to improve delivery of evidence-based clinical preventive services that consist of screening a nd immunizations that can prevent diseases and reduce mortality associated with chronic disease. Advancement in health information tec hnology alongside standardized documentation procedures provide clinical staff a much more accurate and updated profile in the delivery of clinical preventive services to patients. Therefor e, project goals will be to implement and expand evidence-based population-focused interventions as outlined in published st udies and reports that include the United States Preven tive Taskforce Guide to Clinical Preventive Services and the National Prevention Council's National Preventi on Strategy. These clinical recommendations make evident the importance of enhancing access to clinical and preventive care and thereby create opportunities that engage and motivate individuals to make informed decisions about their health that include seeking and adhering to c linical preventive care. This includes utilizing technology to inform patients that they are due for a preventive health serv ice through clinical reminder systems (e.g., electronic h ealth records with reminders or cues, chart stickers, vital signs stamps, medical record flow sheets) for preventive services. The Health System will monitor, evaluate, and adjust the project based on quality improvement activities throughout th e development and implementation phase s, offering \"lessons learned\" to our partners in RHP6 through the appropriate Learning Collaborative to be established. Potential challenges faced by this project in clude ensuring access and delivery to clinical preventive screening to populations that are of ten confined by their socioeconomic position and therefore must navigate interpersonal, financ ial and geographic barrie rs to care. Another important element that providers consider a challe nge is ensuring that resources are available to ensure treatment options for individuals who ar e diagnosed. Countermeasur es to these challenges include implementing a culturally tailored patient navigation model that helps to ensure that barriers to seeking prev entive care are reduced. Geographic barri ers to care will be countered through expansion of mobile screening services th at will target high economically distressed areas of the city. Further funding for treatment op tions will be strengthened by ensuring that patients are appropriately na vigated into treatment. Relationship to Regional Goals: This new project will furthe r achievement of the regional goals of the Triple Aim; improve health care infr astructure to better serve Medicaid and currently uninsured residents in RHP 6; reduce health disparities by improving access to delivery of clinical preventive services (screening and im munizations); further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system; and improve outcomes while containing cost growth. Five year expected outcomes include having an established mobile scr eening services program that strengthens patient-centered care and addres ses the triple aim of health service delivery performance that includes improving the experi ence and quality of care, improving population health and delivering care in cost-effective manner. 788 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Starting Point/Baseline: The current baseline for cancer-relate d screening as of October 1, 2012 is: Breast Cancer Screenings: 14,000 Cervical Caner Screenings: 12,000 1,748 preventive screenings as of September 30, 2012. Rationale: Almost half of all Americans (or 133 million) su ffer from at least one chronic health condition including heart disease, str oke, hypertension and diabetes. An estimated 57 million individuals of working-age (age 18 to 64) live with at least one chronic disease. Cumulatively, chronic diseases remain the leading causes of death (70%) in the United States; claim the lives of 1.7 million Americans each year and cost the U.S. economy $ 1.3 trillion and are expect ed to reach $6 trillion by the year 2050. Further, less than half of all Americans receiv e the recommended levels of screening associated with clinical preventive care. Studies confirm the clinical and economic benefits of providing timely access to preventive services by significa ntly reducing the onset of chronic health conditions such diabetes, infecti ous disease such as flu and pne umonia and detecting cancer and other diseases at much earlier stages. In Bexar County, Texas, 22% of resi dents live at or below the poverty level ($22,557), 17% receive no medical ca re due to cost, and 21% have no form of health insurance coverage with a diabetes incidence that it twi ce the national average (14%) . community need identifica tion number two (CN.2): Address the high prevalence of chronic disease and relate d health disparities in the community through greater prevention efforts that focus on addressing chronic disease. The proposed model provides the opportunity to redesign delivery of h ealth services at UHS. This project represents an effo rt to expand University Health System's patient-centered medical home by providing care in the right setting and at the right time for pa tients who historically have been unable to access clin ical preventive care, by providi ng earlier detection and treatment and potential cost avoidance of unnecessary hospita lizations and/or ER vis its due to preventable conditions that include screening for r eceipt of clinical preventive care.

It serves as the primary teaching hospital for the University of Texas Health Science Ce nter San Antonio, and the lead Level I Trauma Center and safety net provider for the estimat ed 2 million residents of Bexar County and South Texas. Over the past two decades University Health System has expanded access to primary, specialty the preventive health care services, and currently operates 19 hea lth centers and clinics throughout Bexar County. Intervention(s) : The program will provide access to a clinical pharmacist in the ambulatory setting/medical home during the medical consult. This pharmacist will be dedicated to the provision of education and medi cation management for patien ts with chronic diseases (ambulatory care sensitive conditions) who ar e on multiple medications and whose disease process is not well controlled and/or patients who utilize the Emergency Department or are hospitalized for their chronic disease. Need for the project : The University Health System di spenses approximately 800,000 outpatient prescriptions per year to the uninsured and Me dicaid patients who utilize the Health System for their health care need s. Although patients have access to medications they often lack understanding of the importance of complying with the prescribed regimen or how their drugs, food and home remedies interact. It is believed that additional time spent with the higher risk patients will improve the health of the patient and reduce unnecessary expenses including visits to the Emergency Department and hospitalizations. Target population : The target population will be patients who are on multiple drug regimens with a history of non-adherence to medication as reflected by the lack of progression in the improvement of their chronic di sease, and those who have multiple emergency department visits/hospitalizations related to their chroni c disease. The target population will include the Medicaid funded and uninsured patients who co mprise 62% of patients who receive services within the Health System. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : Improves access to pharmacist counseling. Patient benefit is to increase the number of patient s accessing the service by 10% over baseline for DY3, and then 10% each year over the previous y ear through DY5. These efforts will provide the opportunity to tailor medication education for pa tients and will bene fit their healthcare experience through the provision of safe, timely and effective patient-centered care relative to their medications. Category 3 outcomes: 136141205.3.24 3.IT.2.11 total acute care hospitalizations for ambulatory care sensitive conditions 797 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital DY4 - Reduce total acute care hospitalizations for ambulatory care sensitive conditions under age 75 by TBD% DY5 - Reduce total acute care hospitalizations for ambulatory care sensitive conditions under age 75 by TBD% Project Description: University Health System (Health System) provides care primarily to the uninsured and Medicaid populations of Bexar C ounty. In this role the Health System provides (1) outpatient pharmacy services for patients discharged from th e hospital to ensure th at regardless of funding source, the needed medications are available at discharge, a nd (2) ongoing outpatient pharmacy services. Overall, the Health System fills approximately 800,000 pr escriptions per year to this group of patients. Medication couns eling is available at the time a prescription is filled, but that encounter with a pharmacist or discharge nurse is failing to adequately address the educational needs of the patients relative to their medications, pa rticularly in light of the diversity of culture and language in the patient population. This proj ect dedicates one specially trained, culturally competent pharmacist to a selected Health System ambulatory \"hub\" clinic to implement chronic disease medication management among the patients assigned to that clinic. Medication management is the monitoring of medi cations a patient takes to confirm that the patient is complying with a medication regime n, while also ensuring th e patient is avoiding potentially dangerous drug interactions and other complications. This is especially important for patients taking large numbers of medications to address chronic illnesses and multiple diseases, which is particularly common among older adults, as they are more likely to need medications to manage an array of chronic conditions. There are a number of aspects to medication management, all of which are focused on making sure that medications are used appropriately. The primary challenge we face in implementing this project include educating providers a nd patients about the im portance of medication management, and assuring providers are aware of and refer patients to the medication counselor role . We expect to address these issues as well as changes to clinical work flow as part of our planning/expansion processes. The overall goal of conducting pha rmacist-led, chronic disease medication management in a defined population is to create a be st-practices \"model\" of processe s and information to facilitate appropriate use of medications to control illne ss and promote health acros s the Health System's ambulatory settings. The goal beyond the five ye ars will be to provide the model to conduct medication management so that patients receive the right medications at the right time, across Health System facilities, to reduce medication er rors and adverse effects from medication use, and to improve the health of the patient population. This project addresses Waiver goals of 1) the Tr iple Aim: assuring patients receive high-quality and patient-centered care, in the most cost -effective ways; 2) Improving the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured resident s of the region; 3)furthering the development of and maintenance of a coordi nated care delivery system; and 4) improving outcomes while containing cost growth. 798 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Starting Point/Baseline: Currently, no Medicaid or unfunded patients rece ive the proposed service. The average \"hub\" clinic, into which smaller clin ics feed, has approximately 60,000 vi sits a year and the average number of prescriptions per unique patient is two. This project will take place in one of the five hub clinics to be determined. Two new pharmaci st FTEs will be required. The numerator and denominator for the outcomes measure will be de termined in DY2 as the project baseline and processes are defined. Rationale: The project was selected to bene fit the majority of the Health System's patient population who have limited resources and need additional support to understand and manage their medications due to chronic conditions such as diabet es and hypertension. Project option 2.11.2 (Core Component choice c) is addressed in this project as direct contact with a pharmacist in a clinical setting for all patients with multiple medicati ons. Currently, University Health System has a computerized physician's entry system in place, in which licensed providers can enter orders as appropriate, which facilitates the scope of this project and fulfills core component b. This will benefit those patients who are on multiple medications for the treatment of diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure or chroni c obstructive pulmonary disease (core component a). Ensuring appropriate use of medication bene fits the health care of the patient as well as reducing overall health care cost s. A delivery system with a written medication management plan that is consistently followed by all provide rs can reduce medication e rrors. Targeted patients who consistently receive medicatio n management are more likely to adhere to their medication regimen and receive the benefits. The plan for the project will be to improve compliance with medication therapy reducing ED visits and admissions and readmissions. This project addresses CN.1 in general (Texas ra nks last in the nation on healthcare quality) and CN.2 in particular (a high prevalence of chroni c disease and related heal th disparities require greater prevention efforts and improved management of patients with chr onic conditions). The Health System's experience with the high prev alence of chronic diseas e and the overwhelming evidence of health care disparit ies provides the opportunity a nd the imperative to implement improvements in the management of patients wi th chronic conditions so prevalent in RHP6. This project is a new initiative for the Health System. According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's 2011 report, Texas ranks la st in the nation on hea lth care quality. The report is based on 155 quality measures which incl ude disease prevention efforts, deaths from various conditions, cancer treatment, and how we ll health care providers manage chronic conditions such as diabetes. Under the category of \"Types of Care,\" Texas scored \"weak\" on preventive measures, acute care measures, and chronic care measures. Under the category of \"Care by Clinical Area,\" Texas scored \"weak\" on diabetes, heart disease, and respiratory measures, and \"average\" on cancer measures. The Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) published vari ous reports related to potentially preventable hospitalizations and readmissions. Between 2005 and 2010, HHS C found that RHP 6 had 125,090 potentially preventable hospitalizations, about 8.5% of the entire state. The conditions studied include bacterial pneumonia, dehydration, urinary tract infection, angina, congestive heart failure, hypertension, asthma, chronic obtrusive pulmonary disease, and diabetes. The hospitalizations 799 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital are considered \"potentia lly preventable\" because \"if the indi vidual had access to and cooperated with appropriate outpatient hea lth care, the hospitalization woul d likely not have occurred.\" This project will create a pharmacist-led, ch ronic disease medication management model program for the Health System that will be shar ed with provider partners in the region. The program will have a direct impact on these qual ity measures by reducing medication errors and adverse effects from medication use.

Exclusions: Individuals 75 years of ag e and older; Death before discharge b) Denominator : Total mid-year populat ion under age 75. c) Data source: EMR/IDX d). Reasons/Rationale for selecting the outcome measures: Lack of access to medication or non- compliance with medication instructions are 2 ke y contributors to increa sed hospital admissions. Reducing unnecessary admissions be nefits the patient and lowers costs for the hospital and the state. A potentially avoidable hospitalization a chronic health condition is commonly associated with a lack of access to appropr iate ambulatory care. While not all admissions for chronic conditions are avoidable, it is assumed that appropriate ambula tory care can pr event avoidable admissions through more effective disease manage ment, and control of acute episodes. A high rate of avoidable admissions reflects problems in obtaining access to appr opriate primary care. This pharmacist-led, chronic disease medication ma nagement program will have a direct impact on reducing avoidable admissions by reducing me dication errors and adverse effects from medication use. Culturally competent pharmaci sts can effectively remove barriers and communicate with patients to educate them about medications, assure proper usage, answer questions, and provide social and emotional support to patients and their families.

Medication management is a primary el ement of a care management model. Category 4: Related Category 4 measures include potentially preventable admissions measures in RD-1, 30 day readmissions in RD-2, and Patient Satisfaction in RD-4.1 and RD-4.2. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: The medication management project has implicati ons and benefits for all Performing Providers in RHP6. Results from this project include a viable model that can be replicated in similar care settings throughout south Texas. Plan for Learning Collaborative: This project naturally lends itself to participa tion in a learning collabora tive dedicated to care coordination as other Performing Providers seek to develop pharmacist-led, chronic disease medication management programs to reduce avoidabl e admissions and erase disparities in care. The Health System will actively pursue opportun ities to share with interested Performing Providers information and best practices on at least a semi-annual basis. During model development and implementation of the medication management model we will capture lessons-learned. These will be shared wi th regional partners who are interested in implementing similar strategies. Project Valuation: Valuation is based on Achievement of Waiver Go als, Community Needs, Scope of Project, and Project Investment. The addition of a pharmacist to the ambulatory team in a specified Health System \"hub clinic\" will benefit the community patient, while reducing costs for unnecessary admissions. This program is an essential elem ent in building cost-effective community health care. It strengthens healthcare linkages with lo cal community partners and enhances access to health care services to a target population who struggle with poverty, receive acute or emergency healthcare services only, and do not have usual providers, or access to medication education and 801 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital support. In addition, many in the target population have chronic disease and are taking multiple medications. Access to medication counseling w ill reduce confusion, clarify the best way to manage medications at home and support patient s on becoming self-sufficient in caring for themselves and their families. 802 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital 136141205.2.8 PASS 2 2.11.2 2.11.2.

It serves as the primary teaching hospital for the University of Texas Health Science Ce nter San Antonio, and the lead Level I Trauma Center and safety net provider for the estimat ed 2 million residents of Bexar County and South Texas. Over the past two decades University Health System has expanded access to primary, specialty the preventive health care services, and currently operates 19 hea lth centers and clinics throughout Bexar County. Intervention(s) : The project involves the implementa tion of a care transitions program for patients identified as having congestive heart failur e as a primary or secondary diagnosis. A core component of this program is the training of primary care physicians in a patient centered medical home by a culturally competent, boar d certified cardiology specialist regarding treatment guidelines, algorithms, and other specia lty care for CHF patients that can be delivered during routine primary care, which expands the benefit of a patient centered medical home. Within the project the target popul ation and existing pre and post acu te services will be identified for more comprehensive engagement, and protocols will be established to prevent hospitalization and/or readmissions. Need for the project : Data shows approximately 15 trillion USD was spent over a 12-14 year span by CMS for Congestive heart failure and this diagnosis is one of the three most costly readmissions to hospitals across the nation. Univ ersity Health System cares for approximately 800 patients annually with a primary diagnosis of CHF. Readmissi on data presented by CMS in 2010 showed a 30.1 % readmission rate. Target population : Patients admitted into University Hospital with primary or secondary diagnoses of congestive heart failure. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : DY2 and DY3 will be the years for identifying and establishing relationships with pr e and post acute services whose interventions are targeted to this population for prevention of hospitalization. Protocols that are evidenced based will be implemented, training of primary care provide rs by a cardiology specialist will occur and processes will become documented and hardwired across the system. Category 3 outcomes: IT-3.2 Reduce Congestive Heart Failure 30 day readmission rate by TBD% from baseline by DY5. 805 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Project Description: The project will work towards implementing a care transitions program for patients identified as having congestive heart failure as a primary or secondary diagnosis . The project will primarily help define the target population and the ch allenges with offering a more comprehensive approach to their specific di sease process. The project wi ll identify readmission rates and determine factors for readmission for the CHF population. The team assigned to facilitate the project will ta rget a patient care unit with a high number of patients admitted with CHF. The pilot progr am will utilize the tool s in Project RED (Re Engineered Discharge) to aid in the reducti on of readmission rates and improved clinical outcomes. The initiative/project includes essential components as follows: Review and implementation of best practi ce models for the population served that addresses readmission rates, reasons and time frames for readmission and post discharge support/calls. Assemble, train and work with prioritized po st acute providers to improve processes for patients in transition. Incrementally implement post discharge pla nning support based on select interventions from Project RED, the Coleman Model, and Boost based upon lessons learned. Regularly identify lessons learned and, utilizi ng Lean processes, work to eliminate waste and improve transitions of care processes. The pilot is ambitious and multiple challenges include: The availability of ambulatory resources to support the needs of the predetermined population of patients with CHF Lack of cultural understanding of the heal th care needs and expectations of the community Lack of infrastructure (staffing) to coordinate th e care needed. Timely data to address the n eeds of the patient in order to implement interventions in a timely manner. The goal of the program will be to reduce readmissions rates for patients diagnosed with congestive heart failure. The benefit for the pa tient will be improved clinical outcomes due to improved education, better understanding of system utilization, training of health care providers, additional ambulatory support, a nd post discharge services offe red by the Care Coordination department. The secondary benefit to Un iversity Hospital will be future cost avoidance. 806 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Starting Point/Baseline: Beginning in early 2012, an interdisciplinary co mmittee was established to develop a program using the Project RED guidelines to reduce CHF readmission rates specific to one pilot nursing unit. The team began by identifying the baseline population, estab lishing the reasons for readmissions and defining the barriers to appropriate post discharge services. Current data from 2011 through the third quarter of 2012 shows 1,205 patients presented to University Hospital with a primary or secondary dia gnosis of CHF. Of these patien ts, 199 returned to the hospital within 30 days. The data was not differentiated by payer, as the project will target Medicare, Medicaid, and the CareLink population. Several tasks accomplished by the group included a dvancing the education of the nursing staff about CHF education and post discharge educat ion, standardizing natio nal evidence-based CHF education, increasing pharmacy disbursement of 30 day medications, and incorporating downstream providers as pa rt of the committee. Rationale: As The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services strives to become be tter stewards of tax payer dollars and simultaneously improve clinical out comes, a shift in health care has resulted. The responsibility of patient care has begun to tr ansition from being the patient's responsibility to a partnership between the patient and the heal th care team. Readmission penalties have placed financial strains on acute providers . Data reflects that approx imately 15 trillion USD was spent over a 12-14 year span by CMS for one specific DR G. The data showed that congestive heart failure is one of the three most costly readmi ssions to hospitals across the nation. University Health System cares for approximately 800 patien ts annually with a prim ary diagnosis of CHF; the readmission data presented by CMS in 2010 s howed a 30.1 % readmission rate. Changes in work patterns in 2012 have shown improvements a nd decreased the rate for all payers to 14.69%, specifically, 14.5% for Medicare Beneficiaries. Although the data s upports improvements in 2012 and the adjustments to clinical practice have shown some benef its, it is difficult to correlate the reduction in readmission rate s solely on the clini cal practice. \"Observation\" data for 2012 reflects that an additional 131 patients returned to the hospital for complications related to CHF. Therefore, the data showed a higher than repor ted readmission rate based on observation visits. The goal of the project will be to reduce the read mission rate by 13% for all payers regardless of geographic location within University Health System. This project addresses a high prev alence of chronic disease and re lated health disparities that require greater prevention effort s and improved management of pa tients with chronic conditions. One of the leading causes of death in RHP 6 includes cardiovascular disease; the pilot will address this population. (CN2) The project will enhance efforts to date with th e Project Red CHF pilot to decrease admissions, decrease readmission, decrease EC utilization, im prove patient clinical outcomes, enhance disease specific educ ation, and improve pati ent satisfaction. 807 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): This Outcome Measure was chosen specifica lly due to supporting facts as follows: A report written by the CDC on Preventing Ch ronic Diseases stated, \"During 1995-2009, there were preventable hospitalizati ons for CHF among to of 1,013,091 readmissions annually\" (Will, Valderrama, Yoon, 2012). Based on th e State Health Facts, the average cost for admission in the nation is approximately 1798.51/day; th is translates to over 27 trillion dollars in 14 years. The goal will be to reduce CHF readmission rates below the national standa rd of 24% to 14%. OD-3 Potentially - 30 Day Readmission Rates (PPRs) IT-3.2 Congestive Heart Failure 30 day r eadmission rate (Stand-Alone Measure) a) Numerator: The number of readmissions (for pa tients 18 years and older), for any cause, within 30 days of discharge from the inde x HF admission. If an index admission has more than 1 readmission, only firs t is counted as a readmission. b) Denominator: The number of admissions (for patients 18 years and older), for patients discharged from the hospital with a principa l or secondary diagnosis of HF and with a complete claims history for the 12 months prior to admission. Relationship to other Projects: The project has multiple implication on other projects within the DSRIP: A. 2.1 - Enhance/expand the medical home a. Care Transitions will support the medical home by coordinating all efforts associated with patient care throughout the care continuum. Care Transitions looks at caring for the patient in an acute setting through the ambulatory resources. B. 2.3 - Redesign Primary Care a. Primary care will be impacted by looking at multiple factors of transitions of care to include education, specia lty appointments, referrals, post discharge calls, etc. C. 2.4 - Redesign to improve patient experience a. Improvements in patient experience will be a byproduct of transitions of care. The belief is that once the processes are put in place and the system is improved, patient satisfaction will improve. D. 2.8 - Apply process improvement met hodology to improve quality/efficiency a. November 2012, a Lean event is scheduled to assess the level of importance tied to the specific target areas identifie d within the Transitions of Care Implementation Team. E. 2.9 - Establish/expand a patient care navigation program a. The Care Navigation Program will be impacted by the efforts associated with the transitions of care team. 808 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: In addition to UHS, Christus Santa Rosa and Guadalupe Regional Medical Center are also addressing the need for transitions of care progr ams. As projects evolve, there may be the opportunity for sharing best practices, ideas, a nd solutions across the RHP relative to CHF. Plan for Learning Collaborative: In addition to UHS, Christus Santa Rosa and Guadalupe Regional Medical Center are also addressing the need for transitions of care progr ams. As projects evolve, there may be the opportunity for sharing best practices, ideas, and solutions across the RHP. Project Valuation: Project valuation for an efficient and comprehens ive Patient Care Transition Program is defined through cost avoidance. Assuming the patients are receiving, case management support, social services support, and medically appropriate patient education, th e result should be a reduction of admissions and readmissions as well as a decrease in EC utilization. 809 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital 136141205.2.9 PASS 3 2.12.2 N/A 2.12.2 Implement a Care Transi tions Project for the CHF Population University Hospital TPI - 136141205 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 136141205.3.29 3.IT-3.2 Congestive Heart Fa ilure 30 day readmission rate Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P-X pg. 7]: Establish a baseline, in order to measure improvement over self Metric 1 [P-X.1]: Determine baseline CHF readmission data for 2011 and 2012.

It serves as the primary teaching hospital for the University of Texas Health Science Ce nter San Antonio, and the lead Level I Trauma Center and safety net provider for the estimat ed 2 million residents of Bexar County and South Texas. Over the past two decades University Health System has expanded access to primary, specialty and preventive health care services, and currently operates 19 health centers and clinics throughout Bexar County. The Texas Diabetes Institute is University Health System's specialty clinic which combines 5 centers of excellence for comprehensive diabetes education and care. Intervention(s) : Primary care physicians from 4 prim ary care Community Medicine Associate (CMA) sites at University Health System will receive specialized training under a board- certified endocrinologist for evidence-based, culturally appropriate gui delines for diabetes management and specialty care, including the us e of treatment algorithms for low to medium complicated cases, standard guidelines, etc. A diab etes nurse educator from each of these sites will maintain a constant relati onship with these patients to act as a resource for education, information, and to ensure adherence to medical advice. Need for the project : About 9.3% (1.7 million) people in Texas have been diagnosed with diabetes. In Bexar County a far gr eater percent of the population ar e affected by this disease at 11.8% (137,009). Diabetes is also the 4th leading cause of death in Bexar County. According to statistics from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance system, thos e at highest risk of developing diabetes are adults, 20 years and older, that make an annual income of less than $50,000 and have an educational attainment of a high school diploma or less. This demographic includes mostly Medicaid and Medicare and unin sured patients. The CMA patient population is comprised of 32.4% CareLink (University Health System's medical financial aid 12.6% HMO/PPO, 12.1% Me dicare, and 10.9% self pay. Target population : The target population includes all pati ents diagnosed with diabetes, roughly 12,283. The majority of patients diagnosed with diab etes live in the southern and north central areas of San Antonio. This affects the determina tion of the 4 primary care clinic sites for the project intervention. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The anticipated 5 year goal is to increase primary care encounters by 20% over baseline (or 30,000 en counters) by enhancing access to managed diabetes health care at the primary care clinic. Category 3 outcomes: IT1.10 Diabetes care: HbA1c poor Diabetes care: BP control (<140/80mm Hg), IT1.6 Cholesterol management for patients with cardiovascular c onditions (NCQA HEDIS 2012 812 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital DY4 - o Decrease Frequency of HbA1c poor control by TBD% from baseline. o Increase Frequency of BP c ontrol by TBD% from baseline. o Improvement in HDL levels by TBD% from baseline. DY5 - o Decrease Frequency of HbA1c poor control by TBD% from baseline. o Increase Frequency of BP c ontrol by TBD% from baseline. o Improvement in HDL levels by TBD% from baseline. Project Description: This project takes a two prong approach using the evidence-based Chronic Care Model at helping patients manage their diabetes through providing training of thei r primary care providers to stratify the risk of their condition and r ecommending appropriate treatment, and allowing the patient to receive all necessary care through th eir usual place of health care. The goal of this project is to empower both newly diagnosed and low to medium ri sk patients and their primary care team to successfully manage their diabetes. By establishing a relationship with their usual primary care team at their usual place of healthcare , patients are more likely to adhere to medical recommendations, which will reduce unnecessary emergency department (ED) visits and improve the overall health indicators and patient outcomes, while lowering the cost of treatment through the prevention of serious complications due to lack of effective diabetes management (Piatt et. al, 2006), (Sim inerio, et. al, 2004). The current multiple challenges include: The availability of ambulatory resources to support the needs of the predetermined population of patients with diabetes. Lack of cultural understanding of the heal th care needs and expectations of the community. Lack of infrastructure (staffing) to coordinate the care needed. Timely data to address the n eeds of the patient in order to implement interventions in a timely manner. The proposed program will address these challeng es by increasing access to specialty medicine within the confines of the prim ary care setting, enhancing the relationship between patient and primary care teams, and empowering bot h to have successful interactions. The 5 year goal is to expand comprehensive ca re for diabetes, keeping patients with their primary care team instead of shunting patients to specialty care after diagnosis, as is the current practice. The benefits to the pa tient including eliminating delays in scheduling appointments, and long wait times, while improving overall acces s to healthcare, and improvement in the management of diabetes. The project addresses th e following regional goals: Triple Aim: assuring patients receive high-quality , patient-centered care, in the most cost effective ways Further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system 813 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Improve outcomes while containing cost growth Starting Point/Baseline: As of September 30, 2011, there are 0 patients se rved by the project, 0 encounters, and 0 providers trained at these locations for base year. Rationale: In the United States, safety-net hospital systems remain essential to providing access to health services for over 50 million uninsured American s as well as other underserved populations. In the era of healthcare reform, safety-net hospi tals will remain critic al to responding to the mandate of providing medical care that is acce ssible, integrated, and patient-centered. In addition, the evidence makes clear that carefully tailo red health services inte rventions can lead to the establishment of a usual source of care, impr ove adherence to clinical care and treatment, and strengthen evidence-based clinical preventive service delivery to ec onomically vulnerable, uninsured or underinsured populations. As re ported in 2011 by the Agency for Healthcare Research, Texas ranks last in health care qua lity, specifically scoring \"weak\" on preventive measures and chronic care measures, including diabetes measures. In Bexar County 11.8% (137,009) have been diagnosed w ith diabetes, which is in vast contrast to 9.3% (1.7 million) diabetes in the state. Diabetes is also the 4 th leading cause of death in Bexar County. According to statistics from the Behavior al Risk Factor Surveillance system, those at highest risk of developing diabet es are adults, 20 years and older, that make an annual income of less than $50,000 and have an educ ational attainment of a high school diploma or less. This demographic includes Medicaid an d Medicare and uninsured patien ts. The rate of uninsured in Bexar County is 23% further highlighting the need for increased access. The CMA patient population is comprised of 32.4% CareLink (Univers ity Health System's medical financial Medicaid, 12.6% HMO/PPO, 12.1% Medicare, and 10.9% self pay. To combat these disparities and increase healthca re access, University Health System; the major safety-net hospital for South Central Texas prop oses to follow the Chronic Care Model, and expand the role of primary care providers at four patient-centered medical home sites. This is considered an integrated model of health serv ice delivery that focuses on providing high quality, affordable, accessible, and cultura lly appropriate health care alongsid e a clinical practice that is efficient, evidence-based and utilizes inter-ope rable information systems to address primary, urgent and specialty care needs. The project components are to: a) Design and implement care teams that are tailored to the patient's health care needs, which will occur through traini ng by a board-certified, culturally competent endocrinologist regard ing diabetes treatment and management, which include recommended guidelines for diabetes management, treatment algor ithm, etc, and through the establishment of a relationship with a diabetes nurse educator so that diabetes ma nagement and overall heath care can remain accessible to the newly diagnosed or moderate to low risk patient. 814 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital b) Ensure that patients can access their regular primary care teams, specifically the diabetes nurse educator, in person or by phone in the location of their usual care. c) Increase patient engagement, by having the diab etes nurse educator provide the patient with educational material regarding diet, lifestyle, adherence to medication and coordination with community resources to help the patient mainta in control over their ove rall healthcare and diabetes. d) Implement projects to empower patient s to make lifestyle changes to stay healthy and self manage their chronic conditions e) Conduct quality improvement by having the health teams meet bi-weekly to report and present any barriers, issues and lessons learned to the program manager, and other providers. These program components reflect the proj ect option's core components, a through e. This project addresses CN.2, improved manage ment of patients with chronic conditions. Specifically, the local identified need of incr eased access to chronic health management. Implementation of this program will ensure patients have access to improved management of their chronic conditions in an environment that they are familiar with, and with providers they are comfortable with. This is a change in the fl ow of usual care. Currently all diagnosed patients are referred by their primary care physician to r eceive specialty care at the Texas Diabetes Institute. Patients can be lost to care and result in low or no c ontrol of their diabetes, and other chronic illnesses because of barriers such as transportation to a more distant clinic, long wait times for an appointment, etc. Poor control over their diabetes results in unnecessary complications and visits to the ED. Measures of performance will include both proce ss and outcomes measures that assess progress towards implementation milestones. These includ e: 1) expanding the chronic care model to primary care sites, 2) integration and access (expa nded services that address target population needs), and 3) quality of care a nd cost-effectiveness. In summar y, establishing an expansion of the role of primary care providers responds to national health aims of delivering high quality care, improving population health and reducing hea lthcare costs. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): In 2010, the Texas Chronic Disease Burden Re port through the Texas Department of State Health Services established that the prevalence of diabetes in Te xas surpasses that of the nation, and accounts for $1,075,284,123 per year in total hospital ch arges, in which 53.4% of the primary source of payment came from Medicaid or Medicare. Coupled with low scores for national health quality standards for chronic care, such as diabetes care, and the prevalence of poor control of diabetes management, University Health System proposes to adopt the Chronic Care Model in the primary care setting to em power the primary care and patient team to successfully manage the patient's chronic c onditions, thus improving the patient's Zgibor, Solano, 2004), (S tellefson, Dipnarine, Stopka, 2013). Focusing on Category 3 outcomes related to primary care and ch ronic disease management, such as the levels of HbA1c, blood pressure, and LDL, and short term complication admission rates will show the level of success that patients had with the pr ogram model. By improving diabetes management, long term complications can be avoided and overall reductions in costs from prevention of complications, as has been demonstr ated throughout the literature. 815 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Relationship to other Projects: By utilizing the Chronic Care Model in the pr imary care setting, there is an opportunity to complement other projects within the RHP plan or to have other projects complement the goals and objectives of this project. 136141205.1.3- Implement and use chronic disease management registry functionalities 136141205.1.2- Expand existing primary care capacity: Un iversity Hospital expanding capacity 092414401.2.1- Apply evidence-based care management model to patients identified as having high-risk care needs: Implement Care Model for Clinic settings Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: N/A Plan for Project Valuation: In Bexar County 11.8% (137,009) have been diagnosed w ith diabetes, which is in vast contrast to 9.3% (1.7 million) diabetes in the state. Diabetes is also the 4th leading cause of death in Bexar County. In face of such high prevalence of diabet es in Bexar County, effective management is necessary to reduce the bur den of the disease and the cost of treatment of complications. Texas has failed to meet the national standards for health care quality measures re garding diabetes. This innovative, evidence-based approach will increase help meet the three part CMS aim of assuring patients receive high-quality, patient-centered ca re, in the most cost-effective ways, which translates to reducing the co sts due to unnecessary hospitali zations and the treatment of complications related to poor control of diabetes. Each project site has been chosen because of th e proximity to areas wher e the majority of UHS' diabetic population resides. 816 RHP 6 Plan March 8, University Hospital 136141205 .2.10 Replaces 16141205.2.6 2.2.1 A-E 2.2.1 Redesign the outpatient delivery system to coordinate care for patients with diabetes: University Hospital University Hospital TPI - 136141205 BP control (<140/80mm Hg) Cholesterol management for pa tients with cardiovascular conditions (NCQA HEDIS 2012) Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 P2: Train staff in the Chronic Care Model, including the essential components of a delivery system that supports highquality clinical and chronic disease care Metric [P 2.1] : Increase percent of staff trained Goal: Have 4 primary care physicians trained at 1 site by September 30, 2013.

Intervention(s) : The project will offer palliative care se rvices for patients and their families. It will emphasize the importance of comfort and quality of life for high risk patients who have late stage chronic illnesses. Need for the project : A high percentage of palliative care appropriate patients are being transferred home without hospi ce or home health care serv ices. Currently none of the neighboring hospitals in nearby countie s offer palliative care services. Target population : The target population is our high risk patients with la te stage chronic illnesses. Our hospital operates with a Medicaid inpatient utilization rate higher than 50% and a low income utilization rate al so higher than 50%. 32% percen t of the population within our service region is uninsured. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project will increase the number of palliative care discharges to hospice from the DY 3 baseline by 60 patients in DY 4 and 120 patients in DY 5. These numbers are based on approximately 2,000 tota l hospital discharges in 2012. It is has been estimated that new palliative care programs can expect to see 1% of to tal discharges and well established programs can expect to see 10% of total discharges. We have set ambitious goals of 3% of discharges by DY 4 and 6% by DY 5. A goal of a 20% improvement over DY 3 baseline scores on the patient/family experience survey fo r palliative care services has been set for DY 5. Category 3 outcomes: IT-13.4 Our goal is to reduce the pe rcentage of patients admitted to the ICU in the last 30 days of life. Percent reduction goals TBD in DY 3. Project Description: Uvalde Memorial Hospital seeks to implement a palliative care program to address patients with end of life decisions and care needs Currently, many hospice appropriate patients are being transfe rred home without care. This causes many of these patients to fr equent the ICU in their last 30 da ys of life. This is costly for the patient's family and is often not the most comf ortable, pain free way to spend the last days of life. UMH will implement a new palliative care program in DY 3 while achieving milestones in DY 2 to DY 5. First, UMH will develop a hospital- specific business case for palliative care and conduct planning activities necessary as a precurso r to implementing a palliative care program. Then we will develop an EHR/system (e.g. a rou nding tool or a registry or software) that analyzes the palliative care system data to dete rmine if the program is effective. These two steps will lay the groundwork for implementing the program. 820 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Uvalde Memorial Hospital Once the program is implemented, a record will be kept of the conditions for which palliative care is consulted (COPD, CHF, can cer, etc.). One of the goals of the program is to increase the number of palliative care disc harges to home care, hospice, or a skilled nursing facility while minimizing transfers to ICUs, hospital stays a nd home discharges without services. UMH will set the goal of 60 new palliative care discharges from the DY 3 baseline in DY 4 and 120 new palliative care discharges in DY 5. Another goal will be to increase the number of patients who are not only screened for pain during their hospice admission ev aluation and/or palliative care initial encounter but who also receive a comprehe nsive clinical assessment for pain within 24 hours of screening positive for pain. Patients a nd their families will be surveyed to measure satisfaction with the new palliative care program. Goals and Relationship to Regional Goals: Patients will receive dignified and culturally appropriate end-of-life care, which is provided for patients with terminal illnesses in a manner that pr ioritizes pain control, so cial and spiritual care, and patient/family preferences. This service will also greatly reduce re turn emergency room visits while also reducing hospital inpatient days for hospice appropria te patients. Project Goals : Increase discharges to hospice and SNF while decreasing discharges home without services Substantially decrease the rate of potentially preventable re-admissions Decrease the proportion admitted to the ICU in th e last 30 days of life (Cat. 3: IT-13.4) This project meets the following regional goals: Work together to make significant progress towards the Triple Aim goals of assuring patients receive high-quality and patient-cen tered care, in the most effective ways. Improve the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of our region. Further develop and maintain a c oordinated care delivery system. Improve outcomes while containing cost growth. The project achieves an improved infrastruc ture for Medicaid and uninsured residents through ensuring quality care for hospice or SNF care for appropriate patients who are uninsured. The project develops and maintains a coordinated care delivery system through communicating with and educating patients, families, physicians and care givers. The project improves outcomes while containing cost growth by reducing PPRs and ICU admits in the last 30 days of life. Challenges: When starting any new program such as this th ere are always challenge s, particularly with ensuring medical staff support. One of the key pi eces to this program is presenting a solid business case to the medical staff for their revi ew. Providing adequate pal liative care training to ancillaries, physicians and primary care special ties will also build suppor t for the program. This is vital to ensuring that hospice or SNF appropria te patients are given a pa lliative care consult and transferred into the care of one of these two services in our community. 5-Year Expected Outcome for Provider and Patients: This service will greatly reduce return emerge ncy room visits while also reducing hospital inpatient days for hospice appropriate patients. The patient will receive hospice care from highly trained specialists in palliative care. The patient will experience much better quality of life and 821 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Uvalde Memorial Hospital their family will receive support as well while reducing the cost care and the burden on UMH. Starting Point/Baseline: The baselines for improvement milestones, [ I-9] and [I-11], will be established in DY 3. This baseline is currently 0 or in other words, cannot be established until DY 3 because the palliative care program won't be fully implemented until this year. Process milestones associated with this project have 0 baselines, again because this program represents an new service to our community. Rationale: This project also meets the regional goals a nd community needs of RHP 6 and fills a pressing need in our community. This project option was selected because it meets the Triple Aim goals of the waiver high-quality care patient-centered care most effective care Specific project components that will address these goals and community needs are outlined below. a. Develop a business case for palliative care and conduct planning activities necessary as a precursor to implementing a palliative care program - UMH will include this component into this palliative care project by achieving [P-1]. This component is essential to the project as it will garner support from the medical staff, primary care specialties and ancillary staff. b. Transition palliative care patients from acute hospital care into home care, hospice or a skilled nursing facility - This component is the main fo cus of the project. It will be addressed by the achievement of improveme nt milestone [I-9]. This improvement milestone will increase palliative care discha rges to home care and/or hospice and/or SNF by 60 patients in DY 4 and 120 patients in DY 5. Patient transfers will depend on what makes the most sense given each patient's cond ition during the palliative care consult. c. Implement a patient/family experience sur vey regarding the quality of care, pain and symptom management, and degree of patient/family centeredness in care and improve scores over time - This component will be addressed by the project through the achievement of improvement milestone [I-12] . The goal for this project is to improve scores by 10% in DY 4 and 20% in DY 5. d. Conduct quality improvement for project using methods such as rapid cycle improvement This component will be addressed by the project through the achievement of improvement milestones [I-12] and [I-11]. Th e patient/family satisfaction survey results will give UMH valuable insight to what areas of the program require greater attention and quality improvement resources. The achievement of [I-11] targets (40% DY 4 patients, 60% of DY 5) will improve the quality of pall iative patient care while also identifying areas within pain management that w ill be improved upon throughout the project. Unique community need identificati on numbers the project addresses: 822 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Uvalde Memorial Hospital CN.1 - Texas ranks last in the nation on hea lth care quality. RHP 6 is challenged to deliver improved quality a nd patient satisfaction. CN.2 - A high prevalence of chr onic disease and rela ted health dispariti es require greater prevention efforts and improved management of patient with chronic conditions. Leading causes of death in RHP 6 include cardiova scular disease, cancer and diabetes. How the project represents a new initiative or significantly enhances an existing delivery system reform initiative: There is not currently a palliative care program in our service re gion or in any of the neighboring hospitals' service region. Th is program would complement UMH's pass 1 project, 121782003.1.1. Community health workers and an e xpanded primary care capacity will ensure regular follow up and will further promote the palliative care consults. The greatly improved communication channels between ph ysicians, care givers and patie nts/families from this pass 1 project will facilitate th e palliative care program. *This initiative, and any relate d activities, is not being funded in whole or part by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-13: Palliative Care IT-13.4 Proportion admitted to the ICU in the last 30 days of life (NQF 0213) Percentage of patients who died from cancer admitted to the ICU in the last 30 days of life (stand-alone measure) Reasons/rationale for select ing the outcome measures: These outcome domains with their associ ated improvement targets were chosen after considering the outcomes most likely to be impact ed the most by the project. These outcomes are also a priority for RHP 6 because they directly related to CN.1, and CN.2 in the RHP community needs assessment. Specifically, achieving improvement milestone [I-9] percentage improvements in discharges to hospice, SNF and other care will contribute towards the achievement of IT-13.4. Relationship to other Projects: The primary way this project supports, reinforces, enables and is related to other projects and interventions within the RHP pl an are through contribution to RH P 6 goals. However, the RHP 6 anchor facility, University Hospital, is also im plementing a palliative care program. We plan on being involved in learning colla boratives with University Hospital to facilitate discussion and improvement in palliativ e care services offere d to our community. Related Category 4 Population-focused measures. RD-2: 30-day readmissions RD 4: Patient-centered Healthcare Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: University Hospital, PA: 2.10 Plan for Learning Collaborative: UMH plans to participate in an RHP-wide le arning collaborative with other providers with similar projects. \"RHP 6 is committed to tran sforming health care in our region and throughout the state. Given the large number and value of projects proposed for our region, University Health System, as the RHP 6 anchor, will prom ote and facilitate learning collaboratives.\" 823 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Uvalde Memorial Hospital Following completion of the RHP Plan, University H ealth System will facilitate the formation of working groups of performing providers who are pursuing similar projects. These working groups will develop their learning collaborative structure which may include the following:\" -Identify participants -Establish Learning Collaborative goals -Develop a calendar of regular meetings, site visits, and/or conference calls -Develop a plan to communicate ideas, data, and successes across th e region and state -Organize a learning event and in vite experts and othe r Performing Providers from outside the region to share knowledge and best practices -Adopt metrics to measure success UMH plans to be a significant part of learning collaboratives with othe r performing providers with similar projects. Project Valuation: This project scored high in all categories used to assess projec t value to the RHP and to our community. Categories included in the valuatio n process included: project scope, achieves waiver goals, and addresses community needs and project investment. Uvalde Memorial Hospital also values each project based on the fo llowing factors: the pot ential impact on health of our population, the resources ne cessary to implement the projec t, and level of improvement anticipated in overall patient satisfaction. UM H also took into account the extent to which reducing 30 day PPRs, increasing tr ansfers to hospice care for a ppropriate patients, and reducing the number of inpatient days will have on cost. Mo st importantly, this project was valued based on its potential impact on re gional and Waiver goals. 824 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Uvalde Memorial Hospital 121782003.2.1 PASS 2 2.10.1 2.10.1 ABCD 2.10.1 - Implement a Palliative Care Program to address patients with end of life decisions and care needs Uvalde County Hospital Authority, DBA Uvalde Memorial Hospital TPI - 121782003 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 121782003.3.3 3.IT-13.4 Proportion admitted to the ICU in the last 30 days of life (NQF 0213) Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P-1]: Develop a hospital- specific business case for palliative care and conduct planning activities necessary as a precursor to implementing a palliative care program Metric 1 [ P-1.1]: Business case Baseline: 0, no palliative care business case or program currently exists at UMH or at any of the neighboring rural hospitals.

CMA serves the San Antonio area with an estimated population of 1.7 million. CMA currently has approximately 100 providers who pr actice within an ambulatory network of 19- primary, specialty and preventive health clinics located thr oughout Bexar County. Intervention(s) : This project will establish an interdisci plinary care coordination team within its ambulatory network of care. These teams will be comprised of RN case managers, social workers, and patient educators to identify and support chronic a nd other health care needs and education of patients the receiv e services at respective regiona l medical home clinics. This interdisciplinary model of care will also be tailored to addressing the health needs and preferences of the patient popul ation including appr opriately accessing use of community and organizational resources, enhancing the patien t's knowledge of the dis ease process(es), and facilitate healthy decisions to reduce risk for chronic disease a nd or disease self-management. Need for the project : The Community Needs Assessment reported that approximately 470,000 residents in RHP 6 remain unins ured (C.N.3) and the foundation for their care is dependent on the services offered by University Health Syst em. Leading causes of death in RHP 6 include cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes (C.N . 2). This project was selected because the incorporation and partnership of RN's, Social wo rkers, and patient educ ators (Care Management model) all working at the top of their skill sets can better assi st provider shortages (C.N.3) will not only improve patient outcomes, provider and patient satisfaction, but reduce hospital admissions, EC visits. Target population : The target population will include th e CMA patient population, specifically those patients dealing with 2 or more chroni c conditions (50%). CMA is comprised of 32.4% CareLink, 31.9% Medicaid, 12.6% HMO/PPO, 12.1% Medicare, and 10.9% self pay. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : This project will establish and expand a comprehensive care management program in primary care clinics in DY 2, DY 3 and DY4. This will result in improvements in clinical outcomes and reduced utilization fo r patients served under the care management model and 50 percent of eligible patients will have a documented self-management goal in the EMR by DY5. Patient be nefits from established care coordinated processes and procedures will include enhanced quality of care and patient experience. Category 3 outcomes: 3.IT-2.13 Other Admissions Rate DY4 - Decrease admission rate by TBD% for patients enrolled in care management program. 829 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Community Medicine Associates DY5 - Decrease admission rate by TBD% for patients enrolled in care management program. Project Description: Community Medicine Associates has identifi ed the need to establish and align an interdisciplinary care coordina tion team including, but not limited to RN Case Managers, Social Workers, and Patient Educators to identify and support chronic a nd other health care needs and education. This model will educate the patien t on the appropriate use of community and organizational resources, increase the patient's knowledge of the dis ease process(es), and facilitate healthy decisions. Project goals are: improved clinical outcomes, decreased hospital admission/readmissions, decreased EC utilization and incr eased patient and provider satisfa ction. The anticipated 5 years goal is 50% of patients have a documente d self management goal in the EMR. The Health System will monitor, evaluate, and adjust the project based on quality improvement activities throughout th e development and implementation phase s, offering \"lessons learned\" to our partners in RHP6 through the appropriate Learning Collaborative to be established. The project is ambitious and requires significan t coordination at several levels within the organization. Current challenges: University Health System is a large system of where coordi nation of services and patient education are prioritized due to current-st ate deficiencies, frag mentation, and silos The infrastructure and tools necessary to be tter coordinate the care needs and education of patient-specific populations need to be developed Finding the patient story in the EMR is very difficult Provider turnover has been high Access is not timely Patient engagement processes are limited There is significant variation in policies a nd procedures and workfl ow processes relative to Access and care coordination in the Ambulatory setting existing care coordination roles have different reporting relationships, and Available data is often historical rather than timely Provider turnover has been significant By addressing these needs within the RHP Plan, University Health System is placing more emphasis on a much needed model of improve d communication and care coordination in the Ambulatory arena that addresses patient level interactions and education, individually and in aggregate. Relationship to Regional Goals This project will further achievement of the regi onal goals of the Triple Aim; improved health care infrastructure to better serve Medicaid and currently uninsured residents in RHP 6; reduce 830 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Community Medicine Associates health disparities; further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system; and improve outcomes while containing cost growth. The health system will monitor, evaluate and adjust the project based on quality improve ment activities throughout the development and implementation phases. 5 Year Expected Outcome for Provider and Patients: University Health System expects to see impr ovements in clinical outcomes and in reduced utilization of the ER for patient s served under this care manageme nt model. The anticipated 5 years goal is that fifty percent of patients will have a documented self management goal in the EMR. Starting Point/Baseline: Prior to July of 2012, no patients within Universi ty Health System's Am bulatory clinics were being served under a Care Management Model. In early 2012, a Director to implement and oversee a care management model was put in pl ace. In mid 2012, University Health System hired, oriented and began piloting two Case Mana gers in two ambulatory clinics. Early active caseloads are approximately 42 patients per case manager. Four Soci al workers were pre- existing and support all of Ambulat ory with a different reporting relationship. Patient educators are dispersed throughout the Ambulat ory clinics. Discussions are just beginning to assess better alignment and the working relations hips of case managers, social workers, and patient educator roles per setting. Encoun ter data is just occurring along with accompanying software capability. The organization has prioritized Exitcare as the predominant source of patient education materials and is in the early stages of organizational implementation. Rationale: The Community Needs Assessment reported th at approximately 470,000 residents in RHP 6 remain uninsured (C.N.3) and the foundation for th eir care is dependent on the services offered by University Health System. Leading causes of death in RHP 6 include cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes (C.N. 2). This project was selected because the incorporati on and partnership of RN's, Social workers, and patient educators (Care Management model) all working at the top of their skill sets can better assist provider shortages (C.N.3) will not only improve patient outcomes, provider and patient satisfaction, but reduce hospita l admissions, EC visits. Unique community need identificatio n numbers the project addresses: CN.2 - Address the high prevalence of chronic di sease and related health disparities in the community through greater prevention efforts that focus on addressi ng chronic disease. CN.3 - Address the lack of medical and dental health serv ices in the community due to high rates of uninsured and provider shortages. This project will \"significantly enhance\" the current state by enlarging and establishing standardized processes for patien t engagement and patient care management as needed for the population served. This project a ddresses a high prevalence of chr onic disease and related health 831 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Community Medicine Associates disparities that require greater prevention effo rts and improved management of patients with chronic conditions. Ultimately, 6 of the 15 site s will have an established Care Management Program, serving 600 patients in DY3 and 900 in DY4.

Relationship to other Projects: 092414401.1.1 Expand training of the primary care workforce Training future providers in primary will assist w ith filling the need to create more access for patients and having newly trained provider s to staff additional clinical sites 092414401.2.2 Enhance/Expand Medical Homes - The PC MH is designed to increase access to primary care through the presence of a medical home model, and acce ss to specialty and preventive services offered in one locati on, in close proximity to patient homes and communities. Category 4 measures include emergency departme nt in RD-5 and patient-centered healthcare, including patient satisfaction a nd medication management in RD-4 Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: The project has multiple implications on other projects within our RHP. 136141205.1.4- Introduce, expand, or enhan ce telemedicine/telehealth o The Care Model will involve coordina ting care, educating the patient, and addressing clinical needs via multiple modes of communication to include telephonic conversations and potentia lly secure web based face to face conversations. 92414401.2.2 - Enhance/expand the medical homes o The Care Model will expand the medical home concept by offering services that would otherwise be unavailable. These services include, but are not limited to, case management, social servic es, and patient education. 136141205.2.2 - Redesign to improve patient experience o Research has proven that patient satisfac tion will increase as a result of the implementation of a Care Management Mode l. The expectation will also be to 832 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Community Medicine Associates improve provider satisfaction within our ambulatory clinics. A recent study completed with the Affinity Health System showed an increase in provider satisfaction and patient compliance. 136141205.2.4 - Establish/expand a patient care navigation program o Care Management Model is a method of navigating the patient throughout the health care continuum while simultane ously addressing chronic conditions identified by the patient's provider. There are a total of 3 organizations within RHP 6 who will address 2.2 Expand Chronic Care Management Models. As the focus of this pr oject is predominantly the adult population, there may be opportunity to share best practices and lessons learned with UTHSCSA as these projects evolve. Plan for Learning Collaborative: University Health System is very interested in sharing best pr actices, lessons learned, and other ideas to improve chronic care management models . We will participate in face-to-face meetings and/or conference calls to regularly share data related to the efficacy of various practices along with lessons learned as we implement this program. Project Valuation: Project valuation for an efficient and compre hensive Care Model was rated at the highest valuation level and is defined predominantly th rough cost avoidance. Assuming the patients are receiving, case management support, social serv ices support, and medically appropriate patient education, the result should be a reduction of admissions and readmissions as well as a decrease in EC utilization. Patient and provider satisfact ion will be improved with projected valuation, as well. This project achieves the Waiver goals by a) improving the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured resident s of the county; b) further developing and maintaining a coordinated care delivery system; c) contributing to patients' receiving high- quality, patient-centered care in th e most cost-effective way; and serving as a powerful tool to help providers improve outcomes and reduce ED utilization (containi ng cost growth). 833 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Community Medicine Associates 092414401.2.1 PASS 2 2.2.2 N/A 2.2.2 Apply evidence-based care management model to patients identified as having high-risk care needs: Implement Care Model for Clinic settings Community Medicine Associates TPI - 092414401 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 092414401.3.2 3.IT- 2.13 Other Admission Ra te (Stand-Alone Measure) 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 P-3: Develop a comprehensive care management program Metric 1 [P-3.1]: Documentation of Care Management Program.

CMA serves the San Antonio area with an estimat ed population of 1.7 million. CMA currently has approximately 100 providers who practice with in an ambulatory network of 19-primary, specialty and preventive health c linics located thr oughout Bexar County. Intervention(s) : This project will achieve Level 3 Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) recognition in order to provide improved qua lity, better access and more efficiency. Need for the project : Many patients, specifically CareLink patients, are in need of chronic disease management, care coordination, and timel y access to medical and social services. The PCMH will be built around this CareLink popula tion and has been shown to improve chronic disease management, improve quality of care, an d decrease costs associated with avoidable hospitalizations or emergency center visits (N CQA Patient-Centered Medical Home website). A major component of the PCMH model is patient self-management where patients take initiative to partner with providers to pr oactively manage their health. Target population : This is a portion of the CareLink (Bex ar County Indigent) patient population. In 2011, CareLink members averaged 4 primary car e visits per year. 32% of CareLink members were seen at least once for hypertension, 22% were seen at least once for diabetes, and 18% were seen at least once for hyperlipidemia (high ch olesterol).There were 580,234 prescriptions filled last year for CareLink members. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : This project will expand a nd re-organize primary care staff to more fully integrate elements of th e PCMH. The Health System will continue to implement and integrate core elements of the PCMH between DY3 and DY5 resulting in an 8% increase in patient encounters over base line year and NCQA/PCMH recognition by DY5. Expected benefits to the patie nt population include improved qua lity and increased access to primary care within a medical home setting. Category 3 outcomes: 3.IT-9.2 ED Appropriate Utilization DY4 - Decrease ED visits by TBD% for patie nts with COPD, behavioral health diagnoses, diabetes exacerbations , and asthma from baseline. DY5 - Decrease ED visits by TBD% for patie nts with COPD, behavioral health diagnoses, diabetes exacerbations , and asthma from baseline 837 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Community Medicine Associates Project Description: Many patients at University Health System are not identified with one provider or care team. They may be seen by different personnel at every visit and therefore their health and health care are not well coordinated. This can result in freq uent avoidable hospital stays and ED visits. The target population will include the CMA patie nt population which is comprised of 32.4% CareLink, 31.9% 12.6% HMO/PPO, 12.1% Medicare, and 10.9% pay. CareLink is a financial assistance program for uninsure d residents of Bexar County. The program was created in 1997 to help address the needs of Bexar County resident s without health care coverage who were not eligible for Medicaid or other pub lic or private funding. While CareLink is not an insurance product per se, it has many similar a dvantages in terms of promoting access to preventive health services, enc ouraging a long lasting relationship with a primary care provider, and instilling a sense of shared responsibility be tween member and staff for the member's health. Due to high utilization of health care resources and an overall need for better health coordination, CareLink members would benefit from a Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) program. In 2011, CareLink members averaged 4 primary car e visits per year. 32% of CareLink members were seen at least once for hypertension, 22% were seen at least once for diabetes, and 18% were seen at least once for hyperlipidemia (high ch olesterol).There were 580,234 prescriptions filled last year for CareLink members. The challenge will be to coordinate care for this large population while increasing quality and managing cost. There are so many touch-points where patients can access care, providing consistent, qua lity, coordinated care will challenging to implement and manage. A major component of the PCMH model is pa tient self-management where patients take initiative to partner with prov iders to proactively manage their health. Clinics will need to educate patients on va lue of self-management and encourage them to feel in control. University Health System goals include: Prep aration of a gap analysis to determine NCQA Patient Centered Medical Home readiness. Deve lop training and education for key stakeholders to the importance of NCQA certification and imp act on quality of patient care. Develop plans and processes to connect patients to a medical home. Provide ne w patients assigned to a primary care medical home an appointment to be seen wi thin 60 days of referral. By developing systems to identify and prioritize patie nts in need of medical home a ssignment, defining appropriate provider panel sizes, and criteria for prioritizing patients for medical homes, University Health System aims to have 50% of clinics using the medical home model by DY 5. The 5-year expected outcome would be to improve access utilizing innovative methods like group and telephone visits and appropriately assigni ng patients to their me dical home in order to impact costly visits to emergency rooms and potentially avoidable admissions. This achieves the following regional goals: Triple Aim: assuring patients receive high-quality and patient-centered care, in the most cost effective ways Further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system 838 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Community Medicine Associates Starting Point/Baseline: CareLink as well as established patients assigned to University Health Sy stem medical home will serve as our selected patient popul ation. Our starting point will be to pilot a primary care medical home model at one of the major primary care cl inics. New patients assigned to medical homes will receive their first appointme nt in a timely manner. Care teams will actively manage their patient panel so that patients are reminded of se rvices needed and receive coordinated care based in a primary care setting. Patients will know th e professionals on their care team and establish trusting, ongoing relationships to reinforce continuity of care. For the baseline year of October 1st, 2011 through September 30th, 2012, there were 244,382CMA primary care encounters. Primary care encounters include: CMA primary care network ( all locations that provide primary and preventive services) Rationale: In the United States, safety-net hospital systems remain essential to providing access to health services for over 50 million uninsured American s as well as other underserved populations. In the era of healthcare reform, safety-net hospi tals will remain critic al to responding to the mandate of providing medical care that is accessibl e, integrated, and patient-centered. In Bexar County, Texas, 22% of residents live at or be low the poverty level, 17% receive no medical care due to cost, and 21% have no form of health insurance coverage. In addition, assessments of health behaviors in this area reveals th at 49% of adults are physically inactive, 30% are either overweight or obese, 77% consume less than five servings of fruit or vegetables per day, and 33% have had one or more days where their mental health was poor. This project specifically addresse s community need two (CN.2) wh ich finds a high prevalence of chronic disease and related health disparities in the region which requi re greater prevention efforts and improved management of patients with chronic conditions. RHP 6 has a high rate of mortality associated with chronic conditions including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. Evidence from demonstration PCMHs shows that care fully tailored health services interventions can lead to the establishment of a usual source of care, improved adheren ce to clinical care and treatment, and strengthen evidence-based clinic al preventive service delivery to economically vulnerable, uninsured or underinsured populations. The purpose of this program is to expand establ ished patient assignment into medical homes to engage patients in a care setting where a continuo us care plan can be put in place and to ensure that they have access to services that are targ eted to their personal health needs. This will subsequently improve geographical coverage an d access to clinical and community preventive services through expansion of the patient-cente red medical home. This accountable model of care will focus on common aims, priorities, and goals to ensure that all patients receive the right care including recommended clinical preventive services, at the ri ght time, in the right setting, every time. Since CareLink members are unfunded, a nd have high prevalence of chronic disease, 839 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Community Medicine Associates unmanaged healthcare will cost billions. Implem enting the PCMH provides patients with access to care to control chronic condi tions, reduce costly inpatients or ED visits, and ultimately improve patient health and sa tisfaction. Expanding the PCMH and the delivery clinical preventive care within University Health Sy stem ambulatory facilities will improve health, health care and reduce costs. The milestones se lected for this program (e.g. P-3, P-9,P-10, I-13, I-18, and I-19) are centered on developing care team s aimed at clinical integration and access, thereby improving overall healthcare, reducing wa it times and unnecessary hospitalizations, and improving patient satisfaction. University Health System operate s University Hospital, a 496 bed full service facility, including trauma and emergency services for the region, 19 health centers and clinics providing primary care and specialty care, as well as acute care and preventive services. University Health System will coordinate care between our facilities to es tablish patient centered services. The system will expand our primary care base, inco rporate clinics using the medical home concept, and train staff on PCMH methodologies. This will open new channels of access for our community to comprehensive, managed healthcare. Implementa tion of this model ensures patients have access to a seamless system of care that focuse s on reduced wait times, timely scheduling of appointments, advanced communication and e-messagi ng with health care teams, data systems to support population health, case management, care coordination, support for patient self-care and development of performance reporting and im provement plans to measure the medical and financial impact of care delivered. Measures of performance as outlined include bo th process and outcomes measures that assess progress made towards implementation milestones including measures of clinical expansion (establishment of patient-centered medical home site) integration and ac cess (expanded services that address target population needs), quality a nd cost-effectiveness. In summary, establishing this clinical preventive mode l of care strengthens the organi zational mission and responds to national health aims of delivering high quali ty care, improving population health and reducing healthcare costs. This project addresses the following core components: a) Utilize a gap analysis to assess and m easure NCQA PCMH readiness: University Health System anticipates utilizing the NC QA PCMH criteria for accr editation to develop the PCMH at University Health System a nd measure readiness th rough the development process. b) Conduct feasibility studies to determine necessary steps to achieve NCQA PCMH status: University Health System will determine PCMH readiness and necessary steps during baseline assessment phase. Reorgani zation of staff into primary care teams (Milestone 1) is expected to occur during this time. c) Conduct educational sessions for primary care physician practice offices, hospital boards of directors, medical staff and senior leadership on the elements of PCMH, its rationale and vision: University Health System anticipates the development of an online PCMH training program, and will train PCMH personnel on concepts (Milestone 5). d) Conduct quality improvement for project using methods such as rapid cycle improvement: The University Health System will monitor, evaluate, and adjust the project based on quality improvement act ivities throughout the development and implementation phases. Because the PCMH is being piloted at a small number of sites 840 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Community Medicine Associates initially, a key focus will be on identifying \"lessons learned\" opportunities to scale the PCMH model to more sites a nd a broader patient population. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): High emergency room (ER) utilization is a consider able concern for the increasing cost of health care. Frequent and inappropria te use of hospital ERs is extremely costly and care could be provided in a less expensive setti ng. Patients, when possible, s hould be treated by their primary care provider for non-emergency conditions in orde r to promote consistent, quality care. The target population will include the CMA patie nt population which is comprised of 32.4% CareLink, 31.9% Medicaid, 12.6% HMO/PPO, 12.1% Medicare, and 10. 9% self pay. CareLink is a financial assistance program for uninsure d residents of Bexar County. The program was created in 1997 to help address the needs of Bexar County resident s without health care coverage who were not eligible for Medicaid or other pub lic or private funding. While CareLink is not an insurance product per se, it has many similar a dvantages in terms of promoting access to preventive health services, enc ouraging a long lasting relationship with a primary care provider, and instilling a sense of shared responsibility be tween member and staff for the member's health.

Plan for Learning Collaborative: This project lends itself to part icipation in learning collaborativ es as other Performing Providers in RHP6 seek to develop patient-centered primar y care services in other parts of the region for similar patient populations. Processes and tech niques developed and implemented during this project will be documented by th e project team. Successes as well as lessons learned will be shared with regional collaborators who are also working to improve primary care access and quality. Project Valuation: The project achieves the waiver goal and meets community needs by expanding primary care in a predominantly Hispanic, underserved area of Bexar County. This program strengthens healthcare linkages with local co mmunity partners, enhances acce ss to primary care and assures improved quality care services to a target populati on that struggles with poverty, receive acute or emergency healthcare services only, and do not have usual providers. In addition, many in the target population have chronic disease; with no primary care access these condition will become far more complicated and costly to treat. Access to a primary care medical home been has shown to improve health, improve heal th care, and lower care costs. 842 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Community Medicine Associates 092414401.2.2 PASS 2 2.1.1 A-D 2.1.1 - Develop, implement, and evaluate action plans to enhance/eliminate gaps in the development of various aspects of PCMH standards: Community Medicine Associates Community Medicine Associates TPI - 092414401 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 092414401.3.3 3.IT-9.2 ED Appropriate Util ization (Standalone measure) (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 P-3 Reorganize staff into primary care teams responsible for the coordination of patient care Metric 1: P-3.1 Primary care team Baseline: 0 Goal: Have all primary care staff assigned into a team from 1 primary care site.

More than 3,000 students a year train in an environment that i nvolves more than 100 affiliated hospitals, clinics and health care facilities in South Texas. Division of Community Pediatrics (CP) is a division within the Department of Pediatrics. The CP division has over 25 professiona ls, organized into multi-disciplinary teams engaged in the provision of health care, translational health car e research into the areas of respiratory and pulmonary health, research for children and fami lies living with HIV/AIDS, early child growth and development, adolescents and adolescent pr egnancy. The Department of Family Medicine provides medical care for children, adolescent an d adults. Family Medicine conducts national and regional experiments regarding the building of medical homes. Intervention(s) : Integrate and coordinate health and beha vioral health intervention/prevention as well as lung functioning tests to as sess the severity of asthma and monitor the course of project interventions. Neuropsychological assessment and interventions, for lead and asthma exposed children will be accessed to evaluate physical , neuropsychological and parental health management services. This project will implemen t lead and asthma prevention and intervention services for children and families living in hous ing identified by City and HUD officials as having environmental contamination for lead or other respiratory hazards. Approximately 1488 children and families will receive treatment for lead poison and/or asthma. Need for the project : Bexar County has the 3rd highest incidence rate for Elevated Blood Lead Levels (EBLLs) in Texas and among the worst 10 % of U.S. cities for lead exposure risk (Environmental Defense Fund, 2011). Asthma, th e most frequent chronic childhood illness affecting 12% of school-age children causes 23% of elementary school absences in Bexar County. In 2011, children in Bexar County (19,980) were screened for childhood lead, and 1000 qualified for chelation therapy. Of the 630,935 Sa n Antonio children under age 18, 45,427 have been diagnosed with asthma. Asthma, the mo st frequent chronic childhood illness affecting 12% of school-age children cause s 23% of elementary school absences in Bexar County (2011 Bexar County Community Health Assessment). Target population : The San Antonio Empowerment Z one/Enterprise Community (EZ/EC) target area represents the highest lead exposur e incidence rates, highest rates of abandoned housing, poverty, single mothers, teen births , and Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD's) within Bexar County. The EZ/EC target area has 59,732 low-income housing and 46% were built prior to 1978 and 12.8% were built prior to 1940. Approximately 22% of San Antonio's children under the age of six live within EZ/EC area and 70% of the 3-5 years of age Head Start children in the area (5447 ) in the area are Medicaid recipients . Sixty-Five percent (65%) of all house members in the EZ/EC area live below th e federally defined poverty level. Childhood blood lead level screening in 2012 identified 236 children with blood lead exposed and 120 (50.8%) had elevated blood lead levels ( 10 \u00b5g/dL). Children residing in the EZ/EC zone were 846 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA over represented for asthma hospitalizations w ith 17.76% of all asthma in San Antonio.

Community Pediatrics will provide lead and asthma education and medical consultation for children with asthma/lead for Medicaid enrolled children. Approximately 1488 Medicaid and indigent children manifesting lead/asthma symptoms, and who reside in substandard housing will receive project services. Pr oject participants will re ceive medical and wrap-around psychosocial interventions by Co mmunity Pediatrics and Family Medicine staff. Community collaboration for project sustainability will be do ne with the City of San Antonio Planning and Community Development Department and S.A. GHHI partners. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : This project will use an empirically designed evidence based program (1) Improved integrated primary and be havioral care for children with lead/asthma exposures a total of 1488 enrolled throughout the life of the project, approximately 33% of the total seen each year as follows: ( Start up recruitment and enrollment, year 2; 491, year 3; 491, year 4; 506, year 5) totaling to 1488 or 100% of the children. (See Related Categories 3 Outcome Measures chart on page 9); collaborating with local city, educational and county health agencies in implementing systems of pediatric care. The lead/asthma project aims to design and implement comprehensive healt h, environmental health and quality of life programs, for Medicaid children with asthma/lead.

Note: statistically sign ificant differences in health outcomes were observed for only symptom-free days in the last 2 weeks and caregiver quality of life score .) Category 3 outcomes: Reduction/prevention in Emergency room admission and sick days of Medicaid children with asthma/ elevated lead levels will be accomplished by: (a) primary medical intervention and preventive services to remediate environmental health problems by project staff. Collaborativ e neuropsychological assessments and environmental and psychosocial interventions will help address the medical and psychosocial needs of children and establish and sustain a City-wide program for respiratory an d lead exposed children. This an evidenced based project, and is a multi-agency and county-wide, medical, bio-psychosocial initiative. Project Description: Purpose of the Project : Implement an innovative evidenced-based disease prevention program 847 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA for children diagnosed with lead poisoning and asthma, and children with asthma to Reduce Emergency room admissions. Project Goal: (1). Reduce the severity of childhood asthma and childhood lead symptoms that c ontributes to E.R visits, (2) Decrease preventable asthma morbidity, (3) Decrease the number of emergency room visits, school absents due to sick days, and decrease number of in home sick days, (4) Improved quality of life for lead/asthma children and parents. Reduce the severity of asthma symptoms by 20%: GGHI Collaborative Board of City of San Antonio Officials, Metropo litan Health District , Housing Authority, University Hospital and UTHSCSA Commun ity Pediatrics and UTHSCSA Family Medicine will oversee and assu re successful integration of (a) weatherization and, energy efficiency interventions for pr operty remediation (b) environmental strategies to control asth ma, allergens (mold, insects, dust mites, pet dander etc) and environmental irritants (tobacco smoke, indoor/outdoor fumes, sprays/scents, (c) Primary health lead /asthma education, health knowledge assessment, lead/asthma prevention and intervention in structions and medical referrals, (d) recommendations from home environmental assessment provide by professional environmental consultants will provide home energy asse ssment, health and safety checks and Indoor air quality testing to determin e level of volatile organic compounds, allergens, mold, and formaldehyde with the part icipants home. Improve Quality of Life of participants with lead/asthma by 20%: Quality of life changes, improved patient access to c oordinate health and behavioral health care, and health literacy will be accessed by standardized parent and child health quality of life surveys, psychological te sts and pulmonary lung functioning tests results, especially from the asthma part icipants. Community Pediatrics will provide six in home education sessions to individuals with lead, lead and asthma or asthma only. Quarterly lead asthma education sessions will be offered to healthcare providers, school educators and other envi ronmental health officials. Advanced statistical methods to access the rapid cycle of improvement between health literacy, health intervention and health prevention will be used. Decrease the number of lead and or Asthma Morbidity/Severity by 15% ; UTHSCSA Community Pediat rics and Family Medici ne in conjunction with Metropolitan Health District health staff will create a process for triage, referral, remediation, health education prev ention and intervention to reduce the morbidity/severity of asthma /lead symp toms as assessed by (1) number of school absents,(2) number of parent reported sick days, and (3) number of routine hospital visits (4) episodic emergency room visits and (5) number of visits to a primary healthcare provider or school nurse. Unit cost of analysis of base line morbidity/severity variables in comparison to post intervention cost analysis will be conducted and a 15% morbidity/ severity reduction is expected. Background : Asthma is the fourth most common reas on for pediatrician office visits. Asthma affects over 1 million Texas children. The rates of asthma vary widely geographically in the county, with lower rates of dia gnosis in low SES regions of the county. The Assessment notes that the Bexar County Physical Environment, including housing, can affect chronic conditions like asthma. Texas Hispanic children are more lik ely to be hospitalized due to asthma than non- Hispanic white children. Exposures that cause airway inflam mation and trigger asthma include: 848 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA indoor irritants and allergens su ch as tobacco smoke, cockroaches, animal dander, dust mites, mold, and volatile organic chemi cals (VOCs). Frequently, these e xposures are associated with older housing stock where lead exposure may al so be a concern. Children with blood lead levels of 0.5 \u00b5g/dL may suffer disproportionately from respiratory and immunological impairments as well as neurocognitive, developmenta l and mental health deficits later in life. Medicaid and uninsured children have less access to primary health preventive services due to low Medicaid reimbursement rates for asthma that fail to promote environmental interventions that have the potential to a ddress the underlying causes of as thma. Most reimbursement goes toward medications, hospitalizati on, ER visits, with few, if any, resources directed toward reducing or eliminating contribut ory environmental exposures. Methodology: How The Project Will Be Addressed: The Departments of Pediatrics and Family and Community Medicine will partner to coordina te comprehensive lead and asthma integrated \"Primary and Behavioral health interventions and Prevention Services.\" Medicaid-enrolled children presenting with lead exposure and or asthma will be enrolled in the proposed 1115 waiver project. Community Collaborative partne rs will include the San Antonio local Housing and Urban Development Green and Healthy Home s Division and the Sa n Antonio Metropolitan District (SAMHD), who will make referrals of San Antonio children with documented elevated blood lead levels via blood scr eening and asthma for the durati on of the project. The target population will consist of 1488 clie nt's residing in San Antoni o's public housing units. Based current S.A. Housing Authority housing censu s data and on previous HUD funded lead and asthma projects (2002-2005 and 2007-2009) conducted in San Antonio, we expect each home to consist of 4 individuals, with at least one child between the ag es of 2 and 9 years, 11 months, and 29 days with diagnosed elev ated blood lead levels and/or asthma. The overall population impact therefore would allow this study to reach approximately 1,488 individuals. Baseline respiratory health will be determined by careg iver report on a respir atory health-screening instrument. Family and Community Medicine (FCM) Sc ope of Work: Asthma Environmental Assessments and Recommendations for reducing E.R. visits and in-home sick days : (A) Background, Medical, and Environmental Information: FCM will work with Pediatrics to obtain basic medical information relevant to environmental medical exposures for each child including personal exposure hist ory, total IgE, RAST tests for common allergens, blood lead levels, cotinine test, and pulmonary function te st results. (B) Environmental House Calls (EHC) : FCM will implement a series of environmental house calls in each child's home to evaluate salient residential e xposures. These inspection tools, along with the EPA Asthma Home Environment Checklist, will guide the home evaluations. A series of three house call visits per family is necessary. A minimum of two community health professionals with prior training in envir onmental house calls will conduct each home visit. During the first visit the family will receive ba sic information about asthma and accompany the EHC team on a walkthrough visit to identify poten tial concerns. Two weeks later, at the second visit, family will receive an action plan and di scuss recommended interventions environmental, housing remediation's and personal changes i.e. smoking, pet's and dust control.. The final house call will occur approximately 6 months later, to assess changes that were made in the home and changes in the child's asth ma control. (C) Assessment of EHC Intervention : Each child's medical history will be reviewed for the 849 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA following: hospital and ER records, doctor visi ts, medication requirements, days lost from school and family assessment (TRACK survey). (D) Proposed Environmental Hous e Call Intervention for Asthma: FCM will develop an intervention plan that marries environmental and medical concerns and interventions in a manner designed to complement and enhance the HUD-funded lead/asthma initiative . Homes evaluated for safety and envir onmental risk factors for children. Baseline environmental testing including CO/CO2, particulates, volatile organic compounds indoor and outdoor mold samples, and humidity will be assessed in each housing unit. Individual action plan devel oped to include: Interventions include education regarding integrated pest management (IPM), s ource control (such as removing candles; improving storage and use of cleaners), mold and relevant educati on on other allergens (cockroach, pet dander, and dust mite). Environmental assessment will be done during the 3rd (final) visit in an effort to assess the reduction of known asth ma triggers made in the unit since the initia l visit. (E) Research Team: The team will consist of experienced FCM faculty and staff from the South Texas Environmental Education and Re search (STEER) program who have conducted environmental house calls and asthma trainings for more than 15 years throughout South Texas (San Antonio, Laredo, Harlingen). FCM will provide training to FCM staff (community health workers) from San Antonio on the identification and management of indoor air asthma triggers. Pediatrics Scope of Work\u2014Medical Interven tion and Prevention: Medical Evaluation: The Pediatric Department will be responsible for the medical evalua tion of children with environmentally induced illnesses, including asthma and lead toxicity. Pediatrics will recruit Medicaid enrolled children with asthma. Pedi atrics will perform an initial medical evaluation and medical tests that may be necessary to gui de environmental inspections of each child's home (e.g., RAST testing for relevant allergens, cotinine levels). Pediatrics will then communicate these results to the EHC team. Once a home assessment has been completed, FCM/EHC will communicate concerns to the Pe diatric team. Intervention and prevention components conducted by Pediatrics will include: The Baseline Intake Information: The caregiver will complete a survey battery that includes: (1) demographi cs, (2) Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI: Derogatis), (3) Cr isis in Family Systems (4) a biomarker survey (5) Time of any lead exposure (prenatal, pos tnatal); (6) Prenatal history (m aternal alcohol use, maternal smoking, maternal drug use, infant birth weight); (7) Family history (respiratory problems, diabetes); (8) Environmental exposures (pesticide use, environmental tobacco smoke, dust, rodents, mold, etc.); and (9) Other (hygiene, nutrition, educational stim ulation, presence of developmental delays, & cultural influences). Pediatric Pulmonology : Will perform a blood draw on the child to obtain: 1) the serum levels total IgE, 2) total eosinophils, 3) Radio Allergo Sorbent Test (RAST) for household allergens, 4) cortisol level, and 5) lead level. Respirat ory health-related information will be provided to the caregiver and this information will be extended to the PCP. The caregiver will provide the venous lead test results and TR ACK standardized asthma symp tom survey results to their Primary Care Physician PCP for further follow-up. Parent Education : 1) Basic facts about 850 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA asthma, 2) Role of medications, 3) Techniques in using an inhaler/sp acer/holder chamber and how to self-monitor for asthma symptoms and 4) Environmental control measures, and 5) When and how to take rescue actions. The educati on sessions will use knowledge of home conditions reported by the EHC team to customize the educational intervention to better meet the family's needs. Educational Curriculum: In home Seven (7) session curriculum, this includes the receipt of non-toxic cleaning supplies (e.g., vine gar, baking soda). Service and Linkages: Pediatrics will provide information and referrals to community services and organizations that can assist with food, medical care, and other necessities. For instance, staff will refer participants to Medicaid or the Children's Health Insura nce Plan (CHIP) as needed. Child Psychosocial and Neuropsychological Assessment : One of the following three developmental/cognitive assessments will be ad ministered to each child based on age and language: Mullen Scale of Early Learning (Mullen, 1995) (<5 year s); the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scales of Intelligence-III (WPPSI-III; Psych. Corporation, Naglieri, 2006) (5 years; Spanish speakers). Caregivers will complete the Digit Span, Digit Coding, and Picture Completion subtests (Spanish translatio ns of instructions developed in 2009 nationally standardized) of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV (W AIS-IV: Wechsler, ecklist (CBCL) (Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001). Parental assessment for health literacy will be assessed by the Test of Functiona l Health Literacy in Adults (TOFHLA) developed and validated in the literacy of health Ca re Project (Cronbach's alpha 0.96-0.98). Within a month of testing, particip ants will receive a letter with the test results including recommendations and anticipator y guidance on developmental milestones. Effectiveness Evaluation: At the beginning of each session, the educator will document any lead- or respiratory health-relate d services reported by the partic ipant. The curriculum includes a pre- and post-lead Exposure and Asthma Triggers Knowledge Test, which will assess any changes in lead and asthma. Follow-up Assessmen ts: Baseline assessments will be repeated after three, six and twelve months. This project meets the Region 6 waiver goals for the following: Triple Aim: assuring patients receive high-quality and patien t-centered care, in the most cost effective ways Improve the healthcare infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of our counties Further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system Improved outcomes while containing cost growth We shall continually assess the quality improveme nt and project impacts, and make adjustments as necessary, share best practice and lessons learned, seize scaling opportunities to expand successful outcomes to broader populations, a nd rapidly disseminate successful outcomes to other providers across Texas. Starting Point/Baseline: 1. Number of Patients Served in Previous Depa rtment of Pediatrics Lead and Asthma Projects : In the 2004 project 325 mothers and infants ( total served 1300) were served and in the 2009-2011 project 212 ( total served 848) ch ildren and parent members were served. Percent of Providers Trained in Intervention: 100% of the Community Pediatrics Medical, 851 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Psychological and Health Navigator/Health Educat ors are fully trained. In like manner, 100% of the Family Medicine staff Medical, Environm ental health inspector s and Environmental technicians are fully trained a nd proficient in each of th eir fields of expertise. 2. Number of Patients Served in Previous Department of Family Medicine Projects. (a)National Institute of Envi ronmental Health Sciences Environmental House-call Pilot Study :( 2000-2001). Comprehensive environmental testing was performed for 15 family units (total served 60) units; (b) U.S. Housing Urban Development (2006- 2009). Healthy Homes Project Comprehensive environmental testing for 60 homes and family units (total served 240). Families reported a decrease in emergency room visits, decrease asthma severity of over the course of the year and reduction in school abse nteeism related to asthma and (c) Centers for Disease Control CDC/ATSDR Border Envir onmental Health and Toxicology Education Research Program with Texas A&M Univ. School of Rural Public Health (2009-2012). In- home asthma educational sessions for 145 low-income Hispanic families conducted. Rationale: The Integrated Primary and Behavioral Medi cal Lead Poisoning and Asthma Intervention & Prevention option was selected because asthma and lead represent tremendous health and growth and development problems, not only in Bexar County, but in the state of Te xas. Project components including all required core com ponents already secured for the successful implementation of the project in clude provider agreements, projec t protocols, recruitment and enrollment procedures, an identified target population awaiting enro llment, project staff recruitment, community and HUD collaborato rs' endorsements, and necessary hospital affiliations. This project is a new initiative, integrating innovative and preventive healthcare delivery through existing and successful colla borations and partnerships throughout the community and across federal agencies. This pr oject includes qualitativ e and quantitative data collection for biological, psychol ogical, quality of life, patien t health literacy data and environmental health quantitative outcome data. This project addr esses care for children with asthma and childhood lead poisoning--which re present major health disparities in our community. The unique community need identifica tion numbers the project addresses: CN.4 There is a shortage of high quality mental and behavioral health services that are integrated with physical health care servic es and/or provide cr isis stabilization. CN.1 The need to deliver improved lead and asthma health care compliance, quality of life and literacy. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): The rationale for selecting Primary Care Behavi oral Health for lead exposed and asthmatic children. 1. Asthma is a chronic health problem for childre n and is the leading cause of hospital visits for children. In like manner, lead poison is a high pr iority concern for children in South Texas. 2. Reports from the Texas Department of Stat e Health Services and San Antonio 2011 Needs Assessment, document these health problems and health disparities among impoverished 852 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA children. 3. The 2011 Centers for Disease Control a nd Prevention health advisory committee recommends primary care and home based care in conjunction with preventive education. Relationship to other Projects: Project Support, Reinforces and Enables other Project Interventions. The proposed \"The Integrated Primary and Behavioral Medical Lead Poisoning and Asthma Intervention & Prevention\" is commensurate with the HUD-f unded San Antonio Green and Health Homes funding and the UTHSC Family Medicine and Pedi atrics environmental health comprehensive services research agenda... Asthma is a majo r problem that affects neurological, endocrine logical, psychological and psycho- educational and overall growth and development of children and especially poor and minority children. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: The Departments of Family and Community Medi cine and Pediatrics (D ivision of Community Pediatrics) are not aware of any UTHSCSA or community providers that are submitting Lead and Asthma or other environmen tal health related research. Plan for Learning Collaborative: Plan for participating in a RH P-wide learning collaborative: Community Pediatrics and Family Medicine submitted research grants in 2005 and 2011 to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in orde r to address the Lead poison and Asthma health care problem in children. We were funded in the 2005 application. Currently, Community Pediatrics is servi ng as a consultant to the 2011 San Antonio Green and Healthy Homes Initiative (S.A GHHI) and through collaboration with the city. Community Pediatrics and Family Medicine will develop a research ag enda to continue Lead and Asthma research. Project Valuation: Project Evaluation will include a cost analysis. A database will be designed to tract the number of clients served, types of servi ces received and quantitative as-w ell-as qualitative measure will be collected. A power analysis will be conducted to find the number of clients needed to find significant changes in E.R. visits. Chi-square tests, t-tests, and analyses of variance (ANOVA) will be conducted to compare differences betw een the dependent variable with respect to number and types of encounters/interventions. Univariate ANOVAs will be used to assess whether the independent variables used had significant main effect s on test scores and also to determine whether an interaction effect o ccurred between the Inde pendent Variable and Dependent Measures. A regressi on analysis for each dependent measure will identify demographic and psychosocial variab les as covariates in subsequent hypothesis testing of E.R visits. Associations between the demographic cova riates (age, gender, an d ethnicity), treatment use covariates (e.g. age of first use of any medication and age of first asthma), and the independent and dependent variables will be examined using Pearson correlation coefficients, t- tests, and ANOVAs. The Wilks' la mbda statistic will assess the proportion of error and of the effect variance/covariance in the dependent variables unaccounted for by the independent variables. Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) and Multivariate Analysis of 853 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Covariance (MANCOVA) will be us ed to test the relationship between Independent variables and the dependent measures while controlling fo r age, treatment history and other variables such as; ethnicity, and gender. Cost Benefit Analysis: In a study referencing the economic value of home-based, multi-trigger, multi-component interventions with an environmental focus for reducing asthma, Nurmagambetov et al. (2011) found that for ever y dollar spent on the inte rvention, the monetary value of the resulting benefits, such as averted medical costs or averted productivity losses was $5.30-$14.00 (the benefit-cost ratio). Each a dditional symptom-free-day had a cost- effectiveness ratio between $12-$57.Cloutier et al. (2009) found that with an asthma management program that reduces asthma-related h ealth services utilization there is a potential $3.58 return on investment per each US dolla r spent for Medicaid managed care plans. 854 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 085144601.2.1 PASS 1 2.7.6 NA 2.7.6 Implement innovative evidence based strategies to significantly reduce and prevent lead poisoning and asthma in children and adolescents by targeting environmental aspects of children's health (TEACH) University of Texas Health Scienc e Center at San Antonio TPI - 085144601 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 085144601.3.18 IT-9.3 Pediatric / Young Adult Asth ma Emergency Department Visits Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P-X] Recruit and train all project staff to implement an innovative evidence based client and health systems level interventions/prevention program.

It extends to campuses in the metropolitan border communities of Laredo and the Rio Grande Valley. More than 3,000 students a year train in an environment that i nvolves more than 100 affiliated hospitals, clinics and health care facilities in South Texas. Intervention(s) : The project will place master's leve l behavioral care managers (BCM) in primary pediatric clinics to work with childre n with ADHD and comorbid psychiatric conditions (depression, aggression), providing behavioral an d family therapy. The BCM will consult with child psychiatrists who in turn will assist pe diatricians with psychopharmacology when needed. The BCM's and child psychiatrists will provide crisis counseling as well. Need for the project : Currently child in pediatric primar y care with ADHD may wait months for an appointment with mental health professional or child psychiatrists, untreated i llness often leads to severe crises which result in hospitalization and increased medical costs. Target population : In December 2011, there were approximately 1400 served in the primary care pediatric clinics and 3000 served in pediatric specialty clinics of the University of Texas Health Center Health Science Center (UTHSCA). Rou ghly 50% of these childre n (n =2200) would be in the age of risk for ADHD (> 3 years) on epid emiological data, 10% of these children would meet criteria for ADHD (n = 200). Approximately 10 of these would have severe conditions requiring psychiatric ho spitalization or involvement of the police each month . Thus 80-120 per year might require such a level of intervention. This population is enti rely indigent/Medicaid eligible. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : Perform 200 visits/month with children with ADHD and severe comorbid disorders in the PROXIMA program. This will involve up to 1200 unique patients per year. Number of patient s per DY: DY2:300, DY3:800, DY4:1200, DY5:1200 Category 3 outcomes: 50% reduction is baseline rate of psychiatric hospitalization (80-120 admissions per year) of children wi th ADHD and severe comorbidity. Project Description: PROXIMA (Primary Care Optimization for Excelle nce in Interventions Managing ADHD) is an integrated mental and physical health program for children with ADHD and related disorders. Master level mental health provide rs will be placed in pr imary and specialty care clinics of the Pediatrics Dept. of UTHSCSA. These Behavioral Care Managers (BCM) will conduct assessments with children with suspecte d ADHD, integrate diagnostic information from home and school, provide psyc hoeducation about ADHD as well as behavior management 859 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA regarding not ADHD but aggression, mood regula tion and sleep. A child and adolescent psychiatrist (CAP) will consult with both the BH C and the PCP. The CAP will guide the PCP in the use of expanded psychopharmacology for co mplex cases of ADHD, reducing need for specialty referral and psychiatric hospitalization. Since CAP residents and pediatric residents currently train in isolation from each other, PROXIMA will fund time for residents of both specialties to do joint rotations to en hance consulting and communication skills. This project meets the Region 6 waiver goals for the following: Triple Aim: assuring patients receive high-quality and patien t-centered care, in the most cost effective ways Improve the healthcare infrastructure to bett er serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of our counties Further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system Improved outcomes while containing cost growth In order to pursue quality improvement we sh all continually assess th e project's impact and make adjustments as necessary, share best practice and lessons learned, seize scaling opportunities to expand successful outcomes to broader populations, and rapidly disseminate successful outcomes to other providers across Texas. Starting Point/Baseline: In December 2011, there were approximately 1400 se rved in the primary care pediatric clinics and 3000 served in pediatric specialty clinics of the University of Texas Health Center Health Science Center (UTHSCA). Roughly 50% of these children (n =2200) would be in the age of risk for ADHD (> 3 years) on epidemiological data , 10% of these children would meet criteria for ADHD (n = 200). Approximately 10 of thes e would have severe conditions requiring psychiatric hospitalization or invol vement of the police. Thus 80-120 per year might require such a level of intervention. Rationale: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity di sorder (ADHD) affects 6-9% of school-age youth in the U.S., and is the most prevalent psychiatric disord er among preadolescents. ADHD's adverse impact on learning, self-control, and personal safety ar e well-established. The large subgroup with comorbid disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs) also incurs the disadvantages of persistent antagonistic behavior, such as embittered fa mily relations and social exclusion. Beyond childhood, ADHD raises the incidence or severity of many mental health problems, especially those distinguished by poor impulse control (e .g., antisocial behavior, affective dysregulation, and substance abuse). The challenges of working with this population is a high no show rate for mental health care (25-30% in UTHSCSA child psychiatry clinics and a tendency toward coming to appointments only in a crisis). There is a stigma around seeking mental health care. PROXIMA will implement and evaluate a co llaborative-care model (for ADHD within primary pediatric services). This addresse s the challenge by providi ng care in a setting comfortable to families and that is readily acces sible. The five year outcome will be reduced need for hospitalization and improved psychosoc ial functioning as assessed by standardized measures. Improved outcome for children with ADHD with integrated care has been shown by numerous studies (http://www.skipproject.org/ ) 860 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Unique Community Need-Mental Health Among Youth. At present, about 40% of Bexar County's population is under the age of 21 or 640,000 individuals. (pg 9 of Community Health Assessment, CHA). Given that up to 10% of these individuals have ADHD and 14% \"seriously considered suicide (these are likely overlapping populations), this means more than 60,000 youth are at risk. Only 1501 received state mental health services (Figure 277, CHA) and while many others received care in the privat e sector, many low income youth with ADHD and other comorbid conditions have gone untreated, Overview of PROXIMA. While PROXMIA is a new program for the Performing Provider, the Divisions of Child Psychiatry and Pediatrics have recently completed a four year state wide project, Services Uniting Pediatrics and Psychiatry Outreaching to Texas (SUPPORT) which placed Master level mental health pract itioners in primary ca re settings. SUPPORT showed that after six months, participants show ed significant improvement in ratings of quality of life and behavioral/emotional functioning. PROXMIA will provide a Behavioral Care Manager (BCM), supervised by a child psychiat rist, who supports primary care physicians in assessment and optimized management of ADHD. The BCM will be a licensed master's level mental health professional. BCMs' roles incl ude family psychoeducation, treatment planning, and frequent outcome measurements, decision- support for a data-driven medication algorithm, psychosocial therapies, assiduous patient follo w-up, and supporting families' engagement with treatment. By early intervention with children with ADHD in the primary care setting, we hope to limit negative outcomes such as psychi atric hospitalization a nd antisocial behavior which often leads to involvement in the juvenile justice system . Eligible children are 5-15 years-old who ar e (a) referred from primary care clinicians (PCPs) for suspected ADHD, both with and wi thout concurrent aggression, conduct or mood disorders. PROXIMA will occur in the primary and sp ecialty (chronic care) clinics of the Department of Pediatrics of the UTHSCSA. Up to five BCM's will be employed, in each of the high volume pediatric clinics in Sa n Antonio. These clinics routin ely refer out 5-10 individuals a week with ADHD and related conditions, most of these end up on waiting lists in local mental health agencies. PROXIMA will allow immedi ate intervention in the primary care setting. The BCM meets with the project team's child psychiatrist for weekly supervision. In the primary care setting, the BCM is part of the prac tice's team. Each prac tice also has a liaison pediatrician who participates in monthly project reviews with the study team and ensures smooth implementation at the pediatric site. Prior to meeting with a family allocated to PROXMIA , the BCM reviews the assessment information with the site's psychiatrist and the RC. Preliminary suggestions for initial management are proposed for subsequent review by the family and PCP, with attention to factors that may disfavor the first-line medication and behavioral interven tion approaches (e.g., stimulant intolerance, tics, factors that may warrant modifying behavi oral therapy). When needed for diagnosis or treatment planning, othe r information will be identified and obtained. The BCM discusses the family's chief concerns , and offers a summary of the history from review of the evaluation, inviti ng parents to clarify and elabor ate. The role of ADHD as a contributor to the child's difficulties will be in troduced, along with factors/comorbidities as indicated. Parents' ratings of ADHD and ot her behavioral symptoms will usually be a good starting point. The BCM will use and give families printed and video materials (available in English and Spanish) from the AAP ADHD Toolkit , AACAP, and other sources from the 861 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA common library we establish. Families' treatmen t preferences, attitudes toward medications, and pressures they experience from extended fa mily members around their child's needs are discussed. The BCM helps parents to record sp ecific questions about risks and benefits of medications to ask the PCP. The BCM acquain ts parents with the main outcome monitoring tools, described next, and the importance of th e information they yiel d to gauge progress. Child psychiatrists will cons ult on the selecting the part icular stimulant and dosing strategy for a particular child. The BHC will assist the physicians by obtaining rating scales from the parent and school. After stimulant optimi zation steps, not all children will experience sufficient amelioration of symptoms. We distinguish between significant residual difficulties that are chiefly core symptoms of ADHD, for which additional medications will be familiar to PCPs, and those that reflect comorbid probl ems such as aggression, anxiety, and mood disturbances, for which more di rect care by a child psychiatric specialist is indicated. In consultation with the psychiatrist, we anticipate that PCPs will typically initiate alternate or adjunctive medication when the chief con cern is persistence of ADHD symptoms. Symptoms of ADHD and comorbid problems th at persist beyond these initial steps often warrant treatments beyond the comfort zone of most PCPs. While always an option, we anticipate common scenarios for assessment by the team's psychiatrist. (a) Related disruptive behavior symptoms, such as aggression, temper dyscontrol, or conduct problems that often improve with ADHD treatment, but nonetheless re main to a detrimental extent, may require pharmacotherapy or more intensive behavioral interventions. (b) A nxiety and mood problems may require more specific treatment. (c) Poor tolerance for pharmacotherapy or atypical responses to it may compel dia gnostic reconsideration. Most evidence-based psychosocial treat ments for youngsters with ADHD focus on associated conduct problems, such as difficulties w ith rule-adherence, complying with directions, managing frustration and anger, etc. The core of the behavioral treatmen ts are: 1) introduction and goal setting; 2) increasing positive interactions with th e child, noticing and rewarding cooperative behavior and self-cont ainment when frustrated, and st ructuring the environment and routines to avert problem behavior; 3) tools to maintain parental co mposure in the face of difficult behavior, including judi cious ignoring of low-level misb ehaviors to avoid unnecessary conflicts and inadvertent reinforcem ent via attention; 4) tools to help parents communicate to the child directions and other limits on behavior that hitherto resulted in combative reactions; 5) implementation of a system to provide behavior al monitoring, clarity of expectations and consequence to reward cooperati on and improved frustration tolera nce; 6) implementation of a similar school behavioral program in consultatio n with teachers; 7) interventions for handling uncooperative and dyscontrolled behavior. PROJECT COMPONENTS: (A) We have identified sites (University Health System [UHS Pediatric Clinics, affiliated with UTHSCSA) to be involved in the program. (B) As UHS is a primary teaching hospital for UTHSCSA, agreements can be efficiently negotiated. (C) Establish protocols and processes for comm unication, data sharing, and referral between behavioral and physical health providers. (D) Pediatricians in the Community Medicine Associates of UHS and UTHSCSA Dept of Pediatrics (faculty and residents) w ill be recruited to participate. (E) Train physical and behavioral health providers in protocol s, effective communication and 862 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA team approach. Build a shared culture of treatment to include specific protocols and methods of information sharing that include: Regular consultative meetings betwee n physical health and behavioral health practitioners; Case conferences on an individualized as n eeded basis to discuss individuals served by both types of practitioners; and/or Shared treatment plans co-develop ed by both physical health and behavioral health practitioners. (F) We will develop agreements to access Electr onic Health Record (EHR) data from UHS (Sunrise) as well as develop a method to tr ack hospitalization via Medicaid claims. (G) Since UHS and UTHSCSA are already health care partners, legal issues are not anticipated to be significant in terms of limiting collaboration. (H) All utilities/building services are in place. (I) We will develop a web based tool to track progress using standardized mental health symptom rating scales. (J) We will regularly conduct Quality Improvement to identify challenges and barriers to working with this population or th at prevent true collaboration. CN.4 This project addresses the need for high quality mental and behavioral health services that are integrated with physical health care serv ices and/or provide cr isis stabilization. CN.1, This project addresses the need for impr oved health care quality in our community. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): Psychiatric hospitalizations of children with ADHD and complex comorbidities (aggression, mood disorder) have risen dramatically in Te xas and nationwide. These admissions occur in crisis and rarely result in long term outpatient care to consolid ate any gains. Thus, there is often little long term bene fit despite high costs. PROXIMA will seek to reduce potentially pr eventable admissions (PPA, OD-2) through provision of integrated mental/ physical health services. Process Milestones for Outcome: Milestone 1 will be to engage stakeholders (pediatricians, community) to ensure PROXIMA program meets the challenges these families present. Milestone 2 will establish the baseline rate of psychiatric hospitalization. This is a customized milestone critical to accurate assessment of our Improvement Target. Milestone 3 will be to test data collection procedures, while Milestone 4 will be to conduct Plan Do Study Act (PDSA) . We choose reduced hos pitalization as our Improvement Target due to the high cost of hospitalizati on and the lack of evidence that acute hospitalization improves long term functioning. Relationship to other Projects: It will be key for the PROXIMA pr oject to be integrated with othe r child health providers in the region, as well as schools. Children in this population are likely to have variety of neurodevelopmental (autism spectru m and learning disorder) and soci al issues that will need intervention outside the primary care clinic. Wh en children do need hospi talization, coordination of treatment planning and follow up services will be integrated to prevent gaps in care. A project related to PROXIMA is TEACH (Targeting Envi ronmental Aspects of Children's Health - 2.15.2), which also integrates primary care and be havioral health for ch ildren with a team approach to care. 863 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: None of the other projects are proposing an integr ated primary and behavioral health system for children, though one other project (UTHSCSA, 2.15.1) will do so in adults. This project, along with the two projects mentioned above (Clar ity, CHCS) will be included in a learning collaborative. Plan for Learning Collaborative: A weekly phone conference will focus on identify ing patients shared by the providers and addressing the challenge of obtaining permission form parent to share children's data amongst the providers. The Dept of Psychiatry develope d a web-based simple data base as part of an earlier practice to track data across practices. Information from the BHC's on patients' will be used to identify common barrier s to continuity of care and fo llow through. This information will be rapidly disseminated to all sites and a webina r based brain storming session will carried out to propose ways of dealing with these barriers. Pilot projects will be launched and the results (i.e., reduction in drop-out from treatment) disseminated to sites. Quarterly in person meeting will be held amongst the partners. Families will be asked if they wish to speak of their experience in PROXIMA, with quotes of successful outcomes di sseminated each week to encourage staff of PROXIMA to preserve in their efforts. Succe ssful interventions will be mandated in all the practices using PROXIMA. Project Valuation: In 1982 Satterfield and colleagues reported an 8 year follow up of 110 boys with ADHD (mean age 17). 58% of low income boys with ADHD ha d a conviction for a serious offense compared to 11% of low income boys without ADHD. Wh ile children are never admitted to a psychiatric facility for symptoms of ADHD alone, 1 in 5 ch ildren with ADHD have severe comorbidity such as mood disorder or severe aggression which lead s to dangerous behavior to self or others. Incarceration in a juvenile justice facility may cost $100 per day, such that long term costs may be in excess of $40,000 per year. A typical psyc hiatric hospitalization may cost $1,000 per day for 5-10 days (~$7,500). In the baseline data we noted that 10 youth per month need inpatient care. Assuming 80 youth per year from our sample needing institutional care of some sort, the cost of caring for this cohort would be: 20 youth in long term juvenile care: $800,000 per year 20 youth with short term juvenile detention stays: $90,000 per year 40 youth with 1.5 psych admissions per year $450,000 per year Total: $1,340,000 per year Other costs of under treated ADHD are increased special education services, demands on the juvenile courts for truancy can be estimated to be about $260,000 per year for the entire cohort. Thus our population would account for $1.6 milli on in costs per year, or $6.4 million over 4 years. The total cost of PROXIMA would be $4 m illion for all four years, a significant savings. 864 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 085144601.2.2 PASS 1 2.15.1 2.15.1 (A, C, E) 2.15.1 Design, implement, and evaluate projects that provide integrated primary and Behavi oral health care services: PROXIMA (Primary Care Opti mization for Excellence in Interventions Managing ADHD) University of Texas Health Scienc e Center at San Antonio TPI - 0855144601 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 085144601.3.19 3.IT-2.4 Behavioral health/s ubstance abuse admission rate (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P-2] Identify existing clinics/community based settings (UTHSCSA primary care, private practice) where integration could be supported.

Velligan Ph.D. Pedro Delgado M.D. Performing Provider TPI: 085144601 Project Summary: Provider Description : The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio serves San Antonio and the 50,000 square-mile area of South Texas. It exte nds to campuses in the metropolitan border communities of Laredo and the Rio Grande Valley. More than 3,000 students a year train in an environment that involves more than 100 affiliated hospitals, clinics and hea lth care facilities in South Texas. Intervention(s) : The project provides evidence-based tran sitional care for indi viduals discharged from psychiatric units or diverted from emergenc y rooms. Interventions to be delivered include cognitive behavior therapy (a tr eatment focused on correcting erro rs in attribution and thinking in an effort to improve outcomes in depression, anxiety and psychosis); cognitive adaptation training (a home based treatment using environmental supports such as signs, alarms, checklists, pill containers to promote medication adherenc e and improve community functioning); family psychoeducation and care coordination (designed to link patients to appr opriate options for care in the community for longer term follow up). A uni que feature of this prog ram is that it provides interprofessional training in these evidence-base d approaches for social workers, nurses, and case workers to improve workforce developmen t as well as community behavioral health training for prescribing professionals-- physic ians, advance practice nurses and physician assistants. Need for the project : There is a severe shortage of ment al health providers in Bexar county coupled with reduced availability of services fo r the most seriously mentally ill- overwhelming existing health care systems, dram atically increasing the use of emergency services and leaving the most vulnerable in our society with inadequate or no mental health care options. This project increases service availability and delivery and develops the workforce for multiple disciplines for work with the seriously mentally ill. Target population : Seriously mentally ill being discharged from inpatient psychiatry units or diverted from emergency services. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : Enroll and provide eviden ce-based services for over 4600 individuals in the immediate pos t-discharge/diversion period wi th average number of wrap around visits=4 per individual prior and ensuring connection with longer-t erm services in the community. Training a minimum of 40 new providers (10 per year) in application EBPs for the seriously mentally ill using an inter-professional treatment model that is easily replicable throughout Texas. Category 3 outcomes: Our goal is to reduce the potential ly preventable all-cause readmission 867 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA rate within in 1 year by 20% in DY4 and 30% in DY5. Project Description: The costs of serious mental illness (SMI) are $317 billion annually, or more than $1,000/year for every man, woman, and child in the U.S. Th e 2010 Community Health Assessment of Bexar County found that 32% of residents have no us ual source of health care. For those who do, transportation issues and cost issues, including un derinsurance, often lead to a delay in seeking care. Other barriers include a l ack of knowledge of community serv ices, lack of access to those services and a lack of locali zed services. According to a 2011 report by Capitol Healthcare Planning, a severe shortage of mental health providers in the area coupled with reduced availability of services for the most seriously ill have combined to overwhelm existing health care systems and leave the most vulnerable in our society with inadequate or no mental health care options. This situation has le d to a dramatic increase in th e use of emergency services by patients who have not been able to obtain timel y appointments in community agencies or have no other place to go for help. Even when resources exist, mental health providers are frequently not available. To address these needs the Depart ment of Psychiatry has developed a Transitional Care Clinic (TCC) designed to give patients ra pid access to a prescriber upon hospital discharge or diversion from emergency departments (ED) and provide gap services and linkage to community services for a period of up to 90 days . The TCC also functions as a specialty training program in community psychiatry training residents and nurse pr actitioners with the goal of increasing the number of providers in the underser ved South Texas area. Ho wever, in addition to medication, the patients coming out of emergency departments and psychiatric units need access to rapid wrap around care includ ing prescription medications, speci alized behavior therapies, psychosocial rehabilitation, skills training, transportation and case ma nagement. Those patients who are deemed \"priority population\" including t hose with psychosis and bipolar I disorders can eventually qualify for wrap-around services through the local mental health authority, but cannot qualify to receive these services until they have completed the required Texas assessment (TRAG). These patients are essentially \"unfunded \" until they can be assessed and assigned to a clinic which may take a number of months. They are left vuln erable to relapse and readmission in the critical days immediately following discha rge/diversion. Many other patients with recent suicide attempts, severe anxiety or depressi on, are not priority popul ation and will remain unfunded for services until a solution is found. The cr itical period post discha rge or diversion is a period in which aggressive wrap around services can prevent de terioration and readmission. The Transitional Care Clinic (TCC) began providing gap services including medication management, case management, skills traini ng, and psychotherapy in an innovative inter professional setting on 4/2/12. Currently, ther e are over 200 active patients in the 90 day program funded by a private foundation grant. No federal money funds the TCC. The majority of patients have no health care benefits upon ad mission. The TCC provides comprehensive wrap around transitional services including; cognitive behavior therapy (a treatment focused on correcting errors in attr ibution and thinking in an effort to improve outcomes in depression, anxiety and psychosis); cogni tive adaptation training (a home based treatment using environmental supports such as signs, alarms, ch ecklists, pill containers to promote medication adherence and improve community functioning); family psychoeducation and care coordination (designed to link patients to appr opriate options for care in the community for longer term follow up). Patients are connected for follow up at the Center for Health Care Services, FQHCs, the University Health System outpatient clinic, UT HSCSA psychiatry clinic , other MHMR clinic's outside the county or private prov iders. A unique feature of this program is that it provides 868 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA interprofessional training in these evidence-base d approaches for social workers, nurses, and case workers to improve workforce developmen t as well as community behavioral health training for prescribing professionals-- physic ians, advance practice nurses and physician assistants. Our Division of Schiz ophrenia and Related Disorders is a world-leader in developing and testing EBPs for the SMI population. The TCC will provide critically needed services and increase the number of providers trained in th is model. The program will develop a referral mechanism accessible on a secure internet site to be used by all local hospital emergency rooms and inpatient psychiatric units in the Bexar county area, allowing for rapid assessment of need and triage to most appropriate type of servi ce. An Outreach Coordinator serves as a liaison between referral sites and the TCC as well as from TCC to community resources. Evidence from a pilot study with Superior Medi care found that our wrap around se rvices cut hospitalizations for frequent service utilizers in half and saved more than $20,000 per patient in 9 months. Wrap around services immediately following hospital admission or emergency room contact, can prevent a return to these cos tly services. In a community where 32% of the population has no usual source of care and little knowledge of community resour ces, a program that provides multiple EBPs and links individuals at their most vulnerable point to community resources will assist in decreasing the \"stacki ng\" of behavioral health problem s in emergency rooms and ease access to emergency care for truly emergent patients. Quality: To achieve continuous quality improvement we shall assess the projects impact and make adjustments as necessary using a PDSA approach. We will share best practice and lessons learned, seize scaling opportunities to expand successful outcomes to broader populations, and rapidly disseminate successful outcome s to other providers across Texas. Region 6 goals: This project achieves CMS's Triple aim objectives of assuring patients receive high quality and patient centered care, in the most cost effectiv e way, improves the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsur ed residents of the counties we serve, further develops and maintains a coordinated care de livery system and improves outcomes while containing costs. Starting Point/Baseline: Prior to 2012 no services of this type were availa ble. Zero encounters were being made and zero physicians, physician assistants, ad vance practice nurses, or soci al worker, psychology or case coordination trainees were receivi ng training in EBPs for SMI at th is location. At the University Hospital, readmissions within 30 days for the same quarter in the year before the opening of the TCC were 54 out of every 1000. Readmissions within 72 hours were 37 per 1000. Rationale: A program that is adaptable, aligned with pa tient needs and provides wrap around service and EBPs within their community offers a unique op portunity to continually adapt practices to improve health in a vulnerable and difficult to tr eat population. The project will allow expansion of the TCC to serve greater numbers of patients in need. An issue identified in the 2010 Bexar County Community Health Assessment, as well as every other assessment over the past 2 decades is the lack of mental health care worker s and services for individu als in crisis. Creating 869 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA an inter-professional training clinic has the added advantage of addressing the severe shortage of mental health providers in the area. Trainees ex posed to our rapid PDSA cycle learn to be more agile in responding to patient a nd community needs and are more likely to translate what they have learned to other work settings with similar populations, ther eby addressing potential behavioral issues early on before they reach crisis proportions. Patients served, individuals trained and PPAs are clear, objec tive methods to measure the outco me. This project is already funded in a limited fashion through a Methodist Healthcare Ministries grant. Early experiences have allowed us to define new challenges and to better target this request to meet those challenges. In particular, issues of transpor tation, providing medication for indigent patients, creating a living data base of community resources, providing short term EBPs and ensuring linkage to community resour ces will be addressed. Our community has defined crowding of emergency rooms by people seeking behavioral health treatment to be a major issue. Use of a scarce resource not only increases wait time for all patients, but also adversely effects patients w ith urgent medical needs that need emergency treatment. Deflecting access to care issues from emergency centers to a transitional program and decreasing readmissions to EDs due to inability to provide follow up care will directly impact this issue of \"stacking\" and addr ess a major community concern. At this time, the Local Mental Health Authorit y offers a wrap-around service to patients who present to their Crisis Care Clinic. That pr ogram has diverted these individuals from the emergency room. However, the CCC does not impact those who already use the emergency room as their access point to hea lth care. In addition, patients utilizing CCC continue to utilize (and be referred by the CCC to) the emergency de partment whenever substance use or co-morbid medical conditions are involved. Currently there is no care coor dination between the Emergency Department and referrals. CN.1 Enhance quality by deliver ing care in the right setting CN.4 Provide mental health serv ices to at risk populations Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): Rehospitalization- Hospitalization is the single most costly intervention for individuals with behavioral health diagnoses a nd preventing readmission and ED di versions is a primary goal of the community. The TCC will achieve this goal by providing rapid access to care and multiple EBPs including medication management, Cogni tive Adaptation Training, Cognitive Behavior Therapy, and Case coordination. Focusing on PPAs will allow rapid and evidence-based treatment in the community where individuals ha ve maximal independence and costs of care are lower. Relationship to other Projects: This project will directly reinfo rce others that aim to support holistic patient care within the community. Other projects being submitted from our department will create a substance use disorder clinic and training progr am that will specifically address co-morbid substance use and mental health. Together, addressing these issues in the period of increased vulnerability a person experiences post hospitalization or post crisis, these projects will have a direct impact on recurrent hospitalization and emergency room vis its leading to a decrease in the crowding and \"stacking\" of behavioral health patients in emergency departments. 870 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: This project will directly reinfo rce others that aim to support ho listic patient care and wellness within the community. Several other projects in the region plan to establish post-discharge support for behavioral health/s ubstance abuse as well as deve loping innovation for provider training and capacity. These providers include the Center for Health Care Services and University Health System. Th e current project builds on a pre-existing grant that has already begun to realize both of those goals. As these providers already have a relationship, this would be an ideal nidus for a Learning Community to sh are what we have already learned and translate it to other areas of the RHP that have not submitted similar projects. Other projects being submitted from our department will create a substance use disorder clinic and training program that will specifically address the complicated i ssues of mental illness with co-morbid substance use. Together, addressing these issues in the period of increased vulnerability a person experiences post hospitalization or post crisis, these projects will have a direct impact on recurrent hospitalization and emergency room vis its leading to a decrease in the crowding and \"stacking\" of behavioral health pati ents in emergency departments. Plan for Learning Collaborative: Following completion of the RHP Plan, University H ealth System will facilitate the formation of working groups of performing providers who ar e pursuing similar projects. These working groups will develop their learning collaborative structure which will identify participants, establish Learning Collaborative goals, develop a calendar of meetings, visits and or calls, develop a plan to communicate ideas, data a nd successes across the region and state, adopt metrics to measure success and may organize a learning event to share knowledge and best practices. We anticipate playing a large role in such a community as we have already faced some of the challenges related to connecting wi th and supporting individu als after a behavioral health crisis and ED or hospital visit. Project Valuation: Within the 5 years of this project, we will 1) deliver wrap-around services to at least 3600 individuals in the immediate post-discharge/d iversion period with av erage number of wrap around visits=4 per individual prior to ensure connection with longer-te rm services in the community 2) develop, deploy and maintain a we b-based system to be used by all referring hospitals and emergency departments. We a expect 80% of all referrals to be web based, with an estimated 35 patients referred daily by the end of the waiver period. 3) Train over 40 providers in application EBPs for the seriou sly mentally ill using an inter-p rofessional treatment model that is easily replicable throughout Texas. This pr oject will not only impact access to care within Bexar County, but will train 10 providers yearly in an evidence based inter professional treatment model that is easily replicable throughout Texas. As described above, lack of knowledge of community programs and economic f actors combine to foster use of high level services in emergency departme nts, particularly among those w ithout access to general health care. Patients with severe mental illness who are seen and dismissed from emergency departments often lack ability to connect to so cial supports revisit the emergency department whenever a perceived need arises. Furtherm ore, care coordination after hospitalization is generally insufficient to ensure connection to community suppor ts. Over the period of the waiver, at least 40 new providers will be trained to ensure that these needs are met in the community in a timely fashion to prevent emerge ncy department visits. They, in turn can replicate this program in communities a ll over the region and the state. An estimated 35 patients daily will ultimat ely be referred via the web based referral system 871 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA by the end of the waiver period. This immediate referral and initiation of care coordination to over 3600 patients will decrease re- hospitalization within 1 year fo r behavioral health issues by two-thirds over 4 years which not only represents a major cost savings, but also an increase in access to scarce hospital beds. Si milarly, immediate referral will have a major impact on 72 hour behavioral health readmission to the emergency department. Combined increase in capacity and rapidity of access to care after a crisis or hospitalization decompresses hospital and emergency services a nd spawns a shift from high acuity, expensive care to community based prevention and care. Re-hospitalization and emergency room revisit rates from Major Hinchman 2010 study yield th e cost lack of care coordination between inpatient/ED and outpatient settings as well as of the delay in accessing care. This was coupled with the anticipated cost of developing and maintaining a web-based tool. Milestone 1,4,7,11 : Each new prescribing psychiatric APN and PA entering the community to provide services yearly will in crease capacity by approximately 350 patients/caseload. This creates a decrease on the crisis and emergency se rvices as well as decompressing the caseloads in primary care. Social workers and LPCs tr ained in EBP case-management practices for the seriously mentally ill will increase the availabi lity of localized community based behavioral health services. This is the most difficult mile stone to value as a many of these services are prevention based in agencies that are not stric tly mental health, but work with families and youth. Milestone 2,5,8, 12 : Re-hospitalization and emergency room revisit rates from Major Hinchman 2010 study yield the cost lack of care coordina tion between inpatient/ED and outpatient settings as well as of the delay in accessing care. This was coupled with the anticipated cost of developing a nd maintaining a web-based tool. Milestone 3,6,9,13 : Valuation is estimated using the 2011 Community Assessmen t percentage of individuals in Bexar County who do not have a usual source of care and are pr esumed to visit crisis clinics or emergency rooms for behavioral healthcare needs including detox and othe r substance related issues and domestic crises. Improvement Milestone 10,14: Valuation is estimated based upon costs of a typical psychiatric admissi on ($8100) per stay. 872 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 085144601.2.3 PASS N/A 2.13.2 Implement other eviden ce based project: Provide an intervention for a targeted behavioral health population to prevent unnecessary use of services in an innovative manner.

It extends to campuses in the metropolitan border communities of Laredo and the Rio Grande Valley. UTHSCSA clinics serve a large number of Medicaid and uninsured patients. More than 3,000 students a year train in an environment that involves more than 100 affiliated hospitals, cl inics and health care facilities in South Texas. Intervention(s) : The project will implement specific Chronic Care Model activities within the practice, including a comprehensive care manageme nt plan, adopting evidence-based protocols, implementing patient self-management plans for chronic conditions, nurse-care management and medical group visits. Need for the project : The practice's patient population has high levels of poorly controlled chronic diseases, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and others. Barriers to better performance include a patient population with seve re socioeconomic disadvantage needing more support, combined with a deliver y system that has not yet implemented a comprehensive care management plan for these patients. The Chroni c Care Model is an evidence based mechanism for organizing effective car e and improving outcomes. Target population: The practice serves a largely Latino disadvantaged urban population, 50% of whom are uninsured patients r eceiving care through a county assi stance plan, 15% on Medicaid, and 4% self pay. Chronic disease prevalence is high and control poor; for example diabetes prevalence in the patient panel is 35%, with 1 in 4 of those having glycosylated hemoglobin values greater than 9%. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project seeks to enroll 50 patients in medical group visits in Year 3, 75 in year 4 and 100 in Year 5. For the self-management plan, we expect to enroll 75 in Year 3, 150 in Year 4 and 250 in Year 5. For the care model and protocols, we plan to have 200 patients receive care under the m odel in Year 3, 400 in Year 4 and 600 in Year 5. Category 3 outcomes: IT 1.10 The project seeks to reduce the proportion of adult patients with diabetes who have glycosylated hemoglobin >9%. Starting at a baseline of 25%, the goal is to reach 22.5% in Year 4 and 17.5% in Year 5. Project Description: The project goal is to implement patient manage ment consistent with the Chronic Care Model (CCM) in a large safety net primary care practic e. The practice serves a vulnerable patient population with high burdens of chronic disease and socioecono mic disadvantage. Although the practice has made recent progre ss in reconfiguring its system s (see below under \"baseline\") 876 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA limited resources have prevented the hiring of suffi cient personnel with the right training to more fully implement elements of the CCM. Specifi cally, there has been a need for nurse care managers, medical assistants in numbers sufficient to allow for registry activities or delegation of standing orders, and community health workers (CHW ) to help patients navigate the system and activate community health workers. As a resu lt, patients do not have access to nurse care management, medical assistants remain fixed in traditional roles taking vital signs and rooming patients, and a small CHW pilot was just comp leted (the CHW component is described in a related project 2.9.2). But the pract ice still lacks evidence-based protocols for most chronic disease management (opioid management is an exception), does not assess its performance on population-based process or outcome metrics for outpa tient care, and has lit tle internal capacity for patient self-management support. This project will address those challenges throug h a systematic process from comprehensive care planning, through hiring and training of necessary personnel, to im plementation of specific CCM activities. The specific plans are as follows: A practice improvement team with representation from practice leadership, physicians, mid-level practitioners, nurses, medical assistants, a nd front office will meet weekly to plan a comprehensive care management program. \"Compr ehensive\" means considering all domains of the CCM including health system, delivery sy stem design, information systems, decision support, patient self-management support, and mobilizing community resources. CCM training for new and existing staff will be developed from resources made available by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the American Academy of Fa mily Physicians, TEAMcare, Agency for Healthcare Research and Qu ality, and other sources. A critical component of the proj ect is the use of health system utilization and EHR data to identify patients for coordinated care manageme nt. This proactive risk assessment will focus resources on identifying patients with clinical parameters for hype rtension and diabetes that are above recommended therapeutic goals, as well as patients with poor follow-up histories. Effort will be devoted in the first 2 project years to developing and testing these queries and reports. To focus the team's activities, members of the improvement team will develop evidence-based clinical protocols for the 2 mo st common DSRIP Category 3 diagnos es of chronic disease in our practice: type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The protocols will consider best practices for clinician management, disseminating guideline s, patient engagement, tracking outcomes, protocols for self-management support by a nur se care manager, care coordination, and connecting with community resources. A self-management program based on the work of Lorig (Ann Beh Med 2003;26:1) and others will be created from available resources, with speci al attention to approaches appropriate for our patients' culture and health l iteracy (Lorig et al, Nurs Re s 2003;52:361). In addition, we will conduct group medical visits. Ou r implementation of this concept will assemble high-risk patients (identified by no or inc onsistent visits for chronic care, poor control of diabetes or hypertension, sentinel health events such as hosp italization or ER visits for the two conditions, or nomination by clinicians) for stru ctured interactions with a te am including physicians, nurses, care-manager, pharmacist, social worker, and community health worker. Multidisciplinary assessment in this setting allows the team to efficiently evaluate patients' needs while 877 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA coordinating efforts across disciplines. Additional personnel to be hire d for this project include: Year 1 - Nurse Care Manager Year 2 - 1 additional Nurse Care Manager; 3 additional Medical Assistants Year 3 - 1 additional Medical Assistant We will address all 5 required core project components under Project 2.2.1: a) We will design and implement care teams that are tailored to the patient's health care needs, including non physician health professionals, such as pharmacists doing medication care managers providing care outside of the clinic setting via phone, email, and home visits; and navigators (in the linked project) helping patients successfully engage with the health care system . b) Ensure that patients can access their care teams in person or by phone or email. We are now tracking appointment access time and have de veloped protocols for telephone access and monitoring of call line performance. c) Increase patient engagement. The projec t addresses patient education, group visits, selfmanagement support, improved patient provider communication techniques, and coordination with community resources. d) Through self-management education by the nurse care manager (and community health workers in the linked project) we will create mechan isms to empower patients to make lifestyle changes to stay healthy and self manage their chronic conditions. e) Quality improvement for project is built in with specific performance goals specifying methods such as rapid cycle improvement. The expected major 5-year outcome for this pr oject is improved care processes for diabetes, better disease control, and improved health outcomes, measur ed by reductions in patients with uncontrolled hyperglycemia (HbA1c >9%). Region 6 RHP Goal: To achieve continuous quality improvement we shall assess the project's impact and make adjustments as necessary, share best practice a nd lessons learned, seize scaling opportunities to expand successful outcomes to broader populat ions, and rapidly disseminate successful outcomes to other prov iders across Texas. Quality: This project achieves CMS's Triple aim objectives of assuring patients receive high quality and patient centered care, in the most cost effectiv e way, improves the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsur ed residents of the counties we serve, further develops and maintains a coordinated care de livery system and improves outcomes while containing costs. 878 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Starting Point/Baseline: Our Family Health Center clinic cares fo r approximately 17,000 unduplicated patients (2010-11 data) over a two-year period, the majority ( 75%) of which are enrolled in Bexar County's CareLink program for uninsured resi dents or Medicaid/dual eligible. In the past 5 years, the FHC has successfully implemented a number of practice improvements, including open access for children and improved access for adults; improvements in telephone and refill systems, and small CCM pilots under HRSA training grants. An important initial condition for project success is that senior mana gement is heavily committed to and engaged in practice improvement. The department Chair, th e Vice Chair for Clinical Services, and the practice Medical Director actively pa rticipate on the improvement team. However, limited resources have prevented the hiring of sufficient pers onnel with the right training to more fully implement elements of the CCM. Specifically, there has been a need for nurse care managers, medical assistants in numbers sufficient to allow for registry activities or delegation of standing orders, and community hea lth workers (CHW) to help patients navigate the system and activate community health workers. As a result, patients do not have access to nurse care management, medical assistants remain fixed in traditional role s taking vital signs and rooming patients, and a small CH W pilot was just completed (the CHW component is described in a related project). But the practice still l acks evidence-based protocols for most chronic disease management (opioid management is an exception), does not assess its performance on population-based process or outcome metrics for outpa tient care, and has lit tle internal capacity for patient self-management support. Our baseline for glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values >9% for patients with at least one measurement in the calendar year is 25%. Rationale: As noted in the 2010 Community Health Assessmen t, Bexar County, and especially its poor and underserved minority residents, face high rates of common chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular dise ase, obesity, and cancer. Specifi cally, Bexar County, TX had a diabetes prevalence among adults >18 y/o of 13.5% in 2006-07; the median among other communities sampled by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System was 7.6% (MMWR Surveillance Summaries September 24, 2010 / 59( SS08);1-37). In that same dataset the proportion of Bexar County respondents with diabetes mellitus who reported at least 2 glycosylated hemoglobin measurements in the pa st year was 65.5% vs. 66.3% as the nationwide median. For hypertension, the Bexar County a dult prevalence in 2007 was 28.1% with a U.S. county median of 27.4% (MMWR Surveillance Su mmaries February 5, 2010 / Vol. 59 / No. SS- 1). Providing effective chronic care management to this population will improve the quality and effectiveness of care, leading to reductions in preventable morbidity and mortality. This project specifically addre sses the \"poor health care quality\" and \"high rates of chronic disease\" indicators listed in the community needs document. The rationale for our overall approach using the CCM as a guide is supported by ample evidence that the CCM is an effective framework for primary care interventions (Bodenheimer et al, JAMA 2002 Pt.2). Yet outcome improvements do not necessarily follow process improvements based on the CCM (Chin et al, Diabetes Care 2004; Landon et al, NEJM 2007). Several analyses 879 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA of the reason for this dissociation have concluded that successful interventions are more likely to have addressed multiple CCM domains, in particular both professional performance and its organizational context (Renders et al, Diabetes Care 2001; Cole man et al Health Affairs 2009). Therefore in this project we seek to significantly alter the organizational context, aiming for a system centered on multidisciplinary collabora tion and proactive popul ation management. The rationale for selecting the milestones bega n with the premise that comprehensive care management planning was necessary to address all aspects of the chronic care model in a setting where such comprehensive assessment has neve r occurred. We will accomplish this through carefully planning a CCM approach at the project's start, using a collaborative, inclusive process that involves all job titles in our center. The working plan will specify new roles, collaborations, and team-based accountability for process and imp rovement milestones. This initial work is essential to achieving the cr itical CCM component of health care organization that is built on a foundation of leadership and staff engage ment (Bodenheimer et al, JAMA 2002 Pt.1). Delivery system design is addressed through reduc ing reliance on physicians fo r certain tasks such as standing orders in prevention/chronic disease ma nagement - these will be assumed by MA's - while adding new roles such as nurse care ma nagers and community health workers who can assist with supporting patient self-management and linkage to community resources and partners . Decision support will be built in by creating evidence-based protocols for stepped management of diabetes and hypertension, while information systems will provide essential feedback on performance. The process milestones below were selected to create a logical fl ow from planning, to developing an overall CCM approach, deve loping specific elemen A nn Fam Med 2006;4:317). The Category 2 milestones focus on program development, staff training, and ongoing improvement, while specifying the number of patients who will receive care under the different CCM components. We are not aware of any projec ts at UTHSCSA funded by the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services that serve a similar pur pose to this proposed project. CN. 2 Project meets need for improved mana gement of patients w ith chronic conditions Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): The selected Category 3 outcome milestones addr ess process and improvement milestones. The process milestones set specific goals for planning, testing data syst ems, and establishing baseline rates that will support the improvement milestones. We specify two improvement milestones: IT 1.10 HbA1c poor control (>9%). We chose this milestone because our system-wide assessments reveal that the prevalence of poor diabetes control is high in our population. For example, in the year from mid-2010 to mid-2011, 4,867 of 17,705 patients (27.5%) with a measured HbA1c had values over 9%. The proporti on for patients having more than one reading 880 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA was 24.5%. Also, there are persistent disparities in control of di abetes by socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity (McWilliams et al, Ann Int Med 2009;150:505) that require special attention to the needs of vulnerable populations. Relationship to other Projects: This project relates to \"Community health worker program to addr ess health and social needs in a vulnerable population.\" (Unique RHP ID#: 08514460-2.9.2). The projects are mutually supportive. The proactive assessmen t of the patient panel employed in this project will identify high-morbidity patients likely to benefit fr om health system navigation and enhanced connections to community resources. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Other providers and projects w ith the same project area: CHOSA - 2.2 - Asthma Program. University Health System - 2.2 - Expand chronic care models. Plan for Learning Collaborative: Following completion of the RHP Plan, University H ealth System will facilitate the formation of working groups of performing providers who are pursuing similar projects. These working groups will develop their learning collaborative structure which may include the following: Identify participants Establish Learning Co llaborative goals Develop a calendar of regular meetings, site visits, and/or conference calls Develop a plan to communicate ideas, data , and successes across th e region and state Organize a learning event and in vite experts and other Perfor ming Providers from outside the region to share knowledge and best practices Adopt metrics to measure success University Health System will seek to provide facilitation and administrative assistance as needed to ensure the success of these endeavor s. The RHP 6 website wi ll be available to the Learning Collaboratives to netw ork and share ideas, challeng es, and success stories with colleagues. RHP 6 hopes to make significant tran sformational progress on its project milestones to achieve waiver goals and share what we learn with the rest of the State. Project Valuation: Achieves waiver goals: The pr oject directly addresses waiver goals, with its Triple Aim objectives, improvement of health ca re infrastructure at a safety net clinic where more than 75% of patients are uninsured or on Medicaid. The CCM approach will created a coordinated care system that is consistent with other models for which there is strong evidence of improved outcomes while reducing costs 10-30% (Nie lsen, PCPCC 2012; Gr umbach, PCPCC 2010). Addresses community needs: The project direc tly addresses the high prevalence of poorly controlled diabetes and other chr onic diseases in the community. Impact on better disease control should be significant,{Nielsen:2012wt} though public health approaches are necessary to reduce 881 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA incidence of common chronic diseases. Project Scope - the project is implemented in a safety net clinic with 17,000 unduplicated patients seen over a two-year period. The pane l has a high prevalence of diabetes with many patients not meeting standards for control. Project Investment - The expected investment in human resources and time to implement is relatively small. Capital investments are minima l. Gaining experience with implementations of the chronic care model and population management in primary care is important for University Health System in the era of A ccountable Care Organizations. 882 RHP 6 Plan March 085144601.2.4 PASS 1 2.2.1 2.2.1 A-E 2.2.1 REDESIGN THE OUTPATIENT DELIVERY SYSTEM TO COORDINATE CARE FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC DISEASES University of Texas Health Scienc e Center at San Antonio TPI - 085144601 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 085144601.3.21 poor 9/30/2013) 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 P-3 - Develop a comprehensive care management program Metric 1 : Documentation of a care management program based on Wagner's Chronic Care Model Baseline/Goal: Baseline of no plan documented to goal of approved care management plan Data Source: Program Materials including approved care management plan.

It extends to campuses in the metropolitan border communitie s of Laredo and the Rio Grande Valley. UTHSCSA clinics serve a large number of Medicaid and uninsu red patients. More than 3,000 students a year train in an environment that i nvolves more than 100 affiliated hospitals, clinics and health care facilities in South Texas. Intervention(s) : The project will implement a patient na vigator program linked to a primary care safety net clinic to improve diabetes outcomes. Community health workers will engage high-risk patients, identified by glycosylated hemoglobi n values greater than 9%, through home and community-based interventions to address barriers to successful interaction with the health system and self-management. Need for the project : The region has a prevalence of diabet es well above the national average. The practice's patient population has high levels of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. Barriers to better control include patients' difficulty navigating a complex health system, difficulty adhering to treatment because of low healthy literacy, and social stresses in the home and community that impede clinical success. Patient navigation is an evidence-based mechanism to help disadvantaged minority commun ities successfully engage in th e health system as well as to promote health in patients' community settings. Target population : The practice serves a largely Latino disadvantaged urban population, 50% of whom are uninsured patients r eceiving care through a county assi stance plan, 15% on Medicaid, and 4% self pay. Diabetes prevalence in the pa tient panel is 30%, with 1 in 4 of those having glycosylated hemoglobin values greater than 9%. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project seeks to document 120 unique patients with community health worker visits in Y ear 3, 360 in Year 4, and 360 in Year 5 for a cumulative total of 840 high-risk pa tients reached over th e three years. A secondary goal is to reduce emergency room visits and hospital ad missions for patients seen by the CHWs. Category 3 outcomes: IT 1.10 The project seeks to reduce the proportion of adult patients with diabetes who have glycosylated hemoglobin >9%. Starting at a baseline of 25%, the goal is to reach 22.5% in Year 4 and 17.5% in Year 5. 886 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Project Description: The goal of this project is to implement a pa tient navigator program linked to a primary care safety net clinic to improve diabetes outcome s. The practice serves a vulnerable patient population with high burdens of ch ronic disease and socioeconomic disadvantage. In this setting, where social determinants of health create high barriers to successful pa tient self-management, CHWs are trusted natural helpers who enhance their community's wellbeing by responding to problematic situations. They also understand how people make decisi ons in real life, and they act as brokers between health professionals and th eir patients. CHWs role in this project will encompass a set of the following core functions in community-based development of basic skills necessary to produce health. We have develope d training and practice models for these core functions in two pilot projects, now completed, funded by our county health system (Ferrer et al, J Am Board Fam Med, 2013 in press). a. Promoting healing relationships with the h ealth care team, meaning that CHW will assist patients in navigating health care visits a nd procedures, assess patients sense-making of messages from health care providers and c ounsel patients on effective communication and agenda-setting for c linical visits. b. Reinforcing clinical messages as directed by the clinical team, promoting adherence with prescribed therapies. c. Problem solving for family, social, and economic issues that may impede clinical success. d. RN-Care Manager and CHW will coordinate th eir plans in twice-monthly discussions of patients in active management. The RN-CM a nd CHW interaction is intended to optimize problem solving for 5 cross-cutting issues in chronic disease management: healthy lifestyles, treatment adherence, behavioral illness, literacy /health literacy, and socio-environmental factors. e. CHWs will teach community-based health ed ucation sessions, in areas where there are concentrations of high-risk pati ents. We have recently begun ge ocoding our patient addresses to identify such concentrations. f. CHWs will promote connections with community resources relevant to patients' needs. In our pilot project, CHWs have been creating asset maps in their communities. The project option selected is 2.9.2, \"implement ot her evidence-based project to establish/expand a patient care navigation program in an i nnovative manner.\" Our use of CHWs focuses on employing them to enhance not just access to care but also to extend the primary care team into patients' homes and communities to improve chronic disease management for vulnerable patients. The CHWs we will employ will have been cer tified as community health workers through a recognized training program. The skill level we are targeting is trained peer educators from the neighborhoods where our patient population resides. The project plan includes hiring and training 6 FTE CHWs in year one and an additional 6 FTE in year two. We have developed training curr icula and materials in our pilot project. Subsequently, the CHW services will be deployed using EHR data that identifies patients with poor diabetes control (A1c>9%). Additional triggering events will include hospitalizations and emergency room visits for diabetes, poor attendan ce at primary care visits for diabetes follow-up. Clinicians will also be able to make referrals to CHWs when they suspect social issues are creating important barriers to successful medical management. 887 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA CHWs will meet weekly with our project impr ovement team to develop systems linking them closely with other team members in our chroni c care model. Based on their interactions with patients, CHWs will be able to activate nurse car e managers, pharmacists, or physicians if they observe specific needs during patient home assess ments. In return, those healthcare professionals will be able to request that the CHWs make specific observations of adherence to care, medication use, and self-management strategies in the home environment. These meetings will also promote QI for the CHW program, as particip ants create, plan, and re view short-cycle tests of proposed improvements. CHW services will be tracked through structured reports of CHW activities. To help guide their work with a patient-centered focus, CHWs will a ssess patients' goals related to functional status and track their progress. They will also record specific process measures such as healthcare visits facilitated, appointments made, community resource referrals, a nd assistance with maintaining health care coverage. In addition to examining CHWs' program records, we will be tracking outcomes by examining monthly reports of glycemic control, emerge ncy department and hospital admissions for our practice cohort. The expected 5-year outcome is a community -based CHW project that effectively links vulnerable patients to health care while also addr essing patients' social n eeds in the context of family and community. These processes will lead to improved control of diabetes as measured by HbA1c levels. Improved diabetes control is expected to reduce diabetes complications, improve quality of life, and decrease health care costs. Region 6 RHP Goal: To achieve continuous quality improvement we shall assess the projects impact and make adjustments as necessary, share best practice a nd lessons learned, seize scaling opportunities to expand successful outcomes to broader populat ions, and rapidly disseminate successful outcomes to other prov iders across Texas. Quality: This project achieves CMS's Triple aim objectives of assuring patients receive high quality and patient centered care, in the most cost effectiv e way, improves the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsur ed residents of the counties we serve, further develops and maintains a coordinated care de livery system and improves outcomes while containing costs. Starting Point/Baseline: Our Family Health Center clinic cares fo r approximately 17,000 unduplicated patients (2010-11 data) over a two-year period, the majority ( 75%) of which are enrolled in Bexar County's CareLink program for uninsured resi dents or Medicaid/dual eligible. A small pilot from 2/1/12 to 1/31/13 of community health workers visiting high-utilizing socially vulnerable patients has just ende d, funded by the Bexar County Hospital district. At the time of writing, approximately 60 patients were being followed by CHWs. The pilot was targeted at high-utilizers, regardless of diagnosis, and thus differs in targeting and scope from the proposed 888 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA project here. Our baseline for glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values >9% for patients with at least one measurement in the calendar year is 25%. At presen t, a report like this can be generated only as a \"one-off\" so we will need to develop a monthly reporting system during our first project year. Our baseline for emergency room visits and hospitalizations among our patient cohort with diabetes and HbA1c>9% will be determined in year 1 of the project. Rationale: As noted in the 2010 Community Health Assessmen t, Bexar County, and especially its poor and underserved minority residents, face high rates of common chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular dise ase, obesity, and cancer. Specifi cally, Bexar County, TX had a diabetes prevalence among adults >18 y/o of 13.5% in 2006-07; the median among other communities sampled by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System was 7.6% (MMWR Surveillance Summaries September 24, 2010 / 59( SS08);1-37). In that same dataset the proportion of respondents with diabetes mellitu s who reported at least 2 glycosylated hemoglobin measurements in the past year wa s 65.5% vs. 66.3% as the nationwide median. Our Category 3 improvement target and valuation is based on the following considerations: there is strong evidence that moving patients from poor to fair or good glycemic control (a) reduces diabetes complications such as coronary dise ase, stroke, and renal failure; (b) decreases hospitalizations, and health care costs, and (c) improves patients ' quality of life. This evidence is briefly summarized and quantified below. In recent years, data from UKPD S and other studies have led to a reconsideration of the utility and safety of aggressive glucose ta rgets in type 2 diabetes. Our goal in this project is therefore to reduce the prevalence of markedly abnormal glycemic control, wh ich we define as HBA1c >9%. Ample evidence documents the micro- and macro-vascular morbidity associated with uncontrolled diabetes. For example, persons with diabetes in a community-based cohort study (Atherosclerotic Risk in Comm unities) in the highest HbA1c quintile (A1c>8.2%) had a 2.8 fold increased risk of coronary heart disease events (on a baseline of 14.4%) compared with those in the lowest quintile (Selvin et al, Arch Int Med 2005). In a secondary analysis of data from the HOPE study, a randomized drug trial, a 1% rise in the HbA1c level was associated with a 7% increase in the risk of cardiovascular events, a 20% increase in the risk of hospitalization for heart failure, a 12% increase in total mortal ity risk, and a 26% increase in risk of overt nephropathy. Risks increased nonlinearly, with steep er increases in patients in the top 2 deciles of A1c (A1c >8.9%)(Gerstein, Diabetologia 2005 ). An observational Fallon Clinic showed poor glycemic control (A1c >10%) was associated with a high risk of hospitalization -- 31 per 100 per year, twice that of patients with fa ir control (A1c 8-10%). Mean adjusted hospital charges were also twi ce as high ($3040 vs. $1380/year; in 1998 dollars) (Menzin et al, Diabetes Care 2001). A larger follow-up study from 2010 in the same system confirmed the findings: annual costs for diab etes-related hospitaliza exceeded 10% (Menzin et al, J Managed Care Pharm 2010). And the Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound, found that reductions in HbA1c from a mean of 10% were associated with annual savings of $680-950 (in 1997 dollars). (Wagner et al, JAMA 2001). 889 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Improved glycemic control also improves quality of life. A randomized trial of intensified glycemic control (from mean Hb A1c of 9.3% to 7.5%) examining patients' functional outcomes, such as quality of life, work participation, bed- days, and restricted activ ity days, demonstrated substantial improvements in a wide range of QOL and activity measures (Testa, JAMA 2008). The evidence base supporting this CHW in tervention derives from a variety of CCM interventions that are being ad apted for low-income populations (e.g. Epping-Jordan et al, Qual Saf Health Care 2004;13:299-305; Lo rig et al, Nurs Res 2003;52:361) . In many of these models, CHWs collaborate closely with nurse care managers to deliver assessment and education in the home setting when patients have barriers limiting travel to the health center. In this project the CHW role encompasses 3 mo dels of care defined in the Community Health Worker National Workforce Study (HRSA 2007): memb er of care delivery team, navigator, and organizer. These models, which the report noted we re not mutually exclusiv e, consist of working under the direction of clinicians (physicians or nu rses), helping patients navigate complex health systems, and working in communities to pr omote self-directed change and community development (HRSA 2007). Providing community health worker navigati on to this population will enhance patients' connections to effective care, help identify and addr ess obstacles to self-management in the home and community environment, and provide im portant feedback loops with clinicians about patients' understanding and adherence to disease management. It will enhance the quality and effectiveness of care, leading to improvements in clinical outcomes. (Bro wnstein et al, J Ambul Care Mgmt 2011;34:210; Balcazar et al, Prev Chr J Prev 2007;32:435; Gabbay et al, Jt Comm J on Qual Pt Safety 2011). This project specifically addresse s the \"high rates of chronic disease\" indicators listed in the community needs document. It also addresse s disparities due to socioeconomic status. The process milestones for CHW's unique patients served were estimated at follows. Our CHW model calls for assessments and teaching in th e patients' homes so as to provide data on contextual influences such as neighborhood sett ing for diet and physical activity, or family situations that interfere with self-management. We therefore estimate each CHW will make 1 visit per \u00bd day or 8 visits per week (with1 day/ week for meeting with clinical team and QI activities) x 45 wks (3 weeks of training/year an d 2 weeks vacation) or 360 visits per year per FTE. Conservatively estimating 6 visits per year per unique patient to allow for both assessment and self-management training, each CHW FTE will manage 60 unique patients per year. We allow for 50% capacity in the first year after hire. With 6 CHW hired in year 1 and 6 additional CHW hired in year 2, the target numbers for uni que patients served in years 3/4/5 are thus 180/540/720. The process milestones for community-based classe s were based on data we developed this year showing that 6 ZIP codes around our health center contain many of our high-risk, high utilizing patients. Holding 12 classes in a year will therefore allow us to reach each of those ZIP codes twice. Expanding to 18 classes will permit outreach in an additional 3 ZIP codes. We are not aware of any projec ts at UTHSCSA funded by the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human 890 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Services that serve a similar pur pose to this proposed project. CN.2 This project meets the community need for improved management of Diabetes. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): We will hire and train 6 FTE promotoras in disease self-management (using the Lorig self- management curriculum in each of the first 2 project years; we have certified trainers on staff) and other elements of the chroni c care model, map community asse ts relevant to chronic disease management The selected Category 3 outcome measure is IT 1.10 HbA1c poor control (>9%). We chose this measure because our system-wide assessments reveal that the prevalence of poor diabetes control is high in our population. Fo r example, in the year from mid-2010 to mid-2011, 4,867 of 17,705 patients (27.5%) with a measured HbA1c had valu es over 9%. The proportion for patients having more than one reading was 24.5%. Al so, there are persistent disparit ies in control of diabetes by socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity (M cWilliams et al, Ann Int Med 2009;150:505) that require special attention to th e needs of vulnerable populations . In our low-income population with poor health care access, we anticipate th at improved connections through community health workers to effective care and self-management support will decrease th e proportion of patients with poorly controlled diabetes (Balcazar et al , Prev Chron Dis 2009;6:1) . The other rationale for this measure is that poorly controlled diabet es mellitus creates high risk for the complications (myocardial infarction, stroke, ne phropathy, blindness) that account for the human suffering and high costs of this disease (Elly et al, Diab Med 2008). Please see the data reviewed in \"Rationale\" above for details. The targets for IT-1.10 are as follows: The achie vable change in % of patients with HbA1c >9% is determined by three factors: (a) how many prac tice patients have HbA1c >9%, (b) of those, how many we can reach with our program's ca pacity, and (c) how many of those reached achieve HbA1c <9%. Beginning with a baseline ra te of 25% of patients with diabetes having A1c > 9%, our goal is to reach 22.5% by DY4 and 17.5% by DY5. Our justification for these targets is as follows. We estimate 3600 patients w ith diabetes in our practice, of whom \u00bc or 900 will have A1c >9%. With 540 of those patients reached in DY4 (Category 2 milestone) and a 25% success rate in reducing A1c below 9, we wi ll reach our goal of 22.5%. With an additional 720 patients reached by CHWs (Category 2 Milest one) in DY5, and continued work with the DY4 patient cohort, we expect to reac h our DY5 goal of 17.5% with A1c>9. Relationship to other Projects: This project relates to \"Expanding chronic care management in a safety net clinic\" (Unique RHP ID#: 085144601.2.4). The projects are mutually supportive. The community health worker activities in this project will extend the clinic's capacity to reach patients in their home and community settings, enhancing the clinical team 's understanding of contextual obstacles to clinical success. Community health workers wi ll work closely with nurse care managers to reinforce self-management support a nd troubleshoot stumbling blocks. 891 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Bluebonnet Trails- 2.9 - Patient navigato r for persons with chronic illness. University Health System - 2.9 - Patient care navigation program. Plan for Learning Collaborative: Following completion of the RHP Plan, University H ealth System will facilitate the formation of working groups of performing providers who are pursuing similar projects. These working groups will develop their learning collaborative structure which may include the following: Identify participants Establis h Learning Collaborative goals Develop a calendar of regular meetings, site visits, and/or conference calls Develop a plan to communicate ideas, data , and successes across the region and state Organize a learning event and in vite experts and other Perfor ming Providers from outside the region to share knowle dge and best practices Adopt metrics to measure success University Health System will seek to provide facilitation and administrative assistance as needed to ensure the success of these endeavor s. The RHP 6 website wi ll be available to the Learning Collaboratives to netw ork and share ideas, challeng es, and success stories with colleagues. RHP 6 hopes to make significant tran sformational progress on its project milestones to achieve waiver goals and share what we learn with the rest of the State. Project Valuation: Achieves waiver goals - The pr oject directly addresses waiver goals, with its objectives to improve care access and address barrie rs to self-management at a sa fety net clinic where 75% of patients are uninsured or on Medi caid. It addresses the triple aim of improved outcomes, lower costs and improved patient experien ce; it provides a mechanism to reduce health disparities for a socioeconomically disadvantaged population through culturally appropriate, patient-centered approaches augmented by community-based interventions. Addresses community needs - Better management of diabetes mellitus is an identified community health priority. The pr oject directly addresses social and contextual influences on poorly controlled chronic diseases at the patient level, but the project al so addresses community based education by using CHWs, w ho are accustomed to assuming this role. Embedding some project activities in community settings will no t only reach out to those who have difficulty accessing clinical resources, but will also promote self-management educati on to a larger at-risk population. Project Scope -The project is implemented in a safety net clinic with 17,000 unduplicated patients seen over a two-year period. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus among adults in our practice is 30% Project Investment - Implementing this project will require additional investment in community health workers for the work described. Although th ey are relatively low-cost health workers, their high load of commun ity-based work means that they can manage fewer visits than a doctor or nurse in a fixed location. In addition, because this work differs in some respects from the work that CHWs are accustomed to, add itional training is required for ne w hires, as well as a ramp-up period as they learn to work with clinical teams. 892 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 085144601.2.5 PASS 1 2.9.2 NA 2.9.2 - IMPLEMENT OTHER EVIDENCE BASED PROJECT TO ESTABLISH A PATIENT CARE NAVIGATION PROGRAM IN AN INNOVATIVE MANNER : Community health worker program to address health and social needs in a vulnerable population University of Texas Health Scienc e Center at San Antonio TPI - 085144601 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 085144601.3.22 poor 9/30/2013) 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 P-2: Establish/expand a health care navigation program.

(Transdermal Alcohol Monitoring Intervention to Reduce Drunk Drivi ng, Lower Incarceration Costs, and Prevent Recidivism) Unique RHP ID#: 085144601.2.6 - PASS 2 Performing Provider: University of Texa s Health Science Center San Antonio Performing Provider TPI: 085144601 Project Summary: Provider Description : The University of Texas Health Sc ience Center at San Antonio serves San Antonio and the 50,000 square-mile area of S outh Texas. It extends to campuses in the metropolitan border communities of Laredo and the Rio Grande Valley. More than 3,000 students a year train in an environment that i nvolves more than 100 affiliated hospitals, clinics and health care facilities in South Texas. Intervention(s) : Novel treatment program designed to re duce recidivism for alcohol-related driving offenses. Need for the project : Alcohol is a pervasive problem in Te xas, and our state has the 2nd highest number of alcohol-related driving offenses in the nation. Locally, in Bexar County, the number of DWI arrests have risen by 33% in recent year s, and it ranks 3rd in Texas (behind Dallas and Harris counties) in terms of driving fatalities. Even more concerning is the fact that it is estimated that 50-75% of convict ed drunk drivers continue to drive on a suspended license, indicating that existing legal reme dies themselves lack sufficient impact on this costly problem. Target population : Legally indigent adults convicted of alcohol-related driving offenses. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : We propose treating 650 offenders in this pilot program. Category 3 outcome: Decrease recidivism rates for alc ohol-related driving offenses by 25% to 50% compared to probation. Project Description: The overall goal is to develop and implement a novel program for managi ng individuals charged with alcohol-related driving offenses, which will pr ovide the judicial system with a cost-effective alternative to jail and reduce ra tes of recidivism among offenders. This project is designed to address the Improvement Target IT-9.1 Decrease in mental health admissions and readmissions to criminal justice settings such as jails or prisons . Legally indigent adults arrested for alcohol involved driving offenses will be offered treatm ent. This treatment involves a novel technology that will allow us to continuous ly monitor alcohol use. Information from this monitoring technology is used by clinicians to guide each individuals treatment, using contingency management and motivational interviewing to help them reduce alcohol use. A target of 650 patients was chosen because it is what our clinic can accommodate in 4 years and this is sufficient to demonstrate the efficacy and feasibility of the program. At the conclusion of this program, our intention is that this model program will be adopted across the state as a cost of 896 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA effective means to reduce alcohol driving offenses. Quality: To achieve continuous quality improvement we shall assess the projects impact and make adjustments as necessary, share best practice a nd lessons learned, seize scaling opportunities to expand successful outcomes to broader populat ions, and rapidly disseminate successful outcomes to other prov iders across Texas. Region 6 goals: This project addresses the RH P 6 goal of \"improving outcomes while containing costs.\" Reduced recidivism in alcohol driving offenses is the improved outcome. The costs savings comes from: reduction in court costs generated by recidivism; providing an alternative to incarceration and its associated co sts; and the cost associated with loss of life, injury, and property damage as a result of alco hol-related motor vehicle accidents. Starting Point/Baseline: We propose enrolling 650 offenders in this pilot program. This is a new intervention, no clients or providers have previously e xperienced this kind of interven tion. At the conclusion of the 5- years this model could be adopt ed by drug courts state-wide. Rationale: The project was chosen because Texas consistent ly ranks at the top of US DWI fatalities and recidivism. Currently legally indigent indivi duals with alcohol problems do not have access to treatment and instead the state bears the cost of alcohol misuse through th e legal system. This project use a novel technology to continuously m onitor for alcohol consumption and information from this monitoring is used in treatment to facilitate reduction in alcohol misuse. Besides being responsive to the IT-9.1, there are several clinically sign ificant reasons to targ et the legal system for treatment to reduce alcohol misuse: (1) DUI arrests are objective method for identifying individuals who are experiencing impairment from alcohol misuse and an objective method to quantify treatment success (i.e. lack of recidivism); and (2) contac t with the legal system is a time when those who misuse alcohol are more likely to consider re ducing their drinking. CN.4 Meets need for high quality behavioral health services that is integrated with physical health services. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): Data supporting RHP priority. This proposal addresses ne eds identified in the 2010 Community Health Assessment for Bexar County; it addresses Lifestyl e Behaviors (Alcohol Consumption). Alcohol is a pervasive problem in Texas, and our state has the 2nd highest number of alcohol-related drivi ng offenses in the nation. Current judicial approaches to curb these offenses are costly; an estim ated cost to the state is $5.9 b illion dollars. A full 10% of the Texas state budget is for incarceration. More locally, in Bexar Count y, the number of DWI arrests have risen by 33% in recent years, and it ranks 3rd in Texas (b ehind Dallas and Harris counties) in terms of driving fatalities. More problematic is the fact that it is estimated that 50-75% of convicted drunk drivers continue to driv e on a suspended license; this fact underscores the need for treatment programs that work in c onjunction with existing pro cedures. It has been estimated that treatment of indivi duals that have been convicted of alcohol and/or drug offenses 897 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA costs only 1/4th as much as the alternative, incarcer ation. For every dollar spent on treatment, there is an estimated return of $8.87 to the state. These statistics, when taken together, indicate the existing legal remedies themselves lack sufficient impact on this costly problem. Improved Health. Current methods for managing alcohol o ffenses result in a very high rate of recidivism and indigent do not have access to monitored care offered by this proposal. Relationship to other Projects: This is the only intervention study to reduce al cohol related driving offenses and recidivism. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: No other performing providers are proposing similar projects Plan for Learning Collaborative: Goals of the project include dissemination of findi ngs of a manualized system for courts to use transdermal alcohol monitoring to enhance pr obation management and reduce recidivism of alcohol related offenses (Goal 3 of the plan). Project Valuation: While there could be a wide range of parameters used to estimate the value of this program, if you consider only three factors, the anticipated value would be at least $6,027,270. There are several ways to calculate this value: 1- Value to the individual alcohol offender. Gi ven the typical cost of a DWI in Texas ($19,200) and recidivism rate (27%), if our progr ammed reduced recidivism by 25 among a 650 participants in the program there would be a cost saving of $842,400; 2- Saving due to reduce incarceration. Given the typical daily cost of housing a prisoner ($66/day) and duration of prison sentence for a DWI (180 days for first offense) if this program reduces recidivism by 25%, th e prison savings is $521,235; 3- Cost associated with preven ting a single fatality related to DWI is estimated to be $3,300,000. Note, the intention of conducting this program is that it would serve as a model that could be adopted throughout the state, and as a result, the value of this program would be exponentially higher (Milestone 3). 898 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 085144601.2.6 PASS 2 2.13.2 N/A 2.13.2 Implement other evidence based project to provide intervention for a targeted behavioral health population to prevent unnecessary use of services.

In that capacity we are responsible for an array of public se rvices as well as for behavioral health planning and coordination th roughout our local servic e area. We operate services in Guadalupe County and we have responsibil ity to identify gaps in service or barriers to access for persons diagnosed with behavioral health disorders residing in the area. Intervention(s) : BTCS proposes to work in collaborati on with the Guadalupe Regional Medical Center to implement a patient navigation project for persons who are frequent users of the Emergency Department due to behavioral health disorders. We will employ a Peer Support Specialist and a registered Nurse to work on s ite at Guadalupe Regiona l Medical Center to provide rapid triage, assessment and alternat ive services to frequent users of the ED. The RN will provide patient education, assessment and gui dance on follow up care. The Peer Support Specialist will identify community resources and di rectly link and advocate for the patients. Peer Support Specialists are former or current consumer s of behavioral health services. Linkage and referral will include transportation to services by BTCS workers in cu rrently owned transport vehicles. Need for the project : This project addresses the RHP 6 Community Needs Assessment Needs: CN.2 \"A high prevalence of chronic disease and related health dispar ities require greater prevention efforts and improved management of patients with chronic conditions\"; CN.3 \"Many residents of RHP 6 lack access to medical and de ntal care due to high rates of uninsurance and health care provider shortages\"; and especially CN.4 \"There is a shortage of high quality mental and behavioral health services that are integrated with physical health care services.\" Target population : Are target population those users of ED services who are admitted more than 5 times in one year. BTCS served 3,377 pe rsons in Guadalupe County in FY 2012; 2,401 persons with mental illnesses. An average of 43% of the adults and 76% of the children with mental illnesses were eligible for Medicaid or CHIP and approximately 25 % of non-Medicaid adults were indigent. We expect about 75 % of the persons benefitting from these navigation services to be Medicaid or CHIP eligible or uninsured. We expect to serve 30 people in DY 4 and 50 people in DY 5. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The starting point/baseline for this service in DY 2 is 0 since no such service currently exists in this C ounty. The project seeks to serve 30 people in DY 901 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Bluebonnet Trails Community Services 4 and 50 people in DY 5. Those served will be high utilizers of the ED with multiple visits per year. We plan to intervene at the point of the vi sit and to assist the indi viduals in connecting for ongoing care through a medical home, there by reducing future ED utilization. Category 3 outcomes: IT3.1 Our goal is to reduce all cause 30 day readmission rate for this group of high utilizers by a percentage TB D after baseline is established in DY 3. Project Description: Bluebonnet Trails Community Services (BTCS) is the state designated Local Mental Health Authority (LMHA) for Guadalupe County in Re gion 6 as well as for seven other Counties located east of and parall el to IH 35 extending north of Austin, Texas in Travis County. In that capacity we are responsible for an array of public services as well as for behavioral health planning and coordination throughout our local service ar ea. We operate services in Guadalupe County and we have responsibility to identify gaps in service or barriers to access for persons diagnosed with behavioral health disorders residing in the area. BTCS proposes to work in collaboration with the Guadalupe Regiona l Medical Center to implement a patient navigation project for pers ons who are frequent users of the Emergency Department due to behavioral h ealth disorders. We have a goo d relationship with this local hospital and with other health care providers in Guadalupe County. BTCS staff frequently assists the hospital with assessment, discharge an d continuity of care i ssues for BTCS patients and therefore are familiar with key staff, facilities and resources. We continue to hold planning discussions with the leadership of Guadalupe Regional Medical Center and are hopeful that we can identify a location for the navigation program st aff within the hospital itself or alternatively in the facility that BTCS is constructing in partnership with the FQHC , Community Centers of South Texas. Plans for the project are to hire an RN and a Peer Support Specialist to deliver the navigation services. The RN will provide pati ent education, assessment and guidance on follow up care. The Peer Support Specialist will iden tify community resources and directly link and advocate for the patients. Peer Support Specialists are former or current co nsumers of behavioral health services. They bring an ability to connect with frequent ED visitors and engage them in recovery and solutions. Using Peers is an Evidenced Based Practice promoted by the Texas Department of State Health Services ('DSHS') and the SAMHSA division of US Department of HHS. DSHS certifies Peer Specialists and this in dividual carrying out the na vigation role will be certified or seek certification. The project goals for the program and for the patient navigators will be to provide enhanced social support and culturally competent care to this high risk population. They will help support the patients as they seek access throughout the co ntinuum of health care. In addition they will ensure timely, coordinated and site appropriate health car e and if needed behavioral health care. The patient navigators will work closely with ho spital and emergency department staff to divert non urgent patients to other more appropriate levels of care. Th is project also meets regional goals to include: integrating primary and behavioral health care; improving access for the poor and uninsured; and advancing the goals articulated in the Commun ity Health Improvement Plan for Bexar County of 2012 to improve comprehensiv e behavioral health services and access for all. It also advances the triple aim of CMS because reduction in ED us e by these high utilizers will have a positive impact on regi onal health care costs. The challenges to this project are to enga ge those who are frequent visitors to the EDs and help 902 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Bluebonnet Trails Community Services them access alternatives. This project will address this problem by providing the opportunity for a person centered intervention offered by a Peer, to connect the individuals to services at the point that they need them the mo st, i.e., at the point they are se eking emergency care. We expect to use community resources to fill unmet soci al needs such as housi ng, transportation, income, food and medication. For those who are in need of behavioral heal th services either as a short term stabilization strategy or for long-term, we will connect patients to BTCS or to primary care practitioners who can support behavi oral health treatment. We plan to provide transportation to make access to healthcare as smooth as possible. BTCS currently uses staff and Peers to provide transportation in current Center owned vehicles and we plan to continue to use these personnel and resources to transport to services. This approa ch is aimed at resolving the multiple issues that lead to repeated visits to the ED . Our goal is to do all we can to ensure connection to aftercare and follow up rather than quick treatment and releas e from the ED with instructions for aftercare but no community support. Over the next five years we expect the outcomes of this project t o be the continued development robust alternatives to ED care a nd improve the performing provider and the healthcare system in the region. We expect the patients who receive navigation services to re duce utilization of EDs and reduce preventable readmissions as a result. These outcomes are directly achievable due to the goals and interventions described above. Starting Point/Baseline: Since this program has not been established and does not exist in Guadalupe County, the baseline for DY 2 is 0. We will use the remainder of DY 2 to identify the target population as a discrete cohort by review of emergency department admissi ons at Guadalupe Regiona l Medical Center. Rationale: The primary intent of our project, which is to establish a patient naviga tion program for persons with cognitive impairments who are frequent visi tors to the ED. We plan to use Peer Support Specialists as navigators. These are innovative h ealth care workers who have been consumers in the system and will bring an enhanced level of cultural competency and understanding to the process and the people who they are helping. The navigators will be assisted by RNs to act as nurse educators. The team is enriched by inclusi on of a trained health care professional and Peer support, founded on recovery oriented focus ensu res access to care management and education that promotes self-management. BTCS and its partner, Community Health Centers of South Texas, FQHC for Guadalupe County, are in proce ss of building a clinic to co-locate behavioral health services with primary care services in partnership in Seguin, furt her enhancing access to care. BTCS has participated as a member of the Gu adalupe County Mental Health Task Force to identify behavioral health gaps and needs. Health disparity is often driv en by income disparity. 11% to 20% of the population of Guadalupe Coun ty is below the poverty level. Additionally, 24% of the people in the RHP 6 region are without insurance or any third party coverage. The entire county has been designated a health care pr ovider shortage area for behavioral health and for primary care according to US Department of HHS, HRSA. An area of concern that the hospital leadership, task force me mbers and BTCS have identified is the repeated ED visits by a group of patients some of whom are BTCS patients and some of whom are not. Anecdotal 903 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Bluebonnet Trails Community Services evidence indicates reasons for the multiple ED visits by this group of patients, ranges from chronic behavioral health issues, mental illnesse s and substance use disorders to chronic physical health issues such as asthma, chronic pain, cardiopulmonary disease, etc., but frequently triggered by behavioral health conditions. According to the Bexar County Consortium Report, the root cause of a large number of visits to the ED's in RHP 6 is related to anxiety, symptoms of mental illness and/or substance abuse. Povert y and provider shortages coupled with cognitive deficits that are symptoms of mental illnesses, makes finding and accessing care difficult for many in Guadalupe County. We believe a sp ecial intervention provided by people who are trained in behavioral health assessment and mana gement is required. The target population is composed of patients identified as having multiple emergency department/hospitalizations over the last year. Most of the patients have chr onic health problems often exacerbated by substance abuse and mental illness. They tend to have poor compliance with treatment recommendations, often lack a medical home and have few natural community supports such as friends and family. Since this is a wholly new program for Guadal upe County we expect to follow and carry out each of the required co re project components : a) Identify frequent ED users a nd use navigators as part of a preventable ED reduction program. Train health care navigators in cultural competency. b) Deploy innovative health care personnel, such as case manage rs/workers, community health workers and other types of health pr ofessionals as patient navigators. c) Connect patients to primary and preventive care. d) Increase access to care manage ment and/or chronic care mana gement, including education in chronic disease self management. e) Conduct quality improvement for project usin g methods such as rapid cycle improvement. Activities may include, but are not limited to, id entifying project impacts, identifying \"lessons learned,\" opportunities to scale a ll or part of the project to a broader patient population, and identifying key challenges associated with expansion of the proj ect, including special considerations for safety net populations. This project addresses RHP 6 Co mmunity Needs Assessment needs: CN.2 \"A high prevalence of chronic disease and related health disparities require greater prevention efforts and improved management of patients with chronic conditions\"; CN.3 \"Many residents of RHP 6 lack access to medical and dental care due to high rates of uninsurance and health care provider shortages\"; and especially CN.4 \"There is a shortage of high quality mental and behavioral health services that are integrated with physical health care services and/or provi de crisis stabilization..\" BTCS has operated a free-standing mental health outpatient clinic site in Seguin in Guadalupe County for a number of years. We have been en gaged in planning for a number of years with the local FQHC to build and establish a clinic site that integrates be havioral health care and primary care. This navigation project is e nhanced by that delivery system reform . Our planning recently resulted in the award of a grant through the Health Resources and Se rvices Administration Division of the US Department of HHS to devel op a primary care/behavioral health care clinic site in Seguin in partnership w ith the Federally Qualified Health Center for Guadalupe County. These Federal funds will not be used to provide the patient navigation program, but having the integrated clinic will more effectively meet the needs of those we provide navigation services to and provide options for care and a medical hom e that has heretofore been unavailable. 904 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Bluebonnet Trails Community Services Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): The Category 3 Outcome Measure that we selected is \"OD 3 Potentially Preventable ReAdmissions 30 day Readmission Rates (PPRs) IT 3.1 All cause 30 day readmission rate NQF 1789.\" This is a stand-alone measure. We se lected this measure becau se the goal of this project is to help people who ha ve multiple visits to EDs and we believe in many cases that has resulted in admission and readmission to hospital. We believe that measuri ng the reduction in re- hospitalization will be a good indica tor of success for the program. Over the four yeas of the project we expect to dramatically reduce the nu mber of ED visits for the target population and the associated inpatient admissions. These re ductions will occur by improved chronic disease management, linkage to a primar y care provider and medical home. The RN will be hired and trained to deliver culturally a nd linguistically appropriate serv ices to the target population. Patients will be diverted from EDs/hospitals and linked with primary care providers who can offer a medical home. Navigators will also link patients to soci al support programs and behavioral health programs where a need is identified. It is exp ected that utilization of programs such as self-management support, patient edu cation, improved patient provider communication and coordination with community resources will lead to increased patient engagement in maintaining their health. This outcome supports RHP 6 goals to improve health for low-income populations and link to a medical home. Relationship to other Projects: BTCS has also proposed in Category 1, Project 1268443-05.1.2. That project is the establishment of new treatment site for outpatient substance abuse care. The navigation project will be able to refer to servi ces offered through the substance a buse clinic and thereby initiate much needed treatment and reduce returns to the ED. This is project fills a gap in services that the patient navigators will need for referral and care. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: BTCS plans to participate in learning collaborati ve with Center for Health Care Services which is planning integrated care and specialized care ma nagement projects. We would also request to participate with University of Texas Health Sc ience Center, San Antonio and University Health System both of which are planni ng patient naviga tion programs. Plan for Learning Collaborative: BTCS will participate in all learning collaborative s organized or sponsored by University Health System that are relevant to our projects. As a bove, we will actively seek participation in other learning collaboratives in the Regi on. We believe it is important to improving and adjusting the care provided. 905 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Bluebonnet Trails Community Services Project Valuation: The project seeks to serve 30 people in DY 4 a nd 50 people in DY 5. Those served will be high utilizers of the ED with multiple visits per year. We plan to intervene at the point of the visit and to assist the individuals in connecting for ongoing care thro ugh a medical home, thereby reducing future ED utilization. The valuation calculated for this project used cost-utility analysis which measures program cost in dollars and the health consequences in utility-weighted units that were applied to the factors existing in th is underserved area, including: limited access to primary care and to behavioral health care, poverty and the link between chronic health conditions and chronic behavioral health condit ions. The valuation study was prepared by professors H. Shelton Brown, Ph.D. and A. Ha sanat Alamgir, Ph.D. both of the UT Houston School of Public Health and Thomas Bohman, Ph.D . of the UT Austin Center for Social Work Research based on a model that included quality-a djusted life-years (QALYs) and an extensive literature of similar interventions and cost savings and health outcomes related to those interventions. The QALY index incorporates costs averted when known (e.g., emergency room visits that are avoided).We assigned a valu e of $1,134,866 through DY 5. Complete write-up of project will be available at performing provider site. 906 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Bluebonnet Trails Community Services 1268443-05.2.1 PASS 1 2.9.1 2.9.1 A-E 2.9.1 PROVIDE NAVIGATION SERVICES TO TARGETED PATIENTS WHO ARE AT HIGH RISK OF DISCONNECT FROM INSTITUTIONAL HEALTH CARE : PATIENT NAVIGATOR FOR PERSONS WITH CHRONIC MENTAL ILLNESS Bluebonnet Trails Community Mental Health and Me ntal Retardation Center dba/ Bluebonnet Trails Community Services TPI - 126844305 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 1268443-05.3.3 3.IT - 3.1 All cause 30 day readmission rate- NQF 1789 Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 P1: Conduct a needs assessment to identify the patient population(s) to be targeted with the Patient Navigator program.

That responsibility includes identifying gaps in service or barrier s to access for persons with behavioral health issues re siding in the area. We also pr ovide behavioral health services through various contracts including a contract with the state to serve adults who are primarily diagnosed with Serious Mental Illnesses. BTCS is responsible for aftercare upon release from hospital and for stability in the community following ED visits, jail stays and the number disruptive of events that happen for those with SMI. Community stability cannot occur for anyone without access to housing. Intervention(s) : BTCS proposes to implement a transi tional housing facility that is provided consistent with SAMHSA recognized recovery pr inciples. We will secure, renovate, open and staff a facility suitable for about 6 individuals who will be provided behavioral health services in this transitional housing setting to improve co mmunity living skills. The program will be for individuals who have a need for housing but who are also willing to participate in a Recovery- Based Program. While in the program they will participate in psychosocial skills training to learn and practice skills to improve the likeli hood of a successful tran sition into independent living. All admissions to the program will part icipate in a Wellness, Recovery, Action Plan. Need for the project : This project addresses RHP 6 Community Needs Assessment needs CN.4 \"There is a shortage of high quality mental and behavioral health se rvices that are integrated with physical health care services.\" It also addresses the lack of affordable housing in Guadalupe county for the poor and mentally ill. Target population : The target population is our patients or potential patients referred from the Crisis Respite Unit, State Psychiatric Inpatient F acilities, and the local Community Centers. The referrals will be screened and considered based on need. We will prioritize admissions to those with long or repeated stays in inpatient settings or with freq uent contacts with the criminal justice system. BTCS served 3,377 persons in Guadalupe County in FY 2012; 2,401 persons with behavioral health disorders. In FY 2012, an average of 43% of the a dults were eligible for Medicaid; 73% of BTCS clients are below th e federal poverty level; 55% are uninsured. We estimate that approximately 70% of those benefitti ng from this project will be poor, uninsured or underinsured. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : This project seeks to provide transitional housing services and placement in permanent housing for 12 people in DY 4 and 18 people in DY 5.

That responsibility includes identifyi ng gaps in service or barriers to access for persons with behavioral health issues residing in the area. We also provide be havioral health services through various contracts including a contract with the st ate to serve adults who are primarily diagnosed with Serious Mental Illnesses (SMI the Federal definition can be found at \"Federal Definition for SMI,\" http://www.healthcare.uiowa.edu/icmh/doc uments/FederalDefinitionsofSMIandSED.doc .) This group of patients generally suffers from th e most profound deficits in functioning and are often unemployed, homeless or living in sub-stan dard housing and without natural family or community supports. Recovery is possible for these individuals but it is a difficult journey requiring help and supports. BTCS and commun ity partners are responsible for aftercare upon release from hospital and for stability in the community following ED visits, jail stays and the number disruptive of events that happen for thos e with SMI. Community stability cannot occur for anyone without access to housing. BTCS proposes to implement a transitional housing facility that is provided consistent with SAMHSA recognized recovery pr inciples, (National Consensus Statement on MH Recovery, http://www.samhsa.gov/SAMHSA_N ews/VolumeXIV_2/article4.htm .) Based on our experience providing treatment in the region and w ith the consensus of community leaders, we realize no housing now exists in Guadalupe County that can be used to help people make the transition to recovery. We will identify a suitable facility in Seguin, Texas to rent, remodel and use for the transitional housing project. Program participants may be referred from the Crisis Respite Unit, State Psychiatric Inpatient Facilities, and the lo cal Community Centers. The referrals will be screened and considered base d on need. The program will be for individuals who have a need for housing but who are also willing to participate in a Recovery-Based Program. While in the program they will participate in psychosocial skills training to learn and practice skills to improve the likelihood of a su ccessful transition into independent living. All admissions to the program will participate in a We llness, Recovery, Action Plan (WRAP) to help target the individual needs. We have identifi ed a variety of evidenced based program models that focus on promoting recovery and self -responsibility. We will assess the models and through a process of review and ev aluation, incorporate practices that enhance our current plans. (\"Developing a Recovery and We llness Based Lifestyle Guide,\" http://store.samhsa.gov/product/Developing-a-Re KIT/SMA11-4633CD-DVD .) The common elements in the m odels are that they all contain components supporting skills development, self- aw areness and individual responsibility in the recovery process. For exampl e, WRAP is listed on the SAMHSA registry of evidenced based practices. WRAP is an effective, manual-based group intervention for adults with mental illness. WRAP guides participants thr ough the process of identifying and understanding their personal wellness resources (\"wellness tools\") and then help s them develop an individualized plan to use these resources on a daily basis to manage their me ntal illness. Tools and practices such as these will form the foundation of the Transitional Hous ing project. The program will be evaluated 911 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Bluebonnet Trails Community Services quarterly and outcomes will be closely monitored. All services will be documented in our electronic information system. Data will determ ine the amount and frequency of the services being provided and will be utilized to help guide the program quarterly. Satisfaction surveys will be provided for individuals leavi ng the program to ensure we gath er personal attitudes regarding the effectiveness of the program. The final phases of this program will include transition assistance - assistance to establish a basic household, including security deposits, essential furnishings, moving expenses, bed and bath linens so that individuals can smoothly move into community living. Goals and Relationship to Regional Goals: Over the next five years we expect to fully implement the transitional housing program base d on recovery principles. We expect the program to maintain an average census of around 6 persons who will stay from one month to six months depending on assessed need. We expect to serve 12 to 18 people each year after the program is underway. The goal of the program is to facilitate the change and recovery process for individuals with SMI thr ough skills building, self-awarene ss, self-advocacy, and providing the supports necessary for stable li ves in a community setting. Project Goals are to : 1) Establish a Transitional Housing pr ogram based on Recovery Principles; 2) Recruit and train staff to pr ovide transitional services; 3) Pr ovide services to the target population of people who have been hospitalized or experienced a recent crisis event; and 4) Assist people to regain functioni ng and self-manage their wellness. This project meets the following regional goals : 1) Further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system; and 2) Improve out comes while containing cost growth. As this program is established and grows, we expect individuals will have fewer emergency departments visits, fewer stat e hospitalizations, a lower rate of arrests and fewer days incarcerated. An additional benef it of this program is that it can serve as a recovery resource center to the broader co mmunity of persons in Guadalupe County with SMI who are in the process of recovery. Challenges : Challenges include finding adequate hous ing for persons when they are ready to exit the transitional housing program to live indepe ndently or in a supportive living situation in the community. We are fortunate to have a long st anding presence in the community and the support of community leaders who can assist in identifying suitable loca tions for independent housing. Over the next few months staff will a ssess houses and apartment complexes that BTCS could access. We will also work with them to find other locations in the future. Another key challenge is recruiting an d training staff in recovery princi ples and ensuring they have the knowledge necessary to make linka ges with other programs such as crisis respite and federally qualified health clinics. During DY 2 we will be gin actively recruiting and review and inventory of community resources. 5-Year Expected Outcome for Provider and Patients: Over the next 5 years, we expect the outcomes to include reduction of readmissions to psychiatric hospitals within 30 days. The goals of this project are to establish a service that helps people improve functioning so that they can live successfully. Improvement in functio ning and managing one's wellness gives the opportunity to make a transition from inpatient stay or cris is event to co mmunity living. Providing this stable living envi ronment along with skills trai ning and supports will reduce 912 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Bluebonnet Trails Community Services preventable readmissions. Starting Point/Baseline: Currently no Transitional Housing program exists in Guadalupe County; therefore, the baseline is 0 in DY 2. Baseline data will be based on pa tients entering the transitional housing program in DY3. Rationale: The Transitional Housing program based on Recove ry principles provides an opportunity for those persons discharged form a psychiatric hospital or recently experiencing a behavioral health crisis to have a stable place to live and participat e in learning the skills needed to move on to independent or supported living in the commun ity. We selected the \"Implement other evidencebased project to provide an in tervention for a targeted be havioral health population to prevent unnecessary use of services\" because assessm ent of the needs in the County indicate that resources and interventions are lacking to reduc e inpatient stays and provide community options after a crisis event. The community-based inte rventions employed in th e project mirror many of those listed as components unde r this Option; including: Residential Assistance (Foster/Companion Ca re, Supervised Living, Residential Support Services); Psychosocial Rehabilitation; Transition assistance - assist ance to establish a basic hous ehold, including security deposits, essential furnishings, moving expenses, bed and bath linens; Transportation to appointments and community based activities; Prescription medications; Project Components: Even though there are no Core Compon ents associated with this option, we plan to follow the components listed for 2.13.1. We will convene community stakeholders during the remainder of FY 2013 to identify information needed to assess the gaps that must be filled to secure housing and to gain the skills for a smooth transition. With these stakeholders, we will identify tools to provide data to get an inventory of community resources currently utilized and those needed by the people we expect to serve. We will use the current staff to assess current needs of those w ho are now hospitalized and soon to be discharged and those experiencing crisis events need ing transition to community housing. Using the information from stakeholders, from capacity and utilization tools, from furthe r literature reviews and from assessment of those potential referrals, we will assess the interventi on we are planning to provide. As we implement the project we will plan a rapid cycle quality improvement component through our Quality Management Depart ment at BTCS. We plan to continuously improve the program over the next 5 years as we adjust the interventi ons, peer supports and make changes based on lessons learned. Those changes may include adjustments to the model with respect to interventi ons, intensity and population. Continuous Quality Improvement : BTCS is committed to continuous quality improvement a nd learning related to this project. We will establish quality improvement activities such as rapid cycle improvement and will perform other activities such as \"le ssons learned\" and identifying proj ect impacts. In addition, we are participating in a regional learning collaborative which shares information such as challenges, lessons learned and consideratio ns for safety net populations. 913 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Bluebonnet Trails Community Services We expect the milestones and metrics in the first 2 years to reflect the innovative and developmental nature of this project. We will measure progress toward community assessment and development of infrastructure such as polic ies, training materials, contracts and support. These Milestones and Metrics are specifically rela ted to the targeted pop ulation of individuals who have recent crisis events that sometimes re sult in hospitalizations with the aim of providing them the best opportunity to make a recovery or iented transition to the community and thereby prevent further crises and hospitalizations. BTCS has participated as a member of the Gu adalupe County Mental Health Task Force to identify behavioral health gaps and needs. Health disparity is often driv en by income disparity. 11% to 20% of the population of Guadalupe Coun ty is below the poverty level. Additionally, 24% of the people in the RHP 6 region are without insurance or any third party coverage. The entire county has been designated a health care pr ovider shortage area for behavioral health and for primary care according to US Department of HHS, HRSA. BTCS reviewed data related to admissions to the State Hospital and to the volunt ary Crisis Respite facili ty. We found a large percentage of the 218 year to date admissions to the State Hospital--17% accounting for 37 of the 218 admissions--were made without prior screeni ng and authorization by BTCS, the LMHA. Analysis reveals that those admissions are being taken directly to the hospital by law enforcement officers because they have few local alternatives. Analysis of those State Hospital admissions reveals a substantial number with very s hort lengths of stay, indicating that they were inappropriately admitted and might be prevented with a community alternative for transitional housing. The number of individuals w ith lengths of stay less than 3 days reflects that 61 persons may have been inappropriately admitted year-to- date. When we reviewed the admission data for the voluntary Crisis Respite f acility, it revealed that there were 252 admissions in FY 2012 and of those admissions, 13% were from EDs and local Hospitals; 8% were from the State Hospital; and 13% were from jail. All of these individu als would meet initial eligibility criteria for transitional housing. This project addresses RHP 6 Community Needs Assessment need CN.4 \"There is a shortage of high quality mental and behavioral health services that are integr ated with physical health care services.\" BTCS has operated a free-standing mental health outpatient clinic site in Seguin in Guadalupe County for a number of years. We have b een engaged in planning with the local FQHC, Community Health Centers of South Central Texas, to build and establish a clinic site that integrates behavioral health care and primary care. This naviga tion project is enhanced by that delivery system reform . Our planning recently resulted in the award of a grant through the Health Resources and Services Administration Division of the US Department of HHS to develop a primary care/behavioral health care cl inic site in Seguin in partnership with the Federally Qualified Health Center for Guadalupe County. These Federal funds will not be used to provide the patient navigation program, but ha ving the integrated clinic will more effectively meet the needs of those we provi de navigation services to and provide options for care and a medical home that has heretofore been unavailab le. Successful community living requires whole health. Our collaboration increase the opportuni ties for linkage to primary care and a medical 914 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Bluebonnet Trails Community Services home and overall improve ment in functioning. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD3 Potentially Preventable Re Admissions 30 day Readmission Rates IT3.8 Behavioral Health /Substance Abuse 30 day readmission rate. Reasons/ rationale for selecting the outcome measure: This is a stand-alone measure. We selected this measure because the goal of th is project is to help people who have been hospitalized or experienced a crisis event that could have resulted in a hospitalization to transition to stable living in the community. That transition will be made because of the program interventions that improve functioning and the skills needed for successful community living. When the goal is achieved then program partic ipants will self-manage their recovery and wellness and there should be a reduction in symptoms and a re duction in crisis events. The outcome of this is fewer readmissions to the hospital both for 30 days and in the long term. Relationship to other Projects: BTCS has also proposed in Category 1, Projec t 1268443-05.1.2. That project is the establishment of new treatment site for outpatien t substance abuse care. The navi gation project will be able to refer to services offered through the substance ab use clinic and thereby initiate much needed treatment and reduce returns to the ED. This pr oject fills a gap in serv ices that the patient navigators will need for referral and care. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: BTCS plans to participate in learning collaborati ve with Center for Health Care Services which is planning integrated care and specialized care management projects. We have contracts with the Center to provide Crisis Re spite and Detoxification services. Adjusting these interventions along with the Transitional Housi ng program will improve potential for success. We expect to meet quarterly with the Center for Health Care Services and other community providers. We would also request to participat e with University of Texas Hea lth Science Center, San Antonio and University Health System both of whic h are planning patient navigation programs. Plan for Learning Collaborative: BTCS will participate in all learning collaborative s organized or sponsored by University Health System that are relevant to our projects. As stated by University Health System in guidance to Performing Providers on October 2, 2012, \"RHP 6 is committed to transforming health care in our region and throughout the stat e. Given the large number and value of projects proposed for our region, University Health System, as the RH P 6 anchor, will promote and facilitate learning collaboratives.\" As above, we will actively seek participation in other learning collaboratives in the Region. We believe it is important to improving and adjusting the care provided. Project Valuation: This project seeks to provide transitional hous ing services and placement in permanent housing for 12 people in DY 4 and 18 people in DY 5. The valu ation calculated for this project used cost- utility analysis which measures program cost in dollars and the health co nsequences in utility- weighted units that were applie d to the factors existing in th is underserved area, including: limited access to primary care and to behavioral health care, poverty and the link between chronic health conditions and chronic behavioral health conditions. The valuation study was prepared by professors H. Shelton Brown, Ph.D. and A. Hasanat Alamgir, Ph.D. both of the UT 915 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Bluebonnet Trails Community Services Houston School of Public Health and Thomas Bohman, Ph.D. of the UT Austin Center for Social Work Research based on a model that include d quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and an extensive literature of similar interventions and co st savings and health ou tcomes related to those interventions. The QALY index incorporates costs averted when known (e.g., emergency room visits that are avoided). We assigned a value of $1,313,236 through DY 5. A description of the method used, titled 'Valuing Transformation Pr ojects,' has been posted on the performing provider website which will be linked to www.bbtrails.org under the Medicaid 1115 Transformation Waiver tab.

CHCS provides behavioral health services and treatment to children, adolescents and adults. Intervention(s) : CHCS seeks to expand a therapeutic ju stice model for persons with serious mental illness as a means of diverting them from being placed in the criminal justice system whether through institutionalization or adjudication. Points of entr y into services will include mental health assessors statione d at the Magistrate Court provid ing screening and assessment of self-referrals or system referrals. Those identifie d with behavioral health needs are referred under judicial order to the specialized outpatient program, which features targeted interventions for this hard to serve population, in lieu of incarceration. The services to be provided are community based mental health services provided in the co mmunity and not provided in the criminal justice jail site. As an alternative to hospitalization or incarceration, this is a cost efficient approach and connects patients to appropriate treatment in a more durable fashion. This population is differentiated from a general a dult mental health outpatient p opulation by their demonstrated reticence to access care and their historical fail ures to comply with care recommendations; the basis of a therapeutic justice model. Evidence-base d practice research indicates that the presence of court ordered monitoring improves compliance and treatment outcomes. There is an estimated 25% difference between available funding for current capacity and demonstrated need. A consistent, coordinated, service- rich continuum of care for adu lts with mental illness, key components of a therapeutic ju stice model will ensure positiv e, long-term improvements in mental health, quality of life, functioning and st ability, and will provide appropriate alternatives to incarceration. Need for the project : Diverting adults with behavioral health disorders into treatment rather than incarceration is an evidence-based, cost-effective practice. CHCS has implemented a variety of therapeutic justice programs targeting adults w ith serious mental illness, which have shown positive outcomes; however, CHCS is currently pr oviding these services at 25% above capacity and significant numbers of otherwise eligible adults are going un-served or experiencing a lengthy wait for treatment. Target population : Adults with a behavioral health diso rders. Based upon current service data, it is anticipated that 54% of those to be served will be indige nt and 44% will be covered by Medicaid. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project seeks to divert adults with serious mental illness from institutionalization or incarceration and into treatment and readmissions. In DY4 the percentage of individuals who demonstrate improved functional stat us on standardized instruments (e.g., ANSA, CANS, etc) will improve from a base line of 295 served in DY3, by 50%, totaling 148 individuals and in DY5, 75% , totaling 221 individuals will demonstrate improved functional status on st andardized instruments. Category 3 outcomes: IT-9.1. Our goal, which will be quan tified by DY4, is to decrease mental 886 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services health admissions and readmissions to criminal justice settings. Project Description: The Center For Health Care Services (CHCS) seeks to increase the availability of mental health support services for mentally ill persons as a mean s of diverting them from institutionalization or incarceration and into tr eatment. Only a fraction of the me dically indigent population can be served and there is a wait time of up to three months for persons needing this type of treatment. Compounding the issue is the need to establish a sufficient continuum of care for persons who are exiting crisis services. Linkages to specialize d, community-based services will reduce the number of subsequent crises. Bexar County and The Center for Health Care Serv ices recognizes the need for expeditious and effective mental health treatment and stabilizing supports for this target population. including the subset that becomes involved with the criminal justice system. Expansion of existing services and further implementation of the th erapeutic justice approaches fo r this target population must include additional mental health, substance-abus e and support services components if we are to stabilize mental health, rest ore community functioning and imp rove quality of life while simultaneously reducing cyclic acute episodes. Goals. Reduce the number of adults with serious me ntal illness who repetitively cycle through the criminal justice and courts system by expanding th e availability of special ized services designed to promote treatment engagement and prevent unnecessary incarcerati on and utilization of emergency departments and urgent car e facilities. Provide an interv ention for adults with serious mental illness to promote treatment engagement and prevent unnecessary incarceration and the utilization of emergency departments and urgent care facilities. Reduce the number of adults with serious mental illness who repetitively cycle th rough the criminal justi ce, acute inpatient and other costly systems. Maintain adults in treatment for a mi nimum of one year. Challenges addressed by the project . Diverting adults with a beha vioral health disorder into treatment rather than institutionalization or inca rceration is an evidence-based, cost-effective practice. In a limited study, CHCS examined the expense associated with members of the target population who received psychiatri c in-jail services during a one year period ($3,058,000) versus the same target population receiving community-bas ed therapeutic justice services in lieu of incarceration ($497,000). A $2,561,000 cost savings wa s verified. While CHCS interventions have shown positive outcomes, we are currently operating at 25% above capacity and significant numbers of otherwise eligible adults are going un-served or experiencing a lengthy wait for treatment. In the absence of rapidly responsive treatment services, the members of the target population also often experience exte nded or repeated stays at inpa tient psychiatric facilities. 5-year expected outcomes for CHCS . CHCS seeks to provide specialized diversion services in an outpatient clinic that will be easily accessed fo r this population and allo w for expanded access to psychiatric and relate d clinical services. 5-year expected outcomes for pe rsons served by the project. Improved access to services, including: 1) sign ificantly reduced waiting time for physician appointments, which will improve patient sa tisfaction and compliance, and reduce adverse outcomes attributable to the lack of timely acce ss to care. 2) improved compliance with scheduled appointments resulting from timely access. 3) urgent care for medication management and related 886 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services crisis resolution. Relation to Regional Goals. Expanding resource availability to address the dear th of intensive outpatient mental health services is a key mean s of achieving the regional goal of \"Improving the infrastructure for delivery of behavioral health services\". The program fills an existing gap in care and improves the existing behavioral health infras tructure to better serve Medicaid and uninsured adults in Bexar County while containing cost growth. Starting Point/Baseline: 244 unduplicated adults per year Rationale: The project option 2.13.1 Design, implement, and evaluate research-supported and evidence- based interventions tailored towa rds individuals in the target popul ation, process milestone (P-3: Enroll and serve individuals with targeted comp lex needs (i.e., a diagnosis of severe mental illness with concomitant circumstances such as chronic physical health conditions, chronic or intermittent homelessness, cognitive issues re sulting from severe mental illness, forensic involvement, resulting in extended or repeated stays at inpatient psyc hiatric facilities) was selected in correspondence to an existing, unmet n eed for additional services for integrated care among adults with serious mental illness, frequent co-occurring behavioral and physical health problems and involvement with the criminal jus tice and courts systems. The target population often has a complex combination of physical and behavioral health care needs. Community mental health fac ilities are the right place for th e mentally ill with complex behavioral health issues to access specialized care and treatment. When such services are sufficiently available and easily accessed, person s with mental illne ss will experience an improved quality of life. Consequently, sufficient access to services in th e community for persons with mental illness will: a) positively impact their quality of life by ensuri ng that they will receive consistent, appropriate treatment in the right setting; b) reduce the likelihood that adults with mental illness will are less likely to inappropriately enter the criminal justice or court system; and, c) promote wellness and adherence to medication and other treatment modalities, which will promote recovery and stability in the community. Project Components: a). Assess si ze, characteristics and needs of target population(s) (e.g., people with severe mental illnes s and other factors leading to ex tended or repeated psychiatric inpatient stays. b). Review literature / experience with populations similar to target population to determine community based interventions that are effective in averting negative outcomes such as repeated or extended inpa tient psychiatric hosp italization, decreased mental and physical functional status, nursing facility admissi on, forensic encounters and in promoting correspondingly positive h ealth and social outcome s / quality of life. c) Develop project evaluation plan using qualitat ive and quantitative metrics to determine outcomes. d) Design models which include an appropriate range of community based services and residential supports. e) Assess the impact of interventions based on standardized quantitative measures and qualitative analysis releva nt to the target population. Unique community need identificatio n numbers the project addresses: CN.4 - Inadequate mental health services results in avoidable costs to ho spital and criminal and juvenile justice systems. The RHP 6 Community Needs Assessment also cited information from the Bexar County Health Collaborative Community Health Improvement plan that includes the following facts. About 6 people per 1000 are hospitalized fo r mental disorders every year in Bexar 886 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services County. About 1 person in 10,000 dies every year in Bexar County due to suicide. Adjusted for age, in 2008, this rate added up to 245 years of potenti al life lost per 100,000 under age 65 due to suicide for the residents Bexar County. The goal of the improvement plan is to improve comprehensive behavioral health services and access for all. According to RHP6 Community Needs Assessment, inadequate services fo r individuals who have been arrested or incarcerated either as a result of or precipitated by unmet behavioral health needs remain a concern in Bexar County. The proposed project will positively impact issues identified by UHS as Mental and Behavioral Health Unique Needs, identification number: How the Project represents a new in itiative or significantly enhan ces an existing delivery system reform initiative: Significant enhancement Related initiatives funded by U.S. Department of HHS . None Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-9 Right Care Right Setting. IT-9.1 Decrease in Mental Health Admissions and r eadmissions to criminal justice settings such as jails or prisons. Reasons/rationale for selecting the outcome measures : Twenty percent of the Bexar County Adult Detention Center (BCADC) populati on includes persons with mental illness. The right place for consistent clinical therapeutic mental health tr eatment is not BCADC or local emergency rooms; the right place is a community-based mental hea lth facility. The lack of access to a therapeutic justice system makes adults with serious mental illness more vulnerable to repetitively entering the criminal justice and courts systems, adve rsely impacting quality of life, and increasing vulnerability. Since the ment ally ill are over-rep resented in low-income populations, improvement in community based treatment and se rvices will benefit a significant share of persons in poverty. Relationship to other Projects: The proposed project will address significant be havioral health care re source insufficiency in Bexar County. As such, it is an integral component of this County's health care infrastructure. Another proposed project seeks to establish research-based care for a segment of the population of adults with mental illness. These resources will be coordinated with CHCS's proposed service expansion, if appropriate, to build a more durable continuum of care. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: UTHSCA is proposing a potentially similar project. CHCS will jo in any collaborative learning communities with UTHSCA or other providers dedi cated to serving adults with mental illness. Plan for Learning Collaborative: CHCS will participate in any a nd all relevant learning collaborat ives organized by University Health System. Project Valuation: 886 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services The value for this project is $3,618,510 for DY 2 and $15,152,433 for all years. A total of 295 adults will be served by the program by the end of DY3. The proposed service expansion increases accessibility of behavioral health care for adults. Additionally, th e availability of the proposed resource will ensure adults with ment al illness are treated expediently, connected to systems of care that support community livi ng and not institutionali zed or incarcerated inappropriately. Services and treatment provided will demonstrate that 75% of the individuals served, 221 consumers will demonstrate improved functional status. CHCS has a significant amount of existing infrastructure from which this project can be launched and only site preparation is required; there by driving down the required investment and increasing the cost effectiveness of the approach. The annual value of benefits provided to those se rved at full implementation considered several factors in valuing this project such as reducing costs at hospita ls, costs for emergency detention and use of psychiatric institutions. This informati on was based on extensive literature as well as a valuation study completed and prepared by professors of the Houston School of Public health and of the UT Austin Center for Social Work Research that was based on the co st utility model, usage of extensive literature of similar interventions, co sts savings and health outcomes related to those interventions. The annual value of benefits provided to those served at full implementation was calculated by multiplying the annual value of a single succe ssful intervention by five. The rationale for selection of a multiplier of five was that to overcome resistance to change in a hard-to-serve population, both in the delivery and payment systems, five years of benefits would be needed. This assumption was verified as valid after an extensive literature review. Cost-utility analysis (CUA) also was used to m easure the cost of the pr ogram in dollars and the health consequences in utility-w eighted units. This valuation us es a quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) analysis that combines health quality (util ity) with length of time in a particular health state. Cost-utility analysis is a useful tool for assessing th e value of new health service interventions because it provides a standard way of valuing multiple types of interventions and programs. The valuation also incorporates costs averted when known (e.g., emergency room visits that are avoided). In order to make the valuations fair across different types of interventions, the common health goal, or ou tcome, is the number of life-years added. The CUA calculations indicate that the availability of therapeutic justice services, in lieu of institutionalization or incarceration, has the po tential to increase QALY among those it serves. 923 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services 137251808.2.1 PASS 1 2.13.1 2.13.1 2.13.1 Design, implement and evaluate research supported and evidence based interventions tailored towards individuals in the target population Center for Health Care Services TPI - 137251808 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 137251808.3.6 3.IT-9.1 Decrease in Mental Health Ad missions and readmissions to criminal justice settings such as jails or prisons Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 P-3: Enroll and serve individuals with targeted complex needs (i.e., a diagnosis of severe mental illness with concomitant chronic physical health conditions, chronic or intermittent homelessness, cognitive issues resulting from severe mental illness, forensic involvement, resulting in extended or repeated stays at inpatient psychiat ric facilities) Metric 1 P-3.1: Number of targeted individuals enrolled or served.

CHCS provides behavioral health services and treatment to children, adolescents and adults. Intervention(s) : CHCS seeks to establish a comprehe nsive, integrated care management center offering primary and behavioral health care to homeless adults living at Prospects Courtyard (PCY) within the Haven for Hope campus. The great majority will have co- occurring mental health and/or substance us e and chronic physical disorders. CHCS, with funding from local public and private stakeholde rs, has established an on-site psychiatric clinic that has exceeded service expectations and continues to grow in utilization and positive impact; however, there remains a critical need for on-site primary care. The new integrated care clinic will prov ide walk-in triage, preliminary diagnostics, initial treatment, referral and follow up for medical care, ps ychiatric care, urgent care, medication management, immunizations, and chronic diseas e prevention strategies. A health navigator will support treatment comp liance through evidenced-based practices, such as motivational interviewing. Also, commonly used medication will be available, a significant unmet need for the target population and a major c ontributing factor to their physical and behavioral health problems. The easily accessed, integrated care clinic will foster greater stability and compliance w ith recommended treatment by a frequently treatment-averse target population, which in turn will reduce crises and the inappropriate utilization of emergency department (ED) servic es. Most patients will be uninsured despite their eligibility for Medicaid because they lack a permanent address. Need for the project : PCY sleeps more than 600 adults per night and cares for more than 700 during the day. The initial goal was to pr ovide a safe sleeping environment, three meals a day and access to showers and bathrooms but it quickly became apparent that untreated physical and behavioral health probl ems were inextricably tied for the target population. Also, it is well documented th at homeless populations routinely access primary health care through hospital emergenc y departments (ED), a costly approach and a major contributor to congestion and over-crowding in urban EDs. Target population : Homeless adults with untreated physical and behavioral health disorders. These adults can be expected to have significant, chronic physical and behavioral health problems and all will be extremely low income. Most will repetitively cycle through the San Antonio State Hospita l and/or University Hospital. Based upon current service information, 16% of the target population will be funded by Medicaid and 57% will be indigent and uninsured. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project seeks to ensure that in DY4, a baseline of 500 residents will receive services and a goal of 125 individuals or 25% will receive integrated services and in DY5, 175 or 35% of baseline w ill receive integrated care. 894 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services Category 3 outcomes: IT-9.2. Our goal, which will be quantified in DY4, is to increase the appropriate util ization of area EDs. Project Description: The Center For Health Care Services (CHC S) seeks to establish a comprehensive, integrated care management center offering primary and behavioral health care at Prospects Courtyard (PCY) within the Have n for Hope campus. The target population will consist of homeless adults living at PCY with co-occurring mental health and/or substance use and chronic physical disorders. CHCS, with funding from local public and private stakeholders, has established an on-site ps ychiatric clinic that has exceeded service expectations and continues to grow in u tilization and positive impact; however, there remains a critical need fo r on-site primary care. The new integrated care clinic will provide wa lk-in triage, preliminary diagnostics, initial treatment, referral and follow up for medical care, psychiatric care, urgent care, medication management, immunizations, and chronic disease prevention strategies. A health navigator will be provided to suppor t treatment complian ce through evidenced- based practices, such as motivational interviewing. Also, commonly used medication will be available, a significant unmet need for the target population and a major contributing factor to their physical and be havioral health problems. The easily accessed, integrated care clinic will foster greater stability and compliance with recommended treatment by a frequently treatm ent-averse target population, which in turn will reduce crises and the inappropriate ut ilization of emergency department (ED) services. The great majority of those who will be served are uninsured despite their eligibility for Medicaid because th ey lack a permanent address. Goals . Improve health outcomes by delivering the right care at the righ t time and the right place. Increase use of preventive, primary and specialty care. Decreas e use of costly ED and inpatient care. Challenges addressed by the project . PCY, initially designed to accommodate 400 homeless adults (June 2010), has grown to sleep ing more than 600 at night and caring for more than 700 during the day. The initial goal was to provide a safe sleeping environment, three meals a day and access to showers a nd bathrooms. However, it quickly became apparent that untreated physic al and behavioral health probl ems were inextricably tied for the target population, with one undermining st ability and improvement of the other. For example, Texans with severe and persistent mental illness die 28 years sooner than the general population. And the most frequent cause s of death, e.g., diseases of the circulatory system, can be effectively addressed through ea rly intervention and primary care that is integrated with behavioral health care. Also, it is well documented that homeless populations routinely access primary health care through hospital emergency departments (ED), a costly approach and a major contributor to congestion and over-crowding in urban EDs. The primary means of getting to an ED is EMS and in 2011, the City of San Antonio's EMS responded to 950 emergency calls at Haven for Hope, resulting in approximatel y 600 transports to area hospital EDs. Two- thirds of these calls were in the evening, signaling the need for extended clinic hours. It is reported that 9 PCY reside nts have died in the last y ear. Reducing costs for area EDs and EMS are worthy goals but both are superseded by the need to avert the tragic loss of life and functioning associated with untreated behavioral and physical illnesses among homeless adults. 894 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services 5-year expected outcomes for CHCS . Development of an integrated care management center to be oriented around the patient so that primary care access and the patient experience can be improved. Decreased emer gency room visits. Decreased use of emergency detoxification servic es. Decrease 911, psychiatric crisis and triage calls. Decreased utilization of emerge ncy transportation services. Decreased utilization of State and crisis transitional psychiatric beds 5-year expected outcomes for persons served by the project . Increased preventive behavioral health behaviors (e.g. vaccinat ions, nutrition, and hygiene). Improved overall primary, mental, and behavioral health outcomes Relation to Regional Goals . Psychiatric triage and primar y care are available within two blocks of PCY but residents wi ll not consistently utilize th ese resources. Therefore, the proposed project supports achievement of th e regional goal of \"Int egrating behavioral health with physical health and other evidence -based services and supports\". It also meets the CMS three part aim, as follows. The program enables and en sures individualized, patient-centered care. The program fills an existing gap in care and improves the existing behavioral health infrastructure to better serve Medicai d and uninsured adults in Bexar County. Starting Point/Baseline: Integrated behavioral and physic al health care is not curren tly available to the target population. However, as previously mentioned, it is known that the City of San Antonio's EMS made over 600 transports to EDs for all Haven for Hope residents. It is unknown how many of these were PCY residents. Rationale: The project option (2.15.1 Design, implement and ev aluate projects that provide integrated primary and behavioral health care services), process milest one (P-6 Develop integrated behavioral health and primary care services within co-located site) and improvement milestone (I-8.1 % of individuals receiving both physical and be havioral health care at the established location) were se lected in correspondence to an existing, unmet need for integrated care among homeless adults. Th e target population of ten has a complex combination of physical and behavioral hea lth care needs combin ed with concomitant issues of substance abuse, traumatic injury, c ognitive challenges and a lack of daily living skills and natural supports, causi ng them to be frequent user s of public health services. This project will expand the capacity of curre ntly available treatment options and will install a new, integrated treatment methodology in an effort to avert outcomes such as the inappropriate use of emergency departments and potentially avoidable inpatient admission and readmission, and to promote recovery in the community. Project Components: Through the PCY Integrated Clinic Care service, we propose to meet all required project components. a) Identify sites for integrat ed care projects, which would have the potential to benefit a significant number of patients in the community. Examples of selection criteria could include proximity/accessibility to target population, physical plant conducive to provider interaction; abi lity / willingness to inte grate and share data electronically; receptivity to integrated team approach. b) Develop provider agreements whereby co scheduling and information sharing betw een physical health and behavioral health providers could be facilitated. c) Establish protocols and processes for communication, data sharing, and referral between be havioral and physical health providers. d) Recruit a number of specialty providers (physical he alth, mental health, 894 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services substance abuse, etc. to provi de services in the specified locations. e) Train physical and behavioral health providers in protocols, effective communication and team approach. Build a shared culture of tr eatment to include specific protocols and methods of information sharing that include: Regular c onsultative meetings between physical health and behavioral health practitioners; Ca se conferences on an individualized as needed basis to discuss individuals served by both types of practitioners; a nd/or, Shared treatment plans codeveloped by both physical health and behavior al health practitioners. f) Acquire data reporting, communication and collect ion tools (equipment) to be used in the integrated setting, which may include an integrated Electr onic health record sy stem or participation in a health information exchange - depending on the size and scope of the local project. g) Explore the need for and develop any necessary legal agreements that may be needed in a collaborative practice. h) Arra nge for utilities and building se rvices for these settings. i) Develop and implement data collection and re porting mechanisms and standards to track the utilization of integrated se rvices as well as the health care outcomes of individual treated in these integrated service settings . j) Conduct quality improvement for project using methods such as rapid cycle improve ment. Activities may include, but are not limited to, identifying project impacts, identifyi ng \"lessons learned,\" opportunities to scale all or part of the project to a broader patient population, and identifying key challenges associated with expansion of the project, including special considerations for safety net populations. Unique community need identifica tion numbers the project addresses: CN.1 - Texas ranks last in the nation on hea lth care quality. RHP 6 is challenged to deliver improved quality a nd patient satisfaction. CN.4 - There is a shortage of high quality mental and behavioral health services that are integrated with physical health and/or provi de crisis stabilization. More specifically, the propos ed project will positively impact the following: Need for integrated behavioral health and primary care services Inadequate access to care mana gement and resource navigation Inadequate resources for special need s populations (e.g., homeless adults, sex offenders) including efficiencies such as integrated behavioral and primary care, pharmacy services, telemedici ne, and physician extenders Inadequate outpatient care for adults with moderate acuity behavioral health needs to support reductions in hospital readmi ssions and the inappropriate use of emergency departments How the Project represents a ne w initiative or significantly enhances an existing delivery system reform initiative: Significant enhancement. Current ly, the targeted population of homeless adults does not receive or access c onsistent primary care and, as a result, are over-represented among individuals with preven table, often life-threatening illnesses. The initiative will remove access barriers for and reduce incidence rates of chronic diseases. Related initiatives funded by U.S. Department of HHS . CHCS recently received a Health Care Innovation grant from CMS to test and ve rify the efficacy of a specific integrated care model for the same target population. Details follow.

The significant enhancement of this project wi ll allow for services to be provided outside of the 260 participants identified above. Project Goals : Improve health care for target in tervention population with complex behavioral and physical health disorders. Improve behavioral and physical health outcomes for target population. Lower the heal th care costs of the target population. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-9 Right Care Right Setting, IT-9.2 ED appropriate utilization. Reasons/rationale for selecting the outcome measures: This measure is indicative of consumers receiving easily accessed care when it is needed most, a critical means of addressing emergent issues and reducing in appropriate use of em ergency departments. Relationship to other Projects: There are multiple projects proposed for RHP 6 that could support or be supported by the PCY Integrated Care Clinic, including increa sed training of the primary care workforce (1.2), implementation of a chronic disease regi stry (1.3), introduce, expand or enhance telemedicine/telehealth ( 1.7), and expand chronic care management models (2.2). Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: There are no similar projects proposed for implementation in RHP 6. However, CHCS will participate in any relevant learning communitie s organized by University Health System. Plan for Learning Collaborative: CHCS will participate in any and all re levant learning collaborative organized by University Health System. Project Valuation: The value for this project for DY 2 is $1,538,919and $6,783,356 for all years. By DY5, 175 homeless individuals with significant, chronic physical and behavioral health problems will receive integrated care every year through the proposed PCY Clinic. The establishment of integrated care at PCY fills an existing gap in the local continuum of behavioral health care for high need adults and frequent ut ilizers of public health care resources. Chronically mentally and physically ill adults will have access to the care required to improve status and stabilize in both domains, which will prevent or reduce costly, avoidable hospitalization and the ina ppropriate use of emergency departments. CHCS has significant existing infrastructure fr om which this project can be launched and only site preparation is requi red, driving down the required in vestment and increasing cost effectiveness. The annual value of benefits provided to thos e served at full implementation considered several factors in valuing this project such as reducing costs at hospitals, costs for emergency detention and use of psychiatric in stitutions. This information was based on extensive literature as well as a valuation st udy completed and prepared by professors of the Houston School of Public health and of the UT Austin Center for Social Work Research that was based on the cost utility mode l, usage of extensive literature of similar interventions, costs savings and health outcomes related to th ose interventions. 894 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services The annual value of benefits provided to those served by the PCY Clinic at full implementation was calculated by multiplying the annual value of a single successful intervention by five. The rationale for selection of a multiplier of five was that to overcome resistance to change in a hard-t o-serve population, both in the delivery and payment systems, five years of benefits woul d be needed. This assumption was verified as valid after an extensive literature review. Cost-utility analysis (CUA) also was used to measure the cost of the program in dollars and the health consequences in utility-weighted units. This valuation uses a quality- adjusted life-years (QALYs) analysis that combin es health quality (uti lity) with length of time in a particular health state. Cost-utility analysis is a useful tool for assessing the value of new health service interventions because it provides a standard way of valuing multiple types of interventions and programs. The valu ation also incorporates costs averted when known (e.g., emergency room visits that are avoided). In order to make the valuations fair across different types of interventions, the co mmon health goal, or outcome, is the number of life-years added. The CUA calculations indicate that the availabi lity of the PCY Clinic has the potential to increase QALY among those it serves. 894 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services 137251808.2.2 PASS 1 2.15.1 2.15.1.

CHCS provides behavioral health services and treatment to children, adolescents and adults. Intervention(s) : The Center For Health Care Services (CHCS) seeks to embed and integrate primary care services at the Rest oration Center, a comprehensive substance abuse treatment facility. Adu lts served at the Restorati on Center will experience enhanced access to primary care, including he alth promotion, disease prevention, health maintenance, counseling, patient education, and diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic illnesses. Frequent co-morbidity of medical conditions and drug dependency among existing Restoration Center consumer s verifies the appr opriateness of the approach. CHCS' Restoration Center serv es up to 10,000 individuals annually with approximately half needing some physical h ealth care during their period of treatment. Additionally, they commonly re quire support for enrollment in benefit programs (e.g., Medicaid), referrals for specia lty care, and access to medicatio ns at low or no cost until health insurance covera ge can be obtained. This is a cost effective service as it dive rts adults away from over-crowded emergency departments. The proposed project will e xpand and scale up an existing Clinic by providing a person-centered health care home for adult consumers of substance abuse and mental health services and their families when they are involved in their care. Results of integrated care will include better functio ning in both domains, improved behavioral and physical health outcomes any lo wer costs to the community. Need for the project: Individuals who utilize substance use treatment and other behavioral health treatments, including those with HIV and pregnant women, often have untreated physical health conditions. In the absence of integrated physical and behavioral health care, these conditions have the potential to worsen and ultima tely require more expensive tertiary care and hospitalization. Target population : Adults with substance abuse with or without other behavioral health disorders and who also have or are at risk for HIV, are pregnant or have other physical health problems. Based upon current service stat istics, it is anticipated that 25% will be covered by Medicaid and 48% w ill be indigent and uninsured.. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project seeks to ensure that in DY4, a goal of 1,250 patients with dual he alth care needs will receiv e integrated car e of 5,000 total patients with dual health care needs and in DY5, 1,750 patients with dual health care needs will receive integrated ca re of the 5,000 total patients. Category 3 outcomes: IT-9.2. Our goal for increasing th e appropriate utilization of ED resources will be established in DY4. 900 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services Project Description: The Center For Health Care Services (CHCS) seeks to embed and integrate primary care services at the Restoration Center, a comprehensive substance abuse treatment facility. Adults served at the Restoration Center will experience enhanced access to primary care, including health promotion, disease preventi on, health maintenance, counseling, patient education, and diagnosis and treatment of acu te and chronic illnesses. Frequent co- morbidity of medical conditions and drug de pendency among existing Restoration Center consumers verifies the appropr iateness of the approach. CHCS ' Restoration Center serves up to 10,000 individuals annually with approximate ly half needing some physical health care during their period of treatment. Add itionally, they commonl y require support for enrollment in benefit programs (e.g., Medicaid), referrals for specialty care, and access to medications at low or no cost until health in surance coverage can be obtained. This is a cost effective service as it diverts ad ults away from over-crowded emergency departments. The proposed project will e xpand and scale up and existing Clinic and increase hours of operation to 24 hours. Re sults will include better behavioral and physical health outcomes at a lower cost to the community. Goals . Improve health care by improving consum ers' capacity to participate and self- manage. Improve health outcomes by delivering the right care (behav ioral then physical) at the right time (once stability and sobriety are achieved) and the right place (behavioral health clinic). Lower the cost of care. Incr ease ease of access and coordination of care for individuals served. Challenges addressed by the project . Individuals in need of substance abuse and other behavioral health treatment, including thos e with HIV or pregnant women, often have untreated physical health conditions. In the ab sence of integrated phys ical and behavioral health care, these conditions have the poten tial to worsen and ultimately require more expensive tertiary care and hospitalization. CHCS' Restoration Center features Re sidential and Ambulat ory Detoxification, Outpatient Substance Abuse Services, Opioid Addiction Treatment Outpatient Services, Sobering Unit, Sober Living Dorms and a Crisis Care Center. The majority of consumers served are episodically homeless and many are chronically homeless. At least 50% also suffer from a co-occurring mental illness and one or more chronic physical illnesses, e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabet es, stroke, cancer, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis and lung disease. Each of these illnesses has a higher prev alence among substance abuse patients, whose diminished capacity limits self-care and fo llow through. These consumers also are likely to perpetually cycle through emergency depart ments, substance abuse treatment settings, crisis care services and shelters. In San Antonio, roughly 45% of these high acuity patients are eligible for Medica id but they are unable to navigate through either the behavioral or physical health systems, causing them to be largely untreated until symptom acuity necessitates a call for an ambulance and a trip to an emergency department. 5-year expected outcomes for CHCS . Development of an integrated care management center to be oriented around the patient so that primary care access and the patient experience can be improved. Decreased emer gency room visits. Decreased use of emergency detoxification serv ices. Decreased 911 calls. Decreased utilization of emergency transportation services. 5-year expected outcomes for persons served by the project . Increased preventive health 900 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services behaviors (e.g. vaccinations, nutrition, hygi ene). Improved overall primary and behavioral health outcomes. Improved physical health status of HIV patients receiving primary care. Relation to Regional Goals . Single-site, integrated primary and behavioral health care is believed to be an innovative approach as it fi rst stabilizes the indi vidual's behavioral health and then enables him or her to partic ipate in and remain compliant with primary care, including chronic disease prevention or treatment. Therefore, the proposed project supports achievement of the regional goal of \"I ntegrating behavioral health with physical health care services in order to impr ove care and access to needed services\" by addressing a population with problems substan ce use that is largely ignored in other settings. It also meets the CMS three part aim, as follows. The program enables and ensures individualized, patient-centered care. The program fills an existing gap in care and improves the existing behavi oral health infrastructure to better serve Medicaid and uninsured adults in Bexar County and cr eates cost savings through reduced use of emergent and urgent care. Starting Point/Baseline: Integrated behavioral and physic al health care is not curren tly available to the target population. Rationale: The project option (2.15.1 Design, implement and evaluate projects that provide integrated primary and behavioral health care services), process milestone (P-6 Develop integrated behavioral health and primary care services within co-located site) and improvement milestone (I-8.1 % of individua ls receiving both physic al and behavioral health care at the establishe d location) were selected in correspondence to an existing, unmet need for integrated care among adults with co-occurring substance use, behavioral and physical health problems. The target popul ation often has a complex combination of physical and behavioral health care needs comb ined with concomitant issues of substance abuse, traumatic injury, cognitive challenges and a lack of daily living skills and natural supports, causing them to be frequent users of public health services . This project will expand the capacity of currently available treatment options and will install a new, innovative sequential treatment methodology in an effort to avert outcomes such as potentially avoidable inpatient admission a nd readmission, and to promote recovery in the community. Project Components: Through the Integrated Primary Care for S ubstance Abuse and HIV population service, we propose to meet all required project compone nts. a) Identify sites for integrated care projects, which would have the potential to benefit a signific ant number of patients in the community.

Reasons/rationale for selecting the outcome measures: This measure is indicative of consumers receiving easily accessed care when it is needed most, a critical means of addressing emergent issues and reducing in appropriate use of em ergency departments. Relationship to other Projects: CHCS is the only provider proposing an integr ated behavioral and primary health care project for adults with substance use disorders in RHP 6. However, this project will 900 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services benefit from other proposed interventions a nd infrastructure capacity enhancements, including increased training of the primary care workforce ( 1.2) available to staff the proposed project and the development of wo rkforce enhancement initiatives to support access to behavioral health providers (1.14). Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: There are no similar proj ects proposed in RHP 6. Plan for Learning Collaborative: CHCS will participate in any and all re levant learning collaborative organized by University Health System. Project Valuation: The value for this project for DY 2 is $1,678,820 and $7,400,024 for all years. By DY5, 1,750 individuals will receive integrated behavioral and physical health care. The establishment of integrated care for adults receiving substance abus e treatment, who may be HIV+ and receiving care fi lls an existing gap in the lo cal continuum of behavioral health care for high need adults and frequent utilizers of public heal th care resources. The availability of this new resource will ensure ad ults receive the treatment they need in an easily accessed location with the capacity to meet needs in both health domains, which will prevent or reduce costly, avoidable hos pitalization and the inappropriate use of emergency departments. CHCS has a significant amount of ex isting infrastructure from which this project can be launched and only si te preparation is requi red; thereby driving down the required investment and increasing th e cost effectiveness of the approach. The annual value of benefits provided to thos e served at full implementation considered several factors in valuing this project such as reducing costs at hospitals, costs for emergency detention and use of psychiatric in stitutions. This information was based on extensive literature as well as a valuation st udy completed and prepared by professors of the Houston School of Public health and of the UT Austin Center for Social Work Research that was based on the cost utility mode l, usage of extensive literature of similar interventions, costs savings and health outcomes related to th ose interventions. The annual value of benefits provided to those served at full implementation was calculated by multiplying the annual value of a single successful intervention by five. The rationale for selection of a multiplier of five was that to overcome resistance to change in a hard-to-serve population, both in the deliver y and payment systems, five years of benefits would be needed. This assumption was verified as valid after an extensive literature review. Cost-utility analysis (CUA) also was used to measure the cost of the program in dollars and the health consequences in utility-weighted units. This valuation uses a quality- adjusted life-years (QALYs) analysis that combin es health quality (uti lity) with length of time in a particular health state. Cost-utility analysis is a useful tool for assessing the value of new health service interventions because it provide s a standard way of valuing multiple types of interventions and programs. The valuation also incorporates costs averted when known (e.g., emergency room visits that are avoided). In order to make the valuations fair across different types of interventions, the common health goal, or 900 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services outcome, is the number of life-years added. The CUA calculations indicate that the availabi lity of integrated care has the potential to increase QALY among those it serves. 900 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services 137251808.2.3 PASS 1 2.15.1 2.15.1.

CHCS provides behavioral health services and treatment to children, adolescents and adults. Intervention(s) : This project results from a colla borative planning effort among area hospitals and CHCS to identif y and engage in treatment a dults with significant unmet behavioral and physical health care n eeds who perpetually cycle through the community's emergency departments (ED) a nd inpatient psychiatric facilities. This population will be most efficiently served, will more likely recover and, as a result their quality of life will improve, if their providers collaboratively plan for their needs. To this end, CHCS is developing protocols and a sh ared cloud-based data platform that will enable ED staff to quickly verify that a pati ent is a super-utilizer and gain access to the community treatment plan. If the individual has been lost from care, e.g., has not filled prescriptions or made recent therapy appoint ments, they will be reconnected to their treatment team before leaving the ED. Also, because all members of the target population have complex health concerns with a hist ory of substantial re liance on acute and sub- acute care, CHCS will expand treatment to en compass a holistic perspective, including integrated primary and behavioral health ca re and clinical and or ganizational alignment with other community providers involved in care. Project staff will be trained in the chronic care wellness and integrated care mode ls to provide effective, evidence-based treatment to the patient population. An important attribute of the propos ed project is that it is patient-centered and in vivo , meeting the patient where he or she is in terms of clinical presentation, readiness for engageme nt and change, need, and physical location. Service selections will be based on the results of comprehensive assessment and integrated treatment planning will ensure linka ge to primary medical, mental health and substance abuse treatment services. A trauma-informed service delivery system will be used. Additional supports will include transition services to foster stability, peer support, specialized therapies, medical services, and residential options. The program will operate in the context of the recovery model in which the individual is encouraged and empowered to take an active role in his or her health and tr eatment, and is provided with tools and supports to ac hieve individual goals. Need for the project : Targeted individuals are not re liably engaged in appropriate, effective or efficient behavioral or primary health care that will ensure their needs are met or that stability and community functioning is restored. In additi on to experiencing sub- standard outcomes for their own health, thei r inappropriate over-uti lization of acute and sub-acute care results in the di version of health care dollars that could be more effectively deployed, exacerbating the health care resour ce deficit in Bexar County. Historically, 906 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services there has not been a mechanism for cross-id entification of these individuals between systems. Target population : The target population consists of a dults with severe mental illness and other factors -- e.g., chronic physical hea lth conditions, chronic or intermittent homelessness, cognitive issues resulting from severe ment al illness and/or forensic involvement -- that produce an over-relia nce on and over-utilization of emergency departments and psychiatric f acilities and inpatient hospita ls. Based upon current service utilization data, it is antici pated that 38% of the target population will be indigent and uninsured and 60% will be covered by Medicaid. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project seeks to enroll and serve individuals with targeted comp lex needs with a baseline of 100 individuals in DY3 with a goal to increase to 125 served. In DY4 the goa l will increase to serving 160 individuals. In DY5, 48 individuals (30%) receiving specialized interventions will demonstrate improved functional status. Category 3 outcomes: IT 10.1. Our goal, Quality of Life. Our goal for improvement in quality of life will be determined in Year 4. This outcome goal will positively impact the need for appropriate diversion from expensive tertiary care, which has been shown to be temporary and not impacting on th e cycle of super utilization. Project Description: The proposed project results from a collabo rative planning effort among area hospitals and CHCS to identify and engage in treatmen t adults with significant unmet behavioral and physical health care needs who perp etually cycle through the community's emergency departments (ED) and inpatient psyc hiatric facilities. This population will be most efficiently served, and will more likely recover, if their providers collaboratively plan for their needs. To this end, CHCS is developing protocols and a shared cloud-based data platform that will enable ED staff to qui ckly verify that a patient is a super-utilizer and gain access to the community treatment pl an. If the individual has been lost from care, e.g., has not filled prescriptions or made recent therapy appointments, they will be reconnected to their treatment team before leaving the ED. Also, because all members of the target population have complex health con cerns with a history of substantial reliance on acute and sub-acute care, CHCS will expand treatment to include a holistic perspective, including integrated primary a nd behavioral health care and clinical and organizational alignment with other community providers involved in care. The project will expand a current CHCS pilot that is developing a community collaborative response to identifying and providing effective interventi ons to high utilizers. Historically, there has not been a mechanism for cross-identific ation of these individuals between systems i.e., where else are they seeking care, and how providers have not worked together to deliver the care that is essential to helping these individuals attain stability and a higher level of functioning. The pilot project is lim ited in scope by funding; the proposed project will expand the numbers served, establish a framework for an effective, integrated community response and foster long-ter m sustainability of the intervention. Project staff will be trained in the chronic ca re wellness and integrated care models to provide effective, evidence-based treatmen t to the patient popul ation. Five licensed Behavioral Health Care Managers will be hired and trained for every 100 new consumers 906 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services served. A psychiatric care provider (MD or APN) will be hired for every 200 new consumers served. An important attribut e of the proposed project is that the comprehensive, community-based interven tions it includes are patient-centered and in vivo, meeting the patient where he or she is in terms of clinical pres entation, readiness for engagement and change, need, and physical location. Service selec tions will be based on the results of comprehensive psychosocial and multi-axial assessment and integrated treatment planning will include linkage to pr imary medical, mental health and substance abuse treatment services. A trauma informed service delivery system will be used and will feature evidence-based practices and tools. Additional supports will include transition services to help establish a stable living environment, peer support, specialized therapies, medical services, and residential options. The program will operate in the context of the recovery mode l in which the individual is encouraged and empowered to take an active role in his or her health and treatment, a nd is provided with tools and supports to achieve individual recovery goals , which will yield m easurable improvement in quality of life. This approach has b een found to be efficacious with the target population and is in direct response to a community-identified need for appropriate diversion from expensive ter tiary care, which has been shown to be temporary and not impacting on the cycle of super utilization. Goals : The goals are to: 1) avert negativ e outcomes, e.g., potentially avoidable psychiatric inpatient admission and readmissi ons, criminal justice involvement and homelessness; 2) break the cycle of overu tilization of ED; 3) promote wellness and adherence to medication and other treatments; and 4) promote recovery in the community and enhanced quality of life. Challenges addressed by the project : The target population consists of adults with severe mental illness and other factors -- e.g., chr onic physical health conditions, chronic or intermittent homelessness, cognitive issues resulting from severe mental illness and/or forensic involvement -- that produce an over-reliance on and over-utilization of emergency departments and psychiatric facili ties. Targeted indivi duals are not reliably engaged in appropriate, effective or efficient behavioral or primary health care that will ensure their needs are met or that stability and community functioning is restored. In addition to experiencing sub-st andard outcomes for their own health, their inappropriate over-utilization of acute and sub- acute care results in the dive rsion of health care dollars that could be more effectively deployed, exace rbating the health care resource deficit in Bexar County. 5-year expected outcomes for CHCS . 1) A comprehensive, collaborative continuum of care is established for the high utilizer population. 2) Scarce behavioral health care resources are more effectively util ized and cost of care is reduced. 5-year expected outcomes for persons served by the project . 1) Expanded access to psychiatric and related clinical services. 2) Increased engagement in care. 3) Reduced reliance upon crisis and emergency care. 4) Restoration of commun ity functioning and quality of life. 4) Recovery. Relation to Regional Goals . Integrating all community care resources on behalf of the highest utilizing population is a key means of achieving the regional goal of \"Improving the infrastructure for delivery of be havioral health services \". It also meets the CMS three part aim, as follows. The program fills an existing gap in care and improves the existing behavioral health infrastructure to better serve high utilizing adults in Bexar County. The program will support last ing community living and reduce hospital 906 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services re-admissions, which will improve outcomes while containing cost growth . Starting Point/Baseline: The initial pilot project is funded for two y ears to serve a cohort of 50 individuals per year and to provide 60 intervention encount ers per year per consumer. The proposed project will enable CHCS to serve an a dditional 50 super-utilizi ng consumers per year. Rationale: The project option, 2.13.1, Design, imp lement, and evaluate research supported and evidencebased interventions tailored towards in dividuals in the ta rget population to include core components: a) Assess size, characteristics a nd needs of target population(s) (e.g., people with severe mental illness and other factors leading to extended or repeated psychiatric inpatient stays. Factors could include chronic physical health conditions; chronic or intermittent homelessness, cognitive issues resulting from severe ment al illness and/or forensic involvement. b) Review literature / experi ence with populations simila r to target population to determine community based interventions that are effective in averting negative outcomes such as repeated or extended i npatient psychiatric hos pitalization, decreased mental and physical functional status, nursing facility admission, forensic encounters and in promoting correspondingly positive health and social outcomes / quality of life. c) Develop project evaluation plan using qualitative and quantitative metrics to determine outcomes. d) Design models which include an appropriate range of community based services and residential supports. e) Assess the impact of interv entions based on standardized quantitative measures and qualitative analysis releva nt to the target population. Examples of data sources include: standard ized assessments of functional, mental and health status (such as the ANSA and SF 36); medi cal, prescription drug and claims/encounter records; participant surv eys; provider surveys. Identify \"lessons learned,\" opportunities to scale all or part of the intervention(s) to a broader patient populations, and identify key challenges associat ed with expansion of the intervention(s), including special cons iderations for safety net populations. Process Milestone P 2, Design community based specialized interventions for target populations; and Improvement Milestone I 5, Functional Status, were selected in correspondence to an existing, unmet need for targeted interventions for super-utilizing adults with a complex constellation of unme t physical and behavioral health needs. The right place for these individuals to access spec ialized services is in community mental health settings. Attendant benefits incl ude: a) positive impact on quality of life by ensuring consistent, appropriate treatment in th e right setting; b) re duce inappropriate use of ED or in-patient psychiat ric facilities; and, c) promot e recovery and wellness with adherence to medication and ot her treatment modalities. CHCS and the collaborating hospitals are conducting ongoing research and have identified multiple, evolving outcomes measures related to practice with this population from NAHQ, SAMHSA, Bureau of Primary H ealth Care, CMS. A Ph.D.-level external 906 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services evaluator has been hired to work with the partners on developing an evaluative framework that captures outcomes related to: re duction in system encounters, Quality of Life Measures, Self Efficacy, and general health measures aligned with NAHQ and the Bureau of Primary Health Care index of m easures. The evaluation also will assess the impact of the intervention usage on standard ized quantitative measures and qualitative analysis. Examples of data sources include : standardized assessm ents of functional, mental and health status (such as the ANSA and SF 36); medical, prescription drug and claims/encounter records; participant survey s; and provider survey s. The collaborators will identify \"lessons learned,\" opportunities to scale all or part of the intervention to a broader patient population, and key challenges. Waiver funding will expand the initial pilo t project and add new community based services, e.g., transitional and supported housing and residential support programs, substance abuse treatment, and incentives fo r recovery. The projec t also will add peer support specialists to the intervention team. Participating consumers will have access to comprehensive screening, assessment, treatm ent planning and care. Behavioral Health Care Managers will provide evidence-based interventions and comprehensive coordination of services and will monitor service use for each patient over time to quantify impact. Performance assessment activities will examine the effect of participation on a specific set of high impact outcomes: 1) emergency room encounters, 2) crisis encounters, 3) psychiatric hosp ital encounters, and 4) criminal justice involvement. Data explorati ons will examine outcome variations for different racial/ethnic groups, and any cost benefits/e ffectiveness for implementing this treatment model. The proposed project will positively addresses CN.4 - Inadequate mental health services results in avoidable costs to hospital and criminal and juvenile justice systems. More specifically, this project will address Inadequate access to care manage ment and resource navigation. Inadequate services for indi viduals who have been arrest ed or incarcerated either as a result or precipitated by unme t behavioral health needs. Inadequate resources for special need s populations (e.g., homeless adults, sex offenders) including efficiencies such as integrated behavioral and primary care, pharmacy services, telemedici ne, and physician extenders. Inadequate outpatient care for adults w ith moderate acuity behavioral health needs to support reductions in hospital readmissions and the inappropriate use of emergency departments. How the Project represents a ne w initiative or significantly enhances an existing delivery system reform initiative: Significant enhancement. Related initiatives funded by U.S. Department of HHS . None Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD 10 Quality Of Life/ Functional Status. IT-10.1 Quality of life This measure is indicative of consumer rete ntion in care and enhan ced stability, both of which are critical means of reducing unnecessa ry hospitalizations a nd the inappropriate use of emergency departments. 906 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services Relationship to other Projects: The proposed project will address signif icant behavioral health care resource insufficiency in Bexar County. As such, it is an integral component of this County's health care infrastructure. A nother proposed project seeks to establish research-based care for a segment of the populati on of adults with mental illn ess. These resources will be coordinated with the proposed project to build a more durable continuum of care. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: UTHSCA is proposing a potential ly similar project. CHCS will join any collaborative learning communities with UTHSCA or other pr oviders dedicated to serving adults with mental illness. Plan for Learning Collaborative: CHCS will participate in a ny and all relevant learning collaboratives organized by University Health System. Project Valuation: The value for this project is $1,602,595 fo r DY 2 and $7,186,790 for all years. By DY4, 160 adults who are high utilizers of behavior al health care will receive targeted, specialized support every year . The introduction of specialized, intensive care for adults with severe mental illness will ensure they are treated expediently, connected to systems of care that will support comm unity living and prevent or reduce costly, avoidable hospitalization, lengthy stays in institutions, further crises and the inappropriate use of emergency departments. CHCS has a significant amount of ex isting infrastructure from which this project can be launched and only si te preparation is requi red; thereby driving down the required investment and increasing th e cost effectiveness of the approach. The annual value of benefits provided to thos e served at full implementation considered several factors in valuing this project such as reducing costs at hospitals, costs for emergency detention and use of psychiatric in stitutions. This information was based on extensive literature as well as a valuation st udy completed and prepared by professors of the Houston School of Public health and of the UT Austin Center for Social Work Research that was based on the cost utility mode l, usage of extensive literature of similar interventions, costs savings and health outcomes related to th ose interventions. The annual value of benefits provided to those served by the proposed program at full implementation was calculated by multiplying the annual value of a single successful intervention by five. The rationale for selection of a multiplier of five was that to overcome resistance to change in a hard-t o-serve population, both in the delivery and payment systems, five years of benefits w ould be needed. This assumption was verified as valid after an extens ive literature review. Cost-utility analysis (CUA) also was used to measure the cost of the program in dollars and the health consequences in utility-weighted units. This valuation uses a quality- adjusted life-years (QALYs) analysis that combin es health quality (uti lity) with length of time in a particular health state. Cost-utility analysis is a useful tool for assessing the value of new health service interventions because it provide s a standard way of valuing multiple types of interventions and programs. The valuation also incorporates costs averted when known (e.g., emergency room visits that are avoided). In order to make the 906 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services valuations fair across different types of interventions, the common health goal, or outcome, is the number of life-years added. The CUA calculations indicate that the avai lability of specialized treatment for high utilizers of behavioral health care has th e potential to increase QALY among those it serves. 906 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services 137251808.2.4 PASS 2 2.13.1 2.13.1 A-E 2.13.1 Design, implement and evaluate research-supported and evidence-based intervention s tailored towards individuals in the target population: Coordinated Community Integrated Care Response for Super-Utilizing Consumers-Expand and Enhance Pilot Project Center for Health Care Services TPI - 137251808 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 137251808.3.10 3.IT-10.1 OD 10 Quality of Li fe/Functional Status 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 P.2.

CHCS provides behavioral health services and treatment to children, adolescents and adults. Intervention(s) : CHCS seeks to establish a 24-bed comprehensive, safe, structured day treatment program and a therapeutic milieu living environment for females on the Haven for Hope campus, to be known as the In -House Women's Wellne ss Program (IHWWP). The majority of consumers will have co-occurri ng mental health and/ or substance use and chronic physical disorders; the program will support return of functioning by integrating and managing all aspects of their care, in cluding offering single-site primary and behavioral health care. The carefully m onitored therapeutic living environment will promote compliance with medication and tr eatment and greater physical and mental health stability. The ultimate goal will be for these highly vulnerable female consumers to enter into and maintain their recovery. Go al achievement will be advanced with the provision of psychosocial trauma focused tr eatment (Seeking Safety), a much-needed intervention given the prevalence of sexual violence the target population has experienced and the correspondingly high rate of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. IHWWP also will provide medication complia nce using the Wellness Self-Management model. Need for the project : CHCS has established an on-site psychiatric cl inic and an In-House Wellness Program (IHWP) dormitory for males at Haven for Hope and both have exceeded service expectations and continue to grow in positive impact. However, there remains a critical need for similar, specialized residential services for females, most of whom have a complex constellation of physical and behavioral health care needs, issues of substance abuse and trauma, cognitive challenges, a lack of daily living skills, and minimal if any natural supports. While deliverin g the right care, at the right time and the right place is the right approach for all, cu rrent data reflects females (55%) are more likely to seek treatment if it is readily available than males (41%). Target population : Homeless females with untreated physical and behavioral health disorders. These women can be expected to have significant, chronic physical and behavioral health problems and all will be extremely low income. Based upon current service information, 16% of the target popul ation will be funded by Medicaid and 57% will be indigent and uninsured. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project seeks to im prove functional status by 37 women (40%) in DY4, increasing to 51 wo men (55%) in DY5 with a baseline of 92 homeless women served in DY3. Category 3 outcomes: IT-10.1. Our goal, to be quantified in DY4, is to improve quality of life. 913 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services Project Description: CHCS seeks to establish a 24-bed comprehens ive, safe, structured therapeutic living milieu for females at the Haven for Hope campus. The majority of residents will be transitioning from Prospects Courtyard (PCY ) and will have co-occurring mental health and/or substance use and chronic physical disorders; the program will support their transition by integrating and managing all aspects of their care, including offering single- site primary and behavioral health care. The carefully monitored environment will promote compliance with medication and tr eatment and greater physical and mental health stability. The ultimate goal will be for these highly traumatized female consumers to obtain and maintain recovery. CHCS, with funding from public and private stakeholders, has established an on-site psychiatric clinic and an In-House Men's Wellness Program (IHWP) dormitory serving males; both of which have exceeded service expectations and continue to grow in utilization and positive impact. However, there remains a critical need for similar, specialized residential services for females, most of whom have a complex constellation of physical and behavioral health care need s, issues of substa nce abuse and trauma, cognitive challenges and a lack of daily livi ng skills, and minimal if any natural supports. The new In-House Women's Wellness and day treatment Program (IHWWP) will address each of these presenting problems with the provision of psychosocial trauma focused treatment (Seeking Safety), a much-needed intervention given the prevalence of sexual violence the target population has experienced and the corr espondingly high rate of Post- Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). IHWWP also will provide medication compliance (Day Treatment) through evidenced-based prac tices, such as Wellness Self-Management (WSM). Core components will be provided or available, including residential assistance, psychosocial rehabilitation, supported empl oyment, prescription medications, peer support, substance abuse servic es, and employment supports. Goals . Improve health outcomes by delivering the right care at the righ t time and the right place. Increase use of preventive, primary and specialty care. Decreas e use of costly ED and inpatient care. Challenges addressed by the project . PCY, initially designed to accommodate 400 homeless adults (June 2010), has grown to sleep ing more than 600 at night and caring for more than 800 during the day. PCY data show s that 30% of this population is female. Untreated physical and beha vioral health problems are pervasive among the target population. As a result, Texans with severe and persistent mental illness were found to die 28 years sooner than the general population and the predominant causes of death were chronic illness, e.g., heart di sease, lung disease, cancer. The most frequent causes of death for females were heart disease and stroke3, both of which can be effectively addressed through integrated physical and be havioral health care. However, in the absence of easily accessed, integrated care, st udies show that homeless persons routinely use hospital emergency departments (ED), a cost ly substitution and a major contributor to congestion and over-crowding in urban ED. Als o, the primary means of transport to an ED for homeless persons is EMS and in 2011, the City of San Antonio's EMS responded to 950 emergency calls at Haven for Hope, re sulting in approximately 600 transports to area ED. Finally, while delivering the right care, at the right time and the right place is the right approach for all, current data refl ects females (55%) are more likely to seek treatment, if readily available, than males (41%) 2. 913 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services 5-year expected outcomes for CHCS . 1) Development of an integrated care management model oriented around the female patient that features accessible, integrated primary and behavioral health care . 2) Decreased inappropr iate ED visits. 3) Decreased 911, psychiatric crisis and triage ca lls. 4) Decreased ina ppropriate utilization of EMS. 5) Decreased utiliza tion of State and crisis tran sitional psychiatric beds. 6) Implementation of CQI activities as directed by the SAMHSA evidence-based toolkit for Permanent Supported Housing. 5-year expected outcomes for persons served by the project . 1) Increased preventive physical health behaviors (e.g. vaccinations, nutrition, hygiene). 2) Improved overall primary, mental, and behavioral health outcome s. 3) Improved patient experience of care. Relation to Regional Goals . Psychiatric triage and primar y care are available within two blocks of PCY but residents wi ll not consistently utilize th ese resources. Therefore, the proposed project supports achievement of th e regional goal of \"Int egrating behavioral health with physical health and other ev idence-based services and supports\". The program also enables and en sures individualized, female person-centered care, filling a gender gap in care and improving the existing behavioral health infrastructure to better serve Medicaid and uninsured female adults. 1World Health Organization www.who.int/ mental http://www.samhsa.gov/index.aspx Lethbridge-\u00c7ejku M.

Vital Health Stat 10(232). 2006. 4 Retrieved from http://www.statehealthfacts.org/profileind.jsp?cat=15&rgn=45 on 10/28/12 Starting Point/Baseline: Integrated behavioral and physic al health care is not curren tly available to the target population. The City of San Antonio's EMS made over 600 transports to ED for all Haven for Hope residents. Also, while men have access to comprehensive, safe, structured, integrated care management (the CHCS-operated In House Men's Wellness Program), women do not . This unacceptable, gender-based health disparity will be addressed by the In-House Women's Wellness Program. Rationale: The project option \"Other\" ( 2.13.2 Implement other evidence ba sed project to provide an intervention for a targeted behavioral hea lth population to prevent unnecessary use of services in an innovative manner), pro cess milestone P2: Design community based specialized interventions for target p opulation) and improvement milestone ( I-5.1 % of individuals receiving specialized interven tions who demonstrate improved functional status on standardized instrume nts) were selected in corres pondence to an existing, unmet need for a comprehensive, safe, structure d, integrated care management program for high-need, homeless females in Bexar County. The target population often has a complex combination of physical and behavioral hea lth care needs combin ed with concomitant issues of substance abuse, traumatic injury, c ognitive challenges and a lack of daily living skills and natural supports, causi ng them to be frequent user s of public health services. This project will expand available treatment options (SS, WSM, and Matrix Psychosocial EBPs) for females and will establish a parallel, 24 bed dormitory (IHWWP) for females. Outcomes to be realized will include reductions in the inappropriate use of ED, 913 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services reductions in potentially avoidable inpatie nt admission and readmission, and promotion of recovery. CHCS has demonstrated the abilit y to improve functional status in this high need population through the existing, SA MHSA-funded Project HOMES, with outcomes that include significant functional improve ment from baseline to 6 month follow-up. The IHWWP addresses CN.4 - shortage of hi gh quality mental and behavioral health services that are inte grated with physical health care services and/or provide crisis stabilization. More specifically it addresses: Need for integrated behavioral health and primary care services for homeless females Inadequate access to care mana gement and resource navigation Inadequate resources for special need s populations (e.g., homeless adults, sex offenders) including efficiencies such as integrated behavioral and primary care, pharmacy services, telemedici ne, and physician extenders Inadequate outpatient care for adults with moderate acuity behavioral health needs to support reductions in hospital readmi ssions and the inappropriate use of emergency departments New initiative or significant enhancement of existing initiative . New initiative. Related initiatives funded by U.S. Department of HHS . Other federal funding will not be used for this project. However as part of the continuum of housing and treatment services, clients being served in this propos ed project are likely to benefit from other services offered by other separate programs that are funded by federal monies. CHCS recently received a Health Care Innovation gran t from CMS to test and verify the efficacy of a specific integrated care model for the same target population. CHCS also received funding for Project HOMES, referenced above from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to serve the target population of high need homeless males and females. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): The impact of the proposed primary and behavior al health care integr ation project can be measured by one stand-alone Category 3 Outcome Measure. 1) OD-10 Quality of Life/Functional Status, IT- 10.1 Quality of Life. IT-10-1a . In a similar activity -- Project HOMES -- CHCS has already demonstrated statistically significant quality of life improvements using the SF-36 ( IT-10-1b ). Project HOMES will collaborate with the IHWWP to acquire permanent housing for the targeted population. IT-10-1c . Quality improvement will be monitored by SF-36 outcomes consisting of a pre-post single group design. The IHWWP target population also will be baselined and followed up at six (6) months. 913 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services Relationship to other Projects: There are multiple projects proposed for RHP 6 that could support or be supported by the In-House Women's Wellness Program, including increased training of the existing and additional peer workforce (1.2), implementati on of a chronic disease registry (1.3), introduce, expand or enhance telemedicine/t elehealth (1.7), and expand chronic care management models (2.2). Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: There are no similar project s proposed for implementation in RHP 6. However, CHCS will participate in any relevant learning communities organized by University Health System. Plan for Learning Collaborative: CHCS will participate in any and all re levant learning collaborative organized by University Health System. Project Valuation: The value for this project for DY 2 is $1,006,831 and $4,369,746 for all years. By DY5, 92 homeless women with significant, chronic physical and behavioral health problems, many of which are exacerbated by le ngthy histories of trauma, will receive day treatment and therapeutic milieu living services every year . The establishment of the In- House Women's Wellness Program fills an existing gap in the local continuum of behavioral health care for high need female a dults and frequent uti lizers of public health care resources. The availability of this ne w resource will ensure homeless females receive the treatment they need in an easily accessed location with the capacity to meet needs in both health domains, and are stabilized, wh ich will prevent or reduce costly, avoidable hospitalization and the inappropriate use of emergency departments. CHCS has a significant amount of existing infrastructure fr om which this project can be launched and only site preparation is re quired; thereby driving down the required investment and increasing the cost effectiveness of the approach. The annual value of benefits provided to thos e served at full implementation considered several factors in valuing this project such as reducing costs at hospitals, costs for emergency detention and use of psychiatric in stitutions. This information was based on extensive literature as well as a valuation st udy completed and prepared by professors of the Houston School of Public health and of the UT Austin Center for Social Work Research that was based on the cost utility mode l, usage of extensive literature of similar interventions, costs savings and health outcomes related to th ose interventions. The annual value of benefits provided to those served by the In-House Women's Wellness Program at full implementation wa s calculated by multiplying the annual value of a single successful intervention by five. The rationale for selection of a multiplier of five was that to overcome resistance to cha nge in a hard-to-serve population, both in the delivery and payment systems, five years of benefits would be needed. This assumption was verified as valid after an extensive literature review. Cost-utility analysis (CUA) also was used to measure the cost of the program in dollars 913 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services and the health consequences in utility-weighted units. This valuation uses a quality- adjusted life-years (QALYs) analysis that combin es health quality (uti lity) with length of time in a particular health state. Cost-utility analysis is a useful tool for assessing the value of new health service interventions because it provide s a standard way of valuing multiple types of interventions and programs. The valuation also incorporates costs averted when known (e.g., emergency room visits that are avoided). In order to make the valuations fair across different types of interventions, the common health goal, or outcome, is the number of life-years added. The CUA calculations indicate that the avai lability of the In-House Women's Wellness Program has the potential to increa se QALY among t hose it serves. 913 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services 137251808.2.5 PASS 2 2.13.2 N/A 2.13.2 Implement other evidence-based project to provide an intervention for a targeted beh avioral health population to prevent unnecessary use of services: In House Women's Wellness Program (IHWWP)/Day Treatment Center for Health Care Services TPI - 137251808 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 137251808.3.11 3.IT-10.1 Quality of Life/Functional Status Year 2 (10/1/2012 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 P2: Design community based specialized interventions for target population.

Hill Country serves a 14,390 s quare mile area of RHP6 with a population of approximately 401,123 in 2012. Intervention(s) : This project will implement two Mobile Crisis Outreach Teams (one for Kerr and Gillespie counties and one for Val Verde County) to provide 24 hour a day, 7 day a week behavioral health crisis interv ention and crisis follow up services within the community setting in order to reduce emergency department u tilization, incarceration and hospitalizations. Need for the project : Between Gillespie, Kerr and Val Verd e counties, Hill Country responded to 444 behavioral health crisis episodes be tween September 2011 and August 2012. Providing committed Mobile Crisis Outreach Teams transitions from screening for psychiatric hospitalization to providing community crisis services and supports aimed at helping the individual stabilize in the community. Target population : The target population is individuals within Gillespie, Kerr and Val Verde counties who have a behavioral health cris is. Between September 2011 and August 2012 this consisted of 444 individuals. Approximately 32% of our behavioral health patients within RHP6 have Medicaid and approximately 82% have income below $15,000 per year. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project aims to establish two Mobile Crisis Outreach Teams which will have provided community based behavioral health crisis and crisis follow-up services to a minimu m of 190 individuals within the community (30 in DY3; 60 in DY4 and .100 in DY5) Category 3 outcomes: IT-10.2 Activities of Daily Living (DLA-20) Our goal is to have, at a minimum, 20% of the individuals served by the Mobile Crisis Outreach Teams showing improvement on the Activities of Daily Living (D LA-20) which demonstrates stabilizing the individual in the community thus reducing th e need for inpatient hospitalization, emergency department utilization and incarceration. 913 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers Project Description: Hill Country MHDD Centers does not currently have Mobile Crisis Outreach Teams within the eleven counties served by Hill Country from Re gional Health Plan 6. Mobile Crisis Outreach Team services are would be available 24 hours/day, 7 days per week. According to Evaluation Findings for the Crisis Se rvices Redesign Initiative published by Texas A&M University in January 2010, the development of Mobile Cr isis Outreach Teams moves the focus from screening individuals for state hos pitalization to considering other intervention strategies tailored to the needs of the particular s ituation thus increasing the likelihood that crises can be resolved in the community. Mobile Crisis Outreach Team (MCOT) activities include Crisis Assessment, Treatment Placement, and Preventive Crisis S upport Services. MCOT staff not only help resolve crisis episodes, they al so help recovering consumers re gain stability and resiliency to avoid relapse by providing temporary supports, providing support and care for individuals in eminent danger of or following a crisis, and provide follow-up care for consumers recently released from a psychiatric hospita l. Mobile Crisis Outreach Teams typically are comprised of a combination of Qualified Mental Health Professi onals, Licensed Practitioners of the Healing Arts, psychiatrists, and nurses. Hill Country MHDD Centers is pl anning to implement two Mobile Crisis Outreach Teams. Based on the number of consumer s who had crisis calls during fiscal year 2012, one Mobile Crisis Outreach Team would be serve Gillesp ie and Kerr counties where 315 individuals had crisis episodes during the last year and one would serv e Val Verde County along the Texas Mexico border where 129 indivi duals had crisis episodes duri ng the last fiscal year. Challenges: The primary challenge for implementation of the project is recruiting be havioral health staff available on a 24 hour basis. Hill Country will address the cha llenge by offering incentive, if necessary, and utilizing Psychiatrists for cons ultation for the Mobile Crisis personnel through telephone and telemedicine. Goals: The goal of this project is to establish altern atives to reduce emergency department utilization, inpatient utilization, and incarcer ation by developing wrap around se rvices within the community for individuals in psychiatric crisis. By the end of five years, Hill Count ry will have established two additional Mobile Crisis Outreach Teams which will have provided services to a minimum of 190 consumers within the community ( 30 in DY3; 60 in DY4 and 100 in DY5). Relationship to the Regional Goals: The goal of this project is to use Mobile Crisis Outreach Teams to provide behavioral health crisis services, wrap around and follow up servic es based on each individual's needs within the community setting. By providing th ese services in the community, Hill Country will be meeting the regional goal of the Triple Aim by providing patients high-quality and patient-centered care, in the most cost effective way. In addition, the establishment of the Mobile Crisis Outreach Teams will help achieve the regional goal to improve the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of Gillespie, Kerr and Val Verde counties. 913 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers Starting Point/Baseline: Hill Country MHDD Centers currently operates a M obile Crisis Outreach Team in Hays County which is outside of Regional Healthcare Partners hip 6. Hill Country will utilize the experience and lessons learned from operation of the Hays C ounty Mobile Crisis Outreach Team to establish two Mobile Crisis Outreach Teams in Regiona l Healthcare Partnership 6. The Hays County Mobile Crisis Outreach Team served 228 consumer s during the most recent fiscal year. Hill Country MHDD Centers currently does not operate a Mobile Crisis Outreach Team within Regional Health Partnership 6. Therefore, the ba seline number of participants begins at 0 in DY2. Rationale: Hill Country MHDD Centers is pl anning to implement two Mobile Crisis Outreach Teams. Based on the number of consumer s who had crisis calls during fiscal year 2012, one Mobile Crisis Outreach Team would be serve Gillesp ie and Kerr counties where 315 individuals had crisis episodes during the last year and one would serv e Val Verde County along the Texas Mexico border where 129 individu als had crisis episodes during th e last fiscal year. Mobile Crisis Outreach Teams are designed to avoid psychiatric hospitalization whenever possible by providing services within the community. Mobile Crisis Outreach Team (MCOT) activiti es include Crisis Assessment, Treatment Placement, and Preventive Crisis Support Services . MCOT staff not only help resolve crisis episodes, they also help recove ring consumers regain stability a nd resiliency to avoid relapse by providing temporary supports, prov iding support and care for individu als in eminent danger of or following a crisis, and provide follow-up care for c onsumers recently released from a psychiatric hospital. Mobile Crisis Outreach Teams typically are comprised of a combination of Qualified Mental Health Professionals, Licensed Practitio ners of the Healing Arts, psychiatrists, and nurses. Project Components: Through the Mobile Crisis Outreach Teams, H ill Country MHDD Centers proposes to meet all required project components: A) Assess size, characteristics and needs of target population . Hill Country will collect and analyze information on individuals who have a behavioral health crisis and review contributing factors such as homelessness, noncompliance with medication, diagnosis, unemployment, economic struggles and other fa ctors contributing to crisis episodes in order to determine appropriate staffing and sk ill sets necessary for service provision as well as specific locations for Mobile Crisis Outreach Teams. B) Review literature / experience with populations similar to target population to determine community based interventions that are effective in averting negative outcomes such as repeated or extended inpatient psychiatric hospitalization, decreased mental and physical functional status, nursing facility admissi on, forensic encounters and in promoting correspondingly positive health and soci al outcomes / quality of life. Based on the size, characteristics and needs for the target popul ation, Hill Country will review appropriate literature and experiences regard ing serving individuals in be havioral health crisis in order to provide targeted training for st aff and to develop innovative wrap around services to help avert future crisis episodes. 913 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers C) Develop project evaluation plan using qualita tive and quantitative metrics to determine outcomes . Hill Country will develop a project eval uation plan that will review items such as the number of individuals served, the issues leading to the crisis, the services received, the number of individuals receiving follow up services after the crisis episode, the number of individuals with r ecurring crisis episodes, and pr ogression on the Activities of Daily Living assessment. D) Design models which include an appropriate range of community- based services and residential supports. Based on the size, characteristics and needs for the target population, Hill Country will train Mobile Cr isis Outreach Team staff in the most appropriate interventions to address the need s of the individuals and in connecting the individuals with other appropriate resources within the community. E) Assess the impact of interventions based on standardized quantitative measures and qualitative analysis relevant to the target popul ation based on information from the Adult Needs and Strength Assessment and/or participant surveys, and identify opportunities to scale all or part of the inter vention(s) to a broader patient population and identify key challenges associated with expansion of the intervention(s) , including special considerations for safety-net populations. Hill Country will util ize the Activities of Daily Living assessment to determine progression of individuals recei ving Mobile Crisis Outreach Team services. In addition, H ill Country will do follow up surveys with individuals who receive Mobile Crisis Outreach Team services to determine satisfaction with services and to help ensure stabiliza tion of symptoms in or der to avert additional crisis episodes. Unique community need identificatio n number the project addresses: CN.4 There is a shortage of high quality mental and behavioral health servic es that are integrated with physical health and/or pr ovide crisis stabilization. How the project represents a new in itiative or significantly enhan ces an existing delivery system reform initiative: Hill Country does not have a Mobile Crisis Outreach Team within Regional Healthcare Partnership 6. Through funding provi ded by the Texas Department of State Health Services, Hill Country provides a Crisis Hotline certified by th e American Association of Suicidology and sends Qualified Mental Health Professionals to address the immediate needs of the crisis and determine if the individual is appropriate for psychiatric hospitalizati on. The addition of the Mobile Crisis Outreach Teams would give comm itted staff to providing ongoing crisis services in order to reduce the number psychiatric hospita lizations and avert recurr ence of the psychiatric crisis. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-10 Quality of Life/Functional Status IT-10.2 Activities of Daily Living Reasons/rationale for selec ting the outcome measure: Mobile Crisis Outreach Team service impacts an i ndividual's mental health and thus their quality 913 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers of life. It impacts the individual's self care as well as their ability to cope with their environment. When an individual is unable to prope rly care for themselves or to cope with their local environment, they are at greater risk of unemployment and poor health. The Activities of Daily Living will be utilized to provide an overview of functional status, determine activity limitations, establish a baseline for treatment, provide a guide for inte rvention planning, to evaluate interventions and monitor progress and to plan fo r future services and discharge. The Activities of Daily Living will be measur ed utilizing the DLA-20 Functional Assessment. The DLA-20 Functional Assessment is a functional assessment, proven to be reliable and valid, designed to assess what daily living areas are im pacted by mental illne ss or disability. The assessment tool identifies where outcomes are need ed so clinicians can address those functional deficits on individualized service plans. THE DL A-20 is intended to be used by all disabilities and ages. Developmental Disabilities and Alc ohol/Drug Abuse forms are personalized for daily functional strengths and problems a ssociated with those diagnoses. THE DLA-20 utilizes the followi ng 20 domains: Health Prac tices, Housing Stability and Maintenance, Communication, Safety, Managing Time, Nutrition, Problem Solving, Family Relationships, Alcohol/Drug Use, Leisure, Co mmunity Resources, Social Network, Sexuality, Productivity, Coping Skills, Behavior Norms, Pe rsonal Care/Hygiene, Grooming, and Dress. For the targeted population, individuals with Co-occurring Psychiatri c and Substance Use Disorder, the DLA-20 will identify and address areas the disorders have impacted such as Alcohol/Drug Use, Social Network, Productiv ity, Housing Stability and Maintenance and Managing Money. Relationship to other Projects: Provision of Mobile Crisis Outreach Team services as an alternative to inpatient and emergency department services reinforces obj ectives for all other behavioral he alth services provided by Hill Country through Regional Healthcare Part nership 6 (1333340307.2.2 Psychiatric Consultation, 133340307.2.3 Co-occurring Psychiatric and Substa nce Use Disorder Services, and 133340307.2.4 Trauma Informed Care) by providing sp ecialized services addressing crisis episodes and aimed at averting reoccurrence of cris is episodes experienced by an individual that if not addressed in the commun ity may result in needing inpa tient psychiatric services. Addressing the crisis episode in the community enables the individual to move forward with treatments and to be more successful in their r ecovery. In addition, by addressing crisis in the community, exacerbation of symptoms are reduc ed resulting in a reduction of Emergency Department utilization and potentially preventable hospital admissions (RD-1-3) Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Hill Country MHDD Centers is the lo cal mental health authority that provides services within the following counties of Regional Healthcare Partnership 6: Bandera, Comal, Edwards, Gillespie, Kendall, Kerr, Kinney, Medina, Re al, Uvalde and Val Verde. The other three local mental health authorities (Bluebonnet Tr ails, Camino Real, and Center for Healthcare Services) provides mental health services to the remaining countie s within Regional Healthcare Partnership 6 and service areas do not overlap. Hi ll Country is committed to ongoing advancement of services for the individuals we serve and is willing to par ticipate in a learning collaborative with other providers within the region to c ontinually improve serv ices and data collec tion and to identify how to address additional n eeds that may arise. 913 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers Plan for Learning Collaborative: Hill Country MHDD Centers will participate in a learning collaborative that meets annually to discuss local disparities in care and the ways they have successfully gather ed relevant data and ultimately better served the populations in the projects. Project Valuation: Project valuation is based on a weighted aver age of Achieving Waiver Goals, Addressing Community Needs, Project Scope, and Project In vestment. The valuation is supported by cost- utility analysis which measures program cost in dollars and the health co nsequences in utility- weighted units called quality- adjusted life-years (QALYs). QALYs incorporate costs averted when known (e.g., emergency room visits that area avoided). The valuation on this project is based on 190 consumers over the life of the proj ect resulting in a valuation overall of $15,642 per individual served. 960 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers 133340307.2.1 PASS 1 2.13.1 2.13.1 A-E 2.13.1 Provide an intervention for a targeted behavioral health population to prevent unnecessary use of services in a specific setting: Mobile Crisis Outreach Teams Hill Country Community MHMR Center (dba Hill Country MHDD Centers) TPI - 133340307 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 133340307.3.1 3.IT-10.2 Activities of Daily Living Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 P-2: Design community-based specialized intervention for target population Metric 1 P-2.1: Project plans based on evidence/experience and which address the project goals Baseline: No intervention has been designed Goal: Submission of project plan Data Source: Project documentation Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $626,102 Milestone 2 [I-X]: Number of individuals beginning service during demonstration year Metric 1 [I-X.1]: Number of targeted individuals beginning services during demonstration year (Mobile Crisis Outreach Teams) Baseline/Goal: Baseline - 0 individuals served; Goal - 30 individuals beginning service during DY3 Data Source: Hill Country MHDD records/EHR Milestone 2 Estimated Incentive Payment: $653,159 Milestone 3 P-4: Evaluate and continuously improve interventions Metric 1 P4.1: Project planning and implementation documentation demonstrates plan, do, study act quality improvement cycles Baseline: No evidence of improvement initiatives Goal: Documentation of how monthly real-time data is used for rapid-cycle improvement to guide continuous quality improvement Data Source: Hill Country MHDD records Milestone 3 Estimated Incentive Payment: $ 329,955 Milestone 5 P-4: Evaluate and continuously improve interventions Metric 1 P4.1: Project planning and implementation documentation demonstrates plan, do, study act quality improvement cycles Baseline: DY4 improvement initiatives Goal: Documentation of how monthly real-time data is used for rapid-cycle improvement to guide continuous quality improvement Data Source: Hill Country MHDD records Milestone 5 Estimated Incentive Payment: $ 337,550 961 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers Milestone 4 [I-X]: Number of individuals beginning service during demonstration year Metric 1 [I-X.1]: Number of targeted individuals beginning services during demonstration year (Mobile Crisis Outreach Teams) Baseline/Goal: Baseline - 0 individuals beginning service in DY2; Goal - 60 individuals beginning service during DY4 (for a total of 90) Data Source: Hill Country MHDD records/EHR Milestone 4 Estimated Incentive Payment: $329,955 Milestone 6 [I-X]: Number of individuals beginning service during demonstration year Metric 1 [I-X.1]: Number of targeted individuals beginning services during demonstration year (Mobile Crisis Outreach Teams) Baseline/Goal: Baseline - 0 individuals beginning service in DY2; Goal - 100 individuals beginning service during DY5 (for a total of 190) Data Source: Hill Country MHDD records/EHR Milestone 6 Estimated Incentive Payment: $337,550 Year 2 Estimated Milestone Bundle Amount: $626,102 Year 3 Estimated Milestone Bundle Amount: $653,159 Year 4 Estimated Milestone Bundle Amount: $659,910 Year 5 Estimated Milestone Bundle Amount: NTIVE PAYMENTS FOR 4-YEAR PERIOD: $2,614,271 962 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers Identifying Project and Provider Information: Title: 2.16.1 Provide virtual psychiatric and clini cal guidance to all participating primary care providers delivering services to behavioral patients regionally: Hill Country Virtual Psychiatric and Clinical Guidance Unique RHP ID#: 133340307.2.2 - PASS 1 Provider Name: Hill Country Community MHMR Center (dba Hill Country MHDD Centers) TPI: 133340307 Project Summary: Provider Description : Hill Country Community MHMR Center (dba Hill Country MHDD Centers) is a community mental health center pr oviding mental health, substance use disorder, early childhood intervention and intellectual and developmental disability services to the following counties of RHP6 (Bandera, Comal, Edwards, Gillespie, Kendall, Kerr, Kinney, Medina, Real, Uvalde and Val Verde). Hill Country serves a 14,390 s quare mile area of RHP6 with a population of approximately 401,123 in 2012. Intervention(s) : This project will implement psychiatri c and clinical guidance 24 hour a day, 7 day a week for primary care physicians and hos pitals within the 11 counties served by Hill Country in RHP6 in order to help physicians identify and treat behavioral health symptoms earlier in order to avoid exacerbation of symp toms into a behavioral health crisis. Need for the project : In meetings with the six general hos pitals throughout Hill Country's service area in RHP6, the hospitals noted that one of th e greatest needs for their doctors is psychiatric consultation. In addition, ten of the eleven counties served by Hill Country in RHP6 are designated as Entire County Hea lthcare Provider Shortage Ar eas for Mental Health. Target population : The target population is individuals within Bandera, Comal, Edwards, Gillespie, Kendall, Kerr, Kinney, Medina, R eal, Uvalde and Val Verde counties who demonstrate behavioral health symptoms and s eek treatment at area hospitals or with their primary care physician. Based on the population se rved in Hill Country's behavioral health program in RHP6, approximately 32% of our be havioral health patient s within RHP6 have Medicaid and approximately 82% have income below $15,000 per year. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project aims to establish psychiatric and clinical guidance 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for prim ary care physicians and hospitals with the 11 counties served by Hill Country in RHP6 which w ill provide psychiatric consultation and clinical guidance to primary care physicians and hospitals in order to identify behavioral health symptoms and to begin treatment as soon as possible. The project seeks to provide 4,000 psychiatric consultations by the end of DY5 (500 during DY3; 1,500 during DY4; and 2,000 during DY5)for the 11 counties served by Hill Country in RHP6. Category 3 outcomes: (PHQ- A/BDI-PC) 5% of population between 12 and 18 years of age have had PHQ-A or BDI-PC screening performed in order to identify symptoms and treat adolescents with symptoms of depression IT-12.5 Other USPSTF-endorsed screening outcome measures (PHQ-9) 5% of population over 963 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers 18 years of age have had PHQ-9 screening perfor med in order to identify symptoms and treat adults with symptoms of depression IT-12.5 Other USPSTF-endorsed screening out come measures (CAGE/AUDIT) 5% of population over 18 years of age have had a CAGE or AUDIT screening performed in order to identify symptoms and treat adults with substance use disorder Project Description: According to Mental Health Care by Family Physicians, a paper prepared by the American Academy of Family Physicians, \"Mental health issues are frequently unrecognized and even when diagnosed are often not treated adequatel y. Recognition and treatment of mental illness are significant issues for primary care physicians, who pr ovide the majority of mental health care. In a recent national survey of mental health care, 18% of the surveyed population with and without a DSM-IV diagnosis of a mental health disord er sought treatment during a 12 month period, with 52% of those visits occurring in the general medical (all primary care) sector. Estimates are that 11% to 36% of primary care patients have a psyc hiatric disorder, with one recent survey of mental health conditions in urban family medici ne practices revealing th at over 40% of survey respondents met criteria for a mental health disorder.\" Recognition and treatment of mental illness are si gnificant issues for primary care physicians, who provide the majority of mental health care. Due to ten of the eleven counties served by Hill Country MHDD Centers being designa ted as Mental Health Professi onal Shortage areas, there is a need to develop Psychiatric C onsultation services and have th em available for Primary Care Physicians and hospitals throughout the region to assist with complex psychiatric needs. Challenges: The greatest challenge of the project will be r ecruitment of necessary personnel due to being Mental Health Professional Shortage areas. Hi ll Country will address th e challenge by offering incentives as necessary. Goals: The goal of this project is to provide PCPs and hospitals within Bandera, Comal, Edwards, Gillespie, Kendall, Kerr, Kinney, Medina, Real , Uvalde and Val Verde counties with the necessary resources and guidance to adequately treat patients who present with behavioral health conditions through Psychiatric Consultation. By the end of five years, Hill Country MHDD Centers will have an established psychiatric consultation service available for all primary care providers and hospitals within th e eleven counties with at least fifty providers enrolled and a minimum of twenty percent of primary care physic ians within the counties utilizing the service will be satisfied with the psychiat ric consultation provided for patients in their care. Overall, the availability of Psychiatric C onsultation should result in earlier identificati on and treatment of mental health issues and increase integration of services for individua ls seeking psychiatric assistance in the primary care setting. Relationship to Regional Goals: The goal of this project is to establish Virtual Psychiatric and Clinical Guidance to Primary Care Physicians and Hospitals. By providing Virtua l Psychiatric and Clinical Guidance in the community, Hill Country will be meeting the regional goal of the Triple Aim by providing 964 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers patients high-quality and patient -centered care, in the most co st effective way. In addition, providing consultation and guidance to primary care physicians further develops and maintains a coordinated care delivery system. Starting Point/Baseline: There are currently no dedicated resources for behavioral health cons ultation available to hospitals and primary care physicians within the el even counties served by Hill Country within RHP 6. No formal structure currently exists fo r primary care physicians and hospitals to obtain clinical guidance regarding patients presen ting with behavioral health issues. Rationale: Hill Country MHDD Centers serves eleven coun ties (Bandera, Comal, Edwards, Gillespie, Kendall, Kerr, Kinney, Medina, Real, Uvalde and Val Verde) within Regional Healthcare Partnership 6. Ten of the eleven counties se rved by Hill Country MHDD Centers are designated as Entire County Healthcare Provider Shortage Areas for Mental Health (Bandera, Comal, Edwards, Gillespie, Kerr, Kinney, Medina, Real, Uv alde and Val Verde) As such, resources for psychiatric and clinical guidance to primary car e providers delivering se rvices to behavioral health patients is very limited and not formalized throughout the area. The eleven counties served by Hill Country MH DD within RHP6 have a total population of 401,123 in 2012. Within the eleven counties, ther e are six general hospitals (CHRISTUS Santa Rosa New Braunfels, Hill Country Memorial , Peterson Regional Me dical Center, Medina Regional Hospital, Uvalde Memorial Hospital, and Val Verde Regional Medical Center) and there are three hundred thirty-four physicians with their primary practice location listed in the area. Of these three hundred th irty-four physicians, ni nety-five have their specialty listed as Family Practice or General Practice. Project Components: As a formal structure for psyc hiatric consultation for primary care physicians and hospitals does not exist within the eleven counties, Hill Count ry MHDD Centers proposes to meet all required project components: A) Establish the infrastruc ture and clinical expertise to provide remote psychiatric consultative services. Hill Country will review and improve telecommunication equipment based on estimated volume of services a nd recruit appropriate clinical staff with the clinical expertise to provide remote psychiatric consultative services. B) Determine the location of primary ca re settings with a high number of individuals with behavioral health di sorders (mental health and substance abuse) presenting for services, and where ready access to behavioral health expertise is lacking. Identif y what expertise primary care providers lack and what they identify as their greatest needs for psychiatric and/or substance abuse treatment consultation via survey or other means. Hill Country will surv ey area hospitals and primary care physicians to determine the poten tial volume of consultati on needed as well as the primary types of issues wher e consultation is need ed. The survey will include areas of needed consultation, estimated of occurrences for consultation, as well as the means by which the primary care physician wishes to receive consultation. 965 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers C) Assess applicable models for deployment of virtual psychiatric consultative and clinical guidance models Based on feedback from primary care physicians and hospitals, Hill Country will review successful models of psychiatric consu ltation and assess the models for applicability to the region being served to determine the most appropriate methods to implement. D) Build the infrastructure needed to co nnect providers to virtual behavioral health consultation. Hill Country will revi ew current telecommunica tion capacity and improve telecommunication and telemedicine equipment based on estimated volume of services and connections needed to perform consultation effi ciently and effectively based on the volume of services estimated and the model of consultation being provided. Hill Country will also develop staffing patterns and acquire all necessary personnel to ensure appropriate clinical expertise is available for consultation regarding both a dult and children's ment al health needs. E) Ensuring staff administering virtual psychiatric consultative services are available to field communication from medical staff on a 24-hour basis. Hill Country will staff the program for 24 hour a day coverage, will survey hospitals and primary care physicians to ensure clinical guidance is available 24 hours a day as needed, and conduct random mystery calls for clinical guidance to ensu re 24 hour virtual psychiatric consultative services are available. F) Identify which medical disciplines wi thin primary care settings (nursing, nursing assistants, pharmacists, primary care physicians, etc.) could benefit from remote psychiatric consultation . Based on the recommended model of implementation for the service area and feedback from primary care physicians, ar ea hospitals and other medical providers, Hill Country will conduct needs assessments to determine which primary care settings could benefit from remote psychiatric consultation. G) Provide outreach to medical disciplines in primary care settings that are in need of telephonic behavioral health expertise and communicate a clear protocol on how to access these services. Based on needs assessments and survey, Hill Country will develop protocol and enter memorandums of understanding which define a clear protocol on how to access the remote psychiatric consultation. H) Identify clinical code modifiers and/or modify electronic health record data systems to allow for documenting the use of telephonic behavioral health consultation. Hill Country will add necessary service codes and m odifiers to the EHR and other tracking documents within the agency to track all activity of the telephonic behavioral health consultation. I) Develop and implement data collection and reporting standards for remotely delivered behavioral health consultative services. Hill Country will formalize procedures for collecting and reporting on activ ities associated with remotely delivered behavioral health consultative services. J) Review the intervention(s) impact on access to tele phonic psychiatric consults and identify \"lessons learned,\" opportunities to scale all or part of the intervention(s) to a broader patient population, and identify key challenges associated with expansion of the in tervention(s), including special considerations for safety net populations Hill Country will continually review with primary care providers how the service has supported their practice, ways to improve the service, and how to expand the service to additional providers. Unique community need identificatio n number the project addresses: 966 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers CN.4 There is a shortage of high quality mental and behavioral health servic es that are integrated with physical health and/or pr ovide crisis stabilization. How the project represents a new in itiative or significantly enhan ces an existing delivery system reform initiative: There are currently no Virtual Psychiatric Consul tation services available within the counties served by Hill Country in RHP6. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-12 Primary Care and Primary Prevention IT-12.5 Other outcome measures (PHQ-A/BDI-PC) The number PHQ-A/BDI-PC performe d by Primary Care Physicians on patients/individuals enrolled to receive behavioral health cons ultation will be divided by the 12 to 18 year population of Bandera, Comal, Edwards, Gillespie, Kendall, Kerr, Kinney, Medina, Real, Uvalde and Val Verde as determ ined by Texas Department of State Health Services population estimates. IT-12.5 Other USPSTF-endorsed screen ing outcome measures (PHQ-9) The number of PHQ-9 performed by Primary Care Physicians on patients/individuals enrolled to receive behavioral health cons ultation will be divided by the population over 18 of Bandera, Comal, Edwards, Gillespie, Ke ndall, Kerr, Kinney, Medi na, Real, Uvalde and Val Verde as determined by Texas Department of State Health Servi ces population estimates. IT-12.5 Other USPSTF-endorsed screening outcome measures (CAGE and AUDIT) The number of CAGE/AUDIT perfor med by Primary Care Physicia ns on patients/individuals enrolled to receive behavioral health cons ultation will be divided by the population over 18 of Bandera, Comal, Edwards, Gillespie, Ke ndall, Kerr, Kinney, Medi na, Real, Uvalde and Val Verde as determined by Texas Department of State Health Servi ces population estimates Reasons/rationale for selec ting the outcome measure: The screening instruments above were selected as a method for primary care providers to identify issues that may require virtual psychiatric consultation. By performing the instruments, early diagnosis and intervention of potential symptoms may be addressed in order to avoid escalation of symptoms into a crisis episode. Relationship to other Projects: Provision of Virtual Psychiatric Consultation se rvices reinforces objectives for all other behavioral health services provided by Hill Country through Regional Healthcare Partnership 6 (1333340307.2.1 Mobile Crisis Outreach Teams, 133340307.2.3 Co-occurring Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorder Services, and 133340307.2.4 Trauma Informed Care) by providing specialized consultative services ad dressing behavioral health issues before they become a crisis. Addressing the behavioral health issues in the community enables the individual to move forward with treatments and to be more successf ul in their recovery. In addition, by addressing crisis in the community, exacerbation of sympto ms are reduced resulting in a reduction of Emergency Department utilization and potenti ally preventable hospital admissions (RD-1-3) 967 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Hill Country MHDD Centers is the lo cal mental health authority that provides services within the following counties of Regional Healthcare Partnership 6: Bandera, Comal, Edwards, Gillespie, Kendall, Kerr, Kinney, Medina, Re al, Uvalde and Val Verde. The other three local mental health authorities (Bluebonnet Tr ails, Camino Real, and Center for Healthcare Services) provides mental health services to the remaining countie s within Regional Healthcare Partnership 6 and service areas do not overlap. Hi ll Country is committed to ongoing advancement of services for the individuals we serve and is willing to par ticipate in a learning collaborative with other providers within the region to c ontinually improve serv ices and data collec tion and to identify how to address additional n eeds that may arise. Plan for Learning Collaborative: Hill Country MHDD Centers will participate in a learning collaborative that meets annually to discuss local disparities in care and the ways they have successfully gather ed relevant data and ultimately better served the populations in the projects. Project Valuation: Project valuation is based on a weighted aver age of Achieving Waiver Goals, Addressing Community Needs, Project Scope, and Project In vestment. The valuation is supported by cost- utility analysis which measures program cost in dollars and the health co nsequences in utility- weighted units called quality- adjusted life-years (QALYs). QALYs incorporate costs averted when known (e.g., emergency room visits that area avoided). The valuation on this project is based on an estimated 4,000 consultations for indi vidual patients over the life of the project (500 during DY3; 1,500 during DY4; and 2,000 during DY5) re sulting in a valua tion per patient of $1,486.04. 968 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers 133340307.2.2 PASS 1 2.16.1 2.16.1 A-J 2.16.1 Provide virtual psychiatric and clinical guidance to all participating primary care provi ders delivering services to behavioral patients regiona lly: Hill Country Virtual Psychiatric and Clinical Guidance Hill Country Community MHMR Center (dba Hill Country MHDD Centers) TPI - ng measures (CAGE and AUDIT) Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 P-2: Design psychiatric consultation services that would allow medical professionals in primary care settings to access professional behavioral health expertise (via methods such as telephone, instant messaging, video conference, facsimile, and email) Metric 1 P-2.1: Baseline: No intervention has been designed Goal: Submission of project plan Data Source: Project documentation Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $1,252,203 Milestone 2 P-3: Enroll primary care settings into the remote behavioral health consultation services Metric 1 P-3.1: Number of PCP settings that use psychiatric consultative services Baseline: 0 providers enrolled Goal: Enroll 30 providers Data Source: Signed enrollment agreements Milestone 2 Estimated Incentive Payment: $ 653,159.50 Milestone 3 P-4: Determine the impact of the project Metric 1 P-4.1: Develop Milestone 4 P-3: Enroll primary care settings into the remote behavioral health consultation services Metric 1 P-3.1: Number of PCP settings that use psychiatric consultative services Baseline: 0 providers enrolled Goal: Have cumulative of 50 providers enrolled Data Source: Signed enrollment agreements Milestone 4 Estimated Incentive Payment: $439,940 Milestone 5 P-5: Evaluate and continuously improve psychiatric consultative services Milestone 7 P-5: Evaluate and continuously improve psychiatric consultative services Metric 1 P-5.1: Project planning and implementation documentation demonstrates plan, do, study act quality improvement cycles Baseline: DY 4 Process initiative Goal: Documentation of data analysis and how data was utilized to improve service delivery at least 6 times during the year Data Source: Project reports include documentation of how real-time data was used for rapid-cycle improvement to guide continuous quality 969 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers evaluation plan including metrics, operation and evaluation protocols Baseline: No intervention has been designed Goal: Develop formal plan for Quality and Utilization Management of project including development of clinical code modifiers and data collection as well as satisfaction of physicians receiving consultation services Data Source: Project documentation including formal plan for Quality and Utilization Management of project including development of clinical code modifiers and data collection as well as satisfaction of physicians receiving consultation services Milestone 3 Estimated Incentive Payment: $ 653,159.50 Metric 1 P-5.1: Project planning and implementation documentation demonstrates plan, do, study act quality improvement cycles Baseline: No intervention has been designed Goal: Documentation of data analysis and how data was utilized to improve service delivery at least 6 times during the year Data Source: Project reports include documentation of how real-time data was used for rapid-cycle improvement to guide continuous quality improvement Milestone 5 Estimated Incentive Payment: $439,940 Milestone 6 [I-X]: Number of patients/individuals receiving psychiatric consultation Metric 1 [I-X.1]: Number of targeted individuals receiving psychiatric consultation Baseline/Goal: Baseline - 500 individuals receiving psychiatric consultation in improvement Milestone 7 Estimated Incentive Payment: $675,101 Milestone 8 [I-X]: Number of patients/individuals receiving psychiatric consultation Metric 1 [I-X.1]: Number of targeted individuals receiving psychiatric consultation Baseline/Goal: Baseline - 500 individuals receiving psychiatric consultation in DY3;

Hill Country serves a 14,390 s quare mile area of RHP6 with a population of approximately 401,123 in 2012. Intervention(s) : This project will implement Co-occu rring Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorder Services within the 11 counties served by Hill Country in RHP6 in order to meet the needs of individuals with psychiatric and substa nce use issues within the community setting in order to reduce emergency department utilizat ion, inpatient utilization, and incarceration. Need for the project : Of the 4,490 individuals receiving ment al health services through Hill Country in RHP6, 924 report substance use whil e 351 report substance use at a level that interferes with their daily lives and/or medicatio ns. In meeting with area hospitals, individuals with psychiatric disorders who al so abuse substances end up in their emergency departments. Target population : The target population is individuals within Bandera, Comal, Edwards, Gillespie, Kendall, Kerr, Kinney, Medina, Real, Uvalde and Val Verde counties who have a psychiatric diagnosis and abuse substances. Based on the populat ion served in Hill Country's behavioral health program in RH P6, approximately 32% of our beha vioral health patients within RHP6 have Medicaid and approximately 82% have income below $15,000 per year. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project aims to estab lish Co-occurring Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorder serv ices within the 11 counties se rved by Hill Country in RHP6 which will provide psychiatric and substance use di sorder services within the community setting in order to reduce emergency department utiliz ation and incarceration. The project seeks to provide services to a minimum of 234 individuals entering serv ice from the 11 counties served by Hill Country in RHP6 by the end of DY5 (new enrollees 50 in DY3; 84 in DY4; and 100 in DY5). Category 3 outcomes: IT-10.2 Activities of Daily Living (DLA-20) Our goal is to have, at a minimum, 20% of the individuals served by th e Co-occurring Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorder services showing improvement on the Activities of Daily Living (DLA-20) which demonstrates stabilizing the indi vidual in the community thus reducing the need for inpatient hospitalization, emergency department utilization and incarceration. 972 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers Project Description: According to SAMHSA statistics on co-occurring disorders, 25.7 percent of all adults with serious mental illness also suffer from substanc e use dependence and 19.7 pe rcent of adults with any mental illness also suffer from substance us e dependence. Hill Country currently serves over 4,490 adults with Severe and Persistent Ment al Illness on an annua l basis within eleven counties of RHP 6 (Bandera, Comal, Edwards, Gillespie, Kendall, Kerr, Kinney, Medina, Real, Uvalde and Val Verde). Of the 4,490 individu als served, 924 report substance use while 351 report substance use at a level th at interferes with their daily lives and/ or medication. Throughout the 22,000 square mile service delivery area of Hill Country MHDD Centers, there is one individual dedicated to Co-occurr ing service delivery. By expa nding this service, Hill Country can better address the need of individuals w ith co-occurring psychiatric and substance use disorder. Hill Country MHDD Centers is pl anning to add Co-occurring Ps ychiatric and Substance Use Disorder services throughout the eleven count y area served by Hill Country in RHP6. Hill Country currently serves over 4,490 adults with Severe and Persistent Mental Illness on an annual basis within eleven counties of RHP 6 (Bandera, Comal, Edwards, Gillespie, Kendall, Kerr, Kinney, Medina, Real, Uvalde and Val Verd e). Of the 4,490 individua ls served, 924 report substance use while 351 report substance use at a leve l that interferes with their daily lives and/or medication. Throughout the 22,000 square mile se rvice delivery area of Hill Country MHDD Centers, there is one indi vidual dedicated to Co-occurring service delivery. Challenges: The primary challenge for implementation of the project is recruiting licensed staff. Hill Country will address the challenge by offering incentives as necessary. Goals: The goal of this project is to establish Co-o ccurring Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorder services throughout the eleven c ounty area in order to reduce em ergency department utilization, inpatient utilization, and incarcer ation by developing wrap around se rvices within the community for the targeted population. By the end of five years, Hill Country will have established Co- occurring Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorder specialists which will have provided services to a minimum of 234 consumers within the community over the life of the project (new enrollees 50 in DY3; 84 in DY4; and 100 in DY5). Relationship to the Regional Goals: The goal of this project is to establish Co-o ccurring Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorder services based on each individual' s needs within the community setting. By providing these services in the community, Hill Country will be meeting the regional goal of the Triple Aim by providing patients high-quality a nd patient-centered care, in the most cost effective way. In addition, the establishment of Co-occurring Psychiat ric and Substance Use Disorder services will help achieve the regional goal to improve the he alth care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of the elev en counties served by Hill Country in RHP6. 973 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers Starting Point/Baseline: Hill Country MHDD Centers currently has one individual specializing in delivering Co- occurring Psychiatric an d Substance Use Disorder services who serves forty individuals on an annual basis. This project will expand the serv ice to all 11 counties served by Hill Country in RHP6. Rationale: Hill Country will identify and train licensed chem ical dependency counselors in the provision of co-occurring psychiatric and substa nce use disorder services such as substance abuse services, cognitive processing therapy, psyc hosocial rehabilitation and wrap around services to help the individual Project Components: Through the Co-occurring Psychiatric and Subs tance Use Disorder services, Hill Country MHDD Centers proposes to meet a ll required project components: A. Assess size, characteristics and needs of target population . Hill Country will collect and analyze information on individuals who have co-occurring psychiatric and substance use disorder and review contributing factors to episodes in order to determine appropriate staffing and skill sets necessary for service provision as well as specific locations. B. Review literature / experience with populations similar to target population to determine community based interventions that are effective in averting negative outcomes such as repeated or extended inpatient psychiatric hospitalization, decreased mental and physical functional status, nursing facility admissi on, forensic encounters and in promoting correspondingly positive health and soci al outcomes / quality of life. Based on the size, characteristics and needs for the target popul ation, Hill Country will review appropriate literature and experiences re garding serving individuals co-occurring psychiatric and substance use disorder in order to provid e targeted training for staff. Primary concentration will be based on SAMSHA's Integrated Treatment for Co-Occurring Disorders Evidence-Bas ed Practices Kit. C. Develop project evaluation plan using qualita tive and quantitative metrics to determine outcomes . Hill Country will develop a project eval uation plan that will review items such as the number of individuals served, the serv ices received, the nu mber of individuals receiving follow up services, the number of individuals with recurring issues, and progression on the Activities of Daily Living assessment. D. Design models which include an appropriate range of community- based services and residential supports. Based on the size, characteristics and needs for the target population, Hill Country will train Co-occurring Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorder specialists in the most appropriate interventi ons to address the needs of the individuals and in connecting the individuals with other appropriate resources w ithin the community. E. Assess the impact of interventions based on standardized quantitative measures and qualitative analysis relevant to the target popul ation based on information from the Adult Needs and Strength Assessment and/or participant surveys, and identify opportunities to scale all or part of the inter vention(s) to a broader patient population and identify key challenges associated with expansion of the intervention(s) , including special considerations for safety-net populations. Hill Country will util ize the Activities of Daily Living assessment to determine progressi on of individuals receiving Co-occurring 974 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorder se rvices. In addition, Hill Country will do follow up surveys with individua ls who receive services to determine satisfaction with services and to help ensure stabilization of symptoms. Unique community need identificatio n number the project addresses: CN.4 There is a shortage of high quality mental and behavioral health servic es that are integrated with physical health and/or pr ovide crisis stabilization. How the project represents a new in itiative or significantly enhan ces an existing delivery system reform initiative: Hill Country MHDD Centers currently has one individual specializing in delivering Co- occurring Psychiatric an d Substance Use Disorder services who serves forty individuals on an annual basis. This individual is funded through the Texas Department of State Health Services contract which includes federal and state funds . This project will expand the service to all 11 counties served by Hill Country in RHP6. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-10 Quality of Life/Functional Status IT-10.2 Activities of Daily Living Reasons/rationale for selec ting the outcome measure: Co-occurring Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorder impacts an individual's mental health and thus their quality of life. It impacts the individua l's self care as well as their ability to cope with their environment. When an indi vidual is unable to properly care for themselves or to cope with their local environment, they are at greater risk of unemployment and poor health. The Activities of Daily Living will be utilized to pr ovide an overview of functional status, determine activity limitations, establish a ba seline for treatment, provide a guide for intervention planning, to evaluate interventions and monitor progress an d to plan for future and for discharge. The Activities of Daily Living will be measured utilizing the DLA-20 Functional Assessment. The DLA-20 Functional Assessment is a functional assessment, proven to be reliable and valid, designed to assess what daily living areas are im pacted by mental illne ss or disability. The assessment tool identifies where outcomes are need ed so clinicians can address those functional deficits on individualized service plans. THE DL A-20 is intended to be used by all disabilities and ages. Developmental Disabilities and Alc ohol/Drug Abuse forms are personalized for daily functional strengths and problems a ssociated with those diagnoses. THE DLA-20 utilizes the followi ng 20 domains: Health Prac tices, Housing Stability and Maintenance, Communication, Safety, Managing Time, Nutrition, Problem Solving, Family Relationships, Alcohol/Drug Use, Leisure, Co mmunity Resources, Social Network, Sexuality, Productivity, Coping Skills, Behavior Norms, Pe rsonal Care/Hygiene, Grooming, and Dress. For the targeted population, individuals with Co-occurring Psychiatri c and Substance Use Disorder, the DLA-20 will identify and address areas the disorders have impacted such as Alcohol/Drug Use, Social Network, Productiv ity, Housing Stability and Maintenance and Managing Money. 975 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers Relationship to other Projects: Provision of Mobile Crisis Outreach Team services as an alternative to inpatient and emergency department services reinforces obj ectives for all other behavioral he alth services provided by Hill Country through Regional Healthcare Partne rship 6 (133340307.2.1 Mobile Crisis Outreach Teams, 1333340307.2.2 Psychiatric Consultation , and 133340307.2.4 Trauma Informed Care) by providing specialized services addressing Co-occ urring Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorder for an individual that if not addressed in th e community may result in needing inpatient psychiatric services. Providing the services in the community enables the individual to move forward with treatments and to be more succe ssful in their recovery. In addition, by providing services in the community, exace rbation of symptoms are reduced resulting in a reduction of Emergency Department utilization and potenti ally preventable hospital admissions (RD-1-3) Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Hill Country MHDD Centers is the lo cal mental health authority that provides services within the following counties of Regional Healthcare Partnership 6: Bandera, Comal, Edwards, Gillespie, Kendall, Kerr, Kinney, Medina, Re al, Uvalde and Val Verde. The other three local mental health authorities (Bluebonnet Tr ails, Camino Real, and Center for Healthcare Services) provides mental health services to the remaining countie s within Regional Healthcare Partnership 6 and service areas do not overlap. Hi ll Country is committed to ongoing advancement of services for the individuals we serve and is willing to par ticipate in a learning collaborative with other providers within the region to c ontinually improve serv ices and data collec tion and to identify how to address additional n eeds that may arise. Plan for Learning Collaborative: Hill Country MHDD Centers will participate in a learning collaborative that meets annually to discuss local disparities in care and the ways they have successfully gather ed relevant data and ultimately better served the populations in the projects. Project Valuation: Project valuation is based on a weighted aver age of Achieving Waiver Goals, Addressing Community Needs, Project Scope, and Project In vestment. The valuation is supported by cost- utility analysis which measures program cost in dollars and the health co nsequences in utility- weighted units called quality- adjusted life-years (QALYs). QALYs incorporate costs averted when known (e.g., emergency room visits that area avoided). The valuation on this project is based on 234 consumers over the life of the pr oject resulting in a overall value of $19,054 per individual served. 976 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers 133340307.2.3 PASS 1 2.13.1 2.13.1 A-E 2.13.1 Provide an intervention for a targeted behavioral health population to prevent unnecessary use of services in a specific setting: Co-occurring Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorder Hill Country Community MHMR Center (dba Hill Country MHDD Centers) TPI - 133340307 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 133340307.3.5 3.IT-10.2 Activities of Daily Living Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 P-2: Design community-based specialized intervention for target population Metric 1 P-2.1: Project plans based on evidence/experience and which address the project goals Baseline: Program is currently only available in Kerr and Gillespie counties Goal: Submission of project plan Data Source: Project documentation Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $939,152 Milestone 2 [I-X]: Number of individuals beginning service during demonstration year Metric 1 [I-X.1]: Number of targeted individuals beginning services during demonstration year (Co-occurring Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorder) Baseline/Goal: Baseline - 0 individuals served; Goal - 50 individuals beginning service during DY3 Data Source: Hill Country MHDD records/EHR Milestone 2 Estimated Incentive Payment: $979,740 Milestone 3 P-4: Evaluate and continuously improve interventions Metric 1 P4.1: Project planning and implementation documentation demonstrates plan, do, study act quality improvement cycles Baseline: No evidence of improvement initiatives Goal: Documentation of how monthly real-time data is used for rapid-cycle improvement to guide continuous quality improvement Data Source: Hill Country MHDD records Milestone 3 Estimated Incentive Payment: $ 494,933 Milestone 4 Milestone 5 P-4: Evaluate and continuously improve interventions Metric 1 P4.1: Project planning and implementation documentation demonstrates plan, do, study act quality improvement cycles Baseline: DY4 improvement initiatives Goal: Documentation of how monthly real-time data is used for rapid-cycle improvement to guide continuous quality improvement Data Source: Hill Country MHDD records Milestone 5 Estimated Incentive Payment: $ 506,326 Milestone 6 977 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers [I-X]: Number of individuals beginning service during demonstration year Metric 1 [I-X.1]: Number of targeted individuals beginning services during demonstration year (Co-occurring Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorder) Baseline/Goal: Baseline - 0 individuals served; Goal - 84 individuals beginning service during DY4 (for a total of 134) Data Source: Hill Country MHDD records/EHR Milestone 4 Estimated Incentive Payment: $494,933 [I-X]: Number of individuals beginning service during demonstration year Metric 1 [I-X.1]: Number of targeted individuals beginning services during demonstration year (Co-occurring Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorder) Baseline/Goal: Baseline - 0 individuals served; Goal -100 individuals beginning service during DY5 (for a total of 234) Data Source: Hill Country MHDD records/EHR Milestone 6 Estimated Incentive Payment: $506,326 Year 2 Estimated Milestone Bundle Amount: $939,152 Year 3 Estimated Milestone Bundle Amount: $979,740 Year 4 Estimated Milestone Bundle Amount: $989,866 Year 5 Estimated Milestone Bundle Amount: NTIVE PAYMENTS FOR 4-YEAR PERIOD: $3,921,410 978 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers Identifying Project and Provider Information: Title: 2.13.1 Provide an intervention for a targ eted behavioral health population to prevent unnecessary use of services in a specif ic setting: Trauma Informed Care Unique RHP ID#: 133340307.2.4 - PASS 1 Provider Name: Hill Country Community MHMR Center (dba Hill Country MHDD Centers) TPI: 133340307 Project Summary: Provider Description : Hill Country Community MHMR Center (dba Hill Country MHDD Centers) is a community mental health center pr oviding mental health, substance use disorder, early childhood intervention and intellectual and developmental disability services to the following counties of RHP6 (Bandera, Comal, Edwards, Gillespie, Kendall, Kerr, Kinney, Medina, Real, Uvalde and Val Verde). Hill C ountry serves a 14,390 square mile area of RHP6 with a population of approximately 401,123 in 2012. Intervention(s) : This project will implement Trauma In formed Care Services within the 11 counties served by Hill Country in RHP6 in order to meet the needs of individuals who have experienced trauma that is impacting their be havioral health. The project will incorporate community education on the impact of trauma through Mental Health First Aid training and Trauma Informed Care training, and will provide trauma services through interventions such as Seeking Safety, Trust Based Relational Intervention and Cognitive Processing Therapy in order to help individuals deal with trauma they have experienced. Need for the project : Studies have shown that the majority of individuals w ho are incarcerated have suffered traumatic experiences and that i ndividuals who suffer traumatic experiences are 300% more likely to develop ischemic heart diseas e. By treating trauma, individuals address the trauma in their life and reduce the chance of internalizing the trauma resulting in physical illnesses, a behavioral health crisis, or in reactions that may resu lt in incarceration. Target population : The target population is individuals within Bandera, Comal, Edwards, Gillespie, Kendall, Kerr, Kinney, Medina, Real , Uvalde and Val Verde counties who have suffered trauma. Based on the population served in Hill Country's behavioral health program in RHP6, approximately 32% of our behavioral he alth patients within RHP6 have Medicaid and approximately 82% have income below $15,000 per year. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project aims to establish Trauma Informed Care within the 11 counties served by Hill Country in RHP6. Trauma Info rmed Care will provide community education on identifying trauma symp toms and treatment for individuals who have suffered from trauma in an effort to identify tr auma symptoms early and begin treatment to avoid emergency department utilization and incarceration. The project s eeks to provide services to a minimum of 200 individuals from the 11 counties se rved by Hill Country in RHP6 by the end of DY5(number anticipated beginning service by year, DY3 40; DY4 60; DY5 100). Category 3 outcomes: IT-10.2 Activities of Daily Living (DLA-20) Our goal is to have, at a minimum, 20% of the individuals served by the Trauma Informed Care showing improvement on the Activities of Daily Living (D LA-20) which demonstrates stab ilizing the individual in the community thus reducing the need for inpa tient hospitalization, emergency department 979 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers utilization and incarceration. Project Description: According to Dr. Eric Kandel's New Intellectua l Framework for Psychol ogy, studies show that medication doesn't change molecular structur e of the brain - experiences do. When an individual is exposed to trauma over long periods, it drastically effects their mental health. Further research indicates that many child ren diagnosed with ADD and ADHD are actually suffering from trauma and PTSD. In the article Diagnosis: ADHS - or Is It Trauma?, it is noted that seven of 10 children have been exposed to at least one potentially tr aumatic event and that preschoolers who had experienced multiple traumatic events were 16 times more likely to have attention problems and 21 times more likely to be overly emotionally re active including showing symptoms of depression and anxiety than ch ildren who had not had such experiences. Traumatic experiences can be dehumanizing, shocking or terrifying, singular or multiple compounding events over time, and often include be trayal of a trusted person or institution and a loss of safety. Trauma can result from experien ces of violence. Trauma includes physical, sexual and institutional abuse, neglec t, intergenerational trauma , and disasters that induce powerlessness, fear, recurre nt hopelessness, and a constant stat e of alert. Trauma impacts one's spirituality and relationships with self, others , communities and environment, often resulting in recurring feelings of shame, guilt, rage, isol ation, and disconnection. In the July-Sept. 2012 Youth Law New, Trauma-Informed Care Emerging as Proven Treatment for Children, Adults with Behavioral, Mental Health Problems, states, \"Children who ar e physically or sexually abused, or who go through other trauma-induci ng experiences can develop mental health disorders and related problems. Indeed, trau ma can fundamentally affect how a young person grows and develops.\" Acco rding to a study cited in Trauma among Girls in the Juvenile Justice System, A person traumatized in childhood may resort to criminal behavior. When a survey of all juvenile detainees nationwid e, 93.2% per cent of males and 84% of females reported having had a traumatic experience. In Kaise r's Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) study researchers looked at patients with ACE scores of 7 or higher who didn' t smoke, didn't drink to excess, and weren't overweight. The study revealed that the risk of ischem ic heart disease (the most common cause of death in the United Stat es) was 360 percent higher than for patients who scored a 0 on the ACE. (Paul Tough, \"The Poverty Clinic: Can a Stressful Childhood Make You a Sick Adult?\", The New Yorker, March 21, 2011). Trauma-informed care is an appro ach to engaging people with hist ories of trauma that recognizes the presence of trauma symptoms and acknowledges the role that trauma has played in their lives. The National Center for Trauma Informed Care, a division of SA MHSA, facilitates the adoption of trauma-informed environments in the delivery of a broad range of services including mental health, substance use, housing, vocationa l or employment support, domestic violence and victim assistance, and peer support. Challenges: The primary challenge for implementation of the pr oject is recruiting behavi oral health staff. Hill Country will address the challeng e by offering incentive as necessary. 980 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers Goals: The goal of this project is to establish Trau ma Informed Care throughout the eleven counties served by Hill Country in RHP6. The project will consist of developing Healthy Communities through the use of Mental Health First Aid Training and Trau ma Informed Care training as a means to help the community unders tand the impact of trauma and to help identify symptoms of trauma for earlier treatment. In addition, a system of trauma counseling will be developed including practices such as Seeking Safety, Trust Based Relational Intervention, and Cognitive Processing Therapy in order to he lp individuals deal with trauma they have experienced The primary challenge of the project will be re cruitment and training of staff for initial implementation. By the end of five years, Hill Country's goal is to ha ve trained at least 500 individuals in Mental Health First Aid and/or Tr auma Informed Care and will have established Trauma Informed Care throughout the eleven count y service area and provided services to at least of 200 consumers within the co mmunity over the life of the project (number anticipated beginning service by year, DY3 40; DY4 60; DY5 100) .. Relationship to the Regional Goals: The goal of this project is to provide Trauma In formed Care within the community setting. By providing these services in the co mmunity, Hill Country will be m eeting the regional goal of the Triple Aim by providing patients high-quality a nd patient-centered care, in the most cost effective way. In addition, the establishment of the Trauma Informed Care will help achieve the regional goal to improve the health care infrastruc ture to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents the counties Hill Count ry serves within the region. Starting Point/Baseline: Hill Country MHDD Centers curren tly provides Cognitive Behavior al Therapy to individuals suffering from Major Depression and Cognitive Pr ocessing Therapy for individuals who have experienced a crisis episode and suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder . During fiscal year 2011, Hill Country MHDD Centers provided 1050 hours of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Cognitive Processing Therapy combined. This pr ogram would enable Hill Country to acquire and train additional clinicians to provid e Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Cognitive Processing Therapy to a broader population at an earlier stage to avoid the exacerbation of symptoms into a crisis episode resulting in ut ilization of Emergency Departments, potential psychiatric hospitalizations and utilization of the criminal justice system. Rationale: The approach Hill Country will ta ke with this project will incl ude building health communities by offering Mental Health First Aid Training and Trauma Informed Care training to schools, law enforcement, hospitals, physicians, and community organizations. The trai ning will be aimed at helping individuals understand .the role trauma plays in their lives and helping identify early warning signs of mental health issues. In a ddition, Hill Country will design programs to offer trauma counseling through evidence based prac tices such as Seeking Safety, Trust Based Relational Intervention, and Cognitive Processing Th erapy in order to help individuals deal with trauma they have experienced. Project Components: Through the Trauma Informed Care services, Hi ll Country MHDD Centers proposes to meet all required project components: 981 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers A. Assess size, characteristics and needs of target population . Hill Country will collect and analyze information on individuals who have issues due to an experienced trauma and review contributing factors such as ho melessness, noncompliance with medication, diagnosis, unemployment, economic struggles a nd other factors contributing to trauma in order to determine appropriate staffing and sk ill sets necessary for service provision as well as specific locations for service providers. B. Review literature / experience with populations similar to target population to determine community based interventions that are effective in averting negative outcomes such as repeated or extended inpatient psychiatric hospitalization, decreased mental and physical functional status, nursing facility admissi on, forensic encounters and in promoting correspondingly positive health and soci al outcomes / quality of life. Based on the size, characteristics and needs for the target popul ation, Hill Country will review appropriate literature and experiences rega rding serving individuals in Trauma Informed Care in order to provide targeted training for st aff and to develop innovative wrap around services to help avert future impact of the trauma. C. Develop project evaluation plan using qualita tive and quantitative metrics to determine outcomes . Hill Country will develop a project eval uation plan that will review items such as the number of individuals served, the i ssues leading to the trauma, the services received, the number of individuals r eceiving follow up services, the number of individuals with recu rring symptoms, and progression on the Activities of Daily Living assessment. D. Design models which include an appropriate range of community- based services and residential supports. Based on the size, characteristics and needs for the target population, Hill Country will train Trauma In formed staff in the most appropriate interventions to address the needs of the in dividuals and in conn ecting the individuals with other appropriate resour ces within the community. E. Assess the impact of interventions based on standardized quantitative measures and qualitative analysis relevant to the target popul ation based on information from the Adult Needs and Strength Assessment and/or participant surveys, and identify opportunities to scale all or part of the inter vention(s) to a broader patient population and identify key challenges associated with expansion of the intervention(s) , including special considerations for safety-net populations. Hill Country will util ize the Activities of Daily Living assessment to determine progression of individuals receivi ng Trauma Informed Care. In addition, Hill Country will do follo w up surveys with individuals who receive Trauma Informed Care services to determine sa tisfaction with services and to help ensure stabilization of symptoms in order to aver t additional recurrence of trauma symptoms. Unique community need identificatio n number the project addresses: CN.4 There is a shortage of high quality mental and behavioral health servic es that are integrated with physical health and/or pr ovide crisis stabilization. How the project represents a new in itiative or significantly enhan ces an existing delivery system reform initiative: Hill Country does not currently have a Trauma Informed Care initiative within Regional Healthcare Partnership 6. The addition of th e Trauma Informed Care would give committed 982 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers staff to providing ongoing trauma services in order to reduce the number psychiatric hospitalizations and avert recurren ce of the psychiatric crisis due to triggers related to past trauma. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-10 Quality of Life/Functional Status IT-10.2 Activities of Daily Living Reasons/rationale for selec ting the outcome measure: Trauma impacts an individual's me ntal health and thus their quality of life. It impacts the individual's self care as well as th eir ability to cope with their e nvironment. When an individual is unable to properly care for themselves or to co pe with their local environment, they are at greater risk of unemployment and poor health. The Activities of Daily Living will be utilized to provide an overview of functional status, determ ine activity limitations, establish a baseline for treatment, provide a guide for intervention pl anning, to evaluate interventions and monitor progress and to plan for fu ture and for discharge. The Activities of Daily Living will be measured utilizing the DLA-20. The DLA-20 Functional Assessment is a functional asse ssment, proven to be reliable and valid, designed to assess what daily living areas are impacted by mental illness or disability. The assessment tool identifies where outcomes are needed so clinicians can address those functional deficits on individualized service plans. THE DLA-20 is intended to be used by all disabilities and ages. THE DLA-20 utilizes the following 20 domains: Health Practices, Housing Stability and Maintenance, Communication, Safety, Managing Time, Nutrition, Problem Solving, Family Relationships, Alcohol/Drug Use, Leisure, Community Resources, Social Network, Sexuality, Productivity, Coping Skills, Behavior Norms, Personal Care/Hygiene, Gr ooming, and Dress. For the targeted population, individuals needing Trauma Informed Care, the DLA- 20 will help identify areas th e trauma has impacted in their lives such as coping skills, problem solving, family relationships, communication, and safety and be able to track improvement in the areas of the course of treatment. Relationship to other Projects: Provision of Trauma Informed Care services as an alternative to inpatient and emergency department services reinforces obj ectives for all other behavioral he alth services provided by Hill Country through Regional Healthcare Partne rship 6 (133340307.2.1 Mobile Crisis Outreach Teams, 1333340307.2.2 Psychiatric Consultati on, and 133340307.2.3 Co-occurring Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorder Services.) by provi ding specialized services addressing trauma experienced by individuals that if not addressed in the co mmunity may result in needing inpatient psychiatric services. Addressing trauma symptoms in the community enables the individual to move forward with treatments and to be more suc cessful in their recovery. In addition, by addressing trauma symptoms in the community, exacerbation of symptoms are reduced resulting in a reduction of Emergency De partment utilization and potentially preventable hospital admissions (RD-1-3) Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Hill Country MHDD Centers is the lo cal mental health authority that provides services within the 983 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers following counties of Regional Healthcare Partnership 6: Bandera, Comal, Edwards, Gillespie, Kendall, Kerr, Kinney, Medina, Re al, Uvalde and Val Verde. The other three local mental health authorities (Bluebonnet Tr ails, Camino Real, and Center for Healthcare Services) provides mental health services to the remaining countie s within Regional Healthcare Partnership 6 and service areas do not overlap. Hi ll Country is committed to ongoing advancement of services for the individuals we serve and is willing to par ticipate in a learning collaborative with other providers within the region to c ontinually improve serv ices and data collec tion and to identify how to address additional n eeds that may arise. Plan for Learning Collaborative: Hill Country MHDD Centers will participate in a learning collaborative that meets annually to discuss local disparities in care and the ways they have successfully gather ed relevant data and ultimately better served the populations in the projects. Project Valuation: Project valuation is based on a weighted aver age of Achieving Waiver Goals, Addressing Community Needs, Project Scope, and Project Inve stment. The valuation for this project was based on an economic evaluation model and extensiv e literature review c onducted by professors at the University of Houston School of Public H ealth and University of Texas at Austin Center for Social Work Research. The valuation is s upported by cost-utility analysis which measures program cost in dollars and the health conseque nces in incorp orate costs averted when known (e.g., emergency room visits that area avoided).

Hill Country serves a 14,390 s quare mile area of RHP6 with a population of approximately 401,123 in 2012. Intervention(s) : This project will implement Whole Heal th Peer Support services within the 11 counties served by Hill Country in RHP6 in order to meet the overall health needs of individuals who have behavioral health issues. The project will identify and train behavioral health peers on whole health risk assessments and working with peers to address overa ll health issues in order to treat symptoms prior to the need for utiliz ation of emergency departments or inpatient hospitalization. Need for the project : Individuals with severe and persiste nt mental illness die 25 years earlier than the general population. Identifying and addressing overall health symptoms, such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, t obacco use and physical inactivity, of individuals with severe and persistent mental illness helps address th is issue while reducing emergency department utilization and potentially preventable admissions to hospitals. Target population : The target population is individuals within Bandera, Comal, Edwards, Gillespie, Kendall, Kerr, Kinney, Medina, Real, Uv alde and Val Verde counties who have severe and persistent mental illness and other health risk factors. Base d on the population served in Hill Country's behavioral health program in RHP6, approximately 32% of our behavioral health patients within RHP6 have Medicaid and appr oximately 82% have income below $15,000 per year. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project aims to esta blish Whole Health Peer Support within the 11 counties served by Hill C ountry in RHP6. Whole Health Peer Support will provide whole health risk assessments to i ndividuals with severe and persistent mental illness in an effort to identif y physical health issues early and begin treatment to avoid emergency department utilization and potentially preventable hospital admissions. The project seeks to provide services to a minimum of 250 individuals from the 11 counties served by Hill Country in RHP6 by the end of DY5 (25 in DY3; 100 in DY4 and 125 in DY5). Category 3 outcomes: IT-10.2 Activities of Daily Living (DLA-20) Our goal is to have, at a minimum, 20% of the individuals served by the Whole Health Peer Support showing improvement on the Activities of Daily Living (D LA-20) which demonstrates stabilizing the individual in the community thus reducing the need for inpatient hospi talization and emergency 987 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers department utilization. Project Description: Peers are one of the most valuable assets in helping consumers w ith mental illness gain hope and begin to progress on their road to recovery. The services they provide an d supportive in nature. By expanding peer services as an integral portion of the seven mental health clinics operated by Hill Country MHDD Centers and including whole heal th risk assessments and supported services targeted to individuals with hype rtension, diabetes, and health risk s such as obesity, tobacco use and physical inactivity, improved Daily Living Activ ities and improved health outcomes can be achieved, helping address the disparate life expectancy and poor health outcomes and ultimately decreasing utilization of Emergency Departments. Hill Country's is planning to utilize consumer s of mental health services who have made substantial progress in managing their own illness and recovering a successful life in the community to provide behavioral health servic es. Through Via Hope, a state wide organization established under the State's Mental Health Transformation grant, consumers are being trained to serve as whole health peer s upport specialists. Upon completion of training, peers are working with consumers to set achievable goals to prevent chronic diseases such as diabetes or to address when they exist. While Hill Country has begun the process of incorporating peer support services, there have been ch allenges with maintaining peer support specialists and fully incorporating peer servic es throughout the treatmen t process. The advanc ement to Whole Health Peer Support is needed along with increased emphasis on peer services in order to help individuals advance in their recovery. In implementing this project, Hill Country will continue to train and e ducate clinicians on the importance of peer services, recr uit and train peer specialists in the provision of Whole Health Peer Support, and utilize peer se rvices to identify health risks and provide appropriate education and referrals regarding the health risks identified. Peer services will be tracked in Hill Country's information technology system (Anasazi) by location and consumer in order to monitor services delivered and outcomes of the services. In addition, Hill Country will conduct consumer satisfaction surveys for individuals receiving peer support services. Challenges: The challenges Hill Country has faced in establishing a robust peer support program have been in relation to retaining individua ls in the positions for extended periods of time. Hill Country plans to address this challenge by shifting the focu s of peer support to a w hole health model that becomes more fully integrated into the regular practice of the mental health clinics. In addition, Hill Country intends to increase the percentage of full time equivalent for peer support specialists in order to incr ease retention. Goals: By the end of five years, Hill Country's goal is to have peer support specialists at each mental health clinic with a minimum full time equivalency of 7.0 and to have 20% of the consumers who participate in whole health peer support experiencing improve ment in standardized health measures. Currently, Hill Country has 1.80 full time equivalency for peer support services within RHP6. 988 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers Relationship to the Regional Goals: The goal of this project is to use Whole Health Peer Support to provide guidance and support for the consumer's journey of recovery based on each individual's needs within the community setting. By providing these se rvices in the community, Hill Country will be meeting the regional goal of the Triple Aim by providing patients high-quality and patient-centered care, in the most cost effective way. In addition, the establishment of the W hole Health Peer Support will help achieve the regional goal to improve the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of Bandera , Comal, Edwards, Gillespie, Kendall, Kerr, Kinney, Medina, Real, Uvalde , and Val Verde counties. Starting Point/Baseline: Hill Country MHDD Centers has utilized Peer Sp ecialists in a limited cap acity over the past seven years as a means to help support individuals with behavioral health issues deal with their symptoms and advance in their recovery. Cu rrently, Hill Country MHDD Centers currently has ten peer specialists with only four having certif ication through the stat e training program. The seven mental health clinics operated by Hill Coun try within RHP6 currently have 1.80 full-time equivalency for provision of peer support services . In order to reempha size the importance of peer support services, to fully integrate peer s upport services into th e network of services provided through the mental health clinics operated by Hill Country MHDD Centers within RHP6 and to expand the peer support services of fered to include whole health interventions including health risk assessments, Hill Country will recruit additional peer specialists, arrange for appropriate training, and empha sis the peer specialists role s regarding whole health and serving as navigator for consumers Rationale: Peers are one of the most valuable assets in helping consumers w ith mental illness gain hope and begin to progress on their road to recovery. The services they provide an d supportive in nature.

Through this project Hill Country will acquire and main tain Whole Health Peer Support Specialists equivalent to a minimum of 7.0 full time equivalency throughout th e seven mental health clinics operated by Hill Country within RHP6. Project Components: Through the Whole Health Peer Support, Hill Country MHDD Centers proposes to meet all required project components. A) Train administrators and key clinical staff in the use of peer specialists as an essential component of a comprehensive health system . Hill Country MHDD Centers is currently participating in the Person Centered Recove ry Initiative through Via Hope. The initiative is designed to promote mental health syst em transformation by 1) helping organizations develop culture and practices that support and expect recovery, and 2) promoting 989 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers consumer voice in the transformation process and the future, transformed mental health system. On October 24th, 2012, the clinical leadership of Hill Country completed a one day training on integrating peer support and incorporating the patient in developing and implementing their treatment plan. B) Conduct readiness assessments of organization t hat will integrate peer specialists into their network . Hill Country will review readiness at the Llano Mental Health Clinic within RHP8 and address any pot ential barriers to full integration of Whole Health Peer Support. C) Identify peer specialists interested in this type of work. Hill Country will recruit peer specialists who have interest, first and fore most, in helping other on their journey of recovery and who also wish to receive trai ning in providing whole health peer services and are interested in employm ent with Hill Country MHDD to provide whole health peer services. D) Train identified peer specia lists in whole health inte rventions, including conducting health risk assessments, setting SMART goals, providing educational and supportive services to targeted individuals with specific disorders (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, or health risks (e.g. obesity, tobacco use, physical inactivity). Hill Country MHDD Centers will make arrangements for interested peer specialists to attend Whole Health Peer Support trainings and certifications availa ble through the state of Texas Via Hope program. If training space b ecomes restrictive, Hill Country will find or develop similar training to bring peer specia lists on board until such time as the certification training is available. E) Implement health risk assessm ents to identify existing and potential heal th risks for behavioral health consumers. Hill Country MHDD Centers will have trained peer specialists utilize the health risk assessment tool to determine potenti al or current health risks, will track the completion of health ri sk assessments in the information technology system, and will address potential health risks with the patient. F) Identify patients with serious mental illne ss who have health risk factors that can be modified. Patients identified through the health risk assessment tool will receive education and information regarding potential he alth risks and, if appr opriate, referred to primary care and preventive resources. G) Implement whole health peer support. Hill Country will track the occurrence of health risk assessments by location and patient in order to determine the project is fully implemented. H) Connect patient to primary care and preventive services. If risk factors or medical conditions are identified that require more than basic education, individuals will be referred to the appropriate prim ary care and preventive services. I) Track patient outcomes Review the inter vention(s) impact on participants and identify \"lessons learned,\" opportunities to scale all or part of the interventions(s) to a broader patient population, and identify key challenge s associated with expansion of the intervention(s), including special cons iderations for safe ty-net populations. Hill Country will utilize the Daily Living Activities assessmen t to determine progression of individuals receiving Whole Health Peer Support services. In additi on, Hill Country will do follow up surveys with individuals who receive Whole Health Peer Support services to determine satisfaction with services and to help ensure stabilization of symptoms 990 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers Unique community need identificatio n number the project addresses: CN.4 There is a shortage of high quality mental and behavioral health services that are integrated with physical How the project represents a new in itiative or significantly enhan ces an existing delivery system reform initiative: Hill Country MHDD Centers has utilized Peer Sp ecialists in a limited cap acity over the past seven years as a means to help support individuals with behavioral health issues deal with their symptoms and advance in their recovery. The seven mental health clinics operated by Hill country within RHP6 currently have 1.80 full-time equivalency of peer support services. In order to reemphasize the importance of peer su pport services, to fully integrate peer support services into the network of se rvices provided through these mental health clinics within RHP6 and to expand the peer support services offered to include whole health interventions including health risk assessments, Hill Country will recruit additional p eer specialists, arrange for appropriate training, and emphasis the peer specialists roles regarding whole health and serving as navigator for consumers Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-10 Quality of Life/Functional Status IT-10.2 Activities of Daily Living Reasons/rationale for selec ting the outcome measure: Whole Health Peer Support services impact an individual's mental and physical health and thus their quality of life. It impacts the individual's self care as well as their ab ility to cope with their environment. When an individual is unable to prope rly care for themselves or to cope with their local environment, they are at greater risk of unemployment and poor health. The Activities of Daily Living (DLA-20) will be utilized to prov ide an overview of functional status, determine activity limitations, establish a ba seline for treatment, provide a guide for intervention planning, to evaluate interventions and monitor progress an d to plan for future and for discharge. The Activities of Daily Living will be measured utilizing the DLA-20 Functional Assessment. The DLA-20 Functional Assessment is a functional assessment, proven to be reliable and valid, designed to assess what daily living areas are im pacted by mental illne ss or disability. The assessment tool identifies where outcomes are need ed so clinicians can address those functional deficits on individualized service plans. THE DL A-20 is intended to be used by all disabilities and ages. Developmental Disabilities and Alc ohol/Drug Abuse forms are personalized for daily functional strengths and problems a ssociated with those diagnoses. THE DLA-20 utilizes the followi ng 20 domains: Health Prac tices, Housing Stability and Maintenance, Communication, Safety, Managing Time, Nutrition, Problem Solving, Family Relationships, Alcohol/Drug Use, Leisure, Co mmunity Resources, Social Network, Sexuality, Productivity, Coping Skills, Behavior Norms, Pers onal Care/Hygiene, Grooming, and Dress. Relationship to other Projects: Provision of Whole Health Peer S upport services as an alterna tive to inpatient and emergency department services reinforces obj ectives for all other behavioral he alth services provided by Hill Country through Regional Healthcare Partne rship 6 (133340307.2.1 Mobile Crisis Outreach Teams, 1333340307.2.2 Psychiatric Consultati on, 133340307.2.3 Co-occurring Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorder Services, 133340307.2.4 Trauma Informed Care, 133340307.2.6 991 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers Veteran Mental Health Services, and 133340307.2.7 Mental Health Courts) by providing specialized services addressing crisis episodes and aimed at averting reoccurrence of crisis episodes experienced by an individual that if not addressed in the community may result in needing inpatient psychiatric services. Addressi ng the crisis episode in the community enables the individual to move forward with treatments a nd to be more successful in their recovery. In addition, by addressing crisis in the community, exacerbation of sy mptoms are reduced resulting in a reduction of Emergency Department utilization and potentially preventable hospital admissions (RD-1-3) Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Hill Country MHDD Centers is the lo cal mental health authority that provides services within the following counties of Regional Healthcare Partnership 6: Bandera, Comal, Edwards, Gillespie, Kendall, Kerr, Kinney, Medina, Re al, Uvalde and Val Verde. The other three local mental health authorities (Bluebonnet Tr ails, Camino Real, and Center for Healthcare Services) provides mental health services to the remaining countie s within Regional Healthcare Partnership 6 and service areas do not overlap. Hi ll Country is committed to ongoing advancement of services for the individuals we serve and is willing to par ticipate in a learning collaborative with other providers within the region to c ontinually improve serv ices and data collec tion and to identify how to address additional n eeds that may arise. Plan for Learning Collaborative: Hill Country MHDD Centers will participate in a learning collaborative that meets annually to discuss local disparities in care and the ways they have successfully gather ed relevant data and ultimately better served the populations in the projects. Project Valuation: Project valuation is based on a weighted aver age of Achieving Waiver Goals, Addressing Community Needs, Project Scope, and Project Inve stment. The valuation for this project was based on an economic evaluation model and extensiv e literature review c onducted by professors at the University of Houston School of Public H ealth and University of Texas at Austin Center for Social Work Research. The valuation is s upported by cost-utility analysis which measures program cost in dollars and the health conseque nces in incorp orate costs averted when known (e.g., emergency room visits that area avoided). The proposed prog ram's value is based on the average of benefit- cost studies from Sari et al. 2008 and Kuyken et al. (2008) with an average benefit cost ratio of $23.36 for every dollar invested. 992 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers 133340307.2.5 PASS 2 2.18.1 2.18.1 A-I 2.18.1 Design, implement, and evaluate whole health peer support for individuals with me ntal health and/or substance use disorders: Whole Health Peer Support Hill Country Community MHMR Center (dba Hill Country MHDD Centers) TPI - 133340307 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 133340307.3.7 3.IT-10.2 Activities of Daily Living Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 P-3: Identify and train peer specialists to conduct whole health classes Metric 1 P-3.1: Number of peers trained in whole health planning Goal: 4 peers trained in whole health planning during DY2 Data Source: Training records Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $283,215 Milestone 2 P-6: Implement peer specialist services that produce person-centered wellness plans targeting individuals with specific chronic disorders or identified health risk factors Metric 1 P-6.2: Number and quality of person centered wellness plans Goal: Person centered wellness plans have been developed with 25 individuals Data Source: Hill Country MHDD records/EHR Milestone 2 Estimated Incentive Payment: $304,236 Milestone 3 P-4: Evaluate and continuously improve peer support services Metric 1 P4.1: Project planning and implementation documentation demonstrates plan, do, study act quality improvement cycles Goal: Documentation of how monthly real-time data is used for rapid-cycle improvement to guide continuous quality improvement Data Source: Hill Country MHDD records Milestone 3 Estimated Incentive Payment: $ 156,940.50 Milestone 4 [I-X]: Number of individuals beginning service during demonstration year Milestone 5 P-4: Evaluate and continuously improve interventions Metric 1 P4.1: Project planning and implementation documentation demonstrates plan, do, study act quality improvement cycles Goal: Documentation of how monthly real-time data is used for rapid-cycle improvement to guide continuous quality improvement Data Source: Hill Country MHDD records Milestone 5 Estimated Incentive Payment: $ 164,428.50 Milestone 6 [I-X]: Number of individuals beginning service during demonstration year 993 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers Metric 1 [I-X.1]: Number of targeted individuals beginning services during demonstration year (Whole Health Peer Support) Baseline/Goal: Baseline - 25 individuals beginning service in DY3; Goal - 100 additional individuals beginning services during DY4 (for an estimated cumulative total of 125); Data Source: Hill Country MHDD records/EHR Milestone 4 Estimated Incentive Payment: $156,940.50 Metric 1 [I-X.1]: Number of targeted individuals beginning services during demonstration year (Whole Health Peer Support) Baseline/Goal: Baseline - 25 individuals beginning service in DY3; Goal - 125 additional individuals beginning services during DY5 (for an estimated cumulative total of 250); Data Source: Hill Country MHDD records/EHR Milestone 6 Estimated Incentive Payment: $164,428.50 Year 2 Estimated Milestone Bundle Amount: $283,215 Year 3 Estimated Milestone Bundle Amount: $304,236 Year 4 Estimated Milestone Bundle Amount: $313,881 Year 5 Estimated Milestone Bundle Amount: NTIVE PAYMENTS FOR 4-YEAR PERIOD: $1,230,189 994 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers Identifying Project and Provider Information: Title: 2.13.1 Design, implement, and evaluate research-supported and evidence-based interventions tailored towards individuals in the target popula tion: Veteran Mental Health Services Unique RHP ID#: 133340307.2.6 - PASS 2 Provider Name: Hill Country Community MHMR Center (dba Hill Country MHDD Centers) TPI: 133340307 Project Summary: Provider Description : Hill Country Community MHMR Center (dba Hill Country MHDD Centers) is a community mental health center pr oviding mental health, substance use disorder, early childhood intervention and intellectual and developmental disability services to the following counties of RHP6 (Bandera, Comal, Edwards, Gillespie, Kendall, Kerr, Kinney, Medina, Real, Uvalde and Val Verde). Hill C ountry serves a 14,390 square mile area of RHP6 with a population of approximately 401,123 in 2012. Intervention(s) : This project will implement Veteran Me ntal Health Services within the 11 counties served by Hill Country in RHP6 in order to meet the overall health needs of veterans dealing with behavioral health issues. The projec t will expand peer support services in an effort to identify veterans and their family members who need comprehensive community based wrap around behavioral health services , such as psychiatric rehabilit ation, skills training, crisis intervention, supported housing and supported em ployment, that would complement, but not duplicate, potential services th rough the Veterans Administrati on and provide the community based wrap around behavioral health services for these veterans in order to treat symptoms prior to the need for utilization of emergency departme nts, inpatient hospitalization or incarceration. Need for the project : Hill Country's service area within RHP6 has a veteran population of 37,809 and veterans seeking behavioral health services currently have to travel over 300 miles and take a full day off of work to receive behavioral health services. Based on an average family size for the 11 counties served of 2.87, the veterans and their families are a total target population base for the project of 27,448. In addition, a recent study of death certificates in Texas revealed that the percentage of deaths by su icide for Texas veterans was ne arly double the same rate for civilians. Target population : The target population is veterans and their family members within Bandera, Comal, Edwards, Gillespie, Kendall, Kerr, Kinney, Medina, Real, Uvalde and Val Verde counties who have behavioral health issues . The target population consists of the 27,448 veterans and their families, including reservists who only receive Veteran Administration benefits for 180 days after fede ral deployment. Based on the populat ion served in Hill Country's behavioral health program in RH P6, approximately 32% of our beha vioral health patients within RHP6 have Medicaid and approximately 82% have income below $15,000 per year. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project aims to establish Veteran Mental Health Services within the 11 counties served by Hill Country in RHP6. Veteran Mental Health Services will provide wraparound behavioral health services to veterans and/or their family members within their lo cal communities. The project s eeks to provide services to a minimum of 180 veterans from the 11 counties se rved by Hill Country in RHP6 by the end of 995 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers DY5. The cumulative anticipated number of ve terans or their family members served by demonstration year is as follows: DY3 40; DY4 100; DY5 180. The anticipated number individuals served is shown as an unduplicat ed number since services will carry over between demonstration years. Category 3 outcomes: IT-10.2 Activities of Daily Living (DLA-20) Our goal is to have, at a minimum, 20% of the individuals served by th e Veteran Mental Health Services showing improvement on the Activities of Daily Living (D LA-20) which demonstrates stabilizing the individual in the community thus reducing the need for inpatient hospi talization and emergency department utilization. Project Description: As the mental health authority for our service ar ea, Hill Country is well aware of the challenges for Veteran's requiring mental health services. Currently Veteran's within the eleven counties served by Hill Country within RHP6, including over 543 Reserve Component Service members deployed to OEF/OIF, must trav el to San Antonio to receive mental health services. For a majority of these veterans, this involves over 300 miles of travel and a full day off of work for a one hour appointment. Just this year, the Vete ran's Administration contra cted with Hill Country to offer Telemedicine services at the Del Rio Mental Health Clinic in order to help reduce this additional strain on the Veteran's in the far western portion of our service area. According to 2012 populati on estimates from the Texas Depart ment of State Health Services Population Data System for Texas Population Estimates Program and statistics from the Veteran's Administration 9/30/08 Projection of Veteran's by 110 th Congressional District, Vet Pop 2012, the eleven counties serv ed by Hill Country within RHP6 have a total population of 401,123 with a Veteran population of 37,809, or 9.4% of the total population. According to a study completed by the Austin American Statesman on October 1, 2012, the percentage of deaths of Texas Veterans caused by suicide from 2003 through 2011 was 21.5% compared to 12.4% for the overall Texas populat ion. Of Texas Veterans with a primary diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder who di ed during this period, 80% died of overdose, suicide or a single-vehicle crash. During disc ussions Hill Country held with County Veteran Service Officers within the region, it was noted that there is a need for Mental Health services for Veterans due to the transportation and time commitment needed to access Veteran Administration services as well as the reluctance of veterans to acknowledge a potential mental health issue with the Veterans Administration. Hill Country currently has two Ve teran Peer Coordinators who r ecruit volunteer Veterans to provide peer support services throughout Hill Country's 19 county, 22,000 square mile service area. Through this project, Hill Country woul d acquire additional Vete ran Peer Coordinators who can actively work to recruit and train veteran peer support provi ders in a concentrated area. The Veteran Coordinators acquired through this pr oject will create liaisons within the counties, seek out veterans and establish drop-in centers, recrui t volunteers, connect veterans with other community resources, create jail outreach and ja il diversion for veterans involved with the criminal justice system, coordina te medical and behavioral health referrals as appropriate and serve as a liaison with the local National Guard and Reserve units. This proj ect will also include 996 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers provision of comprehensive community based wrap around behavioral health services, such as psychiatric rehabilitation, skills training, cris is intervention, supported housing and supported employment, that would complement, but not dup licate, potential services through the Veterans Administration for both Veterans and their fami lies in Blanco and Llano counties, including reservists who only receive Ve teran Administration benefits for a few months after active deployment. Wrap around services will be delivered by clinicians who have been trained in cultural competency for the military environment. Wraparound services provided through this project in the local community w ill complement the Psychiatrist and Counselor services provided by the Veteran Administration at the VA clinics. During the last 6 months, the Veteran Peer Support services have referred 60 indivi duals for mental health treatment. Hill Country MHDD Centers will ex pand Veteran Peer and Mental Health services throughout the eleven county area served by Hill Country in RHP6. In establishing th e project, Hill Country will review literature and experiences regarding Veteran Peer and Mental Health services to establish appropriate training for staff on the most effective interv entions for veteran services. Upon identifying needed training, Hill Country will recruit appropriate staff and provide targeted training for veteran peer and co mmunity based wrap around behavior al health services. As a means to determine the success of the interventions, a functional assessment (DLA-20) determining what impact the various stressors have on the individuals daily lives will be completed when a Veteran is referred for mental health services and at determined intervals during treatment. In order to track individuals receiving treatm ent in the program, Hill Country will establish specific units and subunits within its information technology system (Anasazi) that will enable reporting on Veteran Peer and Mental Health services delivered within the program as well as by location within the program. Challenges: The primary challenge for implementation of the project is recruiting licensed staff. Hill Country will address the challenge by offering incentives as necessary. Goals: The goal of this project is to expand Veteran Pe er and Mental Health services throughout the eleven counties served by Hill Country in RH P6 in order to reduce emergency department utilization, inpatient utilization, and incarceration by developing wr ap around servic es within the community for the targeted population. Relationship to the Regional Goals: The goal of this project is to establish Vetera n Peer and Mental Health services based on each individual's needs within the community setting. By providing these services in the community, Hill Country will be meeting the regional goal of the Triple Aim by providing patients high-quality and patient-centered care, in the most cost effective way. 997 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers Starting Point/Baseline: Hill Country MHDD Centers currently has one tw o Veteran Peer Coordinators serving a 19 county, 22,000 square mile service area. This project will expand the service to add a concentrated Veteran Peer Coordinators to se rve two to three countie s each of the eleven counties served by Hill Country in RHP6 in order to recruit a nd train veteran peer service providers and provide identified mental health se rvices as needed. The DLA20 assessment will be performed on each individual referred from vete ran peer services to veteran mental health services as their baseline and the percentage of individuals who have improved DAL20 scores on a subsequent assessment after treatment will be utilized to show improvement. Rationale: Hill Country will identify and train Veteran Peer C oordinators in the provision of veteran peer support services incl uding identifying and seeking out vetera ns needing services, recruit veteran peer support providers, creating drop-in centers for veterans, identify and connecting with current resources, and inco rporating jail diversion as appropriate for veterans in touch with the criminal justice system. Project Components: Through the Veteran Mental Health services pr oject, Hill Country MHDD Centers proposes to meet all required project components: A) Assess size, characteristics and needs of target population . Hill Country will collect and analyze information on veterans with mental h ealth issues and review contributing factors to episodes in order to determine appropriate staffing and skill sets necessary for service provision as well as specific locations. B) Review literature / experience with populations similar to target population to determine community based interventions that are effective in averting negative outcomes such as repeated or extended inpatient psychiatric hospitalization, decreased mental and physical functional status, nursing facility admissi on, forensic encounters and in promoting correspondingly positive health and soci al outcomes / quality of life. Based on the size, characteristics and needs for the target popul ation, Hill Country will review appropriate literature and experiences rega rding serving veteran mental health issues in order to provide targeted trai ning for staff. C) Develop project evaluation plan using qualita tive and quantitative metrics to determine outcomes . Hill Country will develop a project eval uation plan that will review items such as the number of individuals served, the serv ices received, the nu mber of individuals receiving follow up services, the number of individuals with recurring issues, and progression on the Activities of Da ily Living assessment(DLA-20). D) Design models which include an appropriate range of community- based services and residential supports. Based on the size, characteristics and needs for the target population, Hill Country will train staff in the most appropriate interventions to address the needs of the individuals and in connec ting the individuals w ith other appropriate resources within the community. E) Assess the impact of interventions based on standardized quantitative measures and qualitative analysis relevant to the target popul ation based on information from the Adult 998 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers Needs and Strength Assessment and/or participant surveys, and identify opportunities to scale all or part of the inter vention(s) to a broader patient population and identify key challenges associated with expansion of the intervention(s) , including special considerations for safety-net populations. Hill Country will util ize the Activities of Daily Living assessment (DLA-20) to determine pr ogression of Veterans referred for Veteran Mental Health services. In addition, H ill Country will do follow up surveys with individuals who receive Veteran Peer Services to determine satisfaction with services and to help ensure stabil ization of symptoms. Unique community need identificatio n number the project addresses: CN.4 There is a shortage of high quality mental and behavioral health servic es that are integrated with physical How the project represents a new in itiative or significantly enhan ces an existing delivery system reform initiative: Hill Country MHDD Centers currently has one tw o Veteran Peer Coordinators serving a 19 county, 22,000 square mile service area. This project will expand the service to add a concentrated Veteran Peer Coordinators to serve the eleven counties served by Hill Country within RHP6 in order to recru it and train veteran peer service providers and provide identified mental health services as needed. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-10 Quality of Life/Functional Status IT-10.2 Activities of Daily Living Reasons/rationale for selec ting the outcome measure: Behavioral health issues impact ve terans mental health and thus th eir quality of life. It impacts the individual's self care as well as their ability to cope with their e nvironment. When an individual is unable to properly care for themselves or to cope with their local environment, they are at greater risk of unemployment and poor he alth. The Activities of Daily Living will be utilized to provide an overvie w of functional status, determine activity limitations, establish a baseline for treatment, provide a guide for inte rvention planning, to evaluate interventions and monitor progress and to plan for future and for di scharge. The Activities of Daily Living will be measured utilizing the DLA-20 Functional Assessment. The DLA-20 Functional Assessment is a functional assessment, proven to be reliable and valid, designed to assess what daily living areas are im pacted by mental illne ss or disability. The assessment tool identifies where outcomes are need ed so clinicians can address those functional deficits on individualized service plans. THE DL A-20 is intended to be used by all disabilities and ages. Developmental Disabilities and Alc ohol/Drug Abuse forms are personalized for daily functional strengths and problems a ssociated with those diagnoses. THE DLA-20 utilizes the followi ng 20 domains: Health Prac tices, Housing Stability and Maintenance, Communication, Safety, Managing Time, Nutrition, Problem Solving, Family Relationships, Alcohol/Drug Use, Leisure, Co mmunity Resources, Social Network, Sexuality, Productivity, Coping Skills, Behavior Norms, Pers onal Care/Hygiene, Grooming, and Dress. 999 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers Relationship to other Projects: Provision of Veteran Mental Health services as an alternative to i npatient and emergency department services reinforces obj ectives for all other behavioral he alth services provided by Hill Country through Regional Healthcare Partne rship 6 (133340307.2.1 Mobile Crisis Outreach Teams, 1333340307.2.2 Psychiatric Consultati on, 133340307.2.3 Co-occurring Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorder Services, 133340307.2.4 Trauma Informed Care, 133340307.2.5 Whole Health Peer Support and 133340307.2.7 Me ntal Health Courts) by prov iding specialized services addressing crisis episodes and aimed at averti ng reoccurrence of crisis episodes experienced by an individual that if not addressed in the comm unity may result in needi ng inpatient psychiatric services. Addressing the crisis episode in the community enab les the individual to move forward with treatments and to be more su ccessful in their recovery.

Need for the project : Comal, Medina, and Uvalde counties have approached Hill Country regarding establishing Mental He alth Courts in order to increase treatment compliance of individuals with mental illness identified as having frequent utilization of emergency departments, the criminal justice system, and/or psyc hiatric inpatient services in an effort to deter inappropriate utilizati on of these services. Target population : The target population is individuals w ith mental illness from within Comal, Medina, and Uvalde counties who are frequently utilize the emergency departments, criminal justice system, and/or psychiatric inpatient se rvices. Based on the population served in Hill Country's behavioral health program in RHP6, approximately 32% of our behavioral health patients within RHP6 have Medicaid and appr oximately 82% have income below $15,000 per year. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project aims to establish Mental Health Courts to serve Comal, Medina, and Uvalde counties within the RHP6. Mental Health Courts will monitor patient compliance with treatment protocol and pr ovide wraparound behavioral health services to individuals in the program. Th e project seeks to provide se rvices to a minimum of 120 individuals in RHP6 by the end of DY5 (num ber beginning service by DY: 20 in DY3; 40 in DY4; and 60 in DY5). Category 3 outcomes: IT-10.2 Activities of Daily Living (DLA-20) Our goal is to have, at a minimum, 20% of the individuals served by the Mental Health Courts showing improvement on the Activities of Daily Living (D LA-20) which demonstrates stab ilizing the individual in the community thus reducing the need for inpatie nt hospitalization and emergency department utilization. 1003 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers Project Description: Comal, Medina and Uvalde counties have a pproached Hill Country MHDD Centers regarding establishing Mental Health Courts in order to increase treatment compliance of individuals with mental illness who are identified as having freque nt utilization of Emergency Departments, the criminal justice system, and/or psychiatric inpatient services. Hill Country MHDD Centers would hire Community Health Workers to serv e as Case Managers to deliver necessary community-based interventions according to the individuals need. Community-based interventions may include psychosocial rehabi litation, Cognitive Behavi oral Therapy, Cognitive Processing Therapy, supported employment, transpor tation, peer support, and other services in accordance with the individuals needs. The iden tified consumers served through this project would appear regularly before the Mental Hea lth court to increase the accountability of the individual to the necessary trea tment in order to reduce utilizat ion of the Emergency Department, the Criminal Justice system , or Psychiatric Inpatient settings The mental health court in Pitt sburgh, which has been operating si nce 2001, determined that only 10% of individuals who completed the court were rearrested compared to a 68% national average for all defendants. According to the Bureau of Justice Assistance, when it comes to mentally ill offenders, mental health courts have show n positive outcomes related to treatment and satisfaction with the pr ocess. A common perception is th at the informality and decreased adversarial nature of the mental health court, when compar ed to traditional courts, decreases the barriers mentally ill offende rs often face in receiving treatmen t through traditional courts. Mental health courts have been shown to provid e more treatment, better treatment and faster linkages to appropriate treatment. In other studies, a 2003 study of th e Broward County (Fla.) mental health court determined that the program increased defendants' access to trea tment services and that mental health court participants were more likely that non-particip ants to continue treatment after the program concluded. Another 2003 study of the Clark County (Wash.) mental health court, concluded participants had significantly more case mana gement, outpatient service days, and medication monitoring after enrollment than before enrollment. Additionally, participants had fewer crisis intervention and inpatient treat ment days post-enrollment. In designing the Mental Health Courts, Hill Countr y will work with the courts to review other successful mental health courts, identify the targ et population to be served, have dedicated case managers for the courts, devel op necessary legal agreements fo r court participation, create linkages for services beyond mental health services, and work w ith the courts in establishing ongoing procedures. Challenges: The primary challenge for implementation of the pr oject is recruiting qualifi ed staff dedicated to working with the target population. Hill C ountry will address the challenge by offering incentives as necessary. Goals: The goal of this project is to develop Mental Health Courts in Coma l, Medina and Uvalde counties in order to reduce emergency depart ment utilization, inpa tient utilization, and 1004 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers incarceration by developing wrap around services within the community for the targeted population. Relationship to the Regional Goals: The goal of this project is to establish Mental Health Courts within th e community setting. By providing these services in the co mmunity, Hill Country will be m eeting the regional goal of the Triple Aim by providing patients high-quality a nd patient-centered care, in the most cost effective way Starting Point/Baseline: Hill Country MHDD Centers does not currently have a mental hea lth court within its service area. This will be a new program for the area. Rationale: Comal, Medina and Uvalde counties have a pproached Hill Country MHDD Centers regarding establishing Mental Health Courts in order to increase treatment compliance of individuals with mental illness who are identified as having freque nt utilization of Emergency Departments, the criminal justice system, and/or psychiatric inpatient services. Hill Country MHDD Centers would hire Community Health Workers to serv e as Case Managers to deliver necessary community-based interventions according to the individuals need. Community-based interventions may include psychosocial rehabi litation, Cognitive Behavi oral Therapy, Cognitive Processing Therapy, supported employment, transpor tation, peer support, and other services in accordance with the individuals needs. The iden tified consumers served through this project would appear regularly before the Mental Hea lth court to increase the accountability of the individual to the necessary trea tment in order to reduce utilizat ion of the Emergency Department, the Criminal Justice system , or Psychiatric Inpatient settings In designing a program to address the needs of individuals with mental illness identified with frequent utilization of the Emergency Department , the Criminal Justice system , or Psychiatric Inpatient settings, Hill Country MHDD Centers will: A) Assess size, characteristics and needs of indivi duals with mental il lness identified with frequent utilization of the Emergency Departm ent, the Criminal Justice system , or Psychiatric Inpatient settings , Hill Country will work w ith the local court systems to identify a target population that would gain the greatest benefit from participating in a mental health court to determine the size and characteristics of the population to be served. Hill Country will also review with the court the Sequentia l Intercept Model to determine the most appropriate level of entry for participants. B) Review literature / experience with populations similar to target population to determine community based interventions that are effective in averting negative outcomes such as repeated or extended inpatient psychiatric hospitalization, decreased mental and physical functional status, nursing facility admissi on, forensic encounters and in promoting correspondingly positive health and soci al outcomes / quality of life. Hill Country will visit successful mental health courts and review literature on lessons learned from other mental health courts in order to develop targeted services, forms and procedures in establishing the mental health c ourts and associated services. 1005 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers C) Develop project evaluation plan using qualita tive and quantitative metrics to determine outcomes. Hill Country will develop a project evalua tion plan that will review items such as the number of individuals served, the serv ices received, the nu mber of individuals receiving follow up services, the number of individuals with recurring issues, and progression on the Activities of Daily Living assessment(DLA-20).. D) Design models which include an appropriate range of community- based services and residential supports . . Based on the size, characteristics and needs for the target population, Hill Country will train staff in the most appropriate interventions to address the needs of the individuals and in connec ting the individuals w ith other appropriate resources within the community. . E) Assess the impact of interventions based on standardized quantitative measures and qualitative analysis relevant to the target population based on information from the ANSA and/or participant surveys, and identify opportunities to scale all or part of the intervention(s) to a broader patient populati on and identify key challenges associated with expansion of the interven tion(s), including special cons iderations for safety-net populations. Hill Country will utilize the Activitie s of Daily Living assessment (DLA- 20) to determine progression of Mental Hea lth Court participants . In addition, Hill Country will do follow up surveys with indi viduals who receive Mental Health Court services to determine satisfaction with serv ices and to help ensure stabilization of symptoms.

It imp acts the individual's self care as well as their ability to cope with their environment. When an individual is unable to properly care for themselves or to cope with their loca l environment, they are at greater risk of unemployment and poor health. The Activities of Daily Living will be utilized to provide an overview of functional status, determine activity limitations, establish a baseline for treatment, provide a guide for intervention planning, to eval uate interventions and monitor progress and to plan for future and for discharge. The Activi ties of Daily Living will be measured utilizing the DLA-20 Functional Assessment. The DLA-20 Functional Assessment is a functional assessment, proven to be reliable and valid, designed to assess what daily living areas are im pacted by mental illne ss or disability. The assessment tool identifies where outcomes are need ed so clinicians can address those functional 1006 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers deficits on individualized service plans. THE DL A-20 is intended to be used by all disabilities and ages. Developmental Disabilities and Alc ohol/Drug Abuse forms are personalized for daily functional strengths and problems a ssociated with those diagnoses. THE DLA-20 utilizes the followi ng 20 domains: Health Prac tices, Housing Stability and Maintenance, Communication, Safety, Managing Time, Nutrition, Problem Solving, Family Relationships, Alcohol/Drug Use, Leisure, Co mmunity Resources, Social Network, Sexuality, Productivity, Coping Skills, Behavior Norms, Pers onal Care/Hygiene, Grooming, and Dress. Relationship to other Projects: Provision of Mental Health Court services as an alternative to i npatient and emergency department services reinforces obj ectives for all other behavioral he alth services provided by Hill Country through Regional Healthcare Partne rship 6 (133340307.2.1 Mobile Crisis Outreach Teams, 1333340307.2.2 Psychiatric Consultati on, 133340307.2.3 Co-occurring Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorder Services, 133340307.2.4 Trauma Informed Care, 133340307.2.5 Whole Health Peer Support and 133340307.2.6 Veteran Me ntal Health Services) by providing specialized services addressing crisis episodes and aimed at averting reoccurrence of crisis episodes experienced by an individual that if not addressed in the community may result in needing inpatient psychiatric services. Addressi ng the crisis episode in the community enables the individual to move forward with treatments a nd to be more successful in their recovery. In addition, by addressing crisis in the community, exacerbation of sy mptoms are reduced resulting in a reduction of Emergency Department utilization and potentially preventable hospital admissions (RD-1-3) Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Hill Country MHDD Centers is the lo cal mental health authority that provides services within the following counties of Regional Healthcare Partnership 6: Bandera, Comal, Edwards, Gillespie, Kendall, Kerr, Kinney, Medina, Re al, Uvalde and Val Verde. The other three local mental health authorities (Bluebonnet Tr ails, Camino Real, and Center for Healthcare Services) provides mental health services to the remaining countie s within Regional Healthcare Partnership 6 and service areas do not overlap. Hi ll Country is committed to ongoing advancement of services for the individuals we serve and is willing to par ticipate in a learning collaborative with other providers within the region to c ontinually improve serv ices and data collec tion and to identify how to address additional n eeds that may arise. Plan for Learning Collaborative: Hill Country MHDD Centers will participate in a learning collaborative that meets annually to discuss local disparities in care and the ways they have successfully gather ed relevant data and ultimately better served the populations in the projects. Project Valuation: Project valuation is based on a weighted aver age of Achieving Waiver Goals, Addressing Community Needs, Project Scope, and Project In vestment. The valuation is supported by cost- utility analysis which measures program cost in dollars and the health co nsequences in utility- weighted units called quality- adjusted life-years (QALYs). QALYs incorporate costs averted when known (e.g., emergency room visits that area avoided).

Services include health code enforcement, f ood inspections, immunizations, clinical services, environmental monitoring, disease control, h ealth education, dental health, and emergency preparedness. As a public health department Metro Health provides services to all residents, but has a particular focus on unders erved populations and those expe riencing health disparities which often include a higher representation of Medicaid funded individuals. Intervention(s) : The Metro Health teen pregnancy prevention projec t will include the following four components. 1) Educate adolescents in Be xar County zip codes that have high teen birth and STD rates using evidence-based teen pre gnancy, STD & HIV prevention programs. 2). Expand access to affordable reproductive healthcare services for adolescents that may not be reached through existing provider practices a nd focusing on segments of the population with high teen birth and STD rates. 3). Conduct tr aining to providers on the Adolescent Medical Home (AMH) model encouraging a team-based care approach to preventive adolescent health services. 4). Provide case management servic es to teen mothers through the evidence-based Healthy Outcomes through Perinatal Education a nd Support (HOPES) project to reduce repeat teen pregnancies. The project provides a dive rse intervention spectrum ranging from intensive short term services to long-term follow-up over an extended period of time to best meet the needs of the target population. Milestones 4, 8, 12 and16 for DY2-DY5 include CQI activities as a part of the RHP 6 learning collaborative. Need for the project : San Antonio has a critical need fo r effective teen pregnancy prevention strategies in order to stimul ate and sustain long-term change s in adolescent behavior and healthcare. The 2010 San Antonio's Bexar C ounty birth rate for females ages 10-14 was 0.7/1,000 and was 75% higher than the national ra te 0.4/1,000. In 2010, the Bexar County teen childbearing cost was $69.9 million do llars in health care, child welf are, incarceration, and lost revenue. Target population : The target population will be adolescent s 13 to 19 years of age who reside in zip codes where teen births rate s are over twice the national birth rate. The project intends to reach over 1,550 adolescents for each year (DY3 thru DY5) for a total of 4,650 adolescents reached. Approximately 80% of the target population are eligible for Medicaid and would benefit from preventive educati on and health services proven to change adolescent sexual behavior. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : For each year (DY3 thru DY5), the project seeks to reach 1,200 adolescents with evidence-based teen pregnancy, STD & HIV prevention education, 1011 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District 100 teen mothers with case management services , 250 adolescents with re productive healthcare services, and 20 medical providers with education encouraging a te am based care approach using an adolescent medical home model. The number of adolescents reached for each year (DY3 thru DY5) will be 1,550 for a total number of 4,650 adolescents reached. Category 3 outcomes: OD-2 Potentially Preventable Admissions IT- 2.13 Other Admission Rate - Admissions for infant delivery among health education participants A reduction in the proportion of adolescents reporting a teen pregnancy among those participating in the evidence-based teen pr egnancy, STD, and HIV prevention education component compared to baseline. IT-2.13 Other Admission Rate - Admission for infant delivery among case management participants A reduction in the proportion of repeat teen pregnancies among teen mothers participating in the HOPES case management component. Project Description: Project Overview San Antonio Metropolitan Health District (Metro Health) submits this proposal with the overall goal to reduce the burden of adolescent pregnanc y and improve the health status of adolescents in San Antonio, TX. San Antonio has several challenges and has a cr itical need for effective teen pregnancy prevention strategies in order to stimulate and sustain long-term changes in adolescent behavior and healthcare. The 2010 San Antonio's Bexar County birth rate for females ages 10-14 was 0.7/1,000 and was 75% higher than the national rate 0.4/1,000. Accord ing to the latest comparable data, Bexar County's 2008 pregnanc y rate for females ages 10-14 was 1.9/1,000 and was 36% higher than the national pregnancy ra te of 1.4/1,000. The number of Syphilis and HIV cases among youth ages 13-19 increased by 77% in Bexar County from 2006 to 2010. During the same period, reported cases of Chlamydi a and Gonorrhea increased to 31% and 29% respectively for the same age group. In 2010, seve n zip codes had teen birth rates for females ages 15-19, 3 to 4 times the national teen birth rate of 76.9/1,000 females age 15-19. In addition, funding for family planning and repro ductive health services have been cut by two thirds in Texas, reducing access to services for adults and adolescents. One local health care provider has reported that state funding cuts ha ve reduced preventive care and family planning services from more than 10,000 pa tients per year to approximat ely 2,300 today. Nearly 57% of Texas deliveries are paid for by Medicaid, and 47 % of Texas births are the result of unplanned pregnancies. This project will address the cha llenges with four components th at will work in conjunction to support the project goal; 1. Educate adolescents in Bexar County zip codes that have high teen birth and STD rates using evidence-based teen pregnancy, STD & HIV prevention programs. The project will work with school districts and charter schools within Bexar County to implement district-wide, age and culturally appropria te evidence-based teen pregnancy, STD & HIV prevention education. Part of the preventi on education will include information on where 1012 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District adolescents can go for healthcare services. 2. Expand access to affordable reproductive healthca re services for adolescents that may not be reached through existing provider pract ices and focusing on segments of the population with high teen birth and STD rate s. The project w ill work with local providers to increase the number of a dolescents receiving reproductive healthcare services. 3. Conduct training to provider s on the Adolescent Medical Home (AMH) model. The AMH model encourages a team-based care approach to preventive adolescent health services and making efforts to link payment to performance. 63 The project will work with educating area providers on how to esta blish an AMH model in their practices to provide comprehensive healthcare services to new and existing adol escent patients. 4. Provide case management servi ces to teen mothers through the evidence-based Healthy Outcomes through Perinatal Education and Support (HOPES) project to reduce repeat teen pregnancies. The HOPES Project is a client-centered, solution-focused, home visitation model implemented by a complement of Nurse and Social Worker staffing and based on the Inter-conception Health Promo tion Initiative in Denver, CO. Health promotion is accomplished through identific ation of strengths on which to build, education, patient navigation, modeling, counseling, advocacy and motivational interviewing. The project will work local providers to identify and recruit teen mothers for the HOPES project. Goals and Relationship to Regional Goals Project Goals: 1. Reduce teen pregnancies among hi gher risk target populations 2. Reduce repeat teen pregnancies among teens in case management services This project meets the following regional goals: This project directly addresses the RHP 6 need to provide impr oved maternal and child health services within the region (CN.5). Challenges: San Antonio has several challenges and has a cr itical need for effective teen pregnancy prevention strategies in order to stimulate and sustain long-term changes in adolescent behavior and healthcare. The 2010 San Antonio's Bexar County birth rate for females ages 10-14 was 0.7/1,000 and was 75% higher than the national rate 0.4/1,000. These challenges will be addressed through a mu ltipronged strategy to reduce teen pregnancy through evidence-based education, ca se management, clinical serv ices and provider outreach and education. 5-Year Expected Outcome for Provider and Patients: The five year expected outcome will be to redu ce the Bexar County teen birth rate for females ages 15-19 by 15%. 63 Walker, I., McManus, M., Fox, H. December 2011. Medical Home Innovations: Where do Adolescents Fit? The National Alliance to Advance Adolescent Health. 1013 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District Starting Point/Baseline: Currently teen pregnancy prevention services ar e provided by Metro Health and project partners as follows: Teen Pregnancy Prevention Education Services : 500 teens current ly served, 2 of providers trained in project , 42 educational encounters, , (Oct 2011 - June 2012) Expansion of Adolescent Reproductive Health Care Services : : __100__ teens currently served, _1_ provider trained in projec t, _150_ clinical encounter s, (September 2012) Adolescent Medical Home Services : This program does not curren tly exist. Baseline of 0 for DY2 Teen Case Management Services : This program does not currently exist. Baseline of 0 for DY2 Rationale: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has listed t een pregnancy as a \"Winnable Battle\" if communities implement evidence-based prevention programs. However, only twelve Bexar County area schools are using evidence-b ased teen pregnancy, STD & HIV education programs. In addition, existing community health clinics have reached their capacity for adding new adolescent patients, while medical providers have limited funding to provide more comprehensive health evaluation, prevention health screenings and referrals. The Metro Health project components and outcomes were specifically selected to addr ess these criti cal challenges and will significantly expand evidence-based pr evention education, adolescent reproductive health services, provider know ledge on implementing an AMH model, and intensive case management for teen mothers. Unique community need identificati on number the project addresses: The Metro Health project rationale includes a wi de reaching strategy for adolescent prevention education and health services currently lacking in Bexar Count y and associated with RHP 6 community need CN.5. According to the National Campaign to Preven t Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, parenthood is the leading cause of school dropout among teen girls and young teen mothers are much less likely to graduate from high school th an those who wait to become parents. [4] The disparities in teen pregnancy and school drop outs are mo re notable among Lati nos. In a May 2010 publication, The National Campaign re ported that more than half (54%) of Latina teen mothers do not complete high school, compared to 34% of teen mothers overall.[5] In Bexar County, Hispanic teens have historically had teen bi rth rates well above natio nal averages. In 2010, Metro Health recorded a birth ra te of 64.0/1,000 births to Hispanic females ages 15-19 compared to the national rate of 55.7/1000. Teen pregnancy affects the entire community, not just young mothers. As noted above, school dropout and adolescent pregnancy is closely linked. Teen fathers ar e also more likely to drop out 1014 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District of school, have poor involvement with their ch ildren, engage in substance abuse and illegal activity, and conceive children with multiple women.64 In a study of children of mothers aged 17 and younger, it was found that these children had lower general knowledge scores compared with children of mothers age 20-21. Children of the youngest mothers also had significantly lower test and assessment scores than childre n of mothers aged 22-29, suggesting that as maternal age at birth increases , so do children's cognition and knowledge levels by the time they reach kindergarten.65 There is an obvious economic impact on the families created by teen pregnancy, but also one that is spread community-wide. In Bexar County alone, in 2010, teen childbearing cost $69.9 million dollars in health care, child welfare, incarceration, and lost revenue. In 2012, the City of San Antonio conducted a Community Survey among San Antonio residents in all ten City Council Districts. Teen pre gnancy was ranked the highe st concern among fifteen community issues and respondents felt that teen pregnancy was the most important for the City to address over the next two years. 66 In 2011, Metro Health in itiated a strategic planning process both internally and community-wide in wh ich teen pregnancy was identified as one of the priority issues for San Antonio. In 2009, San Antonio Mayor, Julian Castro identified teen pregnancy as one of the most important issues to address within th e SA2020 visioning process and has enlisted Metro Health to take the lead on moving the vision forward. How the project represents a new initiative or significantly enhances an existing delivery system reform initiative: This project would more than double the number of teens served through evidence-based health education programs and adolescent reproductive health care services. Additionally the addition of outreach and education to health care provider s to promote an adolescent medical home model and case management services for teen mothers ar e new strategies for teen pregnancy prevention proposed in this project.

How Children Born to Teen Mothers Fare. 66 2012 City of San Antonio Community Survey Final Report. ETC Institute. 1015 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District has two Category 3 Outcomes. 1) A reduction in the proportion of adolescents reporting a teen pregnancy among those participating in the ev idence-based teen pregnancy, STD, and HIV prevention education component compared to ba seline. 2) A reduction in the proportion of repeat teen pregnancies among teen mothers pa rticipating in the HOPES project component. These will both be reported as potentially prev entable hospital admissions to deliver infants, however additional healthcare costs and negative social outcomes will be averted by reducing teen pregnancies. These Metro Health outcomes are a priority fo r the RHP as supported by local birth and STD data. According to 2010 birth certificate data collect ed by Metro Health, the Bexar County teen birth rate for females ages 10 to 14 (0.7/1,000) was 75% higher than the national rate of 0.4/1,000. The Bexar County teen birth rate fo r females 15 to 19 (50.3/1000) was 47% higher than the national rate of 34.3/1000. In 2010, Be xar County recorded 735 repeat births among females ages 19 and under (22% of all teen births were repeat births). In 2010, seven zip codes had teen birth rates for females ages 15-19, 3 to 4 times the national teen birth rate of 76.9/1,000 females age 15-19. Those zip codes were concentrat ed and HIV cases among youth ages 13-19 increase d by 77% in Bexar County from 2006 to 2010. During the same period, reported cases of Chla mydia and Gonorrhea incr eased to 31% and 29% respectively for the same age group. Accord ing to the latest comparable data. The CDC is recommending that communities implem ent evidence-based strategies to prevent teen pregnancy. Metro Health is using the CDC and the locally produ ced Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) recommendations to implement proven prevention programs to decrease local teen birth rates. Strategies that include evidence-based prevention education, adolescent health services and case manageme nt, along with provider e ducation and input are essential components of an eff ective strategy to combat teen pregnancy, STD/HIV transmission, and sustain long-term community change. Compared to California, a state with similar de mographics to Texas, th e affect of different approaches to teen pregnancy prevention ar e clear. Beginning in 1990, California began implementing evidence based prevention programs, expanding teens' access to healthcare services, and promoting media campaign messages. California teen birt h rates dropped from 71/1,000 for females ages 15-19 in 1990 to 38/ 1,000 in 2008. Unfortunately, Texas did not follow the same strategy and saw the 1990 birth rate of 75/1,000 females ages 15-19 dropped to only 63/1,000 in 2008. 67 Evidence-based prevention programs implemented in Bexar County could result in 1,700 fewer births each year and sa ve five million dollars in direct costs, and thirty-three million in overall costs, annually.68 In addition, case management intervention has been proven effective in reducing repeat birt hs by up to 17%, utiliz ing the HOPES Project model.69 67 United Nations Statistics Division.

The teen pregnancy prevention education component will build knowledge and resistance skills among adolescents to prevent STD and HIV, including information on testing. The provider education component on the AMH model will encourage provider-client discussions on STD prevention and testing. The expansion of adolescent healthcare services component will strengthen provid er-client discussions on disease prevention, provide condoms for sexually active yout h, and STD and HIV testing and treatment. The HOPES component will also support prev ention education and encourage STD and HIV screening for teen mothers and their partners. In addition, the HOPES component will support and reinforce the Metro Health pass 2 proposed project (2.7.5) for breastfeeding promotion project to increase the percent of participating mothers' who breastfeed for six months. Teen mothers in the HOPES project will particip ate in the peer sup port groups and baby caf\u00e9 components of the breastfeeding project. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: This project may align to goals of University Health System's Healthy U School Based Clinic project in expanding access to adolescent focused clinical preventive services. Plan for Learning Collaborative: Metro Health will foster Continuous Quality Im provement (CQI) through ac tive participation in the RHP 6 learning collaborative working grou ps to support and enhance project quality improvement, evaluation and achievement of outco mes. CQI elements are specifically included through milestones 4, 8, 12 and 16 beginning in DY 2. Additionally Metro Health will seek out project specific opportunities to collaborate with regional maternal and child health as well as other local health department performi ng providers in other Texas regions. Project Valuation: In 2008, Texas taxpayer costs associated with children born to teen mothers included: $221 million for public health care (Medicaid and CH IP); $111 million for child welfare; and, for children who have reached adolescence or youn g adulthood, $175 million for increased rates of incarceration and $378 million in lost tax reve nue due to decreased earnings and spending.70 According to the Health and Human Servi ces Commission, Medicaid costs average $2,500 per infant delivery and as much as $45,000 for an infant treated in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.71 Utilizing the methodology provided by the RHP 6 anchor, Metro Health assessed the following Retrieved on July 15, 2011 from http://journals.lww.com/familyandcommunityhea lth/Abstract/2000/10000/The_Interconception_Health_P romotion_Initiative__A.3.aspx 70 Counting it up.

This project was ranked high on achievement of waiver goals given the strong research and high potential for reduction of healthcare costs associated with prenatal care and teen childbearing for Medicaid and other unders erved populations in Bexar County. This project will expand access to health services, emphasi ze effective evidence-based preventive services, provide opportunities fo r coordinated care be tween public health, school, community clinics and privat e providers and reduce costs. This project was ranked high in regards to addressing a community need. Teen pregnancy prevention is consistently listed as the lead ing health and social need in Bexar County and has been established as one of four key priorities for Metro Health. This project was ranked high on project scope in that services will be broadly targeted to all local schools and healthca re providers in Bexar County serving potentially thousands of teens through a mix of population-based a nd individually focused health promotion services. This project was ranked high in regards to pr ogram investment driven by the broad scope of population-based project activities as well as the expens e of intensive individual case management and/or clinical services that will be provi ded through this project. The project provides a diverse intervention spectrum ranging from intensive short term services to long-term follow-up over an extended period of time to best meet the needs of the target population. 1018 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District 091308902.2.1 PASS 1 2.6.4 N/A 2.6.4 IMPLEMENT OTHER EVIDENCE -BASED HEALTH PROMOTION PROGRAMS IN AN INNOVATIVE MANNER : COMPREHENSIVE TEEN PREGNANCY PREVENTION San Antonio Metropolitan H ealth District TPI - 082426001 Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): 091308902.3.4 091308902.3.5 IT-2.13 IT-2.13 Other Admission Rate Other Admission Rate Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P-X]: Establish program plan to provide evidence-based teen pregnancy and STD prevention education in school settings Metric 1 [P-X-1]: Establish educational program implementation plan and schedule with schools Baseline/Goal: Establish educational program implementation plan and schedule with schools to implement in academic year 2013-2014.

Services include health code enforcement, f ood inspections, immunizations, clinical services, environmental monitoring, disease control, h ealth education, dental health, and emergency preparedness. As a public health department Metro Health provides services to all residents, but has a particular focus on unders erved populations and those expe riencing health disparities which often include a higher representati on of Medicaid funded individuals. Intervention(s) : In order to addres s the obesity and diabetes ra tes within San Antonio/Bexar County, Metro Health will implement the Neighborhood Based Physical Activity and Health Promotion Project . This project will focus on primary prevention strategies at the community level to improve the health status of residents and increase community member engagement in a neighborhood-based approach for chronic disease prevention. Metro Health will identify 10 target area neighborhoods for this initiative based on the prevalence of risk factors for chronic disease, as well as the presence of a network of community based assets that will facilitate opportunities for resident-led health improvement s. Each target neighborhood will encompass an average area of 2 square miles. Based on local population density of 1332 residents per square mile we expect that approximately 26,500 residents will be reached through community based programmatic and infrastructure improvements in health disparity neighborhoods. The project staff will work directly within target neighbor hoods to engage residents in the assessment, planning, implementation and eval uation of health improvement strategies at the neighborhood level in line with the CDC's community level strategies for Obesity Prevention 72 as well as the Institute of Medicine's recommende d strategies for obesity prevention73. Specifically, these include twenty-four specific community-level strategies in the following categories: o Promote the availability of affo rdable health food and beverages o Support healthy food a nd beverage choices o Encourage breastfeeding o Encourage physical activity or limit se dentary activity among children and youth o Create safe communities that support physical activity o Encourage communities to organize for change Residents will participate in planning and select ion from among these evidence-based strategies 72 Centers for Disease Control and Prev ention.

Continuous Quality Improvement components requi red of this project will include project specific training and technical assistance to be provided by the Asset Based Community Development Institute as well as active partic ipation in the RHP6 learning collaborative and internal Metro Health team to support CQI. Need for the project : This project addresses the RHP 6 n eed to provide improved prevention of chronic diseases including diab etes within the re gion (CN.2). San Antonio/Bexar County experiences a high death and diseas e burden related to chronic illne sses, with significant health disparities in diabetes and obes ity within the urban core. The Neighborhood Based Physical Activity and Health Promotion Project will allow Metro Health a nd its partners to target resources and programs within the most vul nerable communities/neighborhoods, and capitalize on resident assets and engagement to drive decision making. This approach will focus on increasing population-wide opportunities for physi cal activity and healthy eating within the urban core of San Antonio through a coordina ted application of multiple evidence-based strategies that will be sel ected by allowing community members to fully engage in deciding which approaches will work best within their neighborhood. Target population : Residents living within 10 defined ta rget neighborhoods to be identified during the initial phases of the project. Community wide da ta indicates 15.4% of the total population is Medicaid elig ible, the percentage of Medicaid eligible reside nts is expected to be higher in target neighborhoods as these will be documented health disparity areas. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : This project will work to improve the health status of residents and increase community member enga gement in a neighborhood-based approach for chronic disease prevention. The project aims to improve healthy eating practices and increase physical activity behaviors among residents in target neighborhoods in order to reduce the prevalence of obesity and ultimately obesity-relate d chronic diseases among adults, adolescents and children. Each target neighborhood will encompass an average area of 2 square miles. Based on local population density of 1332 residents per square mile we expect that approximately 26,500 residents will be reached through commun ity based programmatic and infrastructure improvements in health disparity neighborhoods.

This project will enhance and expand current public health efforts in community-based strategies for obesity prevention by specifically and in tensively focusing on neighborhoods within the 1025 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District geographic disparity areas of the city with the highest rates of chronic disease. The neighborhood focus of the strategies intends to increase ownership and adopti on of the strategies within a context of local community scaled interventi ons. The project staff will include two Team Leaders (Management Analysts) and ten Neighbo rhood Liaisons (Health Program Specialists), which will each be assigned a target neighbor hood in which to engage residents in the assessment, planning, implementation and evalua tion of health improvement strategies for obesity prevention. The project is structured in three phases of activity: Phase I: Co mmunity Selection and Assessment; Phase II: Resident Engagement; a nd Phase III: Implementation of Community Driven Interventions. Phase I (Community Selection), wi ll include the development of selection criteria to identify target area neighborhoods. The criteria will gi ve higher priority to areas of health and socioeconomic disparities, and will also prioritize the presence of social networks. Phase I will also include the development of target area neighborhood hea lth assessment reports. These reports will be compiled for each target area neighborhood and will include health and socioeconomic data for the populati on within the target area. Phase II (Resident Engagement) will include the development of a neighborhood engagement process based on the principles of Asset Based Community Development 3. The process will incorporate the following five principles : the mapping of individual, community, and organizational assets; building relationships among local assets; mobilizing the local assets for health improvement and information sharing; convening a broad representation from the community to build a community vision and plan ; and leveraging activities, investments and resources from outside the community to support community driven health improvement. Once the community engagement process is establishe d, the recruitment and formation of resident leadership groups will take place. The purpose of these groups will be to increase participation and engagement from residents in chr onic disease prevention initiatives. Phase III (Implementation of Community Driven Interventions) will allow the resident leadership groups to identify and select eviden ce based obesity and chronic disease prevention strategies from among the CDC and IOM recommende d approaches within the target area. The resident leadership groups will utilize consensus building methods to make decisions. The programs and initiatives will be focused on re ducing obesity by increasing the proportion of adults who engage in regular physical activit y and increasing the pr oportion of adults who consume the recommended amount of fruits and vegetables. Throughout the three phases technical assist ance, program documentation, and continuous quality improvement activities will occur through a partnership with the ABCD Institute to assure fidelity to the model and to support ongoing program improvements to achieve high levels of resident engagement and successful accomp lishment of project health outcomes (BMI reduction). Goals and Relationship to Regional Goals Project Goals: 1026 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District This project will work to improve the health stat us of residents and increase community member engagement in a neighborhood-based appr oach for chronic disease prevention. This project meets the following regional goals: This project addresses the RHP 6 need to pr ovide improved prevention of chronic diseases including diabetes within the region (CN.2). Challenges: While ABCD methodologies have been proven eff ective in increasing resi dent engagement in chronic disease prevention, it represents a new a pproach for Metro Health to engage specific neighborhoods in identifying, planning, implementing and evaluation health promotion efforts. To address these challenges in implementing this approach significant staff training and development has been planned for in the project implementation. Additionally, as interventions will be driven by resident priorities staff will s eek to balance flexibility and responsiveness to community needs with consistency in timi ng and evaluation of health outcomes. 5-Year Expected Outcome for Provider and Patients: Improved self-efficacy, knowledge and resour ces to support health among neighborhood residents. Improved healthy ea ting and physical activity leve ls in target neighborhoods. Reductions in BMI among residents leading to decreased risk of obe sity-related chronic disease. Starting Point/Baseline: This project represents a ne w approach to health promotion planning and implementation. Therefore the baseline number of neighborhoods and participants begins at 0 in DY2. Rationale: San Antonio/Bexar County experiences a high death and disease burde n related to chronic illnesses, with significant health disparities in di abetes and obesity within the urban core. In 2009, the five distinct leading cause s of death in Bexar County for adults aged 25 and older were heart disease, malignant neoplasms, chronic lower respiratory diseases, ce rebrovascular diseases, and diabetes mellitus (Metro Health, Health Pr ofiles 2009). These causes accounted for 65% of all deaths in adults aged 25 and older, many of which can be attributed to unhealthy lifestyle behaviors related to poor nutrition, physical in activity, and tobacco use. According to 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Survei llance System (BRFSS) data, more than 67% of Bexar County respondents are overweight or obe se, which includes disproportio nate representation by African American and Hispanic residents. Approximately three-quarters of African American (72%) and Hispanic residents (76%) are over weight or obese, compared to 61% of Whites. Morbid obesity was reported in 20% of African Americans and 16% of Hispanics, but only 8% among Whites. Additional self-reported health status and behaviors accordin g to the 2010 BRFSS found that 14% were diagnosed with diabetes, 28% are daily smokers, and only 22% consume five servings of fruits and vegetables per day, while 7% consume fruits and vegetables never or once daily. Access to fresh fruits and vegetables is limited in many locations. Fifty-seven percent of the individuals surveyed reported that there are no farmers markets in their community and 46% shop in small stores and corner stores, the majo rity of which do not sell any fresh fruits or vegetables. In terms of physical activity, 73% reported that they had participated in some 1027 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District physical activity during the past month. Most (84 %) reported that there are sidewalks in their neighborhood, while only 36% reported that there were walking trails in their neighborhoods. Over one-third of the respondents stated that la ck of time and motivati on was the reasons that respondents gave for not walking. As with the local obesity demographics, there are significant income and geographic disparities for those diagnos ed with diabetes. Diabetes was also found to be highest among those making less than $15,000 per year (21%) as compared to other income categories (ranging from 5-17%), with the highest incidence within the south, east and west sides of the inner city. Within Bexar County, Hispanics have twice the rate of diabetic amputations compared to white non Hispanics (117 vs. 54 per 100,000). These socioeconomic, racial and ethnic disparities in disease burden and compli cation rates are reflective of the gaps in linguistically and culturally appropr iate community-based preventive services for chronic disease and diabetes that exists in San Antonio. As a public health agency it is appropriate th at Metro Health focus on primary prevention and community based strategies, consistent with CD C evidence-based strategi es, to address obesity and obesity-related chronic diseases. The Neighborhood Based Physical Activity and Health Promotion Project will allow Metro Health and its partne rs to target resources and programs within the most vulnerable communities/neighbor hoods, and capitalize on resident assets and engagement to drive decision making. This approach will focus on increasing opportunities for physical activity and healthy eating by allowing co mmunity members to fully engage in deciding what approach will work best within their neighborhood. Racial and socioeconomic health disparities are presented in sh arpest focus in the neighborhoods where low-income families and racial minorities live, and this project intends to improve the contexts within these neighborhoods and resultant effects on obesity. The higher rates of obesity and chronic disease in these areas are a direct consequence of lack of safe and public space and opportunities for physical activity in the physical environment, reduced access to healthy food resources, and levels of social capital that of ten are in short supply. I ndividuals that perceive their neighborhoods to be unsafe report lower le vels of physical activity, especially racial minority adults and the elderly. 75 Residents in poor neighborhoods would likely participate in more physical activity and walking in their neig hborhoods if measures were taken to increase safety in those areas.76 Furthermore, children whose parents felt the neighborhood was unsafe had an increased tendency towards obesity by age seven.77 An increase of social cohesion has direct effect on criminal beha vior within neighborhoods, as \"close knit\" communities where there is trust between neighbors have been shown to be more apt to organize in union against crime. Likewise, communities with strong social union are also more successful in advocating 75 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (1999).

The project will increase our efforts to promote healthy eating usi ng these or other evidence-based strategies in the target neighborhoods. The increase in social cap ital that asset-based community development promotes can have a positive effect on the acceptance of preventive health and health promotion measures within a community by building upon trus t and also exerting positive social pressures. 7 Unique community need identificati on number the project addresses: This project addresses the RHP 6 need to pr ovide improved prevention of chronic diseases including diabetes within the region (CN.2). How the project represents a new initiative or significantly enhances an existing delivery system reform initiative: The Neighborhood Based Physical Activity and Health Promotion Project represents a new strategic approach by Metro Health to focus chronic disease prevention efforts in small geographic areas disproportionately affected by health disparities. This approach represents a departure from more typical community wide or large area pub lic health interventions. Metro Health intends to leverage resident engagement at the outset of the planning process in order to allow residents to lead decision making. In an effort to maximize resident engagement, Metro Health will recruit and hire the project sta ff from the health disparity areas within the community.

[Electronic version]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 22 (1), 23-29. 1029 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District Reasons/rationale for select ing the outcome measures: The outcome measures for the Neighborhood Based Physical Activity and Health Promotion Project include increasing the proporti on of adults who engage in regular physical activity, and increasing the proportion of a dults who consume the recommended amount of fruits and vegetables. These indicators wi ll be measured using the Beha vior Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey. In addition to the oversampling done in interv ention neighborhoods for this project the BRFSS is administered by the Centers for Disease Contro l and Prevention (CDC) on an annual basis. BRFSS is the world's largest, on-going telephon e health survey system, tracking health conditions and risk behaviors in the United States annually si nce 1984. The availability of county wide data and historical data will prov ide important opportunities to compare intervention neighborhood outcomes with those of th e community as a whole over time. These specific outcome measures were selected b ecause they represent significant risk factors for several chronic diseases, and if impacted can help accelerate prevention of obesity-related chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovas cular disease within th e target neighborhoods. Increasing physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption within the targ et neighborhoods and decreasing BMI have been shown effective in decreasing chronic disease rates. Relationship to other Projects: The Neighborhood Based Physical Activity and Health Promotion Project and Metro Health's Community Diabetes Program (Category 2 pr oject: 091308902.2.3) intend to work in tandem within 10 target area neighborhoods to address hea lth disparities. This project will focus on a primary prevention strategy to improve heal th behaviors and reduce obesity while the Community Diabetes Program will focus on secondary and tertiary prevention of a critical obesity-related chronic disease. The staff members within the two projects will work together to capitalize on the connections made within th e neighborhoods, and will utilize the asset based community development model to build nei ghborhood level community support systems for individuals impacted by chronic disease. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: This project does not appear to have a dire ct relationship to other RHP 6 projects but opportunities may arise to collabora te as specific neighborhood hea lth priorities and needs are identified. Plan for Learning Collaborative: Metro Health will foster Continuous Quality Im provement (CQI) through ac tive participation in the RHP 6 learning collaborative working grou ps to support and enhance project quality improvement, evaluation and achievement of outco mes. CQI elements are specifically included through milestones 3, 6, 8 and 10 beginning in DY 2. Additionally Metro Health will seek out project specific opportunities to collaborate with regional maternal and child health as well as other local health department performi ng providers in other Texas regions. Metro Health will participate in the establishm ent of Learning Collaboratives to support and encourage information sharing a nd technical assistance related to obesity prevention, increasing opportunities for physical activity, improving the built environment, and increasing neighborhood engagement. The Learning Collabor ative will allow Metro Health to share 1030 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District experiences and best practices with other prov iders in Bexar County and surrounding counties. Metro Health can assist in creating the L earning Collaborative, es tablishing goals and communication strategies, organizi ng events for information sharing, and adopting metrics to measure success. Project Valuation: Many of the demographic risk factors associated with chronic disease as well as high burdens of chronic disease morbidity and mortality are c oncentrated in neighborhoods within San Antonio and Bexar County that have traditionally lacked infrastructure to support healthy living and experienced higher rates of poverty. The approa ch that Metro Health will take in the Neighborhood Based Physical Activity and Health Promotion Project will focus on providing a comprehensive neighborhood-based approach to chr onic disease prevention. Ten specific target areas will be selected for this initiative that ha ve significant risk factors for chronic disease, but more importantly have a network of community ag ency and resident engagement assets that will facilitate opportunities for health improvement over the four years of the initiative. While these communities may have community cohesion and iden tity, additional resources are necessary to address health disparities. Special consider ation will be given to address populations and geographic areas within the county that experi ence a poorer health stat us than the general population. Each of the 10 target neighbor hood areas will include approximately 26,500 residents and will each cover a small geogr aphic area defined by neighborhood boundaries, and natural or physical boundaries. The neighbor hood boundaries will be self-defined, with an average scale of 2 square miles. The implem entation of evidence-based obesity prevention strategies and infrastructure improvements to the built environment (such as side walk improvements, bike routes, cross walks, lighti ng, walking trail expansi on, park improvements, and increasing linkages) will bene fit community safety and hea lth by increasing opportunity and access for physical activity. These strategies and improvements will have an intended reach well beyond the target neighborhood boundaries, as migrat ion between neighborhoods is expected. By allowing residents to prioriti ze, select, and be involved in pla nning the projects and initiatives though the resident engagement process, the comm unity needs will be addressed. This will also increase community ownership of the projects , which will help to ensure successful implementation and sustainability. Utilizing the methodology provided by the RHP 6 anchor, Metro Health assessed the following factors in assigning a value to this health pr omotion project: achievement of waiver goals, community need, project scope and th e level of projec t investment. This project was ranked high on achievement of waiver goals given the high potential for improved and long-term change in nei ghborhoods that would support a reduction in obesity-related chronic diseases. This project was ranked high in regards to addressing a community need. Obesity and obesity-related chronic disease is consistently listed as the leading health and social concern in Bexar County and has been establishe d as one of four key priorities for Metro Health. San Antonio and Bexar County have placed increasing emphasis on obesity prevention for children and adults th rough the SA2020 goals, Community Health Improvement Plan and the work of the Mayor's Fitness Council. Additionally the ABCD model for designing and implementing speci fic interventions will further emphasize community needs in pr oject activities. 1031 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District This project was ranked high on project scope in that services will be broadly targeted to all residents and visitors to the 10 target neighborhoods, with pot ential for additional resident impact outside of the interventi on area. This approach is supported by an increasingly strong evidence- base for policy, systems, and environmental change approaches to health promotion, and in particular obesity prevention. This project was ranked high in regards to pr ogram investment driven by the broad scope of population-based project activ ities as well as the expense associated with permanent infrastructure elements to support long-term neighborhood transformation that are likely to be part of the policy, systems and envir onmental change strategies applied in the intervention neighborhoods. 1032 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District 091308902.2.2 PASS 1 2.6.4 N/A 2.6.4 IMPLEMENT OTHER EVIDENCE -BASED HEALTH PROMOTION PROGRAMS IN AN INNOVATIVE MANNER : NEIGHBORHOOD BASED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND HEALTH PROMOTION San Antonio Metropolitan H ealth District TPI - 082426001 Related Category 3.IT - 12.6 3.IT - 12.6 3.IT - 12.6 Other Outcome Improvement Target Other Outcome Improvement Target Other Outcome Improvement Target Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P-X]: Expand Staff and Partner Capacity to utilize Asset Based Community Development approaches Metric 1 [P-X-1]: Establish agreement with partner to provide technical assistance and training to Metro Health project staff and community partners in ABCD approaches Goal: Establish agreement Data Source: MOA or Contract Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $1,196,794.33 Milestone 2 [P-X]: Identify target area neighborhoods based on chronic disease and Milestone 4 [P-X]: Development of evidence based projects for targeted populations based on distilling the needs assessment and determining priority of obesity prevention strategies for the community.

Services include health code enforcement, f ood inspections, immunizations, clinical services, environmental monitoring, disease control, h ealth education, dental health, and emergency preparedness. As a public health department Metr o Health provides services to all residents, but has a particular focus on unders erved populations and those expe riencing health disparities which often include a higher representation of Medicaid funded individuals. Intervention(s) : The San Antonio Metropolitan Health Di strict (Metro Health) will implement the Community Diabetes Project , that will expand access to the Stanford Chronic Disease Self Management and Diabetes Self Management Progr ams for individuals living with diabetes and their family members/caregivers as well as those that are at ri sk for developing diabetes. The Stanford Chronic Disease Self Management and Diabetes Self Management Programs are staff intensive six -week long, two and a half hours pe r week process driven workshops that are meant to build patients' self-efficacy in ma naging their conditions. The workshops are co- facilitated by two lay leaders with chronic cond itions of their own, with the intent on building peer support. The project aims to improve dise ase management outcomes by expanding the reach of its current chronic disease self manage ment program through increasing the number of locations and courses offered as well as to in crease the number of certified lay-leaders and trainers throughout the community, with the goal of improving the physical and emotional health of participants while reducing health care costs in targeted neighborhoods with the highest incidence of chronic disease. Metro Health will also establish a sub-cont ract with the YMCA of Greater San Antonio to implement diabetes prevention interventi on and education courses across the community. With support and training from YMCA of the USA, the YMCA of Greater San Antonio will replicate the Na tional YMCA Diabetes Preventi on Program (YDPP). YDPP helps those at high risk of developing type-2 diabetes adopt and maintain heal thy lifestyles by eating healthier, increasing phy sical activity, and losing a modest amount of weight. The YDPP has a 12-month duration, which begins with an intensive 16 weekly core sessions and is followed by 8 months of monthly maintenance sessions. Togeth er, these positive changes help reduce their chances of developing the disease. The YMCA al so implements the parallel program Y Living for those who do not meet the clinical eligibility for YDPP but are diagnosed with or at risk for chronic disease. This program will also be utiliz ed for those individuals referred but ineligible for YDPP. Need for the project : San Antonio/Bexar County experien ces a high death a nd disease burden related to chronic illnesses, with significant hea lth disparities in diabetes and its complications. These socioeconomic, racial and ethnic disparit ies in disease burden and complication rates are reflective of the gaps in lingui stically and culturall y appropriate community-based preventive services for chronic disease and diabetes that exists in San An tonio. The proposed interventions 1037 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District will fill those gaps in community- based preventi ve services and provide expanded services more in line with community demand for services and disease burden in San Antonio. Target population : The Community Diabetes Project will be provided throughout the city of San Antonio, with an emphasis on neighborhoods with in the central urban core which has a high burden of diabetes and prediabetes within ge ographic disparity areas. These areas correspond with those sectors of the city with higher percentages of mi norities (Hispanic and African American), low educational attainment a nd household income, along with high rates of uninsured or underinsured. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : This project will work to improve self-efficacy for managing or preventing diabetes, improved health behaviors and reduced h ealth care utilization and costs among program participants and their caret akers by increasing availability of evidence- based disease self-management programs and pr ovide the National YMCA Diabetes Prevention Program (YDPP) at multiple locations throughout the city. 1700 participants per year will be served by the two interventions fo r a total of at least 5100 particip ants over the waiver term.

Ultimately, the project aims to improve disease management outcomes by expanding the reach of its current chronic disease self management program through increasing the number of locations and courses offered as well as to increase the number of certified lay-leaders and trai ners throughout the community. Metro Health will also establish a sub-contract with the YMCA of Greater San Antonio to implement diabetes prevention in tervention and educa tion courses across the community. With support and training from YMCA of the USA, the YMCA of Greater San An tonio will replicate the National YMCA Diabetes Prevention Program (YDPP) at eighteen locations. YDPP helps those at high risk of developing type-2 diabetes adopt and maintain heal thy lifestyles by eating healthier, increasing phy sical activity, and losing a modest amount of weight. Together, these positive changes help reduce their chances of developing the disease. YDPP is based on research funded by the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The YMCA also implements the parallel progr am Y Living for those who do not meet the clinical eligibility for YDPP but are diagnosed with or at risk for chroni c disease. This program will also be utilized for those individu als referred but ineligible for YDPP. 1038 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District The Stanford Chronic Disease and Diabetes Self-Management Programs were developed and evaluated over the past 30 years at the Stan ford University School of Medicine's Patient Education Center. Stanford has developed and of fered programs that have been tested for effectiveness through randomized, controlled trials that are funded by research grants and span two to five years. Their programs are not license d for use outside of St anford unless they are proven through rigorous research standards to be evidenced- based. The ai m of their research- driven programs is to improve the physical and emotional health of par ticipants while reducing health care costs. Expanded staff capacity can train many additional lay leaders to hold Stan ford Chronic Disease and Diabetes Self-Management workshops with in their own communities and to their peer groups, making it possible to reach many more of the neighborhoods that experience the highest rates of disease burden. Both staff and community lay leaders will facilitate the six-week, two and a half hour long workshops, in addition to a two hour session added at the week before the workshop for biometric data collection and regist ration. Community lay leaders will be recruited from targeted neighborhoods with the highest inci dence of chronic disease, and will facilitate self-management workshops within these nei ghborhoods along with expanded Metro Health staff. Metro Health staff will supplement the chronic disease and diabetes self-management workshops with specialized outreach and preventi ve education on the complications of diabetes to include heart disease, kidney disease, neur opathy, and eye complications. Metro Health staff will also establish a referral system to appropria te community- based lifestyle interventions for all participants and caregivers that go through the workshops . They will receive intensive training on health disparities and the social determ inants of health as related to the communities in which they work. Preference will be given in hiring staff that is reflective of the socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic diversity of intervention communities. The YMCA Diabetes Prevention Program (YDPP) has been shown to reduce the risk of developing type-2 diabetes by up to 58%. The success of the program was supported by the evidence based use of small group activities and Social Support Interventions . During the CDC's Diabetes Prevention Program, the risk reduc tion was even greater\u201471%\u2014among adults aged 60 years or older. The YMCA of Greater San An tonio will provide the YDPP at eighteen YMCA locations and affiliated community sites througho ut San Antonio to include childcare sites, schools and churches. Participants in the YDPP ga ther regularly in sma ll groups facilitated by a trained lifestyle coach. In small groups, particip ants discuss healthy eat ing, physical activity, and other behavior changes that, over the one-year course, will help reduce their risk of developing type-2 diabetes. In the supportiv e environment, individual activi ties are a primary component of the YDPP's 12-month course. During 16 weekly core sessions and up to 8 months of maintenance sessions, individuals cover topics such as: healthy eating; getting started with physical activity; overcoming stress; and staying motivated. Afte r the initial co re sessions, participants meet monthly for added support in ma intaining their progress for lifestyle behavior change. Goals and Relationship to Regional Goals Project Goals: Ultimately, the project aims to improve disease management outcomes by expanding the reach of its current chronic disease self management pr ogram through increasing the number of locations and courses offered as well as to increase the number of certified lay-leaders and trainers 1039 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District throughout the community. This project meets the following regional goals: This project directly addresse s the RHP 6 need to provide im proved prevention and management of chronic diseases including diabet es within the region (CN.2). Challenges: San Antonio faces significant challenges with high number of diabetes, pre-diabetics and persons with poorly controlled diabetes. This project represents a signi ficant expansion of self-managem ent activities by Metro Health and YDPP will be a new program to be implem ented by the Greater YMCA of San Antonio. Both programs have a very strong evidence-b ase for improving outcomes among diabetics and pre-diabetes. Staff experience and support for both ac tivities is high and should provide good support for program expansion. 5-Year Expected Outcome for Provider and Patients: Improved self-efficacy for managing diabetes, im proved health behaviors and reduced health care utilization and costs among program participants. Starting Point/Baseline: In the past two years Metro Health has increased internal capacity to provide Stanford Chronic Disease and Diabetes Self-Management progra mming in Bexar County. Staff have completed eighteen community-based workshops of seven week s in lengths, reaching 192 total participant workshop completers and contacts of over 1,300 community members w ith or at risk of chronic disease, diabetes, and their caretakers/family members. These workshops have taken place in churches, community centers, and senior centers. In a lo cal environment with limited community- based and culturally sensitive preven tive services, geographic areas of pronounced chronic disease and diabetes disparities, and a primary care and patient-centered medical home shortage in the inner city. These services ha ve been supported by state grant funds which will expire in March 2013. The YMCA of Greater San Antonio is presently not offering the YDPP program but is gearing up for the insurance- based arm of YDPP in part nership with United Healthcare in the coming months. This proposed project w ould provide access to an effec tive intervention in a community- based setting for at- risk uninsur ed and underinsured individuals to prevent the onset of diabetes. Rationale: Bexar County experiences a high death and disease bur den related to chronic illnesses. There is a significant need for evidence-based disease self-management programs offered within community settings at no cost to participants. In 2009, the five distinct leadi ng causes of death in Bexar County for adults aged 25 and older were heart disease, malignant neoplasms, chroni c lower respiratory diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and diabetes mellitus (Metro Health, Health Profiles 2009). These causes accounted for 65% of all deaths in adults ag ed 25 and older, many of which can be attributed to unhealthy lifestyle behaviors related to poor nutrition, physical inactivity, and tobacco use. According to 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Syst em (BRFSS) data, more than 67% of Bexar County respondents are overweight or obese, which includes disp roportionate representation by 1040 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District African American and Hispanic residents. Appr oximately three-quarters of African American (72%) and Hispanic residents ( 76%) are overweight or obese, compared to 61% of Whites. Morbid obesity was reported in 20% of African Americans and 16% of Hispanics, but only 8% among Whites. Additional self-repor ted health status and behaviors according to the 2010 BRFSS found that 14% were dia gnosed with diabetes, 28% are daily smokers, and only 22% consume five servings of fruits and vegetables per day, while 7% consume fruits and vegetables never or once daily. In terms of physical activity, 73% reported that they had participated in some physical activity during the past month. Over one-third of the responde nts stated that lack of time and motivation was the reas ons that respondents gave for not walking. As with the local obesity demographics, there are significant income and geographic disparities for those diagnosed with diabetes. Diabetes was also found to be highest among those making less than $15,000 per year (21%) as compared to other inco me categories (ranging from 5-17%), with the highest incidence within the south, east and west sides of the inner city. Within Bexar County, Hispanics have twice the rate of diabetic amput ations compared to white non Hispanics (117 vs. 54 per 100,000). These socioeconomic, racial an d ethnic disparities in disease burden and complication rates are reflectiv e of the gaps in linguistical ly and culturally appropriate community-based preventive services for chronic di sease and diabetes that exists in San Antonio. Unique community need identificati on number the project addresses: This project directly addresse s the RHP 6 need to provide im proved prevention and management of chronic diseases including diabet es within the region (CN.2). How the project represents a new initiative or significantly enhances an existing delivery system reform initiative: The proposed intervention to increase availabil ity of evidence-based di sease self-management programs and provide the National YMCA Diabet es Prevention Program (YDPP) at multiple locations throughout the c ity will fill those gaps in commun ity- based preventive services and provide expanded services more in line with community demand for services and disease burden in San Antonio. The health educators and community- based lay leaders will complete eighty-eight Stanford Chronic Disease and Diabetes Self-Management Workshop s throughout the city with an emphasis on disparity areas. Thes e workshops will reach over 1320 individual participants with 7,392 individua l contacts. Community capacity to provide disease self- management workshops will be increased to 24 lay leaders, and their retention will be aided in the provision of a small stipend. The YMCA of Greater San Antonio w ill provide 36 sixteen week intensive lifestyle intervention program s at the community level to reach over 500 individuals and their families who are at risk of developing diabetes. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): OD-1 Primary Care and Chronic Disease Management IT- 1.10 - Diabetes Care: Hb A1c poor control (>9.0%) OD - 9 Right Care, Right Setting IT - 9.2 - ED Appropriate Utilizatio n (reduce ED visits for Diabetes) OD - 10 Quality of Life and Functional Status 1041 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District IT - 10.7 - Other Outcome Improvement Target - Improve Self-Reported Health Status Reasons/rationale for select ing the outcome measures: The Category 3 Outcome Measures selected for the community diabetes project are Hemoglobin A1c poor control (9.0%); reduced emergency depart ment visits related to diabetes; and improved self-reported overall health status. Participants in the Stanford University Self-Management Programs and YMCA Diabetes Prevention Program participants will be assessed for these metrics at baseline and at six and twelve mont hs. HbA1c in poor control is associated with increased incidence of the complications from diabetes, including but not limited to cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. As HB A1c measures average plasma glucose concentration over prolonged periods of time, it is a more accurate indicator of average blood glucose levels in the months prior to the test. Emergency Department visits will be assessed at baseline and at six and twelve months for all program participants using validated questions that have been used in Stanford program evaluations. Enhanced self-efficacy, improved communication with healthcare providers and social supports will result in lo wered percentages in diabetes rela ted emergency department visits for all participants, which is vital in a population with hi gh healthcare costs. Improved community based education on the primary and secondary prevention of diabetes and its complications will reduce utilization and associated costs by promoting lifestyle interventions (YDPP Program) and patient-empowerment in th e primary healthcare setting (Stanford Self- Management Programs). Finally, overall self-report ed health status will be assessed among participants in both programs at baseline, six months and twelve months. While th is is a general reflection of health rather than specific to diabetes, it will encompass change s associated with both the Stanford and YDPP curricula including nutritional changes, physical activity, self-efficacy and other components. Additionally Stanford DMSMP research has found th is item to be a strong predictor of future health. The wording from the Behavioral Risk F actor Surveillance Survey will be used to allow for comparisons to community wide data collected for Bexar County. Relationship to other Projects: The expansion of the Stanford Chronic Dis ease Self Management and Diabetes Self Management Programs and new provision of the YMCA Diabetes Prevention Program (YDPP) at the community-level throughout San Antonio will work in concert with and enhance Metro Health 's proposed Neighborhood Based Physical Activity and Health Promotion Project (Category 2 project: 091308902.2.2) by building neighborhood- level community support systems for individuals living with chronic disease, diabetics, and individuals and families at risk of developing diabetes. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Metro Health will coordinate community-based self-management and chronic disease prevention programs with regional partners including University Health System's diabetes registry project, the UTHSCSA's chronic care management a nd community health worker projects. 1042 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District Plan for Learning Collaborative: Metro Health will foster Continuous Quality Im provement (CQI) through ac tive participation in the RHP 6 learning collaborative working grou ps to support and enhance project quality improvement, evaluation and achievement of outco mes. CQI elements are specifically included through milestones 2, 4, 6 and 8 beginning in DY 2. Additionally, Metro Health will seek out project specific opportunities to collaborate with regional maternal and child health as well as other local health department performi ng providers in other Texas regions. Project Valuation: Bexar County hospital discharge data estimated that hospitalizations directly related to diabetes in 2009 accounted for $100 million in costs, which ex cludes care for emergency room visits that did not result in hospitalization, as well as freque ncy of doctor visits. Overall, San Antonio as a community bears a very heavy economic toll from diab etes when indirect costs such as disability from complications, work loss, and premature de ath from related complications are taken into account. This proposed project will reach at least 5100 individuals and involves a significant time commitment of project staff and participants in each cohort. The Stanford Chronic Disease Self Management and Diabetes Self Management Pr ograms are staff intensive six -week long, two and a half hours per week process driven work shops that are meant to build patients' self- efficacy in managing their conditions. The works hops are co-facilitated by two lay leaders with chronic conditions of their ow n, with the intent on building peer support. The YDPP has a 12- month duration, which begins with an intensive 16 weekly core sessions and is followed by 8 months of monthly ma intenance sessions. Utilizing the methodology provided by the RHP 6 anchor, Metro Health assessed the following factors in assigning a value to this health pr omotion project: achievement of waiver goals, community need, project scope and th e level of projec t investment. This project was ranked high on achievement of waiver goals given the strong research and high potential for reduction of healthcare costs associated with diabetes prevention and management for Medicaid and other underserved populations in Bexar County. This project was ranked moderately in rega rds to addressing a community need. While diabetes in particular, and chronic diseases in general, are high priority community health issues, this project focuses more on secondary and tertiary prevention rather than primary prevention relative to other propos ed Metro Health projects. This project was ranked modera tely on project scope in that services will be widely available to residents but the number of pa rticipants in both the Stanford and YDPP groups will be limited by class capacity rath er than impacting the broader community. This project was ranked moderately in re gards to program investment since the interventions require ongoing participant interaction and evaluation over a somewhat extended period of time even though the pe r episode cost of the intervention is conservative. 1043 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District 091308902.2.3 PASS 1 2.6.2 N/A 2.6.2 ESTABLISH SELF -MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS AND WELLNESS USING EVIDENCE -BASED DESIGNS : COMMUNITY DIABETES PROJECT San Antonio Metropolitan H ealth District TPI - 082426001 Related control (>9.0%) ED Appropriate Utilization (re duce ED visits for Diabetes) Other Outcome Improvement Target Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P-X]: Expand Stanford Chronic Disease Self-Management Program Metric 1 [P-X.1]: Obtain a specialized multi-year license from Stanford Self-Management Programs Baseline/Goal: License obtained Data Source: License Metric 2 [P-X.21]: Train Metro Health project staff as Stanford lay leaders in the Stanford Self-Management Programs Baseline/Goal: All project staff trained Data Source: Training Logs Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $837,755.66 Milestone 4 [P-X]: Expand Community capacity for Stanford Chronic Disease Self-Management Program using lay leaders Metric 1 [P-X.1]: Train lay leaders to conduct Stanford Chronic Disease Self-Management Courses Goal: 24 lay leaders trained Data Source: Training certificates Milestone 4 Estimated Incentive Payment: $655,471.50 Milestone 5 [I-6]: Implement Stanford Chronic Disease Self-Management Program Metric 1 [I-6.1]: Number of participants enrolled in Stanford Chronic Disease Self-Management Course Goal: 1200 participants Milestone 8 [I-6]: Implement Stanford Chronic Disease Self-Management Program Metric 1 [I-6.1]: Number of participants enrolled in Stanford Chronic Disease Self-Management Course Goal: 1200 participants Data Source: Program Participation Logs, Enrollment forms Milestone 8 Estimated Incentive Payment: $882,995.00 Milestone 9 [I-6]: Implement YDPP Program Metric 1 [I-6.1]: Number of participants enrolled in Milestone 11 [I-6]: Implement Stanford Chronic Disease Self-Management Program Metric 1 [I-6.1]: Number of participants enrolled in Stanford Chronic Disease Self-Management Course Goal: 1200 participants Data Source: Program Participation Logs, Enrollment forms Milestone 11 Estimated Incentive Payment: $903,319.33 Milestone 12 [I-6]: Implement YDPP Program Metric 1 [I-6.1]: Number of participants enrolled in 1044 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District Milestone 2 [P-X]: Establish YDPP program Metric 1 [P-X.1]: Establish contract with YMCA to conduct YDPP program Baseline/Goal: Establish contract and initiate YDPP Data Source: Contract Milestone 2 Estimated Incentive Payment: $837,755.66 Milestone 3 [P-6]: Participate in at least biweekly interactions (meetings, conference calls, or webinars) with other providers and the RHP to promote collaborative learning around shared or similar projects.

Services include health code enforcement, food inspections, immunizations, clinical services, environmental monitoring, disease control, health education, dental health, and emergency preparedness. As a public health depa rtment Metro Health provides services to all residents, but has a particular focus on unders erved populations and those experiencing health disparities which often include a higher representation of Medi caid funded individuals. The STD/HIV Branch serves individu als through STD surveillance, cont act investigation and clinic services. Each year over 16,000 STD reports are submitted, over 8000 contact investigations are conducted and approximately 11,000 patient visits occur in the clinic. Intervention(s ): This project will focus on reducing HIV and Syphilis infections with a special focus on high risk populations in Bexar County. This project will utilize f our components that will work in conjunction to support the project goal. 1. Develop and implement a new outreach unit to focus on education and screening in the field for HIV and Syphilis among high risk adults and adolescents (13 years of age or greater). This may include probation or dr ug treatment settings in addition to other geographic areas and settings iden tified through surveillance data. 2. Conduct clinical case management and case in vestigations of all high risk pregnant women to assure appropriate prenatal care and third trimester syphilis screening to prevent congenital syphilis cases and othe r STD transmission. High risk women are defined as any that present to the Metro Heal th STD clinic for any reason or that are referred to Metro Health STD surve illance staff by community physicians. 3. Conduct education and outreach to local medical providers to encourage the adoption of third trimester syphilis testing among all pregnant women in Bexar County. 80 4. Expand STD clinic capacity (hour s and/or staff per shift) to receive additional patients identified through community outreach activit ies and provide prom pt and appropriate screening and treatment for syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases. Need for the project : San Antonio has several challenges and a critical need for enhanced, targeted HIV and syphilis prevention, control an d treatment strategies. This will reduce the burden of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV a nd improve the health status of adolescents and adults 13 years of age and greater in Sa n Antonio, Texas. The Be xar County rate of HIV infection is 21.2 per 100,000 populat ion which is 1.25 times higher than the state rate of 16.9. Bexar County's primary and secondary syphili s rate in 2011 was 2.3 times higher than the national and state rates. With 18 cases in 2012, the congenital syphilis rate in Bexar County was 80 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2010). Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, 2010.

From 2008-2011 the Bexar County annual rate was 40.9 per 100,000 live births, which is 30% higher than the average rate for Texas for that same period (at 28.6 per 100,000 live births) and five times the national average (8.5 per 100,000 in 2011). Target populations : The target populations for this pr oject include: high risk adults and adolescents (13 years of age or greater), high risk pregnant wome n, persons exposed or infected with HIV or Syphilis, and local medical provider s. Of the patients currently seen in the STD Clinic, approximately 80% are either Medicaid elig ible or indigent. We e xpect similar or higher numbers in the high risk targeted populations. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project's goal is to screen 800 high risk persons per year for HIV and Syphilis, assure third trim ester syphilis screening to prevent congenital syphilis, and provide coordination of clinical services for individuals that are identified as infected. Clinic services will be expanded by appr oximately 20% to see an additional 2000 clinic visits per year. In total this project is expected to support services to 8760 individuals.

Bexar County has several challenges and has a cri tical need for enhanced disease prevention and control strategies in an effo rt to promote and encourage lo ng-term behavior changes in adolescents and adults 13 years of age and grea ter. This funding will support new strategies to address local communicable disease rates. These w ould include increasing clinical services in the STD clinic, expanding services to the field, adding case management to prevent congenital syphilis infections and conducting provider educ ation. Additionally, targeted HIV and syphilis testing will be notably increas ed by funding staff that will provi de screening, health education and risk reduction counseling. In 2011, the overall rate of newly diagnosed HIV cases for Bexar County was 21.2 cases per 100,000, compared to a 2010 state rate of 16.9 per 100,000. This county rate is 25% higher than the state rate. Newly diagnosed HIV cases in Bexar Country disproportionally affect two minority populations: Hispanics and Non Hispanic African Americans. In Bexar County at the end of 2011, Metro Health reported 4,312 persons liv ing with HIV infection; this is 263.7 cases per 100,000 people. The CDC estimates 20% of pe rsons infected with HIV do not know their 1048 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District status. Targeted HIV testing will identify and link th ese individuals to care, leading to the goal of decreasing community viral load, and interrupting the spread of HIV. Bexar County's primary and secondary syphilis rate in 2011 was 2.3 times hi gher than the national and state rate. There was a 309% increase in primary and secondary syphilis cases, between the year 2002 and 2011 in the county. Additionally, disparities among racial/ethnic groups in Bexar County are deep, with the 2011 rate for non-Hispan ic African Americans, the highe st at 20.4, compared to 11.8 for Hispanics and 6.2 for the non-Hispanic Whites. Additionally, the number of Syphilis and HIV cases among youth ages 13-19 increased by 77% in Bexar County from 2006 to 2010. During the same period, reported cases of Chlamydi a and Gonorrhea increased to 31% and 29% respectively for the same age group. si nce has increased. From 2008-2011 the Bexar County annual rate was 40.9 per 100,000 live births, which is 30% higher than the average rate for Texas for that same period (at 28.6 per 100,000 live births) and five times th e national average (8.5 per 100,000 in 2011). In 2012, 18 cases of congenital syphilis were confirmed for a rate of 75.3 per 100,000 live births, a rate far surpassing any recent year. This project will address these ch allenges with four components that will work in conjunction to support the project goal; 1. Develop and implement a new outreach unit to focus on education and screening in the field for HIV and Syphilis among high risk adults and adolescents (13 years of age or greater). This may include probation or dr ug treatment settings in addition to other geographic areas and settings iden tified through surveillance data. 2. Conduct clinical case management and case in vestigations of all high risk pregnant women to assure appropriate prenatal care and third trimester syphilis screening to prevent congenital syphilis cases and othe r STD transmission.

Conduct education and outreach to local medical providers to encourage the adoption of third trimester syphilis testing among all pregnant women in Bexar County. 81 4. Expand STD clinic capacity (hour s and/or staff per shift) to receive additional patients identified through community outreach activit ies and provide prom pt and appropriate screening and treatment for syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases. Goals and Relationship to Regional Goals Project Goals: 1. Reduce HIV infections in high risk adults a nd adolescents (13 years of age or greater), 2. Reduce syphilis infections in high risk adults and adolescents (13 years of age or greater) 3. Reduce congenital syphilis infections 4. Increase the efficiency of treatment se rvices by provision or referral for sexually transmitted diseases and HIV This project meets the following regional goals: This project directly addresses the RHP 6 need to address high rates of communicable diseases within the region (CN.6). 81 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2010). Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, 2010. Available at http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/STD Treatment 2010RR5912.pdf pg. 8 1049 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District Challenges: Bexar County has several challenge s and a critical need for enhanced, target ed HIV and syphilis prevention, control and treatment strategies. Th is will reduce the burden of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV and improve the health status of adolescents a nd adults 13 years of age and greater in Bexar County, Texas. Rates of HIV a nd syphilis infections increased in Bexar County, both are higher than the state a nd national levels. The Bexar C ounty rate of HIV infection is 21.2 per 100,000 population which is 1.25 times hi gher than the state rate of 16.9. Bexar County's primary and secondary syphilis rate in 2011 was 2.3 times higher than the national and state rates. With 18 cases in 2012, the congeni tal syphilis rate in Bexar County was 75.3 per 100,000 live births, a rate far surpassing any recent year. From 2008-2011 the Bexar County annual rate was 40.9 per 100,000 live births, which is 30% higher than the av erage rate for Texas between for that same period (a t 28.6 per 100,000 live births) and fi ve times the national average (8.5 per 100,000 in 2011). Metro Health will seek to address these sign ificant community challenges through expanded and targeted HIV and Syphilis prevention efforts focused on high risk adults, adolescents and pregnant women. 5-Year Expected Outcome for Provider and Patients: increase in high risk adults a nd adolescents (13 years of age or greater) screened for HIV infection increase in high risk adults and adolescents (13 years of age or greater) screened for Syphilis infection increase in third trimester syphilis testing to prevent congenital syphilis Starting Point/Baseline: Currently the Metro Health STD/HIV Branch receives local, state and federal-pass through funding to support STD surveillance and case inves tigation activities. A dditionally local funds provide support to operate the STD clinic for 32 hours each week. Funding is not currently available to expand clinic hours, expand field testing for high risk populations or conduct case management or education activities to support congenital syphilis prevention. This funding will expand the clinical services in the STD/HIV Branch and provide funding to support new STD prevention strategies among high risk populatio ns. The clinic provides approximately 11,000 patient visits annually. The baseline for case ma nagement and provider education is zero. The STD Branch has periodically provided field testin g for special events such as World AIDS day but does not have a routine field testing operation . However new grant funds have recently been awarded that will provide approximately 1100 HI V field tests annually. The services proposed under this project will provide additional high ri sk testing and include both HIV and syphilis testing. Rationale: Rationale Rates of HIV and syphilis infect ions increased across Bexar count y, levels of which are higher than both the state and national level, fo r both conditions. From 2002-2011 there was a 309% increase in primary and secondary syphilis cas es in Bexar County. There was a drop in HIV infections in 2010 to 281 new infections diagnos ed in Bexar County; yet in 2011, the number jumped to 361 new HIV infections diagnosed, the hi ghest in the past ten years. With 18 cases in 2012, the congenital syphilis rate in Bexar C ounty was 75.3 per 100,000 live births, a rate far 1050 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District surpassing any recent year. From 2008-2011 th e Bexar County annual rate was 40.9 per 100,000 live births, which is 30% higher than the average rate for Texas for that same period (at 28.6 per 100,000 live births) and five times the na tional average (8.5 per 100,000 in 2011). One of the first steps to HIV and STD prevention is for the individual to know their status of infection\u2014and that is accomplishe d with screening. The challe nges that Bexar County faces with HIV and syphilis are the reasons why this pr oject option was developed. Metro Health aims to reduce the rates of HIV and syphilis infecti on by focusing on targeted testing among residents of Bexar County, especially those adults and adolescents at high risk for infection of HIV and syphilis and high risk pregnant women in order to prevent congenital syphilis cases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has iden tified HIV infection as one of the \"winnable battles\" that can be won w ith evidence based strategies. 82 Metro Health joins the battle against HIV inf ection and syphilis by developing a project with three major components: community-based HIV and Syphilis prevention, case management, and clinical services. Thes e components were chosen so that the Bexar County community receives high quality, efficient, and effective prevention and clinical services to address the high rates of HIV and STD in the community. Outcomes, mile stones, and metrics selected for this project not only address each of the thr ee components, but they also he lp Metro Health monitor their efforts in achieving their outcomes. Such e fforts also support the RHP 6 in controlling the spread of these diseases that are extremely preven table. Furthermore, Metro Health's efforts in addressing HIV and syphilis infection rates help s strengthen the health care infrastructure, representing an option for Bexar county re sidents to gain access to quality care. Unique community need identificati on number the project addresses: Metro Health's multipronged project addresses RHP 6 Community Need CN.6 through targeted HIV and syphilis testing and coordination of care. These actions serve as a safety net for providers in the region and allow the many uninsur ed or underinsured residents of Bexar County gain access to critical screening, case management and treatment services. Sexual health has become a priority within Bexar County. In coopera tion with the Health Collaborative, Metro Health has identified Sexual Health as one of the five data-driven health priorities through the 2010 Bexar County Commun ity Health Improvement Plan (CHIP). The sexual health goal is to \"ensure that males and females have access to education and resources to promote sexual health.\" Additi onally specific objectives identified in the CHIP include decreasing the rate of syphilis, congenital syphilis and HIV and increasing the rates of HIV testing. How the project represents a new initiative or significantly enhances an existing delivery system reform initiative: Through innovative strategies, Metro Health is pr oactive in connecting with these hard-to-reach and hard-to-find individuals. This project will significantly enhance existing delivery systems. The unique way in which Metro Health will accomplish this is through linkages with the three existing areas of the STD/HIV progr am: Surveillance, Disease Intervention, and Clinic. Targeted HIV and syphili s testing will be notably incr eased by funding staff that will 82 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

This funding will also support specific efforts to reduce the incidence of congenital syphilis through case management and provider outreach. The new HIV/Syphilis Prevention team will collaborate with the HIV/STD Disease Intervention team, the HIV/ST D Surveillance team, and the Clinical team through monthly meetings about disease trends , new locations for hol ding screenings, and enhancing the coordination of care for clients se en in the clinic. This coordination will allow project staff to focus outreach a nd testing strategies on \"real time\" disease trends; it will also significantly enhance the clinic's ability to serv e more people and serve them more efficiently. Overall it is expected that 2920 i ndividuals will receive new serv ices each year (DY3-DY5) for a total of 8760 over the cour se of the project.

Additional healthcar e costs and negative social outcomes will be averted by preventing and controlling the spread of HIV and Syphilis infections in Bexar County, including significant clin ical and developmental issues associated with congenital syphilis infection. These Metro Health outcomes are a priority for the RHP as supported by local STD and HIV data. Bexar County's primary and secondary sy philis rate in 2011 was 2.3 times higher than the national and state rate. Bexa r County's rate of new HIV in fections in 2011, 21.2 cases/100,000 population, was 1.3 times the state ra te of 16.9. This county experi enced a 27% increase in new HIV infections diagnosed in 2011 compared to 2010. With 18 cases in 2012, the congenital syphilis rate in Bexar County was 75.3 per 100,000 live births, a ra te far surpassing any recent year. From 2008-2011 the Bexar County annual rate was 40.9 per 100,000 live births, which is 30% higher than the average rate for Texas fo r that same period (at 28.6 per 100,000 live births) and five times the national average (8.5 per 100,000 in 2011). The United States Preventive Services Task Fo rce (USPSTF) recommends screening for syphilis and HIV in high risk adults and adolescents. 8384 Metro Health will follow nationally 83 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.

Within Bexar County, zip codes with the highest counts of new HIV infections were also areas with generally low income/higher poverty re sidents. The outcomes in this project will focus on targeted HIV and syphilis screening in th ese areas where hard to reach individuals may reside. The activities of this project will help Metro Health address these challenges and the health of low-income populations including Medicaid e ligible populations. Relationship to other Projects: The Metro Health comprehensive strategy to ex pand syphilis and HIV prevention screening and treatment among high risk populations supports Metr o Health's pass 1 proposed project for teen pregnancy, STD, and HIV prevention. The syphilis and HIV prevention, screening and treatment program will build knowledge and sk ills through risk reduction counseling among adolescents to decrease teen pregnancies. Clie nts in need of access to affordable reproductive healthcare services will be provided referrals. Staff in the syphilis and HIV prevention project will be available to provide or assist with ST D/HIV education to the teen mothers and their partners participating in the evidence-based Healthy Outcomes through Perinatal Education and Support (HOPES) project to redu ce repeat teen pregnancies. Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Aside from the teen pregnancy prevention project there are no other RHP 6 projects that appear to have a direct linkage to this proposed pr oject, however HIV/STD project staff will be available to support any related STD preventi on efforts should they arise among the primary care, specialty or mental health services projects proposed. Ot her regional performing providers may be particular partners for high risk scr eening activities and provider education to support third trimester syphilis tes ting and will be engaged th roughout the project period. 85 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

CQI elements are specifically included through milestones 3, 6, 9 and 12 beginning in DY 2. Additionally Metro Health will seek out project specific opportunities to collaborate with regional maternal and child health as well as other local health department performi ng providers in other Texas regions. Project Valuation: The project selected addresses a need to screen for HIV and syphilis within high risk populations in Bexar County. Based on recommendations from the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) screening for syphilis is impor tant for detecting new syphilis cases and increased opportunities to treat these individuals.89 If left untreated, even during pregnancy, the syphilis infection can lead to a multitude of costly complications for the individual and especially the newborn baby.90 One in three Texans with HIV received a late dia gnosis of their infection. With earlier diagnosis of HIV infection, therapy can be initiated befo re severe immunologic compromise occurs. Screening can be cost-effective even before incl uding the important public health benefit from reduced transmission to sex part ners. Linking patients who have received a diagnosis of HIV infection to prevention and care is essential. HIV screening without such linkage confers little or no benefit to the patient. Although moving patients into care incurs substantial costs, it also triggers sufficient survival benefits that justify the additional costs. 91 Even if only a limited fraction of patients who receive HIV-positive results are linked to care, the survival benefits per dollar spent on screening repr esent good comparative value . Mean cumulative treatment expenditures ranged from $27,275 to $61,615 higher for la te than early presenters. After seven to eight years in care, the diffe rence was still substantial. 92 Therefore, screeni ng these individuals for HIV and syphilis is a valued strategy. Based on locally obtained data fo r 2011, the average cost to deliver and treat an infant born with congenital syphilis was $54,677. The average length of hospital stay in these cases was 14 days (ranging from 1 to 45 days). These costs do incl ude the costs to the mother or of ongoing care needed for infants that may be born with signif icant physical and/or developmental disabilities. Using the 2011 average cost to an infant, the pr ojected cost of care to the 18 infants with a presumptive diagnosis of congenital syphilis in 2012 would be $984,186.

Utilizing the methodology provided by the RHP 6 anchor, Metro Health assessed the following factors in assigning a value to this health pr omotion project: achievement of waiver goals, community need, project scope and th e level of projec t investment. This project was ranked high on achievement of waiver goals given the high potential for reduction of healthcare costs through primar y prevention outreach activities, and early identification of infections leading to treatm ent and avoidance of complications such as congenital syphilis cases. This project was ranked moderate in regard s to addressing a comm unity need. Rates of HIV and STDs are increasing a nd are higher than state leve ls. Sexual health has been identified as one of the five priority ar eas through the Bexar County Community Health Improvement Plan. This project was ranked moderate on project scope in that services will be significantly expanded but will be targeted to those ge ographic and demographic segments of the population that have been shown to be at hi gher risk for infecti on based on local data sources. This project was ranked moderate in regards to program investment as project will focus on the relatively low-cost intervention of fi eld-based education and testing and include coordination of existing HIV and STD prevention resources. Additional clinic-based treatment and case management activities will be more resource intensive. 93 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2010).

Services include health code enforcement, f ood inspections, immunizations, clinical services, environmental monitoring, disease control, h ealth education, dental health, and emergency preparedness. As a public health department Metr o Health provides services to all residents, but has a particular focus on unders erved populations and those expe riencing health disparities which often include a higher representation of Medi caid funded individuals. Metro Health is one of four local agencies that provide WIC services. The Metro Health WIC program serves over 45,000 women per month. Intervention(s) : This project will implement the Baby Caf\u00e9 Model in San Antonio to increase breastfeeding rates and t hus reduce childhood obesity rates. Th e City of San Antonio's Women, Infants and Children Special Supplemental Nutr ition Program (WIC) re cognizes the need to motivate and empower women to continue breast feeding for as long as possible. Thus, WIC would like to propose to establis h a \"Baby Caf\u00e9\" breastfeeding drop- in center to expand services and attract mothers of all ages and from all sectors of the community. This will be done by providing breastfeeding help and support, from both skilled health professionals, para- professionals, and other mothers, in a friendl y, non-clinical, caf\u00e9 styl e environment. The approach is to deliver breastfeeding help at \"drop-in centers\" to mothers from areas of disadvantage and health inequality. The model ha s been replicated with great success, in large part because of the casual, re laxed atmosphere offered together with a high level of professionalism underpinned by evidence-based in formation. This environment would enhance the \"Loving Support\" Model currently used by th e WIC program in promoting breastfeeding. Thus the primary goals of this interventi on would be: (1) to promote the physical and psychological health of mothers and childre n through education and training regarding breastfeeding (2) to advance the general public's knowle dge of the health benefits, immediate and long term, of breastfeeding. Add itionally satellite Baby Caf\u00e9 sites will be established at five WIC clinic sites throughout the City. This project seeks to foster extensive cooperation between the Baby cafe (Popping Dr., Rittiman, Buena Vista, Pecan Valley, Centromed-Military Dr.). Additionally, all four WIC Agencies in San Ant onio have agreed to refer clients to the Baby Caf\u00e9 for breastfeeding support services. Women are welcome to receive ongoing support serv ices with as many visits to Baby Caf\u00e9 as they wish and are encouraged to participat e regularly over an exte nded period to support breastfeeding duration. Sp ecific activities occu rring within the Baby Caf\u00e9 visit include: 1. Welcoming a mother to the Baby Caf\u00e9, orien ting her to the facil ity and services, and assessing her needs. 2. If mother is not having breastfeeding problem s she will be matched with another mother of similar locality and age to provide peer support on: ma naging daily life and meeting 1060 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District the baby's changing needs, breastfeeding outsi de the home, and night time needs and options. 3. If a mother is having breastfeeding problems then she will be assessed by a lactation consultant who will determine the best course of action to resolve the issues the mother is having. The mother will then either meet with a peer counselor or a lactation consultant to resolve breastfeeding problems. At the same time she will also be invited to participate in group discussion sessions with other breastfeeding mothers, as well as given access to resources (handouts, books, pamp hlets, videos) at the Baby Caf\u00e9. For mothers with extreme breastfeeding needs/i ssues a care plan will be developed and follow-up appointments with the lactation consultants will be made as need. 4. Outside referrals will be made to participa ting mothers who need a dditional help outside of the Baby Caf\u00e9's scope of service. In addition to these individual client services Baby Caf\u00e9 staff will conduct community outreach to key partners including hospitals, WIC sites a nd the local breastfeeding coalition to expand the referral network and promote additional services and resources aimed at increasing breastfeeding rates. Need for the project : San Antonio has high childhood obesity rates and low breastfeeding rates. Higher breastfeeding initiation and duration rates have been shown to reduce the incidence of childhood obesity and the Baby Caf\u00e9 will help im prove breastfeeding rates. It is well documented and supported by research that br eastfeeding and breast milk are the optimum methods in providing infants the best start in life. Studies suggest that breastfeeding is associated with children and teenagers having less of a chance of being overweight. There are several factors in which breastf eeding reduces the risk of overweight among which include: that breastfed infants are better able to control their intake and better self-regulat e and that breastfed infants have higher levels of lep tin (an appetite inhibi ting hormone) thus lower ratios of body fat. According to CDC the longer the duration of brea stfeeding, the lower the odds of a child being overweight. (Harder et al.) \"For each month of breas tfeeding up to age of 9 months the odds of overweight decreases by 4%. This decline results in more than a 30% decrease in the odds of overweight for a child breastfed for 9 month when compared with a child who was never breastfed.\" (Harder et al.) Target population : The target population will be pre gnant and postpartu m women throughout San Antonio. Community wide data indicates 15.4% of the total popu lation is Medicaid eligible. A central and accessible location for the Baby Ca f\u00e9 will be identified and secured during DY2. Additionally to ensure that the Medicaid/indigent populati on has the opportunity to receive services provided by the Baby Caf\u00e9, satellite Baby Caf\u00e9 sites will be established at five WIC clinic sites throughout the City (Popping Dr., Rittiman, Buena Vista, Pecan Valley, Centromed- Military Dr.). Additionally, all four WIC Agencies in San Antonio have agreed to refer clients to the Baby Caf\u00e9 for breastfeeding support services. Category 1 or 2 expected patient benefits : The project seeks to provide services at the Baby Caf\u00e9 to at least 500-700 per year in DY3, DY4 and DY5 for a total of at least 1800 women over the term of the waiver.

Studies suggest that breastfeeding is associated with children and teenagers having less of a chance of being overweight. There are several factors in which breastf eeding reduces the risk of overweight among which include: that breastfed infants are better able to control their intake and better self-regulat e and that breastfed infants have higher levels of lep tin (an appetite inhibi ting hormone) thus lower ratios of body fat.

This decline results in more than a 30% decrease in the odds of overweight for a child breastfed for 9 month when compared with a child who was never breastfed.\" (Harder et al.) In the United States, according to the CDC's 2012 \"Breastfeedi ng Report Card\", 81% of attempt to breastfeed; however, excl usively breastfeeding at the end of 6 months decreases to only 25.5%. In res ponse to the sharp drop in mother s who initiate breastfeeding versus the number of mothers who continue to breastfeed 6 m onths postpartum, Healthy People 2020 have set out several benchmark goals to increase breastfeeding duration at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year postpartum. Hence the need to improve the durati on of breastfeeding among mothers who initiate breastfeeding is apparent an d interventions to assist in meeting increased duration goals put into effect. It is documented in the CDC's report that Mother-to-Mother support is essential to the success and satisfac tion a mother experiences while breastfeeding. Those who receive support have longer duration rates and thus have infants whose risk for obesity is decreased. Therefore, evidence based in terventions that facilitate mother to mother support as well as professional support would be ideal in addressing a nd meeting breastfeeding duration goals. Goals and Relationship to Regional Goals The City of San Antonio's Women, Infants and Children Special Supplemental Nutrition Program (WIC) recognizes the need to motivate and empower women to continue breastfeeding for as long as possible. Thus, the Metro Health WIC program would like to propose to establish a \"Baby Caf\u00e9\" breastfeeding drop-in center to expand services and at tract mothers of all ages and from all sectors of the community. Services will be available to all women regardless of enrollment in WIC. This will be done by pr oviding breastfeeding help and support, from both skilled health professionals, para-professionals, and other moth ers, in a friendly, non-clinical, caf\u00e9 style environment. The appr oach is to deliver breastfeedi ng help at \"drop-in centers\" to mothers from areas of disadvantage and health in equality. The model has been replicated with great success, in large part because of the casua l, relaxed atmosphere offered together with a high level of professionalism underpinned by evid ence-based information. This environment would enhance the \"Loving Support\" Model curr ently used by the WIC program in promoting breastfeeding. Thus the primary goa ls of this intervention would be: (1) to promote the physical and psychological health of mothers and child ren through education a nd training regarding breastfeeding (2) to advance the general public's knowle dge of the health benefits, immediate and long term, of breastfeeding. Overall the Baby Caf\u00e9 will seek to increase breastfeeding initiation, duration with a goal of up to 12 mont hs of breastfeeding, and exclusivity to support 1062 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District childhood obesity prevention efforts. This project meets the following regional goals: This project directly addresses th e RHP 6 need to improve services that affect maternal and child health within the region (CN.5). Challenges/Plans to Address Challenges: 1. Issue: Despite benefits for both mothers and Infa nts, rates of breastf eeding in the United States remain suboptimal, as per a 2004 CD C Survey showing only 74% of infants born in 2004 initiated breastfeeding, 42% conti nued breastfeeding at 6 months, and 21% breastfeeding at 12 months of age. Response: In the CDC's 2012 \"Breastfeeding Repor t Card\", 81% of women who deliver attempt to breastfeed; however, exclusivel y breastfeeding at th e end of 6 months decreases to only 25.5%. In 2011 data pr ovided by the Huddersfield Baby Caf\u00e9 (Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, UK), the serv ices provided by the Baby Caf\u00e9 helped improve breastfeeding duration rates at 6 mont hs from the United Kingdom's average of 25% at 6 months to over 50% at 6 months . By providing essential support and help during the initial stages of breastfeeding and subsequently through individual counseling and group support the Baby Caf\u00e9 was able to impact breastfeeding duration rates in Huddersfield. With the same model and in tervention the San Antonio Baby Caf\u00e9 will positively impact breastfeeding outcomes and improve breastfeeding rates, as seen at the Huddersfield Baby Caf\u00e9. 2. Issue: Insufficient education by Health Providers on the benefits of breastfeeding to include decrease in obesity among child ren, less ear infections etc. Response: The Baby Caf\u00e9 will help fill this gap by proving women information on short and long term benefits of breastfeeding duri ng visits to the Baby Caf\u00e9. Additionally, during Baby Caf\u00e9 group sessi ons, individual counseling and guest speakers this information will be reiterated by Licensed Professional Staff and Peer Counselors. 3. Issue: Lack of discussion on how it benefits mo thers such as less incidence of Breast cancer, uterus shrinkage, less bleeding, etc. Response: Providing information and resources via literature, j ournals, books, and through on-line resources is one of the bene fits that the Baby Caf\u00e9 will provide to breastfeeding mothers in the community. Because of the relaxed/caf\u00e9 type environment a Baby Caf\u00e9 is the perfect setting for women to come together to learn one on one or through the resources th at are available. 4. Issue: Breastfeeding initiation rates continue to improve, however many women still chose to Breastfeed and supplement with fo rmula thus resulting in lower breastfeeding duration rates. Response: The CDCs Guide to Breastfeeding Interventions include peer support, educating mothers, and professional s upport among the effective evidence based interventions to increase initiation, exclusiv ity and duration of br eastfeeding. All these interventions are a major part of what the Baby Caf\u00e9 offers, and women who utilize the Baby Caf\u00e9 will receive peer encouragement, and support and education by professionals that understand the needs of a breastfeeding mom. 5. Issue: The availability of formula is an enab ler to steer away fr om breastfeeding. Response: By partnering with local WIC agencies (a main provider of formula in the community) and setting up satellite Baby Caf\u00e9 sites within WIC clinics, the Baby Caf\u00e9 should be able to educate and help mother s who are considering discontinuing breast 1063 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District milk in lieu of formula. Many mothers turn to formula as a feeding alternative due to unresolved breastfeeding problems which can impede a mother's ability to naturally breastfeed. Hence, the Baby Caf\u00e9's staff's abilit y to provide resources, to educate, and to guide and support women during their prenatal visits, transition after delivery and thereafter will help to keep mother's breastfeeding instead of formula feeding. 6. Issue: Hospital protocols need to ensure mothers receive the quality of care needed to have a successful breastfeeding e xperience prior to discharge. Response: By partnering with the San Antonio Breastfeeding Coalition, the Baby Caf\u00e9 will have a direct link to communicate with lactation consultants and nurses who run maternity wards at hospitals within the City. This interaction will enable both entities to provide feedback and support to improve protocols and address the needs of breastfeeding mothers. 7. Issue: Support system need to be in place for all women 24/7 by the hospital where they deliver. Quite often upon discharge babies go through a transition period and have difficulties that were not encounter ed during their hospital stay. Response: The Baby Caf\u00e9 is staffed with Professi onals that understand hospital protocol and continuation of care of a mom and her ne wborn. By reaching out to her local Baby Caf\u00e9 mothers will have access to a help line (via phone) and will be able to visit during evening hours and Saturdays. This accessi bility will support her during those hours that she is not able to access se rvices that operate on trad itional work schedules. 5-Year Expected Outcome for Provider and Patients: The five year expected outcome will be to increase breastfeeding rates for the women served by the Baby Caf\u00e9. At least 1800 women per year will receive Baby Caf\u00e9 services. Starting Point/Baseline: City of San Antonio Metropolitan Health District does not offer drop in breastfeeding services. The current breastfeeding initiation rate for the C ity of San Antonio Metropolitan Health District WIC program is 70%. Rationale: Rationale Obesity is a national public health problem that not only afflicts adults but also the pediatric population. As per the CDC's 2007 report: \"Does Breastfeeding Reduce the Risk of Pediatric Overweight?\" it is well documented that breastfeeding is associated with decreased risk of pediatric overweight. In itiation, duration, and excl usivity of breas tfeeding all imp act the reduced risk of pediatric overweight in that those infants who initiate breastfeeding, are breastfed over a longer period (duration), and/or have been excl usively breastfed all di splay reduced odds of pediatric overweight. The CDC's report also prov ides examples of effective evidence based interventions which include: peer support, edu cating mothers, professi onal support, and media and social marketing. The Baby Caf\u00e9 model is set up to provide peer support, to educate mo thers through counseling and available educational materials, to pr ovide professional suppor t through lactation consultants, dietitians, nurses, and peer couns elors. The Baby Caf\u00e9 has been shown to be effective in improving breastfeeding outcomes, a nd currently the model has been adapted at 137 sites across 6 countries. In 2011, the Huddersfield Baby Caf\u00e9 (H uddersfield, West Yorkshire, UK) Annual Report revealed that out of the 250 participants surveye d, 78% indicated that attending the Baby Caf\u00e9 helped them continue to breastfeed. Additionally, over 84% of the respondents breastfed their babies for six weeks or longer, 71% breastfed their babies for 3 1064 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District months or longer, and over 50% continued to breastfeed at 6 mont hs. A 2005 United Kingdom (UK) Infant Feeding Survey showed that at 6 weeks of age only 48% of UK babies were breastfed and that number dropped to 25% at 6 m onths of age. Hence, the Huddersfield Baby Caf\u00e9 was able to improve breastf eeding duration rates at 6 weeks and 6 months of age above the UK's national averages. Another report from th e UK's Infant Mortality National Support Team found that the Calderdale Baby Caf\u00e9 (Calderdale, West Yorkshire, United Kingdom) was able to increase breastfeeding initiati on rates by 10 percentage points and breastfeeding duration rates by six percentage points between 2002 and 2009. In the US, Baby Caf\u00e9 USA reported that in 2011 the Baby Caf\u00e9s in Massachusetts (one church ba sed and one WIC based) were able to impact breastfeeding exclusivity rates am ong participating mothers. Th e Massachusetts Baby Cafes had breastfeeding exclusivity ra tes of 91% at birth - 3 weeks, 94% at 3 months, and 97% at 6 months versus the Statewide ra tes of 76.9 % at birth, 42.8 % at 3 months, and 14.1 % at 6 months. In San Antonio, the University Health System brie fly hosted a Baby Caf\u00e9 at a Metro Health WIC Clinic from November 2010 to August 2011, and during that time was able to increase breastfeeding initiation rates at that site from 81% to 90% (services we re discontinued when a state grant ended). The Baby Caf\u00e9 model ha s a strong evidence base for positively impact breastfeeding outcomes and more specifically ha s been shown to increase initiation, duration, and exclusivity of br eastfeeding. Given the consistenc y with CDC breastfeeding support guidelines, history in a variety of communities nationally and internationally, and due the local support for partnership with loca l hospitals and WIC sites the Sa n Antonio Metropolitan Health District would like to implement it in the San Antonio Community. Unique community need identificati on number the project addresses: This project directly addresses th e RHP 6 need to improve services that affect maternal and child health within the region (CN.5). How the project represents a new initiative or significantly enhances an existing delivery system reform initiative: San Antonio Metropolitan Health District's WIC Program previously hosted a Baby Caf\u00e9 sponsored by University Health System's grant fr om the Texas Department of Health Services. The grant ran for six months and significantly impact ed breastfeeding rates at the clinic in which it was housed. Breastfeeding in itiation rates went from 81% to 90%, and through the intervention this clinic site continues to report the highest breastfeeding initiation rate for all Metro Health WIC sites. Unfortunately, due to b udget cuts at the State level, the money for the grant ran out and so the program ended in December 2011. The Department of State Health Services WIC Program endorses the Baby Caf\u00e9 as an effective model and has encouraged WIC sites in Dallas, Houston, Austin, El Paso, and th e Rio Grande Valley to op en lactation sites/Baby Cafes. Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): IT-8.9 Other rtum women who exclusively IT-8.9 Other Perinatal Outcome - duration of breastfeeding among postpartum women Reasons/rationale for select ing the outcome measures: Metro Health's WIC Program has seen the positive effects that the inte rvention provided by the 1065 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District Baby Caf\u00e9 can have on a mother's choice to ini tiate breastfeeding, and with an ongoing program that is open to all expectant mothers in th e San Antonio Community the possibility of reproducing these outcomes on a larger scale exis ts. Hence, Metro Health has developed three Category 3 Outcomes: (1) increase breastfeeding in itiation for those mothers serviced at the Baby Caf\u00e9 (2) increase breastfeeding duration for those mothers serviced at the Baby Caf\u00e9 (3) increase breastfeeding exclusivity for thos e mothers serviced at the baby caf\u00e9. As per the CDC's 2007 report: \"Does Breastfeeding Reduce the Ri sk of Pediatric Overweight? \" breastfeeding initiation, dur ation, and exclusivity are key in reducing pediatric overweight. The CDC's meta-analysis of nine studie s showed that infants who initia ted breastfeeding resulted in a significant overall reduced risk of overweight. Furthermore, the re port states that the protection against overweight from being in itially breastfed versus being given formula may persist into teenage years and adulthood. Add itionally, the meta-analysis goes on to state that breastfeeding is inversely related to pediatric overweight, and that for each month an infant is breastfed (up to nine months) the odds of overweight decreased by 4%. This results in up to a 30% decrease in odds of pediatric overweight if breastfed up to ni ne months compared to a child who was never breastfed. Moreover, the report finds that in a study conducted by Harder et al., that exclusive breastfeeding showed a st ronger protective effect in decreasi ng the odds of overweight by 6% for each month of exclusive breastfeeding. The mentioned outcomes are a priority for the RHP as supported by local obesity and breastfeeding data. According to 2007 Metro Health WIC obesity data, of the children serviced by the program 31% were overweight or obese, compared to the 2007 State Average of 21.3%. Additionally, breastfeeding initiation rates for Metro Health WIC average 70% where as the State average is 82%. As per the Children's Hospital Association of Texas, in 2005 national Medicaid spending to treat childhood obe sity hospitalization was $118.1 million, a 120% increase since 2001. Hence, at this same rate of increase by the year 200 9 Medicaid would have spent $260 million on childhood obesity hospitaliza tion. Because of the high cost spent by Medicaid to treat childhood obesity the need for more interventions to address this problem is apparent. Metro Health's statis tics confirm a high obesity rate for children ages 2-5 and also confirm a lower breastfeeding initi ation rate. Thus, the outcomes proposed by this intervention will help in addressing obesity in both Medicaid and WIC populations (lower income) but will also address the problem with in Bexar County as a whole. Relationship to other Projects: The Metro Health Baby Caf\u00e9 intervention will support the Metro Health project 091308902.2.1 on teen pregnancy prevention by r ecruiting teen mothers served in the case management arm of the project to participate in Baby Caf\u00e9 drop in sessions, education, and counseling. 1066 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District Relationship to Other Performing Providers' Projects in the RHP: Not Applicable Plan for Learning Collaborative: Metro Health will foster Continuous Quality Im provement (CQI) through ac tive participation in the RHP 6 learning collaborative working grou ps to support and enhance project quality improvement, evaluation and achievement of outco mes. CQI elements are specifically included through milestones 3, 6, 9 and 12 beginning in DY 2. Additionally Metro Health will seek out project specific opportunities to collaborate with regional maternal and child health as well as other local health department performi ng providers in other Texas regions. Project Valuation: Breastfeeding is not only the most nutritious way of feeding an infa nt but also cost effective. Breastfeeding can save parents anywhere between $700 to $3000 dolla rs during the first year of life (on money not spent on formula). A study by M ontgomery et al. also s howed that breastfed infants had a cost saving of $112 in Medicaid expenditures during the fi rst six month of life versus formula fed infants. A 2010 UNICEF report assessing the economic benefits of breastfeeding estimated that around $13 billion would be saved if breastfeeding were increased from current levels (13.3%) to 90 percent of wo men breastfeeding exclusively for six months. Utilizing the methodology provided by the RHP 6 anchor, Metro Health assessed the following factors in assigning a value to this health pr omotion project: achievement of waiver goals, community need, project scope and th e level of projec t investment. This project was ranked high on achievement of waiver goals given the strong research and high potential for reduction of healthcare costs a ssociated with childhood obesity for Medicaid and other underserve d populations in Bexar Count y. This project has the potential to significantly im prove breastfeeding rates which have been shown in the research to reduce the risk of childho od obesity, among other health benefits. This project was ranked low in regards to addressing a community need. Childhood obesity has been demonstrated as a particul ar concern, and local breastfeeding rates are below the state average, however breastfeedi ng as a strategy to addr ess obesity rates has not been well recognized yet by local providers and residents. This project was ranked low on project scope in that services will be available to all postpartum women from a variety of referra l sources however anticipated numbers of clients served is relatively small co mpared to other proposed projects. This project was ranked low in regards to program investment given the relatively low cost of the intervention for participants. 1067 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District 091308902.2.5 PASS 2 2.7.5 NA 2.7.5 Implement innovative ev idence-based strategies to reduce and prevent obesity in children and adolescents - Breastfeeding Promotion for Ch ildhood Obesity Prevention Performing Provider: San Antonio-Metr opolitan Health Di strict TPI IT-8.9 Other Outcome Improvement - Breastfeeding Initiation Other Outcome Improvement Target - Breastfeeding Duration Other Outcome Improvement Target - Breastfeeding Exclusivity Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 [P-X]: Establish Baby Caf\u00e9 to provide breastfeeding support and services to increase breastfeeding rates Metric 1 [P-X-1]: Establish Baby Caf\u00e9 Baseline/Goal: Obtain Baby Caf\u00e9 licensure Data Source: Application and Caf\u00e9 License Metric 2 [P-X-1]: Establish Baby Caf\u00e9 Baseline/Goal: Establish Baby Caf\u00e9 location Data Source: Lease or rental agreement for Baby Caf\u00e9 Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $376,670.00 Milestone 2 Milestone 4 [P-X]: Share information and resources with potential Baby Caf\u00e9 participants and referral agencies Metric 1 [P-X-1]: Implement Outreach and Marketing Plan Goal: Contact 600 potential Baby Caf\u00e9 clients Data Source: Outreach documentation and logs Milestone 4 Estimated Incentive Payment: $393,551.33 Milestone 5 [I-5]: Establish clientele receiving services at the Baby Caf\u00e9 Metric 1 Milestone 7 [P-X]: Share information and resources with potential Baby Caf\u00e9 participants and referral agencies Metric 1 [P-X-1]: Implement Outreach and Marketing Plan Goal: Contact 600 potential Baby Caf\u00e9 clients Data Source: Outreach documentation and logs Milestone 7 Estimated Incentive Payment: $399,029.66 Milestone 8 [I-5]: Establish clientele receiving services at the Baby Caf\u00e9 Metric 1 Milestone 10 [P-X]: Share information and resources with potential Baby Caf\u00e9 participants and referral agencies Metric 1 [P-X-1]: Implement Outreach and Marketing Plan Goal: Contact 600 potential Baby Caf\u00e9 clients Data Source: Outreach documentation and logs Milestone 10 Estimated Incentive Payment: $407,718.66 Milestone 11 [I-5]: Establish clientele receiving services at the Baby Caf\u00e9 Metric 1 1068 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District [P-X]: Develop Outreach and Referral Plan Metric 1 [P-X-1]: Document outreach and referral plan Baseline/Goal: Document/produce outreach and referral plan Data Source: Outreach/Referral Plan Milestone 2 Estimated Incentive Payment: $376,670.00 Milestone 3 [P-5]: Participate in at least biweekly interactions (meetings, conference calls, or webinars) with other providers and the RHP to promote collaborative learning around shared or similar projects.

In the same report, Texa s scored particularly weak on diabetes care. Diabetes is in the top list of causes of death in RHP6. Diabetes care management is in the targets listed in RHP 6 Community Needs plan. Process milestones: Process milestones 1-4 were chosen to take our current MSO patient popu lation and calculate a 1071 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Baptist Health System baseline rate of % of patients w ith diabetes that have an A1C <9%. By implementing a call back system for follow-up testing and adjusting diabet es care as indicated, we can improve this measure for our MSO patient base. By adding incr emental primary care sites and providers, we will care for more of our RHP patient population and yet have a mechanism in place to monitor and improve their diabetes control through focused follow-up care by our primary care physicians. Improvement target: Improvement target is the measur e itself and we want to grow the % < 9% which indicates the patient's diabetes is in control. This is a relevant outcome measure for project 1.1 Expand Primary Care Capacity . Outcome Measure Valuation: Baptist values each project based on the specifi c needs of the community, the projected impact on the health outcomes of the community, the leve l of advancement to the healthcare delivery system, and the time, effort, and clinical resources necessary to implement each project. Since diabetes disease and lack of quality manage ment is identified as a high need in RHP 6RGs, focus on successful management resulting in redu ced # of patients with A1c > 9 improves the patient health status, reduces costs and avoids admissions, thus creating greater access for the RHP 6 underserved patient population. 1072 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Baptist Health System 159156201.3.1 PASS 1 3.IT-3.1.10 Diabetes Care: HbA1c poor control (>9%) VHS San Antonio Partners, LLC d/b/a Baptist health System TPI - 159156201 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 159156201.1.1 Starting Point/Baseline: To be developed in DY2 Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 [ P-2]: Establish Baseline rates Determine # of MSO patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes Data Source: Athena/Crimson Process Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $81,235 Process Milestone 2 [P-2]: Establish Baseline rates Calculate A1c value for each patient identified in Milestone 1 (using time period 1-1-12 through 9-30-12) - latest A1c on file during that time period will be baseline.

Readmission rates increase as the patient ages and with the number of co- morbidities. Reducing preventable readmissions helps reduce costs and improve quality of care and life for the patient and family. BHS will instit ute a care coordination process that extends to the CHF patient's home and into other health-care facilities 1074 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Baptist Health System Process milestones: Process milestones 1-4 were chosen because a ke y aspect of this care delivery system seeks to provide a smooth transition from the hospital setti ng through partnership w ith other health care providers to \"transition\" the pati ent instead of simply \"handing-off\" the patient. Education of the patient and family caregivers and ensuring prope r follow-up with the primary care physician is critical. Facilitating the appropr iate level of care at time of discharge begins upon admission and is a major focus for our Case Management team. BHS will also focus on hospice and palliative care models to assist CHF patient in terminal phase to avoid hospitalizations while maintaining a high quality end-of-life care.

The rate for readmission in post AMI patients has increased per a 2010 study in \"Cardiovascular Qu ality and Outcomes\" but is due to higher non cardiovascular complications. Bexar County has a higher incidence of comorbid conditions such as hypertension, renal failure with dialysis, COPD and diabetes. Additional factors such as pneumonia or impeded swallowing function can also impact readmission rates. 1078 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Baptist Health System Process milestones: Process milestones 1-4 were chosen as methods for reducing preventable readmissions which reduces costs and improves quality of care and life for the patient and family. BHS will institute a care coordination process for the AMI patien t focusing on a thorough \"transition\" from the hospital setting through partnership with other hea lth care providers inst ead of simply \"handing- off\" the patient. Education of the patient, family, and caregivers and ensuring the timely follow-up with the primary/specialty care physician is critical for su ccessful management in the AMI's patients post acute status.

DY5: o IT-9.2 Reduce pediatric Emergency Department visits - Target to be determined. Rationale: The emergency department frequently becomes the focal point in the hea lth care system when care is poorly coordinated. W ith shortages in many pediatri c specialties, chronic disease management is a critical area of concern due to the impact it can have ED utilization. The primary objective of project (TPI Pending) 1.3 (Pediatric Specia lty Care Expansion) is to improve access by establishing pediatric specialty pr actices, clinics and othe r sites of services. By providing a more geographica lly dispersed network of specia lty care, patients with chronic diseases will have greater access to these mu ch needed services, which will reduce ED utilization. For this reason, improvement target ED appropriate utilization will be used as an improvement measure for this project. As stated above, improvement targets will be implemented in DY3-5. CH of SA chose the re duction in pediatric emergency cases as an outcome measure for this project because the introduction of pediatri c specialties should reasonably lead to better and more available treatment, and untimely less admittance to the ED. The process milestones of developing and testing systems as well establishi ng a baseline rate are logistically necessary for the successf ul completion of the his project. Outcome Measure Valuation: In valuing this project, Children' s Hospital of San Antonio took into account the extent to which Pediatric Subspecialty Expansion project woul d potentially meet the goals of the Waiver (support the development of a coordinated ca re delivery system, improve outcomes while containing costs, improve the healthcare infrastr ucture), the extent to which it will address the community needs, the population served, and re sources and cost necessary to implement the project. 1097 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Children's Hospital of San Antonio The RHP 6 Community Needs Assessment identified the high prevalence of chronic diseases and lack of provider shortages as two major issues f acing the region. According to a recent analysis conducted by 3d Health, the San Antonio MSA alone has an estimated deficit of 20 pediatric subspecialists. The emergency department frequen tly becomes the focal point in the health care system when patients have trouble accessing sp ecialty care providers. By providing a more geographically dispersed networ k of specialty care, Children's Hospital of San Antonio can increase the capacity for pedi atric sub-specialty care servic es, which will reduce unnecessary ED utilization, improve quality a nd efficiency and reduce costs. 1098 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Children's Hospital of San Antonio (TPI Pending). 3.1 PASS 1 3.IT-9.2 ED Appropriate Utilization Children's Hospital of San Antonio TPI - 020844903 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: (TPI Pending).1.1 Starting Point/Baseline: Baseline to be established in DY3 Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 [P-3]: Develop and Test Systems Data Source: EHR or Horizon's Business Insights Process Milestone 2 Estimated Incentive Payment: $284,324 Process Milestone 2 [P2]: Establish baseline rates Data Source: EHR or Horizon's Business Insights Process Milestone 2 Estimated Incentive Payment : $329,569 Outcome Improvement Target 1 IT-9.2: ED Appropriate Utilization: Reduce Pediatric Emergency Department visits.

This shortage of pediatricians can cause significant access issues, forcing parents/guardians to use the ED as their child's primary care provider for acute illness management and preventative care needs. Th e primary goal of project (TPI Pending)1.4 (Pediatric Primary Care expansion) is to help established practices expand, replace retiring physicians, and add new practices in areas with significant acce ss issues. The ED Appropriate Utilization improvement target is an accurate meas ure for determining the impact this increased access has on ED utilization. As stated above, improvement targets will be implemented in DY3-5. The reduction of pediatric emergency room visits is a reasonable measure of the success of this program because the access to primary car e that will be the result of this project can reasonably expect to reduce ED admissions. Ad ditionally, the two process milestones selected are logistically necessary to implement this project. Outcome Measure Valuation: In valuing this project, Childre n's Hospital of San Antonio took into account the extent to appropriate ED utilization would potentially meet the goals of the Waiver (support the development of a coordinated care delivery sy stem, improve outcomes while containing costs, improve the healthcare infrastructure), the extent to which it will address the community needs, the population served, and resources and cost necessary to implement the project. The RHP 6 Community Needs Assessment identified the lack of provider shortages as two major issues facing the region. According to a re cent analysis conducted by 3d Health, Bexar County alone has an estimated deficit of 40 pediatricians. The emer gency department frequently becomes the focal point in the health care system when patients have trouble accessing primary care. By providing a more geographically disperse d network of pediatric primary care services, 1100 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Children's Hospital of San Antonio Children's Hospital of San Antonio can increase the capacity for these services, which will reduce unnecessary ED utilization, improve qua lity and efficiency and reduce costs. 1101 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Children's Hospital of San Antonio (TPI Pending).3.2 PASS 1 3.IT-9.2 ED Appropriate Utilization Children's Hospital of San Antonio TPI - 020844903 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: (TPI Pending).1.2 Starting Point/Baseline: Baseline will be established in DY3 Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 [P-3]: Develop and Test Systems Data Source: EHR or Horizon Business Insights Process Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $284,324 Process Milestone 2 [P2]: Establish baseline rates Data Source: EHR or Horizon Business Insights Process Milestone 2 Estimated Incentive Payment : $329,569 Outcome Improvement Target 1 IT-9.2: ED Appropriate Utilization Improvement Target: TBD Data Source: EHR or Horizon Business Insights Outcome Improvement Target 1 Estimated Incentive Payment : $528,843 Outcome Improvement Target 2 IT-9.2: ED Appropriate Utilization Improvement Target: TBD Data Source: EHR or Horizon Business Insights Outcome Improvement Target 2 Estimated Incentive Payment : $1,264,624 Year 2 Estimated Outcome Amount: $284,324 Year 3 Estimated Outcome Amount: $329,569 Year 4 Estimated Outcome Amount: $528,843 Year 5 Estimated Outcome Amount: $1,264,624 PAYMENTS FOR 4-YEAR 1102 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health System Identifying Outcome Measure and Provider Information: Title of Outcome Measure (Improvement Ta rget): IT-9.2 ED Appropriate Utilization Unique RHP Outcome ID: 020844901.3.1 - PASS 1 Performing Provider: CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health System TPI: 020844901 Outcome Measure Description: Outcome Measure Description: IT-9.2 - ED appropriate utilization Reduce all ED visits Process Milestones: DY2: o P-3 - Develop and test data systems DY3: o P-2 - Establish Baseline rates Outcome Improvement Targets for each year: DY4: o IT-9.2 Reduce the number of unnecessary emergency department visits - Target to be determined.

Rationale: The growing shortage of primary care workforce pe rsonnel in Texas is a critical problem that has contributed to increased wait times in hospitals, community clinics, and other care settings. Patients with non-emergent issues are using the ED for their primary care needs, which is a costly burden to the health care system. The primary goal of project 020844901.1.2 is to expand access by adding an additional clinic and hiring additional primary care providers, which will help address this substantial shortage, therefore gi ving patients a less costly alternative to the ED. As stated above, improvement targets will be implemented in DY3-5. Outcome Measure Valuation: In valuing this project, CHRISTUS Santa Rosa took into account the extent to which appropriate ED utilization would potentially meet the goals of the Waiver (support the development of a coordinated care delivery system, improve out comes while containing costs, improve the healthcare infrastructure), the extent to wh ich it will address the community needs, the population served, and resources and cost necessary to implement the project. The inappropriate use of EDs (particularly as sites of primary care) is a pervasive inefficiency in the healthcare delivery system adding a costly burden to the health care system. By reducing inappropriate use of EDs , CHRISTUS Santa Rosa can help lower the cost of healthcare in the community and in the State, and free up healthca re emergency healthcare resources for patients who truly need them. 1103 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health System 020844901.3.1 PASS 1 3.IT-9.2 ED Appropriate Utilization CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health System TPI - 020844901 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 020844901.1.1 Starting Point/Baseline: Baseline to be established in DY3 Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 [P-3]: Develop and Test Systems Data Source: EHR/Horizon Business Insights Process Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $189,549 Process Milestone 2 [P2]: Establish baseline rates Data Source: EHR/Horizon Business Insights Process Milestone 2 Estimated Incentive Payment : $219,713 Outcome Improvement Target 1 IT-9.2: ED Appropriate Utilization Improvement Target: TBD Data Source: EHR/Horizon Business Insights Outcome Improvement Target 1 Estimated Incentive Payment : $352,562 Outcome Improvement Target 2 IT-9.2: ED Appropriate Utilization Improvement Target: TBD Data Source: EHR/Horizon Business Insights Outcome Improvement Target 2 Estimated Incentive Payment : $843,083 Year 2 Estimated Outcome Amount: $189,549 Year 3 Estimated Outcome Amount: $219,713 Year 4 Estimated Outcome Amount: $352,562 Year 5 Estimated Outcome Amount: RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health System Identifying Outcome Measure and Provider Information: Title of Outcome Measure (Improvement Target): IT-1.10 Diabetes Care: HbA1c Poor Control Unique 020844901.3.2 - PASS 1 Performing Provide: CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health System TPI: 020844901 Outcome Outcome Measure Description: IT-1.10 - Diabetes Care: HbA1c Poor Control Percentage of patients 65 to 75 years of age with diabetes (Type 1 or type 2) who had hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) control >9%.

DY5: o IT-1.10 decrease the percentage of patient s 65 to 75 years of age with diabetes (Type 1 or type 2) who have HbA1c control >9% - % to be determined. Rationale: Diabetes is one of the most co stly and highly prevalent chronic diseases in the United States. Diabetes control can improve the quality of life for millions of Americans and save billions of health care dollars. In addition, other chr onic conditions are comm on among people with diabetes and account for much of the morbidity these patients face. Comorbidities can have profound effects on patients' ability to manage th eir self-care. A major goal of Project 020844901.2.4 (Patient-Centered Medical Home) is to improve adherence to care plans by offering comprehensive preventative and primary car e services that cater to the complex, chronic care needs of the population 65 and older. This outcome measure will track the progress of the Medical Home project because it gauges the manage ment of one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in the community. The process mileston es selected are necessary to logistically implement the project. CHRISTUS needs a baselin e and data in order to measure the outcome. Outcome Measure Valuation: In valuing this project, CHRIST US Santa Rosa took into acco unt the extent to which the appropriate management of diabetes in the 65- 75 year old population woul d potentially meet the goals of the Waiver (support the development of a coordinated care delivery system, improve outcomes while containing costs, improve the health care infrastructure), the extent to which it will address the community needs, the population served, and resources and cost necessary to implement the project.

During the last decades, heart failure treatment has improve d rapidly. There are now a number of drugs recommended along with non-pharmacological interv entions such as cha nges in lifestyle and monitoring of symptoms to improve mortality and morbidity in pa tients with heart failure. The responsibility of health care professionals is to prescribe treatment according to guidelines and to dedicate additional time and effort to encourag e and support patient to comply with a multi- faceted treatment program. Conges tive Heart Failure is one of th e principal diagnoses that will be targeted by the care transiti ons program, which makes improveme nt target IT-3.2 Congestive Heart Failure 30-Day Readmission Rate a suitable measurement for this project. As stated above, improvement targets will be implemented in DY3-5. The process milestones were chosen because they are logistically necessary for th e successful implementation of this project. Specifically, data and a baseline are both necessa ry components to measure he reduction in CHF readmissions. 1108 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health System Outcome Measure Valuation: In valuing this project, CHRIST US Santa Rosa took into acco unt the extent to which the reduction in potentially preventable readmissi ons due to Congestive Heart Failure would potentially meet the goals of the Waiver (support the development of a coordinated care delivery system, improve outcomes while containing costs, improve the healthcare infrastructure), the extent to which it will address the community needs, the population served, and resources and cost necessary to implement the project. According to the RHP 6 Community Needs Assessm ent, there is a high prevalence of chronic disease and related health dispar ities that require greater preven tion efforts and management. By reducing the unplanned re-admissions for the targ et population with conges tive heart failure and target those with pneumonia and acute myocardi al infarction CHRISTUS Santa Rosa will be adding significantly to the quali ty of life and the health ou tcomes of this population. These conditions are increasingly common in an agi ng population, are associat ed with substantial mortality and morbidity, and have considerable variation in outcomes across U.S. hospitals. A reduction in hospital readmission rates will be a re liable indicator of improved health status for this population. 1109 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health System 020844901.3.3 PASS 1 3.IT-3.2 Congestive Heart Failure 30 Day Readmission Rate CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health System TPI - 020844901 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 020844901.2.2 Starting Point/Baseline: Baseline will be established in DY3 Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 [P-3]: Develop and Test Systems Data Source: EHR Process Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $189,549 Process Milestone 2 [P2]: Establish baseline rates Data Source: EHR Process Milestone 2 Estimated Incentive Payment : $219,713 Outcome Improvement Target 1 IT-3.2: Congestive Heart Failure 30 day Readmission Rate Improvement Target: TBD Data Source: EHR Outcome Improvement Target 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $352,562 Outcome Improvement Target 2 IT-3.2: Congestive Heart Failure 30 day Readmission Rate Improvement Target: TBD Data Source: EHR Outcome Improvement Target 2 Estimated Incentive Payment: $843,083 Year 2 Estimated Outcome Amount: $189,549 Year 3 Estimated Outcome Amount: $219,713 Year 4 Estimated Outcome Amount: $352,562 Year 5 Estimated Outcome Amount: 1110 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Clarity Child Guidance Center Identifying Outcome Measure and Provider Information: Title of Outcome Measure (Improvement Target): IT-2.13 Behavioral Health Admission Rate for Youth. This is a custom/optional measure ONLY because measure 2.4 is designed for patients 18 and over. Our measure is for children ages 3-17 in the service area. Specific information on the numerator and denominator are noted in narrative and in the table. Unique RHP Outcome ID: 112742503.3.1 - PASS 1 Performing Provider: Clarity Child Guidance Center TPI: 112742503 Outcome Measure Description: Outcome Measure Description: IT 2.13 Behavioral Health Admission Rate for Youth The numerator would include discharges wher e the primary and secondary diagnosis was behavioral health from our acute, inpatient hospital. This would be applied against a denominator of all youth 3-17 who received a ny service following assessment, including a referral, individual, family or group thera py, medication evaluation, medication management, psychological assessment and/or consultation or pa rtial hospitalization as alternatives to acute care hospitalization. A baseline would be esta blished in DY3, and repor ting would commence in DY4, with improvements TBD based on the data an alyzed in DY3. This measure was required to be optional primarily because the other preventable admissions measures applied to patients 18 and over, and our focus is children and adoles cents. Clarity Child Guidance Center currently provides services for approximately 7,000 children. Some of those children who are assessed are admitted to our acute inpatient hospital, while ot hers require partial hospitalization or outpatient therapy. Our goal is to provide the right care in the right setti ng, thereby offering a continuum of services. Today, 1,300 children and adolescents present at local emergency rooms with no access to psychiatric care at that facility. We anticipate screening >300 patients annually who divert to our regional psychiatric service. A request was sent to HHSC on 10/1/12, follow- up on 10/2/12 and 10/3/12 about the appropriate measure to utilize. University Hea lth System was copied on all requests.

The process milestones also align with milestones indicated in Category 1, creating syner gy in the Plan Do Study Act processes. P-1 will be approached in DY2, with DY3 creating base line rates in order to report on outcomes in the latter part of DY3, and full year reporting in DY4 and DY5. The creation of a children's psyc hiatric emergency service located at Clarity Child Guidance Center will increase access to multiple treatment options and support the philosophy of the \"right care, right setting\". Rather th an the estimated 1,300 children and adolescents presenting at local emergency departments that do no t provide psychiatric care and be ing \"boarded\" for an average of 12 hours, youth would present at our facility fo r an appropriate assessment. Many times, in the triage and assessment process, other less intensive treatment options can be provided, such as outpatient therapy or day treatment. These options would reduce hospi tal admissions, the key outcome metric noted within IT 2.4, which was customized as 2.13 to measure youth admissions. Outcome Measure Valuation: The approach calculating values for milestones is based on our decades of service to children ages 3-17 with mental health problems. We are affiliated with The University of Texas Health Science Center's Department of Psychiatry and plan to expand the affiliation to the Department of Pediatrics in order to integrate care. Children served through our triage approach to care , resulting in \"right ca re, right setting\" will save local hospitals countless dollars. As an ex ample, most Emergency Departments can turn an ER bed within a 2-hour window, vers us \"boarding\" psychiatric pati ents ages 3-17 for an average of 12 hours. A child with a mental health crisis presenting at a local hospi tal for ED services is far more costly than our \"right care, right sett ing\" approach, even if the child is admitted for acute psychiatric services. However, we belie ve that a significant percentage of patients presenting to us can be diverted to less intensive behavioral health treatment services, such as outpatient therapy or day treatment. Our project also aligns with the Community N eeds Assessment, specifically to the following identification areas: CN.1 Texas ranks last in the nation on health care quality. CN.2 Many residents of RHP 6 lack access to me dical and dental care due to high rates of uninsurance and health care provider shortages. CN.4 There is a shortage of high quality mental and behavioral health services that are integrated with physical health services and/or provide crisis stabilization. Local funding will occur through our IGT partner, University Health System, and through self- funding. Note: During dialogue with HHS C, we would have benefited fr om the utilization of the OD-9 outcome measures for \"right care, right setting\" . However, the measure uses \"member months\" as part of the calculation and that approach is for managed care and not a typical measure used with hospitals. 1112 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Clarity Child Guidance Center 112742503.3.1 PASS 1 3.

IT-6.1: : Increase in patient satisfaction scores for one or more of the patient satisfaction domains (Target TBD) Rationale: Process milestones P-1 through P-3 were chosen due to the lack of accurate reports currently available to monitor and patient satisfaction sc ores throughout the entire organization, including outpatient services. In order to report accurate data and establish baselines, P-1, P-2 and P-3 must be approached in DY2-DY3. In DY3 we will establish baselines and test data systems. Improvement targets were chosen for DY4 and DY 5 in order to produce comparable data on the patient's perspective of care that allows objective and meaningful comparisons between institutions on domains that are im portant to consumers. Public re porting of the survey results is designed to create incentives for institutions to improve their qu ality of care. Public reporting will serve to enhance public acc ountability in health care by incr easing the transparency of the quality of institutional care provided in return for the public investment. Outcome Measure Valuation: One of the community needs addressed in our RH P Plan is that the high prevalence of chronic disease and related health disparities requi re greater prevention efforts and improved management of patients with chronic conditions. Additionally, the leading causes of death in Wilson county are related to cardiovascular conditi ons (30% of all deaths) and heart diseases (24%). Patient satisfaction with healthcare services is largely related to the utilization of these services. Understanding strengths, needs and receiving patient feedback allows for providers and staff to better understand how to tailor care delivery to meet thei r patient's needs. 1118 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Connally Memorial Medical Center 135151206.3.2 PASS 2 3.IT-6.1 Percent improvement over baseline of Patient Satisfaction scores Connally Memorial Medical Center TPI - 135151206 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: : 135151206.1.2 Starting Point/Baseline: To be developed in DY3 Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 [ P-1]: Project Planning-engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timelines and document implementation plans Data Source : EMR; Documentation of plans, stakeholder meetings Process Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $17,651 Process Milestone 2 [P-2]: Establish Baseline rates Data Source : EMR Process Milestone 2 Estimated Incentive Payment: $10,246 Process Milestone 3 [P-3]: Develop and test data systems Data Source : EMR Process Milestone 3 Estimated Incentive Payment: $10,246 Outcome Improvement Target 1 [IT-1.6] Improvement Target : Increase in patient satisfaction scores for one or more of the patient satisfaction domains Data Source : Survey Outcome Improvement Target 1 Estimated Incentive Payment : $32,997 Outcome Improvement Target 2 [IT-1.6] Improvement Target : Increase in patient satisfaction scores for one or more of the patient satisfaction domains Data Source : Survey Outcome Improvement Target 2 Estimated Incentive Payment : $78,811 Year 2 Estimated Outcome Amount: $17,651 Year 3 Estimated Outcome Amount: $20,492 Year 4 Estimated Outcome Amount: $32,997 Year 5 Estimated Outcome Amount: RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Dimmit Regional Hospital Identifying Outcome Measure and Provider Information: Title of Outcome Measure (Improvement Target): IT-6.1 Percent improvement over baseline of patient satisfaction scores (all que stions within a survey need to be answered to be a stand-alone measure) Unique RHP outcome identification number: 112690603.3.1 - PASS 1 Performing Regional Hospital TPI: 112690603 Outcome Measure Description: IT-6.1- Percent improvement over ba seline of patient satisfaction.

Patient satisfaction, specifically with regard to access to specialty care , is important to measure as th is is the exact community need DRH desires to meet. In other words, DRH desi res to increase and improve rural access to specialty care in its service region. There is no t a Cat.3 outcome measure that reflects fulfillment of this goal better than IT-6.1. This improvement target is centered on the patient's perception of access and care. Also, the impact of cycle time and provider productivity improvements achieved by P-17 in DY 4 and DY 5 is also reflected in specialty care patient satisfaction scores - (3)patient's rating of docto r access to a specialist Outcome improvement targets with their specific percentage or point increases in patient satisfaction scores will be determined in DY 3 after the accomplishment of P-2. Outcome Measure Valuation: The outcome measure and associated impr ovement target below were valued based on how closely associated the measure was with the chos en project. Additional methods used to value the project hinged on the valuat ion methodology weights provided by the RHP 6 Anchor facility, University Health System. The valuation methodol ogy included across four categories: Achieves Waiver Goals, Addresses Community Needs(s), Project Scope and Project Investment. This outcome measure received the hi ghest score across all categories Patient satisfaction is difficult if not impossi ble to value on a cost avoidance basis. However, DRH is of the opinion that increas es in patient satisfaction scores will have the greatest impact on access to quality healthcare for the region. It is the only measure which completely ensures care is \"patient-centered\" and meets the waiver goals. 1121 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Dimmit Regional Hospital 112690603.3.1 PASS 1 3.IT-6.1 Percent improvement over baseline of patient satisfaction scores (all questions within a survey need to be answered to be a stand-alone measure) (3)\u2014pati ent's rating of doctor access to specialist.

Improvement Targets - Outcome improvement targets for DY 4-5 were chosen based on their ability to accurately assess th e performance and impact of th e associated category 1 project 112690603.1.2. There is not a Cat.3 outcome measur e that measures performance of the associated Cat. 1 project bette r than IT-9.2. This improvement target will reduce costs for patients and for the Medicare program. A decrease in the average number of ED visits will ensure this cost reduction and ensure that the right care is occurring in the right setting. 1124 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Dimmit Regional Hospital Utilization of an urgent medical advice line with an ED fast track system (cat. 1 project) will reduce the number of ED visits while reduc ing cycle time (ED wait time) and improving provider productivity.

The process measurements selected are: P-1 Proj ect Planning and P-2 Esta blish Baseline Rates. Rationale: The measure was selected due to the high inciden ce of diabetes in both Frio County and RHP 6. Frio County has a 32% adult obes ity rate, low access to health y foods, an elderly population, a 25% uninsured population, a lower pe r capita income and a high perc entage of Hispanics. The above factors ALL lead to an increased prevalence of diabetes. In the RHP itself, diabetes is one of the leading causes of death. Disease manage ment and screening are paramount to improving health outcomes in this population. Addressing quality care and improve ment of screening exams in the diabetic population will also lead to an improvement in potentially prev entable admissions. (Between 2005 and 2010 HHSC found that RHP 6 had over 125,000 potentiall y preventable hospitalizations.) The ability to access primary care clinics and provi ders, i.e. ease of availability, is key in reaching patients in Frio County. Improved access to providers will lead to increased visits and therefore increased screenings. Diabetes is bot h prevalent and costly, with many patients going undiagnosed. Complications lead to increased emergency room utilization and increased costs overall. Many of those complications such as bl indness, can be prevente d with early screening and detection. Diabetes screen ing can improve the health outco mes of a substantial amount of residents in Frio County. Our goal is increased eye exams (retinal or dilated eye exams) in DSRIP year 4 (DY4) and in DY5 over the baseline established. After establ ishing the baseline rates, outcome improvement targets will be determined. To deliver these outcomes, process milestones were carefully selected. These milestones define the activities that will be undertaken to prepar e MRH to report outcomes in DY4 and DY5. The two process milestones selected are: P-1: Project Planning - Engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timeliness and document implementation plans. P-2: Establish Baseline Rates To effect change in both provider adherence to protocols and patient co mpliance, this project must be planned and organized with all stakeh olders on board. These stakeholders include physicians, mid-level providers, staff, mana gement, administration, and Medina County 1127 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Frio Regional Hospital residents. Baseline rates must be established to allow for the measurement of progress in the screening compliance of retinal eye exams. Outcome Measure Valuation: Diabetes is a terribly expensive disease. A recent study from the CDC predicts a dramatic increase in diabetes between now and 2050. The In stitute for Alternative Futures estimates that the number of Texans with diabetes will incr ease by 66% by 2025. The resulting medical and societal cost will be over $51 billion - a 78% in crease from 2010. Diabetes can lead to heart failure, blindness, heart attac k, kidney failure and amputations . From the Texas Diabetes Council, Medicaid reimbursement for diabetes re lated services (2006) reached $443 million. In 2010, 373,000 Texans were visually impaired due to diabetes; 5,570 had renal failure, and 7,840 lower extremity amputations. From the \"Institute of Alternative Futures\", the total cost of diabetes care in Texas was $28.8 billion in 2010. Treating and preventi ve screening could drastically reduce this number (c ost-avoidance) both in Texas, RHP 6, and in Frio County. The rural health clinics re ported over 47,000 visits in FY 2012, a nd if 13% of the patients had diabetes as a diagnosis, early screening coul d prevent numerous complications, hospitalization, and emergency department utilization. From the American Diabetes Asso ciation, \"people with diabetes incur $6,649 annually attributable to diabet es\". $1 in $5 of healthcare dollars in the United States is spent caring for someone with di abetes. If 50% of diabetic patients received high quality medical care in a primary care sett ing and complied with physician orders, the number of lower extremity amputations coul d be reduced by over 2,220/year and 31,000 fewer people could develop end-stage rena l disease. With an estimated 13% of patients in Frio County living with diabetes, the cost savings and improved quality of life certainly justifies this project. 1128 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Frio Regional Hospital 112688002.3.1 PASS 1 3.IT-1.12 Diabetes Care: Retinal Eye Exam Frio Regional Hospital TPI -112688002 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 112688002.1.1 Starting Point/Baseline: Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 P-1 Project Planning Data Source: Planning Document Process Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $45,601 Process Milestone 2 P-2 Establish Baseline Rates Data Source: Electronic Health Record Process Milestone 2 Estimated Incentive Payment: $52,857 Outcome Improvement Target 1 IT-1.12 Improvement Target: Increase the percent of qualified patients who receive a retinal or dilated exam or a negative exam in the prior year.

The denominator is the number of patients 18-75 years old who have evidence of nephropathy or a nephropathy screening. The baseline will be established and outcome numbers for DY4 and DY5 will be determined. The process measurements selected are: P-1 Proj ect Planning and P-2 Esta blish Baseline Rates. Rationale: The measure was selected due to the high inciden ce of diabetes in both Frio County and RHP 6. Frio County has a 32% adult obes ity rate, low access to health y foods, an elderly population, a 25% uninsured population, a lower pe r capita income and a high perc entage of Hispanics. The above factors all lead to an increas ed prevalence of diabetes. In th e RHP itself, diabetes is one of the leading causes of death. Disease manage ment and screening are paramount to improving health outcomes in this population. Addressing quality care and improve ment of screening exams in the diabetic population will also lead to an improvement in potentially prev entable admissions. (Between 2005 and 2010 HHSC found that RHP 6 had over 125,000 potentiall y preventable hospitalizations.) The ability to access primary care clinics and provi ders, i.e. ease of availability, is key in reaching patients in Frio County. Improved access to providers will lead to increased visits and therefore increased screenings. Diabetes is bot h prevalent and costly, with many patients going undiagnosed. Complications lead to increased emergency room utilization and increased costs overall. Many of those complications such as kidney failure, can be prevented with early screening and detection. Diabetes screening can improve the health outcomes of a substantial amount of residents in Frio County. Our goal is increased ey e exams (retinal or dilated eye exams) in DSRIP year 4 (DY4) and in DY5 over the baseline established. After establishing the baseline rates, outcome improvement targets will be determined. To deliver these outcomes, process milestones were carefully selected. These milestones define the activities that will be undertaken to prepar e FRH to report outcomes in DY4 and DY5. The two process milestones selected are: P-1: Project Planning - Engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timeliness and document implementation plans. P-2: Establish Baseline Rates To effect change in both provider adherence to protocols and patient co mpliance, this project must be planned and organized with all stakeh olders on board. These stakeholders include 1133 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Frio Regional Hospital physicians, mid-level providers, staff, management , administration, and Frio County residents. Baseline rates must be established to allow fo r the measurement of pr ogress in the screening compliance of retinal eye exams. Outcome Measure Valuation: Diabetes is a terribly expensive disease. A recent study from the CDC predicts a dramatic increase in diabetes between now and 2050. The In stitute for Alternative Futures estimates that the number of Texans with diabetes will incr ease by 66% by 2025. The resulting medical and societal cost will be over $51 billion - a 78% in crease from 2010. Diabetes can lead to heart failure, blindness, heart attac k, kidney failure and amputations . From the Texas Diabetes Council, Medicaid reimbursement for diabetes re lated services (2006) reached $443 million. In 2010, 373,000 Texans were visually impaired due to diabetes; 5,570 had renal failure, and 7,840 lower extremity amputations. From the \"Institute of Alternative Futures\", the total cost of diabetes care in Texas was $28.8 billion in 2010. Treating and preventi ve screening could drastically reduce this number (c ost-avoidance) both in Texas, RHP 6, and in Frio County. The rural health clinics re ported over 47,000 visits in FY 2012, a nd if 13% of the patients had diabetes as a diagnosis, early screening coul d prevent numerous complications, hospitalization, and emergency department utilization. From the American Diabetes Asso ciation, \"people with diabetes incur $6,649 annually attributable to diabet es\". $1 in $5 of healthcare dollars in the United States is spent caring for someone with diab etes. If 50% of diabetic patients received high quality medical care in a primary care sett ing and complied with physician orders, the number of lower extremity amputations coul d be reduced by over 2,220/year and 31,000 fewer people could develop end-stage rena l disease. With an estimated 13% of patients in Frio County living with diabetes, the cost savings and improved quality of life certainly justifies this project. 1134 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Frio Regional Hospital 112688002.3.3 PASS 1 3.IT-1.14 Diabetes Care: Mi croalbumin/Nephropathy Frio Regional Hospital TPI - Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 112688002.1.1.

The baseline will be established and outcome numbers for DY4 and DY5 will be determined. Rationale: The measure was selected due to the high incidence of documented heart failure in both Frio County and RHP 6. There are many factors which influence this. Frio County has a 32% adult obesity rate, low access to healthy foods, an elderly population, a 25% uninsured population, a lower per capita income, a high level of diabetes and a high percentage of Hispanics. The above factors all lead to an increased prevalence of heart failure. In th e RHP itself, diabetes is one of the leading causes of death. Disease manage ment and screening are paramount to improving health outcomes in this population. Addressing quality care and improvement in assessing patients with heart failure will also lead to an improvement in potentially preventable admissions. (Between 2005 and 2010 HHSC found that RHP 6 had over 125,000 potentially preventable hospitalizations.) The ability to access to specialists as well as primary care clinic s and providers, i.e. ease of availability, is key in reaching patients in Frio County. Improved access to providers will lead to increased visits and therefore in creased screenings. Heart failure is both prevalent and costly, with many patients going undiagnosed.

Outcome Measure Valuation: Heart failure creates a strain of local resources. Unfortunately , many of the associated risk factors for CHF are increasing in our commun ity. Factors such as diabetes, obesity, and hypertension have been on the rise. A recent study from the CDC predicts a dramatic increase in diabetes between now and 2050.

Process Milestones will occur in DY2 & DY3. DY 2 - project planning - will consist of relocati ng and establishing the clinic in its new setting on the hospital campus, hiring and training staff, and developing a process in conjunction with the hospital's EMR to accurately track patients wi th diabetes. We plan to specifically implement these plans through a coordinated team effort by drawing from hospital administrative staff, Christian Free Clinic stakeholders who curren tly operate the clinic, hospital information technology staff, maintenance staff, and human res ource staff to ensure a safe transition occurs between clinic locations. Meetings will be held with these parties to formulate a reasonable relocation timeline, and determine details of clinic operational needs (computers, phones, software etc.), supplies (blood pressure cuffs, ot oscopes, etc.). Other details that will be coordinated with the appropriate individuals from this group w ill include staff screening, hiring and training. Once clinic staff are hired they will be respons ible for developing the patient scheduling and tracking mechanism in the EMR syst em to enable us to accurately track patient information including, lab and imaging resu lts, and view current medications. DY3 - establish baseline rates - will consist of colla borating with key clinic physicians and the primary physician extender who will be operating th e clinic to determine the patient database and determine the patient baseline for improvement. The baseline will be derived from the third year's patient volume of visits, which we expect to be at least 20 to 30 pati ent visits a week. This is based on current patient volume from the Chri stian Free Clinic, which treats 6-10 patients one evening a week. DYs 4 and 5 will focus on the outcome improvement targets, which will be the health of those patients with poor A1c levels (>9.0%). Specific improvement target goals will be decided in year three once a patient baseline has been determ ined and health data has been collected on the diabetic patients receiving treatment from the clinic.

The various methods that will be utilized to achieve this outcome will include: quarterly appoin tment follow ups with these patients, free A1c lab checks to be interpreted at th e patient's quarterly visit, and pe rsonal calls to ensure patients have received their medications, taking them correctly, and are receiving ongoing diabetic education. Rationale: Diabetes is one of the most co stly and highly prevalent chronic diseases in the United States. Approximately 20.8 million Americans have diabetes, and half of these cases are undiagnosed. Complications from the disease cost the c ountry approximately $100 billion annually. In addition, diabetes accounts for nearly 20 percent of all deaths in people over 25 years of age. Many complications, such as amputation, blindne ss, and kidney failure, can be prevented if detected and addressed in the early stages. Alth ough many people live with diabetes years after diagnosis, it is a costly condition that leads to serious and potentia lly fatal health complications. Diabetes control can improve the quality of life for millions of Americans and save billions of healthcare dollars. The outcome improvement target to control diabetic HbA1c leve ls was chosen in conjunction with our process improvement measures of expanding primary care access, clinic hours and staffing as a way to make the grea test impact on community need. Due to the high prevalence of uncontrolled di abetic cases in the Seguin community, it was determined that creating a system to identify pati ents through this newly established clinic with one of the goals being to improve and/or manage patient diabetic A1c levels. Specific target improvement goals will be decided in DY three ba sed on the number of patient visits and data collected on diabetic pa tients receiving treatment from the clinic. Outcome Measure Valuation: The scope of this project should be categorized as large, due to the various coordination efforts and data collection processes that will need to be developed to manage and achieve short and long-term goals. The number of diabetic related ER visits and patient admissions is frequent do to the lack of primary care access for those pa tients who are uninsured, and unable to pay for their diabetic medications. This populations' ed ucation level also pres ents challenges for long- term success and adds to the complexity of this project, because of their ability to understand the importance of their disease and their need to comply with treatment. The lack of diabetic resource management in th e community is a real issue. By implementing this project and improvement target, we will help reduce the level of chronic disease currently recognized in the community, and hopefully, reduce the future rise of this illness. GRMC is currently receiving no local f unding to support the management of this type of project. 1145 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Guadalupe Regional Medical Center 138411709.3.1 PASS 1 3.IT 1.10 Diabetes Care: HbA1c poor control (9.0%) Guadalupe Regional Medical Center TPI - 138411709 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 138411709.1.1 Starting Point/Baseline: To be decided Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 Project Planning - P-1: Engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources to relocate primary care clinic and expand hours.

This milestone measures the hospital-level, risk-standardiz ed rate of unplanned, all-cause readmission after admission for any eligible condition with in 30 days of hospital discharge (RSRR) for patients aged 18 and older Numerator: (Note: This outcome measure does not have a traditional numerator and denominator like a core process measure (e.g., percentage of adult patients with diabetes aged 18-75 years receiving one or more hemoglobin A1c tests per year); thus, we use this field to define the measure outcome.) The outcome for this measure is unplanned all-cause 30-day readmission. We defined a readmission as an inpatient admission to any acute care facility which occurs within 30 days of the discharge date of an elig ible index admission. All readmissions are counted as outcomes except those that are considered planned. Denominator: Admissions to acute care facilities for patients aged 65 years or older Data Source: EMR, Claims Rationale: This measure identifies the hospita l's standardized risk ratio (SRR) for readmissions within 30 days of discharge for patients aged 18 years and older; utilizing this baseline data the organizati on will be able to measure progress toward outcome goals Exclusions: Exclusions: 1. Admissions for patients without 30 days of post-discharge data Rationale: This is necessary in order to identify the outcome (readmission) in the dataset. 2. Admissions for patients lacking a complete enrollment history for the 12 months prior to admission Rationale: This is necessary to capture historical data fo r risk adjustment. 3. Admissions for patients discharged against medical advice (AMA) Rationale: Hospital had limited opportuni ty to implement high quality care. 4. Admissions for patients to a PPS-exempt cancer hospital Rationale: These hospitals care for a unique popu lation of patients that is challenging to compare to other hospitals. 5. Admissions for patients with medical trea tment of cancer (See Table 3 in Section 2a1.9) 1147 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Guadalupe Regional Medical Center Rationale: These admissions have a very di fferent mortality and readmission profile than the rest of the Medicare population, and outcomes for these admissions do not correlate well with outcomes for other admissions. (Patients with cancer who are admitted for ot her diagnoses or for surgical treatment of their cancer remain in the measure). 6. Admissions for primary psychiatric dis ease (see Table 4 in Section 2a1.9) Rationale: Patients admitted for psychiatric treatment are typically cared for in separate psychiatric or reha bilitation centers which are not comparable to acute care hospitals. 7. Admissions for \"rehabilitation care; fitting of prostheses and adjustment devices\" Rationale: These admissions are not for acute care or to acute care hospitals.

Numerator: Number of u nplanned readmissions within 30 days of discharge for patients 18 years and older Denominator: Total number of admissi ons for patients 18 years of age and older Data Source: EMR, Claims Rationale: This measure identifies the degree to which the targeted interventions implemented with this project have been successful Rationale: Acute care readmissions within 30 days of discha rge create an economic and capacity hardship for the healthcare system. The Center s for Medicare and Medicaid Servi ces (CMS) estimates the cost of avoidable readmissions at more than $17 billion each year. Additionally, such readmissions have a negative impact on the quality of life for patents and their families. The ability to coordinate care across the continuum is increasingly recognized as an indicator of the effectiveness of healthcare organizations. Adequately pr eparing patients for discharge and providing support during the transition process has been shown to contri bute significantly to th at coordination. With the aforementioned above, GRMC will monitor EMR, Transitional Care Patient Tracking Logs, and Case Management outcome logs to extrapolate the data. This data will be compiled to document and report the outcome data as it relates to the Transitional Care Program. 1148 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Guadalupe Regional Medical Center Outcome Measure Valuation: Literature has shown that organizations with a high readmission rate for one diagnosis group are likely to have high rates with others as well. GRMC has a CHF readmission rate that is in the fourth (lowest) quartile in the state of Texas for th e period of 2006-2007. Our rura l service area includes many low income and uninsured/under-insured in dividuals and families. Significantly reducing readmission rates will improve the quality of life for our community as well as contribute to the continued viability of our organizatio n and opportunities to expand services. 1149 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Guadalupe Regional Medical Center 138411709.3.2 PASS 1 3.IT-3.1 All Cause Unplanned 30-day Readmi ssion rate for Patients 18 Years and Older Guadalupe Regional Medical Center TPI - 138411709 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 138411709.2.1 Starting Point/Baseline: To be determined in Year 2 Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 P-1- Project planning engage stakeholders]: Identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timelines and document implementation plan.

The condition chosen is Behavioral Health/Substance Abuse. By implementing the Patient Navigation System, GRMC ED would like to decrease the unnecessary ED visits for behavi oral health/substance abuse by 3% by year 5.

The milestone was ch osen because it seems as if a large number of people are utilizing the ED for unnecessary visits th at would be appropriate in a different location such as a doctors' office or clinic. Behavioral health/substance abuse was chosen as the target condition for the group to focus their efforts in order to steer patients to a be havioral health clinic that uses behavioral health evidence based practices such as : cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational enhancement therapy, motivational interviewing. Outcome Measure Valuation: The Navigation Program will assist to manage be havior health/substance abuse patients through outpatient resources, clinics a nd counseling services outside of the emergency department. Guadalupe County is federally desi gnated as a mental health prof essional shortage area. An additional report by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Qualit y, completed in 2010 that mental disorders/substance abuse related visits equal 1 of every 8 emergency department cases. According to a study completed by Salinski and Loftis (2007), Mental health re lated ER visits increased 75% from 1992 to 2003. MSNBC also reported in 2009, that only 9 patients accounted for 2700 ER visits in a one year period in Austin, Texas. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality also completed a report in 2010 showing that mental diso rders/substance abuse rela ted visits equal 1 of 1152 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Guadalupe Regional Medical Center every 8 emergency department cases. The lack of resources for the mental health patients is not only traumatic for them, but it al so takes scarce resources away from the patient with medical emergencies. 1153 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Guadalupe Regional Medical Center 138411709.3.3 PASS 2 3.IT-9.2 ED Appropriate Utilization (Standalone measure) Guadalupe Regional Medical Center TPI - 138411709 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: : 138411709.2.2 Starting Point/Baseline: To be determined in Year 2 Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 P-1: Project planning-engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timelines, and document implementation plans Data Source: meeting minutes and related policies and procedures Process Milestone 1-Estimated Incentive Payment: $ 70,716 Process Milestone 2 P-2: Establish baseline rates- Identify the amount of unnecessary visits for behavioral h ealth/substance abuse per quarter in the ED Data source: Meditech reports tailored for specific ICD9 codes, nursing documentation, and claims Baseline: # of patients identified Process Milestone 2 Estimated Incentive Payment: $ 82,095 Outcome Improvement Target 1 IT-9.2: ED appropriate utilization (standalone measure) Improvement Target: Decrease the amount of unnecessary visits for behavioral h ealth/substance abuse in the ED by 1% Data Source: Meditech reports tailored for specific ICD9 codes, nursing documentation, claims Outcome Improvement Target 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $132,200 Outcome Improvement Target 2 IT-9.2: ED appropriate utilization (standalone measure) Improvement Target: Decrease the amount of unnecessary visits for behavioral health/substance abuse in the ED by 3% Data Source: Meditech reports tailored for specific ICD9 codes, nursing documentation, claims Outcome Improvement Target 2 Estimated Incentive Payment: $315,750 Year 2 Estimated Outcome Amount: $ 70,716 Year 3 Estimated Outcome Amount: $ 82,095 Year 4 Estimated Outcome Amount: $ 132,200 Year 5 Estimated Outcome Amount: $ 315,750 $ 600,761 1154 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country Memorial Hospital Identifying Outcome Information: Title of Outcome Measure (Improvement Target): IT-12.2 Cervical Cancer Screening (HEDIS 2012) Unique RHP Outcome Identification Number: 136430906.3.1 - PASS 1 Provider Name: Hill Country Memorial Hospital TPI: 136430906 Narrative Description: Outcome Measure IT-12.2, Cervical Cancer Screening a.

Starting Point/Baseline (if applicable ): There currently is no baseline per centage available for the target population since they have not been evaluated for preventive care. Rationale: The process measures for this pr oject include (1) Project planning engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, dete rmine timelines and document implementation plans and (2) Develop and test data systems. Th ese steps are key to achie vement of the outcome. An assessment of parts of the co mmunity and businesses with the greatest need will need to be done as well as a plan for ensuring that the ke y needs for preventive car e and wellness are met. An outreach strategy as well as a co ntinuity of care detailed strate gy will need to be developed at this time. At the moment, a system for collecting client data has not been selected. Options, such as use of systems already in use by the hospital or 501a clinics, may be considered as well as others. For long-term patient and program mana gement, a clear system for managing patient information will be crucial. The outcome measure of the number of women who have been screened for cervical cancer was chosen because there is currently such limited data available on the health outcomes of the target population. Once we can begin to provide needed prev entive care services, we can begin to track the health of the uninsured population in our community with greater accuracy. Though we anticipate that major changes in the health of our community resulting from the program and its continuation past the project period, we do not believe that the screening services we will provide will demonstrate these outcomes in community health data immediately. We will 1155 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country Memorial Hospital continue to monitor the health of our community, specifically the uninsured, past the project period, and expect to see a major shift in th e overall health of th e target population. The Quality Improvement process for these measur es will also include participation in the Learning Collaborative set up in ou r RHP for those with similar pr ojects. There are a number of others in the RHP focusing their efforts on prev entive care, so we look forward to both learning from, and sharing our discoveries with, these other healthcare provi ders in our region. Outcome Measure Valuation: This Category 3 outcome measure is valued at $213,203 over the 5 year period. Of the 500 individuals in the target populati on, one can estimate that about ha lf will be females, at least thirty percent of which will not have had a cervica l cancer screening in the last three years. This means, that in addition to the many other health screenings that will be completed on these patients, at least 75 women will be screened for cervical cancer. About 6% will have precancerous results (Risser, Mokry, & Bowcoc k, et. al., 2010), and will be navigated through appropriate treatment routes. Th is will prevent, at least $300,0 00 in costs if those cases had advanced to cervical cancer (Risser, Mokry, & Bowcock, et. al., 2010). Beyond this, it will assist in preventing illness, loss of productivity, and even deaths related to a very preventable disease. Also, the Cancer Prevention Research Institut e of Texas found that th e uninsured population tends to have a much lower rate of compliance with preventive screening measures (as low as 20%), so it is likely that up to 80% of the wo men in the target populat ion will require cervical cancer screening. Meeting this need for such a la rge number in our community will significantly improve the potential for community health. Screening for cancer implies testing for early st ages of disease before symptoms occur. It involves application of an early detection test to a large number of apparently healthy people to identify those having unrecognized cancer. People with positive sc reening tests are subsequently investigated with diagnostic tests and those with confirmed disease are offered appropriate treatment and follow up. The objective of screening is to re duce incidence of and/or death from cancer by detecting early preclinic al disease when treatment may be easier and more effective than for advanced cancer diagnosed after the symp toms occur. It is important to evaluate the efficacy of a given screening approach to reduce disease burden, harm and cost, as well as its overall cost effectiveness, before it is considered for widespread implementation in large population settings. The only justific ation for a screening program is early diagnosis that leads to a costeffective and significant redu ction in disease burden. \"Of all cancers, cervical cancer is one of the most preventable and detectable through regular screening. Yet, cervical cancer remains a se rious threat to the liv es of Texas women. In 2010, an estimated 1,219 Texas women were di agnosed with invasive cervical cancer and 378 women will die of the disease. The rates of women being diagnosed with and dying from cervical cancer in Texas are higher than those of the United States overall. The estimated direct cost of invasive cer vical cancer in Texas for 2007 was $77.4 million. Hispanic women have the highest incidence ra te of cervical cancer, followed by blacks, non- Hispanic whites, and As ian/Pacific Islanders. Blacks have the highest age-adjusted cervical cancer mortality rate, followed by Hispanics, non-Hispanic whites and Asian/Pacific Islanders. 1156 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country Memorial Hospital Hispanic women in the Texas-Mexico border c ounties have a slightly higher cervical cancer mortality rate than Hispan ics in non-border counties. Incidence and mortality rates of cervical can cer are higher in rural counties than in urban counties. Overall, the incidence rate of cervica l cancer was higher in rural countie s (11.6 per 100,000) compared to urban counties (9.5 per 100,000) . The overall mortality rate for cervical cancer was higher in rural counties (3.6 per 100, 000) compared to urban counties (3.1 per 100,000). Eighty percent of women reported having had a Pap test within the past three years. The lowest prevalence of having had a recent Pap test was among women with less than a high school education and women living al ong the Texas-Me xico border. As with most cancers, the stage of diagnosis for cervical cancer determines treatment options as well as the prognosis for survival: The earlier the st age in which a tumor is detected, the better the patient's chance of survival. Relative to the general population, the fi ve-year survival rate among Texas women with localized cervical cancer is almost 90 percent. However, the rate is less than 20 percent for women w ith distant disease (Figure 1) From 2003-2007, a total of 5,397 cases of invasive cervical cancer were newly diagnosed in Texas women, with an average of 1,079 cases per year. The age-adjusted incidence rate in Texas was 9.7 per 100,000 women. In comparison, the rate from the National Cancer Institute's Survei llance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program was 8.1 per 100,000 (Figure 2). Despite be ing virtually preventa ble, cervical cancer killed an average of 340 women in Texas annually from 2002-2006. The age-adjusted mortality rate in Texas was 3.1 deaths per 100,000 women compared to 2.5 per 100,000 women in SEER.\" Reference: Risser DR, Mokry B, Bowcock C, Miller EA, William s MA, Magid R, Garcia R.

Outcome Measure Valuation: This Category 3 outcome measure is valued at $213,203 over the 5 year period. Of the 500 individuals in the target populat ion, one can estimate that at least 50% will not have been screened for colorectal cancer within the appropri ate timeframe. This means, that in addition to the many other health screenings that will be completed on these patients, at least 250 men and women will be screened for colorectal cancer. Regular cancer screening is extremely important for colorectal cancer. Not only can colorectal cancer screening help detect can cers early, which can improve survival, but it can even prevent cancer from developing by removing noncancerous polyps before they become cancer. It is very important for colorectal cancer to be detected and treated early since stage at diagnosis is the most significant prognostic factor in survival. It is estimated that approximately half of the deaths from colorectal cancer could have been prevented through screenin g. Preventing just one case of colorectal cancer can save up to $350,000 in costs to the patient and community. Reference: Risser DR, Mokry B, Bowcock C, MA, Magid R, Garcia R.

Colorectal cancer is the th ird most commonly diagnosed cancer in men and women and the second leading cause of cancer deaths overall. In 2010 it is estimated that 10,366 Texans will be newly diagnosed with invasive colorectal cancer, and 3,578 will die of the disease. The estimated total cost of colorectal cancer in Texas for 2007 was almost $3.6 billion. Blacks have the highest colorectal cancer incidence and mortality rates, followed by non- Hispanic whites and Hispanics. Non-Hispanic whites and Hisp anics along the Texas-Mexico bor der have lower incidence and 1160 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country Memorial Hospital mortality rates than non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics in no n-border counties. There are higher colorectal cancer incidence and mortality rates in rural counties compared to urban counties.

DY 5: IT-12.5, Other USPSTF endorsed screening outcome meas ures: Screening for high blood pressure in adults aged 18 and older. Improvement Target: 100% of all eligible indi viduals in the target population of 500 employed uninsured. Starting Point/Baseline (if applicable): There currently is no baseline per centage available for the target population since they have not been evaluated for preventive care. Rationale: The process measures for this pr oject include (1) Project planning engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, dete rmine timelines and document implementation plans and (2) Develop and test data systems. Th ese steps are key to achie vement of the outcome. An assessment of parts of the co mmunity and businesses with the gr eatest need will need to be done as well as a plan for ensuring that the key needs for preventive care a nd wellness are met. An outreach strategy as well as a contin uity of care detailed strategy will need to be developed at this time. At the moment, a system for collecting client data has not been selected. Options, such as use of systems already in use by the hos pital or 501a clinics, may be c onsidered as well as others. For long-term patient and program management, a clear system for managing patient information will be crucial. The outcome measure of the number of adults who have been screened for hypertension was chosen because there is currently such limited data available on the health outcomes of the target population. Once we can begin to provide needed pr eventive care services, we can begin to track the health of the uninsured population in our community with greater accuracy. Though we 1163 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country Memorial Hospital anticipate that major changes in the health of our community resulting from the program and its continuation past the project period, we do not belie ve that the screening services we will provide will demonstrate these outcomes in community h ealth data immediately. We will continue to monitor the health of our commun ity, specifically the uninsured, past the project period, and expect to see a major shift in the overall health of the target population. The Quality Improvement process for these measur es will include participation in the Learning Collaborative set up in our RHP for those with simila r projects. There are a number of others in the RHP focusing their efforts on preventive care, so we look forward to both learning from, and sharing our discoveries w ith, these other healthcare providers in our region. Outcome Measure Valuation: This Category 3 outcome measure is valued at $213,203 over the 5 year period. Of the 500 individuals in the target population, one can estimate that at least 95% will not have been screened for hypertension within the past year. This mean s, that in addition to the many other health screenings that will be completed on these patie nts, at least 475 men and women will be screened for hypertension. About 32% of Americans are hypertensive (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/f astats/hyprtens.htm ) and 31% of those are no t aware of it, while 17% are not being treated. This means that at least 48 individuals will be diagnosed with hypertension for the first time and almost 80 will be naviga ted to appropriate care and management of the disease. Hypertension is a very prevalent condition that c ontributes to significant a dverse health outcomes, including premature deaths, heart attacks, rena l insufficiency, and stroke. The USPSTF found good evidence that blood pressure measurement can identif y adults at increased ri sk for cardiovascular disease due to high blood pressure. \"The U SPSTF found good evidence that treatment of high blood pressure in adults substa ntially decreases the incidence of cardiovascular events. The USPSTF concludes that there is high certainty that the net be nefit of screening for high blood pressure in adults is substantia l. In the United States, hypertension is responsible for 35 percent of all cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction an d stroke), 49 percent of all episodes of heart failure, and 24 percent of all premature deaths.1 Patients with hypertension have 2 to 4 times more risk for stroke, myocardial infarc tion, heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease than patients without hypertension.2 Additionally, they have an increase d risk for end-stage renal disease, retinopathy, and aortic aneurysm.1,3,4 This substantial burden of suffering from hypertension, in combination with a feasible and accurate m eans of detection and a clear benefit from treatment,5 have led to a widespread recommen dation for screening for hypertension. In 1996, the U.S. Preventive Services Task For ce (USPSTF) reviewed the evidence regarding screening for hypertension.5 Based on its review, the USPST F strongly recommended screening adults 21 and older using standa rd office sphygmomanometry. Alt hough they did not recommend a specific interval for screening, they noted that measurement every 2 years for patients with previously normal blood pressures and every year in persons with borderline levels may be prudent.\" (http://www.uspreventi veservicestaskforce.org/3rdusp stf/highbloodsc/hibloodrev.htm ) One third of all deaths in Gillespie C ounty are related to cardiovascular disease (http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/hcque ry/report/?mode=summ&areas=86_255_271 ). \"Strong indirect evidence supports screening adults for hypertensi on. Hypertension is an important contributor to CVD morbidity and mortality. It is predictive of CH D events and is reliably detected through screening blood pressure measurements using a standard arm blood pressure cuff and sphygmomanometer. Additionally, treatment of adu lt hypertensive patients with drug therapy and possibly nonpharmacological interventions can reduce blood pressure and the incidence of 1164 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country Memorial Hospital cardiovascular events, including myo cardial infarction, heart failure, a nd stroke. The degree of risk reduction depends on patients' levels and possibly duration of blood pr essure elevati on, their other risk factors for CVD, and the c hoice of antihypertensive treatment. Additionally, despite rela tively clear evidence supporting screen ing and the widespread use of clinical blood pressure measurement, identi fication and treatment of hypertension remains suboptimal for the U.S. population as a whole. A recent population-based study using National Health and Nutrition Exam Survey (NHANES III) da ta reported that 31 percent of hypertensive Americans are unaware that they have hypertension, 17 percent are aware of their diagnosis but are not being treated, and 29 percen t are being treated but have not controlled their blood pressure.69 Healthy People 2010 aims to reduce all of th ese numbers to 5 percent.70 Substantial progress in organization of care and access to care will be required to approach the Healthy People 2010 goals.\" (http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskfor ce.org/3rduspstf/highbloodsc/hibloodrev.htm) 1165 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country Memorial Hospital 136430906.3.3 PASS 1 3.IT-12.5 Other USPSTF endorsed screening outcome measures: Screening for high blood pressure in adults aged 18 and older Hill Country Memorial Hospital TPI - 136430906 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 136430906.2.1 Starting Point/Baseline: TBD Year 2 (10/1/2012 (10/1/2013 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 [P-1]: Project planning engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timelines and document implementation plans Data Source: Implementation plan documents and timeline Process Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $25,181 Process Milestone 2 [P-3]: Develop and test data systems Data Source: Documentation of data management system and functionality Process Milestone 3 Estimated Incentive Payment: $29,188 Outcome Improvement Target 1 [IT-12.5]: Other USPSTFendorsed screening outcome measures: Screening for high blood pressure in adults aged 18 and older Improvement Target: 40% of all eligible individuals in the target population of 500 employed uninsured.

Rationale: Process milestones - P-1 through P-2 were chosen because stakeholders must be identified and engaged to affect the outcomes needed. The amount of resources that will be needed must also be identified. To effect change in both provider adherence to protocols and patient co mpliance, this project must be planned and organized with all stakeh olders on board. These stakeholders include physicians, mid-level providers, staff, mana gement, administration, and Medina County residents. Resources needed must be dete rmined and plans implemented to improve the outcomes. 1167 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Medina Regional Hospital A baseline number of patients who are receivi ng a retinal or dilated eye exam must be determined to compare improvements made in DY4 and DY5. Improvement targets: The measure was selected due to the high inciden ce of diabetes in both Medina County and RHP 6. Medina County has a 30% adult obesity ra te, low access to healthy foods, an elderly population, a 27% uninsured populat ion, a lower per capita income and a high percentage of Hispanics. The above factors ALL lead to an increased prevalence of diabetes. In the RHP itself, diabetes is one of the leading causes of death. Disease management and screening are paramount to improving health outcomes in th is population. Addressing quality care and improve ment of screening exams in the diabetic population will also lead to an improvement in potentially prev entable admissions. (Between 2005 and 2010 HHSC found that RHP 6 had over 125,000 potentiall y preventable hospitalizations.) The ability to access primary care clinics and provi ders, i.e. ease of availability, is key in reaching patients in Medina County. Improved acce ss to providers will lead to increased visits and therefore increased screenings. Diabetes is both prevalent and costly, with many patients going undiagnosed. Complications lead to increa sed emergency room utilization and increased costs overall. Many of those complications such as blindness, can be prevented with early screening and detection. Diabetes screening can improve the health outcom es of a substantial am ount of residents in Medina County. Improvement targets were chosen based on the timeframes of implementation. As eye exams are extremely important in the care of diabetic pa tients, the outcome measur e (IT-1.12) was selected. Outcome Measure Valuation: Diabetes is a terribly expensive disease. A recent study from the CDC predicts a dramatic increase in diabetes between now and 2050. The In stitute for Alternative Futures estimates that the number of Texans with diabetes will incr ease by 66% by 2025. The resulting medical and societal cost will be over $51 billion - a 78% in crease from 2010. Diabetes can lead to heart failure, blindness, heart attac k, kidney failure and amputations . From the Texas Diabetes Council, Medicaid reimbursement for diabetes re lated services (2006) reached $443 million. In 2010, 373,000 Texans were visually impaired due to diabetes; 5,570 had renal failure, and 7,840 lower extremity amputations. From the \"Institute of Alternative Futures\", the total cost of diabetes care in Texas was $28.8 billion in 2010. Treating and preventi ve screening could drastically reduce this number (cost-avoidance) both in Texas, RHP 6, and in Medina County. The rural health clinics reporte d over 47,000 visits in FY 2012, and if 13% of the patients had diabetes as a diagnosis, early screening coul d prevent numerous complications, hospitalization, and emergency department utilization. From the American Diabetes Asso ciation, \"people with diabetes incur $6,649 annually attributable to diabet es\". $1 in $5 of healthcare dollars in the United States is spent caring for someone with di abetes. If 50% of diabetic patients received high quality medical care in a primary care sett ing and complied with physician orders, the number of lower extremity amputations coul d be reduced by over 2,220/year and 31,000 fewer people could develop end-stage re nal disease. With an estimat ed 13% of patients in Medina County living with diabetes, the cost savings (a voidance) and improved qua lity of life certainly justifies this project. 1168 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Medina Regional Hospital 133260309.3.1 PASS 1 3.IT-1.12 Diabetes Care: Retinal Eye Exam Medina Healthcare System (Med ina Regional Hospital) TPI - 212140201 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 133260309.1.1 Starting Point/Baseline: Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 P-1 Project Planning Data Source: Planning Document Process Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $21,733 Process Milestone 2 P-2 Establish Baseline Rates Data Source: Electronic Health Record Process Milestone 2 Estimated Incentive Payment: $25,192 Outcome Improvement Target 1 IT-1.12 Improvement Target: Increase the percent of qualified patients who receive a retinal or dilated exam or a negative exam in the prior year.

Rationale: Process milestones - P-1 through P-2 were chosen because stakeholders must be identified and engaged for the successful outcomes of this pr oject. Needed resources, including people and technology, must be determined to manage the pr ocess. Plans certainly must be discussed, agreed upon, and implemented. To measure im provement, baseline data must first be determined. Medina Regional Hospital will work with the medical staff, mid-levels and clinic personnel to increase the number of patients who receive mammograms. Improvement targets: This is a relevant outcome measure for Category 1, Project: Enhancing Performance Improvement and Reporting Capacity. By edu cating and equipping staff with a variety of improvement tools, the healthcare team can iden tify ways to increase the number of females completing mammograms. The objective of the scr eening is to reduce the incidence of/and death from cancer by early detection. 1176 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Medina Regional Hospital Outcome Measure Valuation: Medina Regional Hospital values each project ba sed on community needs, the projected health outcomes, relationship to RHP, and resour ces needed to affect the outcomes. According to the \"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's 2011 report\", Texas scored WEAK on preventive measures and average on can cer measures. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in RHP6. Of the 16,000 deaths in 2008, 60% were due to potentially preventable causes. Screenings and preventive measures to reducing mortality and morbidity are critical. Breast cancer is the second leading cause of d eath from cancer in American women. According to the National Cancer Institute, screening mammography can help reduce the number of deaths from breast cancer among women ages 40 to 70; getting a high quality screening mammogram on a regular basis is one of the most effec tive ways to detect breast cancer early. According to a recent cancer st udy, early detection and advances in technology (for women in Wisconsin), resulted in death rate s plunging by 20% for breast cancer. The estimated per lifetime/per patient cost of breast cancer range from $23,000-$31,000 (The cost of treating breast cancer in the US; a synthesis of publis hed evidence-Pharmacoeconomics, 2009). As in all preventive measures, early dete ction is key in treatme nts and is cost savings . Multiple studies have confirmed that costs incr eased with increased stage of the disease. This outcome measure is justified by a decreased mortality in the community affecting a larger percent of the female population, a possible decrease in hospitaliza tions and a decrease in costs with early detection (cost-avoidance). 1177 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Medina Regional Hospital 133260309.3.4 PASS 2 3.IT-12.1 Primary Care and Primary Prevention: Breast Cancer Screening Medina Healthcare System (Medina Regional Hospital) TPI - 212140201 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 133260309.1.2 Starting Point/Baseline: Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 P-1 Project Planning-Engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timeliness and document implementation plans.

Improvement targets: This improvement target was selected for a numb er of reasons. This is a relevant outcome measure for Category 1, Project 1.10, Enhan ce Performance Improvement Capacity and Reporting. By educating and e quipping both staff and physicians with a variety of process 1179 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Medina Regional Hospital improvement tools, the healthcare team can iden tify and improve the number of PAP exams. Reporting can be more precise with closer and more rigorous follow-through. This outcome target is important, as cancer is one of the leading causes of death in RHP6. Cancer screening tests are effective when they ca n detect disease early. The incidence of PAPs will be increased by (TBD) % in DY4 and (TBD) % over baseline in DY5. Outcome Measure Valuation: Medina Regional Hospital values each project ba sed on community needs, relation to RHP6, and resources needed to affect the outcome. This project serves women at Medina Regional Hospital who are 21-64 years of age. Detecting disease early can lead to more effective treatm ent. Of all the gynecol ogic cancers, only cervical cancer has a screening exam - the PAP test. This test also helps prevent cervical cancer by finding pre-cancers. Dysplasia, a pre-cancer ous condition, detected by PAP test, is 100% treatable. Worldwide, cervical cancer is the third most common type of cancer in women. Early cervical cancer can be cured. Pap smears effectively spot changes, but they must be done regularly (A.D.A.A. Medical Encyclopedia). According to the National Ca ncer Institute, the estimated new cases of cervical cancer ( 2012) is 12,170: 4,220 deaths. As reported in \"Women's Health Issues\" (2010), total Medicaid costs at 6 months after diagnosis were $3,807, $23,187, $35, 853, and $45,028 for in situ, local, regional, and distant cancers respectively. It was concluded that given the great differen ces in cost of early vs. late-stage cancers, interventions aimed at increasing screening among low-income women are likely to be cost effective (cost-avoidance). 1180 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Medina Regional Hospital 133260309.3.5 PASS 2 3.IT-12.2 Primary Care and Primary Prevention: Cervical Cancer Screening Medina Healthcare System (Medina Regional Hospital) TPI - 212140201 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 133260309.1.2 Starting Point/Baseline: Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 P-1 Project Planning-Engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timelines and document implementation plans.

Needed resources, including people and technology, must be determined to manage the proce ss. Plans certainly must be discussed, agreed upon, and implemented. To measure improvement, base line data must first be determined. Medina Regional Hospital will work with the medical staff, mid-levels a nd clinic personnel to increase the number of pneumonia vaccinations. Improvement targets: This improvement target was selected for numer ous reasons: lack of access to primary care in RHP6, 12% of the residents are over age 65, and a low per capita income, adding barriers to preventive care. Under the category of \"Type of Care\" (according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's 2011 report), Texas scored WEAK on preventive measures. Between 2005- 2110, The Texas HHS commission found that RHP 6 had 125,090 potentially preventable hospitalizations. If individuals had access to pr eventive care, many of these could be avoided. Thus, these improvement targets were selected to increase the amount of ol der adults receiving the 1183 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Medina Regional Hospital pneumonia vaccine. Our goal in DY4 and DY5 is to improve access to care, and increase these vaccines, utilizing a formal process improvement model developed (1.10). This is a relevant outcome measure for Categor y 1, Project: Enhance Performance Improvement. By educating and equipping staff w ith a variety of process improveme nt tools, the healthcare team can identify ways to increase the number of vaccines given. Outcome Measure Valuation: Older adults are especially vulnera ble to certain diseases such as influenza and pneumonia. In 2008, the CDC reported that adults aged 65 and older comprised 90% of the deaths that occur every year from complications related to these. Vaccinations help older adults protect themselves from getting pneumonia and other illnesses. According to th e National Institute of Health, October 15, 2012, pneumococcal pneumonia can be contagious and is responsible for as many as 302,000 hospitalizations in the U.S. ever y year. In 2009, pneumonia ranked 8 th among the 15 leading causes of death in the U.S. As reported in \"Respiratory Reviews\" (Vol. 5, #5 ), pneumococcal vaccination of high risk groups, especially elderly, leads to a substantial reducti on in mortality. This report states that the vaccination was associated with a 43% reduction in hospitalizations for pneumonia, a 29% reduction in mortality, and a cost savings of $113-$512/person vaccinated. This outcome measure is justified by decreased mortality in the community affecting a large percentage of the population; a de crease in hospitalizations (cost avoidance); and a decrease in the spread of pneumonia. This is obviously a commun ity need for Medina County as well as RHP6. 1184 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Methodist Hospital 133260309.3.6 PASS 2 3.IT-12.4 Primary Care and Primary Prevention: Pneumonia Vaccination Status For Older Adults Medina Healthcare System (Medina Regional Hospital) TPI - 212140201 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 133260309.1.2 Starting Point/Baseline: Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 P-1 Project Planning-Engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timeliness and document implementation plans.

Methodist Healthcare System will measure if th e patient's access to care was improved over baseline visits. The baseline will be determined in DY3. Subsequent years will attempt to improve access to care by end of waiver. 1186 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Methodist Hospital Rationale: Process Milestones P-1 through P- 3 were chosen due to the lack of accurate reports and resources currently available to measure and monito r Telemedicine. In or der to report accurate data and establish baselines, P-1 and P-3 must be approached in DY2-DY3. In DY3 we will establish baseline to determine if access to care has improved using Telemedicine. The improvement measure will be determined by patient access before Telemedicine was implemented. Currently, patients receive a specialist consul t via telephone with the attending physician in another facility. We feel that we can significantly increase the quality of care by having a specialist see and communicate with the patient in or der to best assess their ability for local care or the need to start therapy and transport to a regional facility. This measures the increased volume of visits and is a method to assess the ability for the Performing Provider to increas e capacity to provide care. Outcome Measure Valuation: Methodist values each project based on the sp ecific needs of the community, the projected impact on the health outcomes of the communit y, the level of advancement to the healthcare delivery system, and the time, effort, and clinical resources necessary to implement each project. In valuing the project, Methodist took into acco unt the extent to which a telemedicine program would potentially meet the goals of the Wavier (improve out comes while containing costs, improve the healthcare infrastructure), the extent to which it will address the community needs, the population served, and resources and cost s necessary to implement the project. 1187 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Methodist Hospital 094154402.3.1 PASS 1 3.IT-6.1 IT6.1 Percent improvement ove r baseline of patient satisfaction scores Methodist Hospital TPI - 094154402 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 094154402.1.1 Starting Point/Baseline: To be implemented in DY3 Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 [P-1] Project Planning- engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timelines and document implementation plans Data Source: Assessments and program data Process Milestone 1:Estimated Incentive Payment: $284,324 Process Milestone 2 [P-2] Establish baseline.

Emergency room ba seline will be determined in DY 3 with 4% improvement by DY5. Rationale: Positive outcomes in healthcare are dependent no t only upon the clinical su ccess of treatment, but also upon a patient's perception of the overa ll experience, which improves compliance and understanding. This experience is comprised, in part, of comm unication with the caregivers regarding different aspects of the pr ocess, as well as the level of se rvice with respect to clean/quiet environment for healing and a responsive staff aime d at meeting needs in a timely manner. In order to better partner with our patients to round out this overall experience, focus upon patient satisfaction metrics and methods to achieve impr ovement thereof is necessary. We utilize the Gallup survey tools, as well as ot her internal, more real-time solutions in order to obtain feedback regarding all aspects of the patient experience. This process milestone was chosen to improve how the patient experiences the care and the patient's satisfaction with the care provided. The overall a pproach to redesigning the patient experience will be to improve patient experience scores over baseline. The intent of the HCAHPS initiative is to provide a standardized survey instrument and data collection methodology for measuring patients' perspectives on hospital care. The surveys are designed to produce comparable data on the patient's perspective on care that allows objective and meaningful comp arisons between institutions on domains that are important to consumers. Pub lic reporting of the survey results is designed to create incentives for institutions to improve th eir quality of care. Public reporting will serve to enhance public accountability in health care by increasi ng the transparency of the quality of institutional care provided in re turn for the public investment. Outcome Measure Valuation: We will measure our emergency room patients that receive service at this freestanding emergency room, according to the inclusion criteria that a national polling organization uses for emergency room services. This survey will include a sampling of patients that receive services at this center. The community benefits by us gaining more real- time feedback (available im mediately after patient contact made) in order to improve processes and procedures for the good of the care experience. The project seeks to provide increased emergency room visits in an area of community need by 2,053 visits in DY 3, 4,721 visits in DY 4, and 5,132 visits in DY5. 1190 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Methodist Hospital 094154402.3.2 PASS 1 3.IT-6.1 Patient Satisfaction METHODIST HOSPITAL TPI - 094154402 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 094154402.1.2 Starting Point/Baseline: To be determined in DY3.

This will be accomplished by improving 1-2% each year within the project time frame. We will measure our inpatient adult and pediatric patients discharged from Methodist Hospita l, according to the inclusion criteria the patient survey vendor uses nation-wide. This includes approximately 1,600 patient interviews per quarter across all service lines and all six campuses. The community benefits by us gaining more real- time feedback (available immediatel y after patient contact made) in order to improve processes and procedures for the good of the care experience. MHS Customer Engagement survey differs from the HCAHPS survey tool utilized by CMS in a variety of different manners: One, it is a much broader measurement tool. The CE1 includes measurements of patient experi ences Inpatient, Outpatient Surgery, Emergency and Test and Treatment areas of the healthcare environment. Two, it asks a much larger variety of questions regarding the experience, which ultimately culmin ate in the \"overall sati sfaction\" question. And three, the composite values are weighted according to the overall impact each area of the patient volume has on the overall facility flow. Rationale: Patient experience is directly correlated with quality of care and thus, the overall health of a community. For example, positive outcomes in h ealthcare are dependent no t only upon the clinical success of treatment, but also upon a patient's per ception of the overall expe rience, which improves compliance and understanding. This experience is comprised, in part, of communication with the caregivers regarding different aspects of the process, as well as the level of service with respect to clean/quiet environment for healing and a respons ive staff aimed at meeting needs in a timely manner. In order to better partner with our patie nts to round out this overall experience, focus upon patient satisfaction metrics and methods to achieve improvement thereof is necessary. We utilize the patient survey tools, as well as other intern al, more real-time soluti ons in order to obtain feedback regarding all aspects of the patient experience. Methodist chose a process milestone to develop a nd test data systems and establish a baseline because these two processes are logistically essen tial to the completion of the project. Additionally, Methodist chose the target percen tage for the selected ITs at 2% and 4%, because while customer engagement is very important, it is often difficult to predict. Theref ore, Methodist feels that even a small increase in customer engagement is beneficial and worthwhile to pursue. Public reporting will serve to enhance public accountability in health care by increasing the transparency of the quality of institutional care provided in return for the public investment. 1193 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Methodist Hospital Outcome Measure Valuation: In determining the value of this project, Meth odist analyzed the needs of the community, the number of patients reached by the pr oject, the value of the anticipated benefit to health outcomes in the community, the time, the effort, and clinical e xpertise involved in implementing the project, the clinical resources required to perf orm the project, and the anticipat ed value of the improvement of delivery of care to the community. 1194 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Methodist Hospital 094154402.3.3 PASS 1 3.IT-6.1 PATIENT SATISFACTION METHODIST HOSPITAL TPI - 094154402 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 094154402.2.1 Starting Point/Baseline: Baseline to be determined in DY3.

Goal is to improve mo rtality rates to at or below expected rates (observed/expected mortal ity ratio to 1.0 or lower) by the end of the waiver. The process milestones to achieve this will be development of an Early Sepsis Recognition form to be used in the ED and in-hospital for patients suspected of sepsis. This will be completed by nursing staff in the ED as well as floor nurses as part of the Rapid Response Team. We will also develop evidence-based order sets for Rapid Sepsis Resuscitation for initial therapy and Sepsis Maintenance Pr otocol order sets for on-going hospital care. Compliance with these data forms and order sets will help in early recognition, early aggr essive resuscitation and appropriate on-going care with evidenced-based protocols. This has been proven to reduce sepsis mortality. Rationale: Implement an innovative and evidence based intervention that will lead to reductions in Sepsis Complications (mortality, prevalence and incidence) for providers that have demonstrated need or unsatisfactory performa nce in this area. Rationale for selecting this sepsis project is the high mortality rate in this population and the known evidenced-based care bundles for decreasing mortality in this population. In CY 2010, MH served 2046 patients with a primary diagnosis of sepsis in DRG 870 and 871. In DRG 870 (Severe Sepsis with Mechanical Ventilation > 96 hours), there were 209 patients with a mortality rate of 32.2% and an expected rate of 30.47%. In DRG 871 (Severe Sepsis without Mechanical Ventilation) there were 1837 patie nts with a mortality rate of 16.05% and an expected rate of 18.37%. The observed/expected mortality rate for DRG 870 is 1.06 (6% above expected) and for DRG 871 observed/expected mortality is 0.87 (13% below expected). The goal for the 5 year project is a mortality rate at or below expected for a select group of sepsis patients identified at baseline DY3. The improvement requires significant planning, deve lopment of metrics, t ools and education of all stakeholders. This is exp ected to be a 5 year process. This addresses Category 2.8.11, Applying Process Improvement methodology to Improve Quality/Efficiency. This project is timely for our Hospital and has been identified as a key element in our Clinical Efficiency (CE) hospital plan. Outcome improvement targets w ill be determined in DY2 for implementation in DY3. Outcome Measure Valuation: In valuing this project, Methodist took into ac count the extent to which the Improvement in Sepsis would potentially meet th e goals of the Waiver (support th e development of a coordinated care delivery system, improve outcomes while containing costs, improve the healthcare infrastructure), the extent to which it will ad dress the community needs, the population served, and resources and cost necessary to implement the project. The Improvement in Sepsis Mortality will save lives of citize ns in the community .

It involves application of an early detection te st to a large number of apparently healthy people to identify those having unrecognized cancer. People with positive screen ing tests are subsequent ly investigated with diagnostic tests and those with confirmed disease are offered appropriate treatment and follow-up. The objective of screening is to reduce incidence of and/or death from cancer by detecting early preclinical disease when treatmen t may be easier and more effec tive than for advanced cancer diagnosed after symptoms occur. According to the American College of Ra diology, Even for women over 50, skipping a mammogram every other year would miss up to 30% of cancers. Through the Medical Home Model, by taking a more active role in the health and disease prevention of their patients, physicians and support staff should proactively remind patients of the importance of preventive screenings is a key role in improving outcomes. This outcome m easure is key to monitoring the success of those reminders. Process Milestones 1200 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Nix Health Care System P-1 was chosen since engaging stak eholders and identifying necessary resources is critical to the success of this outcome in subsequent years. P-2 was chosen since no baseline data currently exists. Baselines will be established in DY3 and improvement targets will be set for DY4-DY5. Improvement Targets Improvement targets will be established in DY3, al ong with the baseline rate, for implementation in DY4-DY5 Outcome Measure Valuation: In order to value the effect of annual screening mammograms, we utilized a cost-avoidance approach. Treatment costs for breast cancer are c onsiderably lower when a tumor is discovered at its early stages, which proves the economic value of screening mammograms. A recent California study showed that stage at diagnosis had an impo rtant impact on lifetime can cer-attributable costs, with costs increasing substantiall y for women diagnosed at later stages. Lifetime Medicare cancer- attributable costs increased fr om $21,320 for women diagnosed with in situ cancer, to $26,747 for localized cancer, $40,096 for regional cancer, and $52,288 for distant cancer1. For every 1,000 screening mammograms, 5 patients w ill be diagnosed with breast cancer, according to the American College of Radiology2. So for every 1,000 screening mammograms that are done, the cost savings of catching the cancer ear ly would be 5*($52,288 minus $21,320). Assuming a patient panel of around 1,900 for DY2 and 50% female , we can estimate that roughly 5 cancers may be caught through annual scre ening mammograms at a cost savings of $154,840 for DY2. In addition, the valuation criteria used for the co rresponding Category 2 projec t are also applicable to this metric. 1 California Breast Cancer Research Program; The Cost of Breast Cancer in California http://cbcrp.org/research/ PageGrant.asp?grant_id=2591 1201 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Nix Health Care System 112676501.3.1 PASS 1 3.IT-12.1 Breast Cancer Screening Nix Health TPI - 297342201 (OLD TPI 112676501) Related Category 1 Starting TBD Year 2 (10/1/2012 (10/1/2013 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 [P-1] Project planning - engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timeliness and document implementation plans.

The objective of screening is to reduce incidence of and/or death from cancer by detecting early preclinic al disease when treatment may be easier and more effective than for advanced cancer diagnosed after symptoms occur. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in Region 6 and routine preventive screenings can help improve the outcomes for pa tients that are diagnosed with colon cancer by catching the cancer early. Process Milestones P-1 was chosen since engaging stak eholders and identifying necessary resources is critical to the success of this outcome in subsequent years. P-2 was chosen since no baseline data currently exists. Baselines will be established in DY3 a nd improvement targets will be set for DY4-DY5. Improvement Targets 1203 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Nix Health Care System Improvement targets will be established in DY3, along with the baseline rate, for implementation in DY4-DY5 Outcome Measure Valuation: In order to value the effect of routine screenings, we utili zed a cost-avoidance approach. Treatment costs for colon cancer are considerably lower when a cancer is discovered at its early stages, which proves the economic value of screen ing exams. A recent study by the American Society of Clinical Oncology showed that stage at diagnosis had an important impact on lifetime cancer-attributable costs, with co sts increasing substantially for t hose diagnosed at later stages. Lifetime cancer-attributable costs increased from $20,731 for those diagnosed with Stage I Colon cancer, to $24,038 for Stage II, $30,260 for Stage III, and $35,663 for Stage IV1. The age-adjusted incidence rate is 0.05% of men and women per year2. So if the Medical Home has a panel of 1900 patients in DY2, it could be expected that 10 people may be diagnosed per year. Through preventive screen ings, catching the colon or rectal cancer earlier would result in better outcomes and less costly treatments. So for every 1,000 colorectal screenings done, the cost savings of catching the cancer earl y would be 5*($35,663 minus $20,731). Assuming a patient panel of around 1,900 for DY2, we can estimate that roughly 5 cancers may be caught through annual screening at a cost savings of $74,660 for DY2 and increasing thereafter.

DY3 P-2: Establish baseline rates Outcome Improvement Targets for Each Year DY4 for Category 2.1 project patient population (% improvement TBD) DY5 IT-12.4: Improve Pneumonia Vaccination Status Rate for Category 2.1 project patient population (% improvement TBD) Rationale: The pneumonia vaccine prevents ag ainst 88% of the pneumococcal bacteria that cause pneumonia. People age 65 and older are at a high risk for ba cterial pneumonia - two to three times more likely than the general population. Patients with chroni c diseases, such as heart and lung disease or diabetes, are also at an increased risk. Of the patients over 65 that have pneumococcal pneumonia and develop bacteremia as a complication, and at leas t 20 % die from it, despite antibiotic treatment. Through vaccination, the risks can be lowered and outcomes improved. Process Milestones P-1 was chosen since engaging stak eholders and identifying necessary resources is critical to the success of this outcome in subsequent years. P-2 was chosen since no baseline data currently exists. Baselines will be established in DY3 and improvement targets will be set for DY4-DY5. Improvement Targets Improvement targets will be established in DY3, al ong with the baseline rate, for implementation in DY4-DY5 1206 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Nix Health Care System Outcome Measure Valuation: In order to value the effect of pneumonia vaccinations, we utili zed a cost-avoidance approach. The American Lung Association reported that the estimation of bacterial pneumonia occurrence in patients age 65 and older is 95 per 10,000 patients1. Based on the current Medicare rates, hospitalization for treatment of simple pneumon ia without complications is $5,336 but treatment for cases with major complications is $11,334. If th e patient develops bacteremia or septicemia, the cost of hospita lization can up over $14,000. So in DY2 with approximately 1900 patients enrolle d in the Medical Home, all of whom will be in the target age for a pneumonia vaccine, I could be estimated that 18 of them would suffer from bacterial pneumonia during the year. With vacci nation, that number coul d easily be cut by 75%. With an assumed average cost per hosp italization of $11,000, a nd a reduction of 13.5 admissions, the value can be calcu lated conservatively at $148,500 In addition, the valuation crit eria used for the correspondi ng Category 2 project are also applicable to this metric. 1 American Lung Association; Pneumonia Fact Sheet http://www.lung.org/lung-disease/influenza/in -depth-resources/pneumonia-fact-sheet.html 1207 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Nix Health Care System 112676501.3.3 PASS 1 3.IT-12.4 Pneumonia Vaccination Status for Older Adults Nix Health TPI - 297342201 (OLD TPI 112676501) Related Category 1 Starting TBD Year 2 (10/1/2012 (10/1/2013 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 [P-1] Project planning - engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timeliness and document implementation plans.

Through our ACE Program, we will be implementing several process improvement initiatives aimed at improvi ng the quality of care received by our elderly patients. Many of the steps that we will take during their hospitalization will also affect their readmission rate and we estimate that we will be able to greatly influence the all-cause readmission rate of the ACE Program patients. Outcome improvement targets will be determined in DY2 for implementation in DY3. Process Milestones P-1 was chosen since engaging stak eholders and identifying necessary resources is critical to the success of this outcome in subsequent years. P-2 was chosen since no baseline data currently exists. Baselines will be established in DY2 a nd improvement targets will be set for DY3-DY5. Improvement Targets Improvement targets will be established in DY2, along with the baseline rate, for implementation in DY3-DY5 1209 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Nix Health Care System Outcome Measure Valuation: As stated by the NQF, \"Multiple factors affect readmission rates and other measures including: the complexity of the medical condition and asso ciated therapies; effe ctiveness of inpatient treatment and care transitions ; patient understanding of and a dherence to treatment plans; patient health literacy and language barriers; an d the availability and qu ality of post-acute and community-based services, particu larly for patients with low income. Readmission measurement should reinforce national efforts to focus all stakeholders' attention and collaboration on this important issue.\" Our process improvement initiatives through the ACE program will address each of these issues and one of the primary measurable ou tcomes will be a reduction in preventable readmissions. Research has shown th at an avoidable hospital readmission can mean prolonged illness, emotional dist ress, and loss of productivity for the patient. The factors mentioned above can be especially impactful on t hose of low income. According to the NQF, the national Medicare beneficiary all-cause readmi ssion rate is around 20%, which costs about $15 billion annually. In order to value the reduction in preventabl e readmissions, we utilized a cost-avoidance approach. In a recent 'Solicitation for App lications' by CMS for Community-based Care Transitions Programs, CMS recommended usi ng $9,600 as the average cost of a hospital readmission1. While we will be establishing our baseline and targets in DY2, we expect that our ACE Program initiatives will reduce the readmission rate for the patients enrolled in the ACE program (assuming 533 in DY2 and increasing to 733 by DY5).

The Patient Navigators will help facilitate connections between patients and primary care physicians, as well as work with patients to identify outpatient and community resources available to them to help th em manage their conditions on a proactive basis. These actions should lessen the o ccurrence of these patients presen ting to the ED for treatment of their underlying conditions. Outcome improvement targets will be determined in DY3 for implementation in DY4. Process Milestones P-1 was chosen since engaging stak eholders and identifying necessary resources is critical to the success of this outcome in subsequent years. P-2 was chosen since no baseline data currently exists. Baselines will be established in DY3 and improvement targets will be set for DY4 and DY5. Improvement Targets Improvement targets will be established in DY3, al ong with the baseline rate, for implementation in DY4 and DY5 1212 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Nix Health Care System Outcome Measure Valuation: In 2005, Texas Health and Human Services Commi ssion identified that 47 .2% of the Medicaid emergency room visits were classified as non-emer gent episodes. Often, patients seek care in an Emergency Department rather than in a Primary Ca re Physician's office due to extended hours of operation, not being required to pay copays or deductibles before bei ng treated or because they have not established a relationship with a PCP. HHSC determined that the state could have saved over $26M if patients had sought treatment for th eir non-emergent conditions through PCP offices instead1. While the focus of this review was on c onditions such as common cold, sore throat, vomiting, headache, etc., it still speak s to the point that developing a relationship with a PCP to treat non-urgent conditions can provide cost-sav ings opportunities across all patients. Through the Patient Navigator Program, patients that are at high risk for di sconnect from the system will be identified and enrolled in the program where they will be encouraged to utilize a primary care physician for their 'medical home' (even if the PCP is not formally a medical home accredited practice). These patients, who will likely have multiple medical conditions, will be connected with resources to assist them in managi ng any chronic or underlying conditions. In order to value the program, we utilized a co st-avoidance approach and assumed each ED visit avoided would save of $1,3182. Also, through more proactive ma nagement of their diseases, the patients' general health will be improved. In addition, the valuation criteria used for the corresponding Category 2 project are al so applicable to this metric. 1 Texas Health and Human Services Request fo r Information: Reducing Unnecessary Emergency Room Utilization 5/15/2008 http://www.hhsc.state.tx .us/Contract/529080216/RFI_529080216.pdf 2Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Me 2013 Nix Health Care System 112676501.3.5 PASS 2 3.IT-9.2 ED appropriate utilization (S tandalone measure) for Diabetes Nix Health TPI - 297342201 (OLD TPI 112676501) Related Category 1 Starting TBD Year 2 (10/1/2012 (10/1/2013 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 [P-1] Project planning - engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timeliness and document implementation plans.

OD-9 Right Care, Right Setting and IT 9.2 was chosen as the proj ects outcome domain based on 19% of overall diabetic population visits were in the Emergency Department setting. Improved transition of care for the diabet ic population can help reduce emergency department (ED) visits. High ED utilization is a considerable concern for the increasing cost of health care. Frequent and inappr opriate use of hospital EDs is extremely costly and care could be provided in less expensive settings. Patients resort to ED use for a variety of reasons: lack of regular or preventative care a nd inability to book timely follo w-up appointments. Appropriate care transitions and patient education will pr ovide diabetic patients with the tools and understanding to seek care with their primary care physician, clinic or specialist for non- emergency conditions. Patients who better unders tand their diabetes and the importance of continuity of their care will recognize the benefit of consistent, quality care.

Therefore, in order to be successful and achieve desired outcomes it was decided that P-1 and P-4 would be the most appropriate to execute. Outcome Improvement Targets: IT-9.2 Reduce Emergency Department vis its for target condition-Diabetes ( standalone measure ) will be executed in DY4 and DY5. 19% of overall diabetic population visits were in the Emergency Department setting. Proper implem entation of Category 2 process improvements 1216 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Peterson Regional Medical Center within the diabetic population group will improve transition of care resulting in an expected decrease in emergency department visits for our diabetic population (regardless of primary reason for visit) by 5% in DY4 and an additional 5% in DY5. Outcome Measure Valuation: The implementation cost of this project, to include Categories 2 - 4, for DY1-DY2 is estimated to be $434,292 total. Each year th ereafter has an estimated cost of $267,272 to continue project operations. In calendar year 2012 PRMC's ba seline diabetic population group had a total of 3,719 patients with 1,863 emergency department visits for a total of $3.73 million in charges. Once project outcomes have been re ached, we estimate an average annual community healthcare savings of $373 thousa nd by reducing the ED total numb er of visits by 10% within our defined target group. This community savings comes from the amount of healthcare dollars that will be saved once the target ed population starts becoming more in control of their disease process and their self-management. Emergency Room resources will not be utilized as often and we anticipate seeing an increase in the use of outpa tient services such as primary care visits and diabetic education resources provided within PR MC or the community. This project will address many of the discovered community health care needs by strategically implementing components of an evidence-based care transition model. With this process in place, we anticipate seeing an increase in diabetic patient self-managed care with improved care transitions reducing emergent and acute care needs This model will be used to assist in closing the gap in health care services of Kerr County residents causing them to utilize more costly inpatient services versus less costly outpatient services. The shortage of primary care in Kerr County has contributed to an increase us of inpatient services. Patients with chronic dis eases who are not established with primary care provider are more likely to show up in the emergenc y department in crisis, which often results in an inpatient admission. The components of Project Red will prepare patients to better understand their disease process and address indi vidual needs enabling them to better care for themselves. After a patient has been admitted to the hospital they are usually motivated to learn more about their illness; it is cruc ial that healthcare providers take advantage of this opportunity to educate and coordinate care during and beyond th e hospital setting. This will allow patients to feel more involved and increasing potential comp liance with their own healthcare needs. By utilizing a more patient-centered discharge model patients will experience more buy in to improve and maintain their own health at home. 1217 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Peterson Regional Medical Center 127294003.3.1 PASS 1 3.IT-9.2 Reduce Emergency Department visits for target condition Diabetes Peterson Regional Medical Center TPI - 127294003 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 127294003.2.1 Starting Point/Baseline: TBD Year 2 (10/1/2012 (10/1/2013 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 [P-1]: Project planning Data Source : NIH, AHRQ, HCPro, Texas Hospital Quality, IOM, IHI, PCORI PM-1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $182,988 Process Milestone 2 [P-4]: Conduct Plan Do Study Act (PDSA) cycles to improve data collection and intervention activities Data Source : Documentation of data management system and functionality PM-2 Estimated Incentive Payment: $212,107 Outcome Improvement Target 1 [IT-9.2]: Reduce Emergency Department visits for target condition Diabetes Goal : Reduce ED visits of the diabetic population group by 5%.

Identifying, testing, and analyzing available da ta sources are critical in DY 2-DY-3. With the implementation of a sound database system, DY3 can then esta blish baseline low birt h weight in the study population. Improvement processes were chosen based on the timeframe allowed to put in place proper resources and processes needed to collect data. In addition the outcome measure being addressed is affected by multiple factors. Prenatal visit are critical to ongoing education and maintenance of this patient population. Through early identifi cation and intervention sc reening, non diabetic mothers can be educated on the importance of pr enatal care and working to achieve adequate health and maturation of the fetus. It is anticipated that the incidence of low birth weight babies will decrease in the study population. DY 3 would serve as baseline for pati ents screened by the Gestational Diabetes 1222 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Southwest General Hospital Team. DY 4 and DY 5 would demons trate a low incidence of low bi rth weight babies as a result of the screening program and proper referral for di abetes care and/or appr opriate prenatal care. The goal for the rate of decrease for low birth wei ght deliveries is conserva tively set at 2% in the first year from baseline (DY4) and show gradual improvement in DY% to 3%. Outcome Measure Valuation: Addresses Community Needs: As previously outlined the community and the RHP as a whole are critically challenged provide timely prenatal care and reduce the incidence of gestational diabetes. Of the 36,000 live births in RHP 6 in 2008, only 59% of mothers received prenat al care within the first trimester, leading to the assumption, access to medical care remain s difficult regardless of clinic resources7. The potential for gestational diab etes going unidentified is extr emely high in the region. The screening, identificati on, education and provision of prenatal care are critic al to impact the above outcome measures. Project Scope: Southwest General Hospital has a known reputation on the Southsid e of San Antonio related to obstetrical care. In late 2011, th e organization launched a maternal fetal medicine program which has enhanced the ability to reach outlying re gions and establish a pr ogram to identify and manage gestational diabetes in a manner whic h demonstrates practices based on evidence and supported by clinical outcomes. The expansion of the program to outlying communities will further enhance care but also ex tend high quality preventive care and education for the region. The program framework is developed and requir es the expansion and planning to serve and identify a larger patient base and establish out reach programs to impact care for the patient population. Project Investment: Many of the resources required to support the physician component of the proposed project is in place. The major investment centers on midlev el care provider recruitment and salaries. Additionally, support staff, space, additional equipm ent needs, travel, marketing, and educational materials will require hospital dollars to suppor t program implementation and sustainability. 7RHP 6 Community Needs Assessment, September 2012. 1223 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Southwest General Hospital 136491104.3.1 PASS 1 3.IT3.IT-8.2 Percentage of Lo w Birth Weight Births Southwest General Hospital TPI - 136491104 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 136491104.1.1 Starting Point/Baseline: To be determined in DY3 Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 [P-1]: Project planning - engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timelines and document implementation plans Date Source: Information Technology reports database; Planning Team minutes and implementation plans Goal: Identify existing and needed systems to gather low birth weight data Process Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment $27,763 Process Milestone 2 [P-3]: Develop and test data systems Data HBI report system from McKesson Goal: Acquire needed systems to collect and analyze data for Process Milestone 3 [P-3]: Develop and test data systems Data Source: HBI report system from McKesson Goal: Establish low birth weight baseline data Process Milestone 3 Estimated Incentive Payment $32,024.50 Process Milestone 4 [P-2]: Establish baseline rate Data Source: HBI report system from McKesson Process Milestone 3 Estimated Incentive Payment $32,024.50 Outcome Improvement Target 1 [IT-8.2]: Percentage of Low Birth-Weight Births Improvement Target: Decrease the percentage of babies born weighing <2,500 grams at birth by 2% below baseline Date Source: HBI report system from McKesson Outcome Improvement Target 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $102,777 Outcome Improvement Target 2 [IT-8.2]: Percentage of Low Birth-Weight Births Improvement Target: Decrease the percentage of babies born weighing <2,500 grams at birth by 3% below baseline Date Source: HBI report system from McKesson Outcome Improvement Target 2 Estimated Incentive Payment: $245,770 1224 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Southwest General Hospital low birth weight Process Milestone 2 Estimated Incentive Payment $27,763 Year 2 Estimated Outcome Amount: $55,256 Year 3 Estimated Outcome Amount: $64,049 Year 4 Estimated Outcome Amount: $102,777 Year 5 Estimated Outcome Amount: $245,770 PAYMENTS FOR 4-YEAR PERIOD: $467,852 1225 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Southwest General Hospital Identifying Outcome Measure and Provider Information: Title of Outcome Measure (Improvement Target): IT 9.2 - ED appropriate utilization: Reduce ED visits for target conditions: Card iovascular Disease/Hypertension Unique RHP Outcome hwest TPI: 136491104 Outcome Measure Description: Outcome Measure Description: IT 9.2 - ED appropriate utilization: Reduce ED visits for target conditions: Cardiovascular Disease/Hypertension Process Milestones: DY2: o P-1 - Project Planning - enga ge stakeholders, identify cu rrent capacity and needed resources, determine timelines, and document implementation plans o P-3 - Develop and test data systems DY3: o P-2 - Establish baseline rates o P-3 - Develop and test data systems Outcome Improvement Target for each year: DY4 : o Decrease the percentage of patients u tilizing the Southwest General Hospital Emergency Department for Cardiova scular Disease/Hypertension by 3.5% from DY 3 baseline DY5: o Decrease the percentage of patients u tilizing the Southwest General Hospital Emergency Department for Cardiovascul ar Disease/Hypertension by 7% from DY 4 baseline Rationale: Process Milestones : P1 - P3 were chosen due to the lack of available systems to track and monitor percentages of ED utilization for specific disease entities within the Iasis Healthcare Corporation.

Improvement processes were chosen based on the timeframe allowed to put in place proper resources and processes needed to collect data. In addition the out come measure being addressed is affected by multiple factors. Through early identifi cation and intervention of screened residents for cardiovascular disease, interventi on, further testing, and treatment can be implemented to impact disease progression and symptom management. A community impact on ED utilization from communities of the RHP 6 region part icipating in screening clinics wi ll be evaluated for utilization. It is predicted that the utiliz ation of the ED will decrease in the study population. DY 3 would serve 1226 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Southwest General Hospital as baseline for patients screen ed by the Mobile Cardiovascular Screening Program. DY 4 and DY 5 would demonstrate a decrease in ED utilization as a result of the screening program and proper referral for symptom and/or disease management. The goal for the rate of decrease for ED utilization is conservatively set at 3.5% in the first year fr om baseline (DY3) and show gradual improvement in DY5 to 5% from year DY4. Outcome Measure Valuation: Achieve Waiver Goals: Waiver goals include increasing the capacity to provi de specialty care servi ces and the availability of targeted specialty providers to better accommodate the high demand for specialty care services so that patients have increased access to specialty services. In support of the goal, Southwest General Hospita l will develop a mobile specialty care unit dedicated to vascular screening. Through this se rvice the surrounding rural communities will have the opportunity to access a vital health resource to identify potentially serious cardiovascular events in a timely and cost effective manner. The program will provide a mobile vascular screening service which will provide non-invasive screenings. Test s will be performed by vascular technologists. Results and follow-up plan, as necessary, pr ovided at the time of screening. Addresses Community Needs: As previously stated, early identification a nd management of potential life threatening cardiovascular conditions (Stroke; Carotid Artery Disease: Peripheral Vasc ular Insufficiency, as well as access for services and treat ment otherwise not available is cr itical to meeting the healthcare needs of RHP 6. The shortage of health care provi ders has led to high emergency room utilization. This is a very costly means of health care deliv ery, and often results in a delay seeking treatment until the illness is severe and advanced 9. In addition, access to primary care has become increasingly difficult within the region, resulting in poor overa ll management of the popul ation's health. Through the development of a mobile sp ecialty care unit by Southwest Ge neral Hospital, dedicated to vascular screening, the surrounding rural communities will have th e opportunity to access a vital health resource to identify potentially serious cardi ovascular events in a timely and cost effective manner. Project Scope: Southwest General Hospital has provided care to the residents of South San Antonio since 1978. In late 2012, the organization achieved Chest Pain Accreditation and cu rrently is preparing for PCI Accreditation with the Center. The expansion of the program to outlying communities will further enhance care but also extend high quality preventive care and edu cation for the region. The program framework for cardiovascular services is develo ped and supports acute care needs for the area. Program development requires the expansion and pla nning to serve and identify a larger patient base and establish outreach programs to impact care fo r the patient population. Through the development of a mobile specialty care unit by Southwest General Hospital, dedi cated to vascular screening, the surrounding rural communities will have the opportunity to access a vital health resource to identify potentially serious cardiovascular events in a timely and cost effective manner. 1227 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Southwest General Hospital Project Investment: Many of the resources required to support the physician component of the proposed project is in place. The need to recruit and hire midlevel car e providers is a key investment in manpower to support the endeavor. The purchase of additional noninvasive diagnostic equipment and a van to support the program will be a $190,000 investment by Southwest General Hospital to launch the program for its current patient popula tion and the RHP 6 proposed project. 1228 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Southwest General Hospital 136491104.3.2 PASS 1 3.IT-9.2 ED Appropriate Utilization: Reduc e ED visits for target conditions: Cardiovascular Disease/Hypertension Southwest General Hospital TPI - 136491104 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 136491104.2.1 Starting Point/Baseline: To be determined in DY3 Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 [P-1]: Project planning - engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timelines and document implementation plans Date Source: Information Technology reports database; Planning Team minutes and implementation plans/ Coral ED System Goal: Identify existing and needed systems to gather ED utilization data for target patient populations Baseline: Lack of needed resources to evaluate impact of ED utilization for project Process Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment $27,763 Process Milestone 2 [P-3]: Develop and test data systems to measure ED utilization for target population Process Milestone 3 [P-3]: Develop and test data systems Data Source: HBI report system from McKesson/Coral ED System Goal: Collaborate with Information Technology to develop and test systems for data collection for ED utilization Baseline: Lack of developed and tested systems to collect baseline data and ongoing study data needs Process Milestone 3 Estimated Incentive Payment $32,024 Process Milestone 4 [P-2]: Establish baseline rate Outcome Improvement Target 1 [IT-9.2]: Appropriated ED utilization: Reduce ED visits for target conditions: Cardiovascular Disease/ Hypertension Improvement Target: Reduce ED visits for target conditions: Cardiovascular Disease/ Hypertension by 3.5% from DY 3 baseline Date Source: HBI report system from McKesson/Coral ED System Goal: Decrease ED utilization rate of targeted population by 3.5% from DY 3 baseline Baseline: ED DY 3 ED utilization rates Outcome Improvement Target 2 [IT-9.2]: ED utilization Reduce ED visits for target conditions: Cardiovascular Disease/Hypertension Improvement Target: Reduce ED visits for target conditions: Cardiovascular Disease/ Hypertension by 7% from DY 4 baseline Date Source: HBI report system from McKesson/Coral ED System Goal: Decrease ED utilization rate of targeted population by 5% from DY 4 Baseline: ED DY 3 ED utilization rates 1229 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Southwest General Hospital Data HBI report system from McKesson/Coral ED System Goal: Acquire and test needed systems to collect and analyze data for ED utilization assessment of targeted population Baseline: Lack of appropriate equipment and systems to collect and analyze data for ED utilization Process Milestone 2 Estimated Incentive Payment $27,763 Data Source: HBI report system from McKesson/Coral ED System Goal: Establish ED utilization baseline rates for target population Baseline: ED utilization rates for target population DY 3 Process Milestone 4 Estimated Incentive Payment $32,025 Year 2 Estimated Outcome Amount: $55,256 Year 3 Estimated Outcome Amount: $64,049 Year 4 Estimated Outcome Amount: $102,777 Year 5 Estimated Outcome Amount: $245,770 PAYMENTS FOR 4-YEAR PERIOD: $467,851 1230 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Texas Center for Infectious Disease Identifying Outcome Measure and Provider Information: Title of Outcome Measure (Improvement Target): IT-11.1 Improvement in Clinical Indicator in identified disparity group: Improve ment in LTBI treatment completion Unique RHP outcome identifica tion number(s): 133257904.3.1 - PASS 1 Performing Provider Name: Texas Center for Infectious Disease TPI: 133257904 Outcome Measure Description: Outcome Measure Description: IT- 11.1 Improvement in Clinical Indi cator in identified disparity group Process Milestones: DY2: o P-1 - Project planning - engage stakeholde rs, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timelines and document implementation plans DY3: o P-2 - Establish baseline rate s for rate 1 and rate 2 Outcome Improvement Targets for each year: DY4: o IT-11.1: Improvement in clinical indicator in identified disparity group.

Medicaid enrolled women who had live births during the past year will be tracked to determine the percentage of reco mmended prenatal visits they had. Complications can arise at any time during pregnancy. For that reason, continued monitoring throughout pregnancy is necessary.

For that reason, continued monitoring thr oughout pregnancy is necessary. Frequency and adequacy of ongoing prenatal visits are importa nt factors in minimizing pregnancy problems. The American College of Obstetricians and Gyneco logists recommends that prenatal care begin as early as possible in the first trimester of pregnancy. Visits s hould follow a schedule.

Studies find that babies born to mothers who received no prenatal care are three times more likely to be born at lo w birth weight, and five times more likely to die, than those whose mothers received prenatal care (Health Resources and Services Administration, 2012). Early initiati on of prenatal care (PNC) dur ing pregnancy has been shown to significantly reduce the potenti ally deleterious eff ects of both normal and high-risk pregnancy outcomes including: 1) premature birth, 2) low bi rth weight, 3) maternal hypertension and 4) gestational diabetes (Alexa nder and Korenbrot, Atrash et al., 2006). In addition, the risk of maternal and infant mort ality and pregnancy-related complications can be reduced by increasing access to quality preconc eption (before pregnancy) and interconception (between pregnancies) care (Healthy People 2020).E vidence further suggests that facilitation of healthy decision-making by individuals can be e nhanced through timely access to interventions that encourage group support, adherence to prev entive care, and positive interactive dialogue. Within the areas of maternal health and c linical preventive serv ices, the 2011 National Prevention Strategy recommends h ealth service interventions that support a healthy pregnancy through timely and ongoing access/early entry into cl inical preventive care alongside systems of support that address the individua l's social and emotional well-be ing (Department of Health and Human Services, 2011). Combined, these practices can encourage and empower individuals to make healthy decision-making that can lead to improved health outcomes for both the mother and child. Determining a process for gathering the data a nd developing baseline wi ll be conducted in DY2 and DY3. After the baseline is established, goals will be set for outcomes measured in DY 4 and DY5. We expect to decrease the rate of women who receive late or no prenatal care by TBD% in DY 4 and DY5. Outcome Measure Valuation: Increasing the proportion of wo men who receive ongoing prenatal care is central to responding to the needs of an underserved, largely Hisp anic population. Many women in our target population struggle with poverty, re ceive only acute or emergency healthcare services only, and do not have an established relationship with a pr ovider. Increased access to primary care allows women much needed prenatal car e and education aimed at improvi ng maternal and child health in Bexar County, Texas. 1242 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital 136141205.3.2 PASS 1 3.IT-8.5 Frequency of ongoing prenatal care (AHRQ266 /CHIRPA267)(Non stand alone measure) University Hospital TPI - 136141205 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 136141205.1.1 Starting Point/Baseline: To be developed in DY3 Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 P 1 Project planning engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timelines and document implementation plans Data Source: Meeting minutes Process Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $175,681 Process Milestone 2 P 2 Establish baseline rates for frequency of ongoing prenatal care.

Evidence further suggests that facilitation of healthy decision-making by individuals can be enhanced through timely access to interventions that encourage group support, adherence to preventive care, and positive interactive dialogu e. Within the areas of maternal health and clinical preventive serv ices, the 2011 National Prevention Stra tegy recommends health service interventions that support a healthy pregna ncy through timely and ongoing access/early entry into clinical preventive care alongside systems of support that address the individual's social and 1244 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital emotional well-being (Departm ent of Health and Human Se rvices, 2011). Combined, these practices can encourage and empowe r individuals to make healthy decision-making that can lead to improved health outcomes for both the mother and child. Determining a process for gathering the data a nd developing baseline wi ll be conducted in DY2 and DY3. After the baseline is established, goals will be set for outcomes measured in DY 4 and DY5. We expect to decrease the rate of women who receive late or no prenatal care by TBD% in DY 4 and DY5. Outcome Measure Valuation: Decreasing low birth weight is central to re sponding to the needs of an underserved, largely Hispanic population. Many women in our target population struggle with poverty, receive only acute or emergency healthcare services only, and do not have an established relationship with a provider. Increased access to primary care allo ws women much needed prenatal care and education aimed at improving maternal a nd child health in Bexar County, Texas. 1245 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital 136141205.3.3 PASS 1 3.IT-8.2 IT8.2: Percentage of Lo w-Birth Weight births (CHIPRA/NQF#1382) University Hospital TPI - 136141205 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 136141205.1.1 Starting Point/Baseline: To be developed in DY3 Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 P 1 Project planning engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timelines and document implementation plans Data Source: Meeting minutes Process Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $175,681 Process Milestone 2 P 2 Establish baseline rates for percentage of low birth weight births.

DY5: Reduce ED visits for targeted conditions by a TBD percentage from baseline Y3. Rationale: High emergency room (ER) utilization is a consider able concern for the increasing cost of health care. Frequent and inappropria te use of hospital ERs is extremely costly and care could be provided in a less expensive setti ng. Patients, when possible, s hould be treated by their primary care provider for non-emergency conditions in orde r to promote consistent, quality care. The targeted population will be the CareLink members assigned to University Health System patient centered medical homes. CareLink is a financial assistance program for uni nsured residents of Bexar County. The program was created in 1997 to help address the ne eds of Bexar County residents without health care cove rage who were not eligible fo r Medicaid or other public or private funding. While CareLink is not an in surance product per se , it has many similar advantages in terms of promoting access to preven tive health services, encouraging a long lasting relationship with a primary care pr ovider, and instilling a sense of shared responsibility between 1247 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital member and staff for the member's healt h. As of December 31, 2011, there were 54,256 members enrolled in CareLink. Process Milestones P1 and P2 were chosen to al low time for necessary project planning and data collection activities to understand our patients who will benefit the most from expanded primary care into their neighborhoods. It will also allow us to set up the necessary processes to effectively reach out and work with chronic disease patient as we expand our primary care capacity. The improvement targets of reducing avoidabl e ED visits for speci fic medical conditions selected because of the evidence base associated with access to primary care and the reduction of unnecessary ED visits. Having a re gular source of primary care in creases the probability that patients with chronic medical conditions will ha ve less exacerbations, be tter control of their disease, and therefore fewer ED visits cause d by uncontrolled symptoms . Since this is an expansion of primary care in an existing patient population we know which pa tients to target for more outreach, and care management to reach our goals. Outcome Measure Valuation: This outcome will be valued based on the number of emergency visits avoided by patients with COPD, behavioral health diagnoses, diabetes exacerbations, and asthma. The rational is expanded primary care and acute care through Univ ersity Health System's ExpressMed clinics will support patients in control ling these chronic conditions and reduce avoidable emergency center visits. It will also s upport the achievement of Waiver goa ls: a) improving the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of the county; b) further developing and maintaining a c oordinated care delivery system; c) contributing to patients' receiving high-quality, patient-cen tered care in the most cost-effective way; and serving as a powerful tool to help providers improve outcome s and reduce ED utilization (containing cost growth). 1248 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital 136141205.3.4 PASS 1 3.IT-9.2 ED appropriate utilization University Hospital TPI - 136141205 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 136141205.1.2 Starting Point/Baseline: To be developed in DY3 Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 P 1 Project planning engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timelines and document implementation plans Baseline: 0 Data Source: Meeting minutes Process Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $554,784 Process Milestone 2 P 2 Establish baseline rates for reduction in ED visits for targeted conditions Metric 1: Number of annual ER visits for CareLink patients with COPD, behavioral health, diabetes and asthma.

Process Milestones 1250 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Process Milestone 1, Project pl anning - engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timelines and docum ent implementation plan s, ensures that the appropriate resources and pers onnel are available to provide data synthesis and reporting. The Health System is in the early stages of its Population Health Infras tructure Initiative (PHII) and creating the registry for asthma under the Wa iver will be a new activity. Process milestone 2, Develop and test data systems, was chosen as a cr itical step in the registry development process, allowing for rapid cycle improvements wher e appropriate prior to implementation. Improvement Targets This outcome improvement measure was chosen for its direct relation to the goals of the Waiver by a) improve the health care infr astructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of the county; b) further devel op and maintain a coordinated care delivery system; c) contribute to patients' receiving high-quality, patient-centere d care in the most cost-effective way; and d) serve as a powerful tool to help provid ers improve outcomes and reduce ED utilization (containing cost growth). Outcome Measure Valuation: Success of the registry program in the form of reduced ED utilization for asthma/COPD patients will be an indicator for achievement of Waiver goa ls: a) improving the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured resi dents of the county; b) further developing and maintaining a coordinated care delivery system; c) contributing to patients' receiving high- quality, patient-centered care in th e most cost-effective way; and serving as a powerful tool to help providers improve outcomes and reduce ED utilization (containing cost growth). When fully implemented - beyond DY5 - which includes registries for other highly prevalent chronic conditions, such as diabetes and CHF, as we ll as eventually shari ng the technology among the region's Performing Providers, the la rger scope of the project shoul d impact proper utilization in the form of increased routine and follow-up pa tient visits and encounters and reduced ED utilization. This project requires investment as it is an enhancement to current HIE funding goals. The hardware, software applications, human resour ces, and time to implement are of the highest organizational priority for the Health System. Th is particular project ta rgets asthma/COPD, but the scope of utilization for other chronic diseases and in other heal th care settings is potentially huge. 1251 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital 136141205.3.5 PASS 1 3-IT-9.2 ED Appropriate Utilization (Standalone Measure) University Hospital TPI-136141205 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 136141205.1.3 Starting Point/Baseline: To be developed in DY 3 Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 [P-1]: Project planning - engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timelines and document implementation plans Data Source: Team meeting minutes, data elements identified in evaluation/assessment and project planning documentation.

The outcome improvement targets are yet to be determined (TBD) for DYs 4 and 5. Rationale: Process Milestone 1: Project pla nning - engage stakeholders, identi fy current capacity and needed resources, determine timelines and document im plementation plans. As noted above, the Health System currently employs telemedicine on a pi lot basis for the Bexar County Adult Detention Center inmates. Expanding the technology to patient cl inic sites, as well as to regional partners in the future, however, requires a completely new planning process. Process Milestone 2: Conduct Plan Do Study Act (P DSA) cycles to improve data collection and 1253 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital intervention activities. As mentioned, Process Mi lestone 2 affords the opportunity to engage in quality improvements, share lessons learned, and e ffect rapid cycle improvements as appropriate.

DY3- Process Milestone P-3: De velop and test data systems . Assess all processes and procedures related to securing outpatient appo intments with mental health practitioners following discharge from inpatient settings for the project populat ion. Include all stakeholders, (inpatient and outpatient), and in clude evaluation of barriers f aced. Refine the diagnostic codes as necessary to determine behavioral health diagnoses in the discharged population. Develop a written protocol for the defined population to include EMR documentation related to discharge planning and process for securing outp atient follow-up appointments.

Outcome Improvement Milestones for each year: DY4 - Increase IT1.18 Follow Up After Hospitalization for Mental Illness by TBD over baseline year those securing outpatient mental health practitioner appointments within 7 days and 30 days after discharge for the project targeted population. DY5 - Increase IT1.18 Follow Up After Hospitalization for Mental Illness by TBD over baseline year those securing outpatient mental health practitioner appointments within 7 days and 30 days after discharge for the project targeted population. Rationale: The rationale for selecting the process milestone s reflect the methodical a pproach that will be undertaken to engage stakeholder, identify needed resources, develop an imp lementation and project monitoring plan to ensure an appropriate alignment with improving and reporting on patient satisfaction. In DY 2 and DY 3 process milestones will be addressed as follows: Outpatient follow-up with specialty behavioral hea lth practitioners after discharged from the hospital allows for maintenance of stability of mental illness, continued assessment of need for support services, encouragement of complia nce with treatment, and engagement in a system of care outside the hospital setting. The time period shortly after release form the hospi tal tends to be a high risk time for decompensation if timely follow-up is not provide d. Cost avoidance relate s to potentially avoided 1257 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital readmission and ER visits. Having outpatient ps ychiatric care within the medical home/neighborhood clinics supports engagement of the patient in treatment for mental h ealth and physical health needs in one setting. This measure assesses the percenta ge of discharges for members 6 years of age and older who were hospitalized for treatment of selected mental health disorders and who have an outpatient encounter with a mental health practitioner within 7 days and 30 days of discharge from the hospital. Outcome Measure Valuation: Outcome measure valuation for followup after hospitalization for mental illness by directly responds to waiver goals including the triple aim and improving the he alth delivery infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured resident s of the community and region. This includes providing care in the right setting at the right time and enhancing th e ability to treat mental health disorders earlier in the course of illness, both of which may contri bute to avoidance of unnecessary admissions and ER visits that might be due to untreated me ntal illness. 1258 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital 136141205.3.7 PASS 1 3.IT-1.18 Follow-Up After Hospitalization for Mental Illness- NQF 0576 University Hospital TPI-136141205 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 136141205.1.5 Starting Point/Baseline: To be developed in DY2 Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 [P-2]: Establish baseline rates for percentage of members who 1) received follow up within 30 days of discharge and 2) who received follow up within 7 days of discharge.

The USPSTF found that effective comprehe nsive weight-management programs incorporated counseling and other interventions that targeted diet and physi cal activity. Inte rventions also included behavioral management tec hniques to assist in behavior ch ange. Interventions that focused on younger children incorporated parent al involvement as a component. In Bexar County, Texas it is estimated that 23% of children on WIC are either overweight or obese. As in adults, individuals who are in these clinical categories are more likely to be at risk for Type 2 diabetes, asthma, high blood pressure. Expanding primary care and prevention and establis hing a usual source of care for this population can strengthen healthy behaviors an d early adoption to adhere to re gular clinical preventive care. Our goal is by DY 4 and DY 5 to increase access to clinical preventive care over baseline by implementing screening practices that identify chil dren and adolescents who are obese who are then referred into evidence-based h ealth service interven tions encouraging physi cal activity, healthy eating and adherence to good clinical preventive care. After establishi ng the baseline rates, outcome improvement targets will be determined. To deliver these outcomes, process milestones were carefully selected. These milestones define the activities that will be undertaken to prepare UHS to report outcomes in DY4 and DY5. The two process milestones selected are: P-1: Project Planning - Engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timeliness and document implementation plans. P-2: Establish Baseline Rates To ensure that project performance milestones are met an evaluation plan will be developed and implemented to monitor project activities. The eval uation is based on elements of the Framework for Program Evaluation in Public Health as outlined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 1999). Framework elements include: enga ging stakeholders, describing the program, focusing the evaluation design, appropriate and timely collection of data, ju stifying conclusions and ensuring use and sharing lessons learned. Use of this framework ensure s barriers to effective implementation inherent in public health/health service in terventions and translational research are reduced by placing focus on specific components of the intervention, clearly identifying the target population, setting obtainable targ ets, and effectively maintaining program fidelity through a focused and rigorous research de sign (Glasgow & Emmons, 2007). 1261 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Outcome Measure Valuation: Adherence to clinical preventive services, such as routine disease sc reening and scheduled immunizations, are key to reducing death and disability and are in line with national health goals. There is clear evidence that clinic al preventive services can both prevent and detect illnesses and disease that range from the flu to cancer and that if caught in thei r earlier, more treatable stages, can significantly reducing the risk of illness, di sability, early death, and health care costs. For example, on average, 42,000 deaths per year are prevented among children who receive recommended childhood vaccines. Yet, despite this evidence and such services are now covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and many pr ivate insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), large segments of the U.S. population which transl ate into millions of children, adolescents, and adults go without clinical preven tive services that could protect them from developing a number of serious diseases or help them treat cer tain health conditions before they worsen. 1262 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital 136141205.3.8 PASS 1 3.IT-12.5 Other USPSTF-endorsed scr eening outcome measures (Screening for obesity in children and adolescents) University Hospital TPI - 136141205 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 136141205.1.6 Starting Point/Baseline: To be developed in DY3 Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 P-1 Project Planning Data Source : Planning Document Process Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment (maximum amount): $157,189 Process Milestone 2 P-2 Establish Baseline Rates Data Source : Electronic Health Record Process Milestone 2 Estimated Incentive Payment: $182,202 Outcome Improvement Target 1 IT-12.5 Other USPSTF- endorsed screening outcome measures (Screening for obesity in children and adolescents) Improvement Target : Percent improvement over baseline of number of children and adolescents screened for obesity Goal : Increase number of screens.

The majority of depressed youth, however, are undiagnosed and untreated, despite opportunities for identif ication in settings such as primary care. A synthesis of the evidence suggest that primary care screening tools may be accurate in identifying depressed adolescen ts, and treatment can improve depression outcomes. Specific treatment should be based on the individual's needs and mental health treatment guidelines (USPSTF, Systematic Review, 2009). Expanding primary/pediatric primary care and prev ention and establishing a usual source of care for this population can strengthen healthy behavi ors and early adoption to adhere to regular clinical preventive care that incl udes screening and immunizations. The goal of this project is by DY 4 and DY 5 to increase access to clinical preventive care by TBD% over baseline by implementing clinical pr actice guidelines that sc reen adolescents 12-18 years of age for major depressive disorders.

The intent of the week long event will be to establish where the effo rts of the Transitions of Care Implementation Team need to focus their attention. The outcome will be a roadmap to the development of a Transitions of Care Program targeting the delivery of care post discharge and incor porating education, sp ecialty visits, post discharge phone calls, medication re conciliation, and much more. DY3 P-1: Project Planning - enga ge stakeholders, identify cu rrent capacity and needed resources, determine timelines and document implementation plan. Once the program is defined and the tasks are prioritized by level of significance as well as achievable goals, the next step will to identify the stakeholders and engage the individuals identified. The approach will be two fold: First, an Executive Team will be established for reporting of efforts. An initial meeting will be held to identi fy the results of the LEAN event and identify the teams implemented as a re sult of the prioritization session. Second, will be the identification of the implementation team members and the subcommittees needed to accomplish the goals and priorities established. Outcome Improvement Target DY4/5 IT-2.13 Other Admissions Rate (Stand-Alone Measure): Admission rate of patients managed by TOC project o As the project continues to work to wards reducing admissions, the Outcome Improvement Target will be reducing ra tes of readmission for patients identified 1272 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital and managed by the Transitions of Care Proj ect. The 5 year goal will be for 65% of patients identified as hi gh risk and, thus, managed w ithin the Transitions of Care program will not be readmitted. Rationale: It is vital for University Health System to ta rget the discharge process and the first 48 hours and days post discharge because that is the most vul nerable time once a patient has returned home to struggle and return to the hospital and/or EC. The project will \"significantly enhance\" pre- existing efforts as stated per the baseline above. Although the work was thorough and fruitful, the following gaps remain: how to better identify patients at high risk before discharge and at home education at discharge a nd via post discharge calls referral processes improved internal and external handoffs and communication, and patient engagement. Outcome Measure Valuation: Project valuation for an efficient and compre hensive Patient Care Transition Program is prioritized as a Pass 1. As there are approximately 22,000 or more discharges a year, around 55,000 EC visits, and > 580,000 Ambulatory visits expe cted in 2013, better transitions of care impact is defined through cost avoidance, a re duction of admissions and readmissions as well as a decreased EC utilization. 1273 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital 136141205.3.11 PASS 1 3.IT-2.13 Other admission rate: Admission rate of patients managed by TOC project University Hospital TPI - 136141205 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 136141205.2.1 Starting Point/Baseline: Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 2 [P-2]: Establish baseline rates Data Source: LEAN Event Report Process Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $443,827 Process Milestone 1 [P-1]: Project planning - engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timelines and document implementation plans.

Stakeholders would design protocols and reporting tools to monitor performance against the project timelin e based on the process improvement projects deadlines. P - 2: Establish baseline rates Part of the problem is identif ying where the baseline is. EPSI (University Health System's new budgeting system) will provide this data. P - 3: Develop and test data systems Configuration of EPSI will be required to pull correct, consistent cost data. IT - 5.1: Improved cost savings: demo nstrate cost savings in care deliver Lean process improvement initiative will streamline processes. Part of reducing waste includes cost minimization because fewer resources are being devoted towards 'non-value added' activities. University Health System exp ects to see a decrease in the cost of care delivery as Lean management philosophi es are developed throughout the system. Outcome Measure Valuation: The process milestones represent the build up to r eaching the improvement target. Essentially, cost minimization adds value to the tax-paying citi zens of Bexar county. As the county hospital, University Health System has a fiscal responsi bility to use the resources given by the county as efficiently as possible. Lean process improveme nt focuses on reducing waste, one of which is unnecessary cost. P - 1 helps outlin e the departments or processes for cost minimization.

In DY 2 and DY 3 process milestones will be addressed as follows: P - 1: Project planning University Health System would need to coordi nate this effort by pul ling in leadership of participating departments and clinical units to raise awareness on the importance of improving 1280 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital patient satisfaction. Stakeholders would design prot ocols and reporting tools to monitor performance against the project timeline. P - 5: Disseminate findings, including lessons learned and best practi ces, to stakeholders After DY2, stakeholders would co mmunicate successes and shortcomi ngs or other insight learned from the project initiatives Improvement target for DY 4 and DY 5 were chos en to based on implementation timeline of the Lean process improvement initiative which w ill streamline processes around the patient's experience. Reducing waste and focusing on the 'value added' activities will increase satisfaction. Workflows and throughput process will be design ed to get the patient through the system as efficiently as possible. Clinicians can spend mo re time focused on patient care and patients will spend less time waiting for staff to work through in efficient processes. University Health System expects to see an increase in the patient satisfaction of care delivery as Lean management philosophies are developed throughout the system. Outcome Measure Valuation: The value and success of this category 3 outcome will based on improvement of HCAHPS patient satisfaction scores. Process improvements will fo cus on improving the overall experience for all patients within UH by driving out waste and focusing on the 'value-added' activi ties.

DY2 will be the year used to continuously identify the appropriate personnel assigned to a Navigation/Care coordination Program, to engage those identified individuals, to determine the resources needed for a su ccessful implementation and expansion, as well as the development of an implementation plan. Preliminary stakeholders include executiv e leadership from ambulatory and acute providers, other clinic personnel, and ED personnel. Identified stakeholders will be activel y engaged through regular meetings. The meetings will be an opportunity to show successes and discuss opportunities for improvement. P-2 Establish baseline rates Once the implementation plan is establis hed and vetted with appropriate members of the organization, the Navigation Progr am will begin to review all data associated with ED visits to determine the population of most needed support. The data will be used to identify the population with freque nt EC visits and misuse. Outcome Improvement Target DY4/5 IT-9.2 ED appropriate utiliz ation (Stand-alone measure) o The selection of Outcome Improvement Target 9.2 was based on the long term goal of the Navigation Program of reduc ing EC utilization. The goal of the project is to reduce EC u tilization for a defined popul ation with chronic medical conditions and patients identif ied as high utilizers. o The Outcome Improvement Target allows Un iversity Health System to assess pre and post navigation services for identified patients. Target will be determined following baseline measure. 1283 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Rationale: P-1 was selected as the process metric for Univ ersity Health System because to date case managers, social workers and other personnel have only recently begun or introduced in the ED and in Ambulatory settings to assist with na vigation and care coordi nation. Though ED visits were up 2.6% in 2012 from 2011, there is a population identified as high utilizers who frequent the ED for any number of health care and beha vioral reasons and who would benefit from better access and coordination in the community. Un iversity Health System will develop a comprehensive implementation plan with plans to increase staffing in 2013 into additional Ambulatory settings. Metrics of success and stakeholder buy-in cont inues to evolve. ED utilization is a targeted metric for improvement Baseline data will be gathered once staff and full implementation occurs per clinic setti ng for improved community access. The Improvement target was chosen based on prev ious research that showed similar programs being able to impact EC utilization. Outcome Measure Valuation: Via the system created to weight all University Health System projects, this project was rated very high (18) due to the anticipated volum e of patients touched who will receive case management and social services support. Cost avoidance is the anticipa ted end result secondary to a reduction of admissions and readmissions as well as a decrease in EC utilization. This project achieves the Waiver goals by a) improving the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of the c ounty; b) further developing and maintaining a coordinated care delivery system; c) contributin g to patients' receivi the most cost-effective way; a nd serving as a powerful tool to help providers improve outcomes and reduce ED utili zation (containing cost growth). 1284 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital 136141205.3.15 PASS 1 3.IT-9.2 ED appropriate utilization University Hospital TPI - 136141205 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 136141205.2.4 Starting Point/Baseline: To be developed in DY 3 Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 [P-1]: Project planning - engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timelines and document implementation plans.

Referring physicians and physicians-in-training need to understand and appreciate the role that Palliativ e Care can play in improving patie nt and family satisfaction, pain and other symptom management, and in promoti ng patient and family-centered care. Education of referring physicians, especially primary car e physicians and physic ians-in-training, can deepen the appreciation for supportive care. Educa tion in Palliative Care can also promote best practices and broad patient access to competent deliv ery of basics in Palliative Care, such as the safe use of opioids, emotional and spiritual aspects of care, and ethical issues related to surrogate decision-making and withdr awing or withholding life- sustaining interventions. Outcome Measure Valuation: For Category 3 outcomes, the three non-standalo ne metrics (chart documentation of pain assessment, life sustaining treatm ent preferences, and documentati on of spiritual concerns) are valued based on their ability to demonstrate ta ngible achievement with various elements of a successful palliative care program and their imp act on patient comfort, safety, and health care outcomes. One first step towards controlling pain and improving patient outcomes is to maximize and standardize the assessment and to an ticipate the pain of our highest risk patients, especially those undergoing surgery or invasive procedures and thos e with advanced illness such as metastatic cancer. A consensus statement from an \"International Expert Panel\" out of Johns Hopkins in 2008 stated that opioids are an essential part of pa tient care for the elderly and patients with cancer.103 They recommended the use of evid enced-based medicine to establish local clinical practice guidelines for clinicians who prescribe opioids. They argue that increased awareness of medication profiles can promote effec tive and safe pain relief. Both the Agency for Health Care Research and the American Pain Society recommend balancing effective analgesia with effective monitoring, prevention, and mana gement of adverse opioid events. The Category 3 metrics for this project will establish a systematic process to achieve higher standard for pain 95Teno JM, Clarridge BR, Casey V, et al.

Furthermore, in many cases, uncontrolled symptoms and incomplete communication regardin g life sustaining preferences and religious/spiritual concerns are avoidable causes of prolonged hospitalization with th e added risks, costs, and inconvenience to families. For any given patient, each day in which pain, nausea, shortness of breath, anxiety, spiritual distress, and life-and- death decisions are not maximally supported can seem like an eternity. Uncontrolled pain lead s to physiologic disturbances a nd poor patient experiences. In many cases, uncontrolled pain is an avoidable cause of prolonged hospitalization with the added risks, costs, and inconveniences to families. Th e Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality suggests that patient safety and satisfaction ca nnot be optimized in hos pital-based care without first raising the bar for pain assessment. The auth ors note that the scope of the problem is vast: 62% of the 35 million discharges from U.S. hospitals include surgery or interventional procedures, and over 80% of these patients e xperience post-operative or procedural pain. 104 These patients are at risk for adverse cardiac events, swings in blood sugar, the development of chronic pain and addiction, and psychological dist ress such as anxiety and sleeplessness. The American Academy of Pain Medicine also note s that patients who expe rience uncontrolled pain experience higher absenteeism and lost productivit y, with an annual estimated cost of about $300 billion.105 Even when pain is recognized and treate d promptly, the safe and effective use of medications is a serious challe nge for hospital care. A sentinel study from 1997 showed that 29% of adverse medication events in the hospital were opioid-related.106 For post-operative patients, the evidence of avoidable health system costs of uncontrolled pain and adverse opioid events is mounting. A study from 2013 showed that adverse opioid events in surgical patients are associated with significantly higher cost s, length of stay, and readmission rates.107 A retrospective review of 320,000 pati ents showed that patients with documented adverse events - including constipation, a ltered mental status, respiratory de pression, and poorly controlled pain - had on average 30% higher in-hospi tal costs. These patients also had a three-fold greater odds of being a cost and length of stay outlier that were mo re likely to be readmitted within 30 days. It is expected the benefits of reduced length of sta y, decreased direct hospita l costs, and readmission rates will be experienced directly by those patients who receive palliative care specialty services and will be multiplied as the standards for expe rt pain management are raised across other clinical services who deliver ca re to patients with advanced ag e, cancer, and surgical needs. Although peer reviewed studies in palliative care do not traditionally quantify the financial value of good pain control or addressing the treatment preferences and sp iritual concerns of patients, these clearly have value to patients and families. Using the same approach to value category 2 metrics, these downstream outcomes are a smalle r reflection of the larger value calculated through cost avoidance using data from patients pr eviously seen at University Hospital. Early palliative care intervention is a specific goal for the LIFE Care/Palliative Medicine service, which offers the greatest ability to improve he alth outcomes, patient experience, and reduced 104Wells, Pasero, and McCaffery, \"Chapter 17: Improving the Qual ity of Care Through Pain Assessment and Management\" in the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality \"Patient Safety an d Quality: An Evidence-Based Handbook for Nurses,\" ed Ronda Hughes, April 2008.

University Hospital has valued the outcomes of the Lifelong Intensive Family Emotional (L.I.F.E.) Care/Palliative Medicine Service projec t through its ability to ac hieve the waiver goals, meet community needs, meet the level of required investment, and include the value of palliative care in the context of both the i npatient and outpatient setting. In 2011, University Health System cared for over 233,000 unique patients, includi ng about 67,000 Emergency Center visits, 400,000 outpatient clinic visits, and 20,000 inpatient discharges. The pr imary inpatient facility in University Hospital, which operates 496 beds and will expand to about 750 beds when the new University Tower is completed in 2014. Universi ty Hospital is a Level One Trauma Center, a world-renowned solid organ transplant center, and a referral center fo r a broad array of life- threatening conditions including me tastatic cancer, end-stage re nal disease, cirrhosis, heart failure, AIDS, and vascular diseas e. South and Central Texas have some of the nation's highest rates of diabetes and obesity. During the calendar year 2012, the LIFE Care/Palliative Medicine program provided 638 inpatient consultations and over 120 outpatient clinic visits. Preliminary analysis from an internal database reveals th at 50% of these patients suffered from advanced cancer, 30% had brain injury or polytrauma, and 30% faced end-stage organ disease such renal failure and cirrhosis, with some overlap among th ese groups. Cost-savings or cost-avoidance is increasingly recognized as a sec ondary outcome associated with Palliative Care programs. When patients and families are provided early supportive care, the culture of automatic escalation of care is mitigated. This can result in cost-savi ngs, improved quality of life, and even prolongation of life. 108 One large multi-institutional study that matched patients by se verity of illness (propensity scores) showed that inpatient Palliati ve Care consultation significantly reduced direct and variable costs.109 For patients who were discharged a live, Palliative Care consultation correlated with an adjusted net savings of $1,700 per admission. And for patients who died in the hospital, savings exceeded $4,900 per admission . When these savings are multiplied across hundreds of consultations per year, and increased IC U bed availability is a dded in, the savings to the healthcare system are substantial\u2014those savi ngs can be used to further improve and expand supportive care for all patients. At University Hospital, early analysis demons trates similar cost- savings. One hundred and seventy patients seen by the LIFE Care/Pallia tive Medicine team during a six-month period were matched to about 9,000 patients with similar diagnoses and severity of illness. With conservative assumpti ons and excluding outlier s, reduced direct and variable savings averaged $5,600 per admission. C onsultations performed within 72 hours of admissions yielded cost-savings of $12,600 per admi ssion, which further illustrates the need for early Palliative Care consultation. Opportunity co sts not included in this analysis includes ICU bed days, which also decreased by an average of one day per admission and almost certainly resulted in reduced ICU mortality and Emer gency Center throughput. Early palliative care involvement is the goal, which offers the greate st ability to improve he alth outcomes, patient experience, and cost avoidance. 108Temel, et al.

Referring physicians and physicians-in-training need to understand and appreciate the role that Palliativ e Care can play in improving patie nt and family satisfaction, pain and other symptom management, and in promoti ng patient and family-centered care. Education of referring physicians, especially primary car e physicians and physic ians-in-training, can deepen the appreciation for supportive care. Educa tion in Palliative Care can also promote best practices and broad patient access to competent deliv ery of basics in Palliative Care, such as the safe use of opioids, emotional and spiritual aspects of care, and ethical issues related to surrogate decision-making and withdr awing or withholding life- sustaining interventions. Outcome Measure Valuation: For Category 3 outcomes, the three non-standalo ne metrics (chart documentation of pain assessment, treatment preferences, and documentati on of spiritual concerns) are valued based on their ability to demonstrate tangible achievement with various elements of a successful palliative care program and their impact on patient comfort, safety, and health care outcomes. One first step towards controlling pain a nd improving patient outcomes is to maximize and standardize the assessment and to anticipate the pain of our hi ghest risk patients, especially those undergoing surgery or invasive procedures and those with advanced illness such as metastatic cancer. A consensus statement from an \"International Expert Panel\" out of Johns Hopkins in 2008 stated that opioids are an essential part of patient care for the el derly and patients with cancer.119 They recommended the use of evidenced-based medicine to establish local clin ical practice guidelines for clinicians who prescribe opioids. They argue that increased awareness of medication profiles can promote effective and safe pain relief. Both the Agency for Health Care Research and the American Pain Society recommend balancing e ffective analgesia with effective monitoring, prevention, and management of adverse opioid ev ents. The Category 3 metrics for this project will establish a systematic process to achieve a higher standard for pain assessment and management. Furthermore, in many cases, uncontrolled symptoms and incomplete communication regarding life sust aining preferences and religi ous/spiritual concerns are avoidable causes of prolonged hospi talization with the added risks, costs, and inconvenience to families. For any given patient, each day in whic h pain, nausea, shortness of breath, anxiety, spiritual distress, and life-and- death decisions are not maximally supported can seem like an eternity.

A sentinel study from 1997 showed that 29% of adverse medication events in the hospital were opioid-related.122 For post-operative patients, the evidence of avoidable health system costs of uncontrolled pain and adverse opioid events is mounting. A study from 2013 showed that adverse opioid events in surgical patients are associated with significantly higher cost s, length of stay, and readmission rates.123 A retrospective review of 320,000 pati ents showed that patients with documented adverse events - including constipation, a ltered mental status, respiratory de pression, and poorly controlled pain - had on average 30% higher in-hospi tal costs. These patients also had a three-fold greater odds of being a cost and length of stay outlier that were mo re likely to be readmitted within 30 days. It is expected the benefits of reduced length of sta y, decreased direct hospita l costs, and readmission rates will be experienced directly by those patients who receive palliative care specialty services and will be multiplied as the standards for expe rt pain management are raised across other clinical services who deliver ca re to patients with advanced ag e, cancer, and surgical needs.

South and Central Texas have some of the nation's highest rates of diabetes and obesity. . During the calendar year 2012, th e LIFE Care/Palliative Medicine program provided 638 inpatient consultations and over 120 outpatient clinic visits. Preliminary analysis from an internal database reveals th at 50% of these patients suffered from advanced cancer, 30% had brain injury or polytrauma, and 30% faced end-stage organ disease such renal failure and cirrhosis, with some overlap among th ese groups. Cost-savings or cost-avoidance is increasingly recognized as a sec ondary outcome associated with Palliative Care programs. When patients and families are provided early supportive care, the culture of automatic escalation of care is mitigated. This can result in cost-savi ngs, improved quality of life, and even prolongation of life. 124 One large multi-institutional study that matched patients by se verity of illness (propensity scores) showed that inpatient Palliati ve Care consultation significantly reduced direct and variable costs.125 For patients who were discharged a live, Palliative Care consultation correlated with an adjusted net savings of $1,700 per admission. And for patients who died in the hospital, savings exceeded $4,900 per admission . When these savings are multiplied across hundreds of consultations per year, and increased IC U bed availability is a dded in, the savings to the healthcare system are substantial\u2014those savi ngs can be used to further improve and expand supportive care for all patients. At University Hospital, early analysis demons trates similar cost- savings. One hundred and seventy patients seen by the LIFE Care/Pallia tive Medicine team during a six-month period were matched to about 9,000 patients with similar diagnoses and severity of illness. With conservative assumpti ons and excluding outlier s, reduced direct and variable savings averaged $5,600 per admission. C onsultations performed within 72 hours of admissions yielded cost-savings of $12,600 per admi ssion, which further illustrates the need for early Palliative Care consultation. Opportunity co sts not included in this analysis includes ICU bed days, which also decreased by an average of one day per admission and almost certainly resulted in reduced ICU mortality and Emer gency Center throughput. Early palliative care involvement is the goal, which offers the greate st ability to improve he alth outcomes, patient experience, and cost avoidance. 124Temel, et al.

Care/Palliative Medicine Service will specifically engage in Project Planning (P -1) for process improvement. This will include engaging multiple stakeholders, identification of current capacity and needed resources, determination of specific timelines and documen tation and implementation of plans to address the outcome improvement measures for palliative care patients. During DY3 , the Lifelong Intensive Family Emotional (L.I.F.E.) Care/Palliative Medicine Service will use information gathered and systems devel oped during DY2 to establish baseline rates (P- 2) for the outcome improvement meas ures for palliative care patients. Outcome improvement measures: Numerator : Number of patients with clinical record documentation of spiritual/religious concerns or documentation that the patient/f amily did not want to discuss. Denominator : Total number of patient's discharged from palliative care during the designated reporting period. Data Source : EHR, Palliative Care Database DY4: Of patients discharged from palliative ca re during the designated reporting period, the palliative care team will successfully document spiritual/religious concerns or that the patient/family did not want to disc uss in least 75% of patients (479). DY5: Of patients discharged from palliative ca re during the designated reporting period, the palliative care team will successfully document spiritual/religious concerns or that the patient/family did not want to disc uss in least 90% of patients (574). Rationale: The process metrics chosen are an essential to develop a systematic process for the quality improvement cycle related to fostering successful outcomes an ticipated in DY4 and DY5. For Category 3 outcomes, the three non- standalone metrics (chart docum entation of pain assessment, life sustaining treatment preferen ces, and documentation of spirit ual concerns) re flect some of the core quality measures needed to achieve ex cellence in patient care. These metrics also correlate with the selected Process and Improve ment metrics.

DY 4 & DY5: P-4 : Conduct Plan Do Study Act cycles to improve data collection and intervention activities: Target: IT-6.1 Meet Teaching Hospital cohort CAHPS benchmarks in all Dimensions of Service by DY 4. Show improvement over baseline of patient satisfaction scores at a level to be determined. DY 5: P-5: Disseminate Findings, including lessons lear ned and best practices, to stakeholders across Bexar County community as well as through articles, webina rs, and presentations through the Teaching Hospitals of Texas, Texas Hospital Association and NRC Picker. Improvement Target : IT-6.1 Exceed Teaching Hospital benchmarks by 5% by end of DY 5, show improvement over baseline of patient satisf action scores at a level to be determined. Rationale: The rationale for selecting the following process milestones reflect the me thodical approach that will be undertaken to engage stakeholders, identify required resources, develop an implementation and project monitoring plan to en sure appropriate alignment with improving and reporting of data and systems provide the necessar y infrastructure to ensure timely and accurate reporting of patient satisfaction scores. Process Milestones Process milestones (P-1, P-2 and P-3) were chosen as part of ensure the accurate and appropriate collection of patient experience in DY2 and DY3. With the implementation of value-based purchasing, as well as research demonstrating th e link between the patient experience and other hospital quality metrics, it is critically important fo r University Health System to ensure that a focus is on placed on HCAHPS improvement from the onset. The project to improve effective communication between healthcare professiona ls with patients and families through interpreter/document translation enhancements will enable University Health System improve the patient experience as measured by achievi ng new levels of performance on HCAHPS, and ultimately deliver higher quality care. The culmina tion of this efforts will be further calibrated with process milestones P-4 c onduct a plan, do study and act as well as share finding (P-5) and lessons learned with regional hospi tal partners and related organiza tions regarding best practices and opportunities to improve patient experience. Improvement Targets This outcome improvement measure was chosen for its direct relation to the goals of the triple aim: assuring patients receive hi gh-quality and patient -centered ca re, in the most effective way 1302 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital as well as developing and mainta ining a coordinated care deliver y system that address patient preferences including cultural a nd linguistic orientation and ther eby contributes to patients receiving high-quality, patient-cente red care in the most cost-effec tive way. In addition, intent of measuring patient experience is that it enhanc es public accountability in health care by increasing the transparency of th e quality of institutional care pr ovided in return for the public investment. Outcome Measure Valuation: University Health System's efforts to succe ssfully strengthen access to culturally competent patient-centered care through stra tegies that promote timely or al interpretation/translation services, improve the fluid exchange of hea lth information between patients and healthcare professionals and promote opportunities for patient to adhere to prescrib ed clinical care and treatment regimens will in large be self-evident and in particular demonstrated by an increase in patient satisfaction scores regarding quality of care received. Such efforts will also strengthen waiver goals: a) improving the health care infr astructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of the count y; b) further developing and maintaining a coordinated care delivery system; c) contributing to patients rece iving high-quality, patient -centered care in the most cost-effective way; and serving as a powerfu l tool to help provide rs improve outcomes and reduce ED utilization (con taining cost growth). 1303 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital 136141205.3.19 PASS 2 3.IT-6.1 Percent improvement over baseline of patient satisfaction scores University Health System TPI-136141205 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: : 136141205.1.7 Starting Point/Baseline: TBD Year 2 (10/1/2012 (10/1/2013 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 [P-1]: Project planning - engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timelines and document implementation plans Data Source: Team meeting minutes, data elements identified in valuation/assessment and project planning documentation.

Rationale: Less than half of all American s receive the recommended levels of screening associated with clinical preventive care. Studies confirm the clin ical and economic benefits of providing timely access to preventive services by significantly reduci ng the onset of chronic health conditions that include cancer. Screening for breast cancer implies testing for early stages of disease before symptoms occur. It involves application of an early detection test to a large number of apparently healthy people to identify those having unrecognized cancer. People with positive sc reening tests are subsequently investigated with diagnostic tests and those with confirmed disease are offered appropriate treatment and follow up. The objective of screening is to redu ce incidence of and/or death from cancer by detecting early preclinic al disease when treatment may be easier and more effective than for advanced cancer diagnosed after the symp toms occur. It is important to evaluate the efficacy of a given screening approach to reduce disease burden, harm and cost, as well as its overall cost effectiveness, before it is considered for widespread implementation in large population settings. Expanding primary care and prevention and estab lishing a usual source of enhance screening behaviors including adherence to clinical preventive care such as breast cancer screening. Project goal in DY 4 and in DY 5 is to increase access and coverage to clinical preventive care; specifically ensuring that women receive a mamm ogram based on clinical preventive guidelines. After establishing the baseline rates, outcome improvement targets will be determined. To deliver these outcomes, process milestones were carefully selected. These milestones define the activities that will be undertaken to prepare University Health System to report outcomes in DY4 and DY5. The two process m ilestones selected are: P-1: Project Planning - Engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timeliness and document implementation plans. P-2: Establish Baseline Rates Quality Improvement Process: To ensure that project perf ormance milestone are met an evaluation plan will be embedded within project activities and will guided by elements of the Framework for Program Evaluation in Public He alth as outlined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 1999). Framework el ements will include: engaging stakeholders, describing the program, focusing the evaluation desi gn, appropriate and timely collection of data, justifying conclusions and ensuring use and sharing lessons learned. The strength of utilizing this framework will also ensure that barriers to effective implementation inherent in public health/health service interventions and transl ational research are reduced by placing focus specific components of the intervention, clearly identifying the target population and target setting and effectively capturi ng fidelity of the project activ ities through a focused research design (Glasgow & Emmons, 2007).E valuation of project success will in large part be self- evident.

Exclusions: Individuals 75 years of ag e and older; Death before discharge b) Denominator : Total mid-year populat ion under age 75. c) Data source: EMR/IDX d). Reasons/Rationale for selecting the outcome measures: Lack of access to medication or non- compliance with medication instructions are 2 ke y contributors to increa sed hospital admissions. Reducing unnecessary admissions be nefits the patient and lowers costs for the hospital and the state. A potentially avoidable hospitalization a chronic health condition is commonly associated with a lack of access to appropr iate ambulatory care. While not all admissions for chronic conditions are avoidable, it is assumed that appropriate ambula tory care can pr event avoidable admissions through more effective disease manage ment, and control of acute episodes. A high rate of avoidable admissions reflects problems in obtaining access to appr opriate primary care. This pharmacist-led, chronic disease medication ma nagement program will have a direct impact on reducing avoidable admissions by reducing me dication errors and adverse effects from medication use. Culturally competent pharmaci sts can effectively remove barriers and communicate with patients to educate them about medications, assure proper usage, answer questions, and provide social and emotiona l support to patients and their families.

Target Outcome TBD DY5: IT-2.11: Reduce total acute care hos pitalizations for ambulatory care sensitive conditions under age 75 years. Target Outcome TBD Rationale: The rationale for this measure is as follows: \"Hospitalization for an ambulatory care sensitive condition (ACSC) is considered to be a measur e of access to appropriate primary health care. While not all admissions for these conditions are avoidable, it is assumed that appropriate ambulatory care could prevent the onset of this type of illness or condition, control an acute episodic illness or condition, or manage a chro nic disease or condition. A disproportionately high rate is presumed to reflect problems in obt aining access to appropriate primary care.\" Proper medication management for patients with chroni c illnesses by a dedicated, specially trained pharmacist will be a significant contributing vari able to lowering the rate of these admissions among the selected hub clinic population. The Health System does not have such a program in place and this template will generate the data necessary to make a significant contributio n to the medication management program and to the other care coordination efforts currently under way in the Health System - and those proposed by other Performing Providers under th is 1115 Waiver. Improvement targets have not been identified, but will be during DYs 2 and 3.

This will be an expansion and enhancement initiative that targets delivery of patient-centered primary pediatric care in Bexar County, Texas. This undertaking will be ma de possible by leveraging the University Health System ambulat ory network of clinical and prev entive health clinics that are located in both high-growth and high-need areas delineated primarily by economically vulnerable populations that include minority indi viduals with multiple chronic conditions with limited and non-existed health insurance coverage. For example project efforts will coincide with Un iversity Health System initiatives to partner with FQHCs to expand primary care capacity and access, oral health services, establish school- based clinics in major urban s ectors of the city and health promotion efforts that enhance awareness of preventive care at all life stages to further help establish linkages between communities and preventive care. The experience of enhancing delivery of services to vulnerable populations gives us confidence th at enhancing and expanding prim ary pediatric care and urgent pediatric care to our cu rrent clinic patient population and in partnership with the other performing providers in RHP6 will vastly improve management of pediatric asthma and related conditions. DY3: Process Milestone 2: Conduct Plan Do St udy Act (PDSA) cycles to improve data collection and intervention activities. Process Milestone 2 affords the opportunity to engage in quality improvements, share lessons learned, and effect rapid cycle improvements as appropriate. 1321 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Outcome Improvement Targets: Category 3 Outcome: Reduce Pediatric/Young Adu lt Asthma Emergency Department Visits per NQF 1381, which populates both DYs 4 and 5 in an ticipation of continu ous improvement. The outcome improvement targets are yet to be determined (TBD) for DYs 4 and 5. Rationale: Process Milestone 1: Project planning - engage stakehol ders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timelines and docum ent implementation plans. As noted above, the Health System currently employs telemedicine on a pilot basis for the Bexar County Adult Detention Center inmates. Expanding the technology to patient clinic sites, as well as to regional partners in the future, however, requir es a completely new planning process. Process Milestone 2: Conduct Plan Do Study Act (PDSA) cycl es to improve data collection and intervention activities. As mentioned, Process Mi lestone 2 affords the opportunity to engage in quality improvements, share lessons learned, and e ffect rapid cycle improvements as appropriate. This milestone is the natural extension to cr eation of the project pl an as the steps to implementation are completed. The outcome improvement targets for the selected Category 3 Outcome, \"Reduce pediatric/young adult asthma em ergency department visits pe r NQF 1381,\" in both DY 4 and 5, will be determined in DY 2 for implementati on in DY 3. This outcome improvement measure directly responds to the Waiver's goals of a) improving the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of the county; b) fu rther developing and maintaining a coordinated/integrated care delivery system; c) contribute to patients' receiving high-quality, patient-centered care in the most cost-effective way; and d) serv e as a powerful tool to help providers improve outcomes and reduce ED utilization (containi ng cost growth). Outcome Measure Valuation: Successful expansion in capacity/delivery of prim ary pediatric care and as a countermeasure to reduce inappropriate ED utilizat ion for pediatric and young adult asthma patients will be an indicator for achievement of Waiver goals: a) impr oving the health care infr astructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of the county; b) fu rther developing and maintaining a coordinated care delivery system; c) contribut ing to patients' receiving high-quality, patient- centered care in the most cost-effective way; a nd serving as a powerful tool to help providers improve health outcomes and reduce emergency room utilization (containing cost growth). When fully implemented - beyond DY5 - which in cludes expansion of primary pediatric care health service delivery for othe r highly prevalent conditions, the larger scope of the project should impact proper utilization in the form of increased routine and follow-up patient visits and encounters and reduced ED utilization. This project requires investment as it co mplements HITECH funding goals. The hardware, software applications, human resources, and time to implement are of th e highest organizational priority for the Health System. This particular project targets asthma, but the scope of utilization 1322 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital for other chronic diseases and in other h ealth care settings is potentially huge. 1323 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital 136141205.3.25 PASS 3 3.IT-9.3 Pediatric/Young Adult Asthma Emergency Department Visits - NQF 1381 University Hospital TPI - 136141205 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: : 136141205.1.8 Starting Point/Baseline: To be developed in DY3 Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 [P-1]: Project planning - engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timelines and document implementation plans Data Source: Needs assessment and project planning documentation.

Legislators and regulators at all levels of gove rnment are exploring options for increasing quality and reducing health care costs related to avoidable r eadmissions. While not all readmissions are preventable unde rstanding what is causing them and developing strategies to reduce readmissions can be implemented. Case management services provided in the psyc hiatric emergency service can transition patients with multiple admissions over to community resources that can reduces reimbursement denials and preserves acute care beds fo r more appropriate admissions. Outcome Measure Valuation: By redirecting non emergent healthcare n eeds to community resources a reduction in readmissions to an inpatient stay will be suppor ted while addressing a pr iority community need.

Outcome Improvement Target for each year: DY4: Improvement Target: Increase in chronic dis ease patients who access dental health services X% from baseline Y3 DY5: Improvement Target: Increase in chronic dis ease patients who access dental health services X% from baseline Y3 Rationale: The rationale for selecting the following process milestones reflect the me thodical approach that will be undertaken to engage stakeholders, identify required resources, develop an implementation, establish baseline performance measures and a project monitoring plan to ensure appropriate alignment with improving and re porting of data and systems that will provide the necessary infrastructure to ensure timely and accurate reporting of patient outcome measures (IT 7.8 Chronic Disease Patient Accessing Dental Services). National studies on disparities in receipt of oral health services find that almost half of all Americans do not a visit a dentist each year and nearly one-third lack access to basic preventive and primary oral health care services. In addi tion, these studies further detail that Individuals who are least likely to access preventative oral health care are more likely to have higher rates of oral disease. In particular, economically vuln erable populations that include minority adults, persons with a chronic disease and children are significantly less likely to have access to oral health care compared to their non-poor and non-minority peers. Studies on adherence to 1330 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital preventive oral health services fi nd that patients are more likely to seek dental services when the importance of need is documented by a formal referral being made. The target population will be economically vulne rable populations that s eek services at UHS including Carelink members assigned to UHS patie nt centered medical homes. CareLink is a financial assistance program for uninsured residents of Bexar County. The program was created in 1997 to help address the needs of Bexar Count y residents without health care coverage who were not eligible for Medicaid or other public or private funding. While CareLink is not an insurance product per se, it has many similar a dvantages in terms of promoting access to preventive health services, enc ouraging a long lasting relationship with a primary care provider, and instilling a sense of shared responsibility be tween member and staff for the member's health. As of December 31, 2011, there were 54,256 members enrolled in CareLink. Outcome Measure Valuation: This outcome will be valued based on the number of chronic disease patients that are able to access dental health services within the project timeframe. The rationale is implementing patient- centered care and leveraging resources with part ners safety net providers allows for expanded comprehensive clinical preventive care, better care coordination, and improved health promotion and disease prevention. 1331 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital 136141205.3.28 PASS 3 3.IT-7.3 Chronic Disease Patients Accessing Dental Services Performing Provider Name: University Health System TPI - 1316141205 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: : 136141205.1.11 Starting Point/Baseline: To be developed in DY3 Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 P 1 Project planning engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timelines and document implementation plans to support access and enhancement of dental health services.

Denominator: The number of admissions (for patients 18 years and older), for patients discharged from the hospital with a principal or secondary diagnosis of HF and with a complete claims history for the 12 months prior to admission. Rationale: The Potentially Preventable Admissions Outcom e Measure enables the Transitions of Care Program to identify, monitor, and assess the pati ents placed on the CHF initiative. Data presented by TMF for 2010, reported a 30.1 readmi ssion rate for Medicare Beneficiaries at University Hospital diagnosed with congestive heart failure. The RHP 6 average was 20.5 for the same population. 1333 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital Outcome Measure Valuation: The project will value the outcome and measur e success by the readmission rate for patients admitted with a diagnosis of heart failure (IT-3.2 ). With a more coordinated discharge process, patients will have a clearer follow-up timeline to manage their chronic condition. The investment in redesigning this process with more of a focus on post discharge planning and care coordination will avoid higher cost hospital stays for readmitted patients. This drives value to RHP 6 by directly addressing CN.2 which cites a need for better chronic disease management. 1334 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 University Hospital 136141205.3.29 PASS 3 3.IT-3.2 Congestive Heart Failure 30 day readmission rate (Stand-Alone Measure) University Hospital TPI - 136141205 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: : 136141205.2.9 Starting Point/Baseline: Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 [P-1]: Project planning - engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timelines and document implementation plans.

Approximately 20.8 million Am ericans have diabetes, and half these cases are undiagnosed. Complications from the disease cost the country near ly $100 billion annually. In addition, diabetes accounts for ne arly 20 percent of all deaths in people over 25 years of age. Many complications, such as amputation, blindne ss, and kidney failure, can be prevented if detected and addressed in the early stages. Alth ough many people live with diabetes years after diagnosis, it is a costly condition that leads to serious and potentia lly fatal health complications. Diabetes control can improve the quality of life for millions of Americans and save billions of health care dollars.

In DY2 and DY3 the primary care teams from all 3 sites require training by an endoc rinologist in all aspects of specialty care for patients with low to moderate risk of compli cations. One site will complete training and full implementation of the program components by th e end of DY2, and other sites will be fully trained and implemented by the end of DY3. Ad herence to the medical recommendations will demonstrate the level of empowerment the patie nt experienced through the strength of the relationship with the primary care team. Fu rther evidence of adherence to medical recommendations will be through monitoring of HbA1c test results. Outcome Measure Valuation: In Bexar County 11.8% (137,009) have been diagnosed with diabetes, whic h is in vast contrast to 9.3% (1.7 million) diabetes in the state. Diabetes is also the 4th leading cause of death in Bexar County. In face of such high prevalence of diabet es in Bexar County, effective management is necessary to reduce the bur den of the disease and the cost of treatment of complications. Texas has failed to meet the national standards for health care quality measures re garding diabetes.

When LDL C levels are high, cholesterol can build up w ithin the walls of the arteries, causing atherosclerosis, the build up of plaque. Hemorrhaging or clot formation can occur at the site of plaque build up, blocking arteries and causing heart attack and stroke. Reducing cholesterol in patients with known heart disease is critically important, as treatment can reduce morb idity (heart attack and stroke) and mortality by as much as 40%.

Uvalde Memorial Hospital also values each outcome based on the following f actors: the potential impact on health of our population, the resources necessary to achieve the outcome, and level of improvement anticipated in overall patient satisfaction. From a cost avoidance perspective, reducing IC U admissions during the last 30 days of life will reduce hospital and payer cost as the ICU is a very high cost source for care. Not only are ICU stays for these patients expensive for their families, they are also not comfortable or accommodating to the needs of the patient and hi s or her family. Costs are avoided, and pain managed more effectively during th e last days of life through an e ffective palliative care program that puts the needs of the pa tient and family first. 1355 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Uvalde Memorial Hospital 121782003.3.3 PASS 2 3.IT-13.4 Proportion admitted to the ICU in the last 30 days of life (NQF 0213) Uvalde County Hospital Authority, DBA Uvalde Memorial Hospital TPI - 121782003 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 1.2 121782003.2.1 Starting Point/Baseline: TBD in DY 3 Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 [P-1]: Project planning - engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timelines and document implementation plans Data Source: Documentation of meetings held, attendance sheets and documented recommendations.

DY5: Reduce ED visits for targeted conditions by a TBD percentage from baseline Y3. Rationale: High emergency room (ER) utilization is a consider able concern for the increasing cost of health care. Frequent and inappropria te use of hospital ERs is extremely costly and care could be provided in a less expensive setti ng. Patients, when possible, s hould be treated by their primary care provider for non-emergency conditions in orde r to promote consistent, quality care. The targeted population will be the Carelink members assigned to University Health System patient centered medical homes. CareLink is a financial assistance program for uni nsured residents of Bexar County. The program was created in 1997 to help address the ne eds of Bexar County residents without health care cove rage who were not eligible fo r Medicaid or other public or private funding. While CareLink is not an in surance product per se , it has many similar advantages in terms of promoting access to preven tive health services, encouraging a long lasting relationship with a primary care pr ovider, and instilling a sense of shared responsibility between member and staff for the member's healt h. As of December 31, 2011, there were 54,256 members enrolled in CareLink. Process Milestones P1 and P2 were chosen to al low time for necessary project planning and data 1367 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Community Medicine Associates collection activities to understand our patients who will benefit the most from expanded primary care into their neighborhoods. It will also allow us to set up the necessary processes to effectively reach out and work with chronic disease patient as we expand our primary care capacity. The improvement targets of reducing avoidabl e ED visits for speci fic medical conditions selected because of the evidence base associated with access to primary care and the reduction of unnecessary ED visits. Having a re gular source of primary care in creases the probability that patients with chronic medical conditions will ha ve less exacerbations, be tter control of their disease, and therefore fewer ED visits cause d by uncontrolled symptoms . Since this is an expansion of primary care in an existing patient population we know which pa tients to target for more outreach, and care management to reach our goals. Outcome Measure Valuation: This outcome will be valued based on the number of emergency visits avoided by patients with COPD, behavioral health diagnoses, diabetes exacerbations, and asthma. The rational is expanded primary care and acute care through Univ ersity Health System's ExpressMed clinics will support patients in control ling these chronic conditions and reduce avoidable emergency center visits. It will also s upport the achievement of Waiver goa ls: a) improving the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured residents of the county; b) further developing and maintaining a c oordinated care delivery system; c) contributing to patients' receiving high-quality, patient-cen tered care in the most cost-effective way; and serving as a powerful tool to help providers improve outcome s and reduce ED utilization (containing cost growth). 1368 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Community Medicine Associates 092414401.3.1 PASS 2 3.IT-9.2 ED appropriate utilization Community Medicine Associates TPI - 092414401 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: : 092414401.1.1 Starting Point/Baseline: Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 P 1 Project planning engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timelines and document implementation plans Data Source: Meeting minutes Process Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $0 Process Milestone 2 P 2 Establish baseline rates for reduction in ED visits for targeted conditions Data Source: Sunrise, IDX, volume reports, Quality reports Metric 1: Number of annual ER visits for CareLink patients with COPD, behavioral health, diabetes and asthma.

DY2 will be the year used to identify the appropriate personnel to discuss the Care management Model, to engage thos e identified individuals, determine the resources needed for a successful implem entation, as well as the development of an implementation plan. Preliminary stakeholders include executiv e leadership from ambulatory and acute, clinic providers and other clinic personnel, along w ith members of the care management team. Once identified, the stakeholders will be actively engaged through regular meetings. The meetings will be an opportunity to show successes and discuss opportunities for improvement. DY3 P-2 Establish baseline rates Care Coordination and clinic leadership will review all data associated with admissions, readmissions, and EC visits per clinic and iden tify the population(s) having high risk health care needs for management. Outcome Improvement Target DY4/5 IT-2.13 Other Admissions Rate (Stand-Alone Measure) o The selection of Outcome Improvement Ta rget 2.13 was based on the inability to identify a single diagnosis within a clinic panel in need of additional resources 1370 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Community Medicine Associates and support. As high risk stratification crit eria are developed, the intent of the Care Management Model is to improve clinical outcomes, decrease admissions, minimize readmissions, and address EC utiliz ation for risk stratified patients in need of additional support. Therefore, we expect to achieve a TBD decrease in hospital admissions, a TBD decrease in re admissions, and a TBD decrease in EC utilization for the patients enrolled in the care management program. Rationale: We have only just begun to pilo t the role of case manager in our Ambulatory Clinics. Many new providers and mid-levels are being hired into Am bulatory clinics in order to improve access. In order to address the barriers identi fied in the project description, and in order to be successful, stakeholder engagement including leaders and providers and other clinic personnel must be engaged for this model to be successful. A documented plan with timelines and accountability will assist to keep us on course due to day in day out distractions. We will know we are successful when clinic no show rates improve a nd when patients, assigned to a care team, visit the hospital less frequently for their primar y care for conditions better managed in the community. Therefore, it was necessary to select process milestones P-1 and P-2. The improvement targets were chosen based on the ne ed for alignment among all stakeholders and that documentation to validate and ha rdwire agreed upon process steps. Outcome Measure Valuation: Project valuation for an efficient and compre hensive Care Model was rated at the highest valuation level and is defined predominantly th rough cost avoidance. Assuming the patients are receiving, case management support, social serv ices support, and medically appropriate patient education, the result should be a reduction of admissions and readmissions as well as a decrease in EC utilization. Patient and provider satisfact ion will be improved with projected valuation, as well. This project achieves the Waiver goals by a) improving the health care infrastructure to better serve the Medicaid and uninsured resident s of the county; b) further developing and maintaining a coordinated care delivery system; c) contributing to patients' receiving high- quality, patient-centered care in th e most cost-effective way; and serving as a powerful tool to help providers improve outcomes and reduce ED utilization (containi ng cost growth). 1371 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Community Medicine Associates 092414401.3.2 PASS 2 3.IT-2.13 Other Admissions Rate Community Medicine Associates TPI - 092414401 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: : 092414401.2.1 Starting Point/Baseline: To be developed in DY 3 Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 [P-1]: Project planning - engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timelines and document implementation plans.

Frequent and inappropria te use of hospital ERs is extremely costly and care could be provided in a less expensive setti ng. Patients, when possible, s hould be treated by their primary care provider for non-emergency conditions in orde r to promote consistent, quality care. The targeted population will be the Carelink members assigned to University Health System patient centered medical homes. CareLink is a financial assistance program for uni nsured residents of Bexar County. The program was created in 1997 to help address the ne eds of Bexar County residents without health care cove rage who were not eligible fo r Medicaid or other public or private funding. While CareLink is not an in surance product per se , it has many similar advantages in terms of promoting access to preven tive health services, encouraging a long lasting relationship with a primary care pr ovider, and instilling a sense of shared responsibility between member and staff for the member's healt h. As of December 31, 2011, there were 54,256 members enrolled in CareLink. 1374 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Community Medicine Associates Outcome Measure Valuation: This outcome will be valued based on the number of emergency visits avoided by patients with COPD, behavioral health diagnoses, diabetes exacerbations, and asthma. The rationale is implementing the PCMH allows for expanded primary care, better ca re coordination, and improved chronic disease management.

Specifically, Th e AHRQ Survey on Patient Safety Culture (SOPS) (Sorra & Nieva, 2004; Sorra & Dy er, 2011) will be used to gather data on staff opinions about patient safety i ssues, medical error, and event reporting during Year 4 and 5. One of two versions of SOPS w ill be used, depending on the setting. Both measure 12 areas of composites of patient safety culture. The scal es demonstrate high relia bility (Sorra & Dyer, 2010). An advantage of the SOPS is the opportunity it provides for referencing local data to national benchmarks. AHRQ produces a nationa l comparative database report that provides survey results on over 1,000 hea lthcare settings, classified by setting characteristics and respondent characteristics (e.g., work area and staff position). These national data will be used 1377 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA as benchmarks to better evaluate the local results. Outcome Measure Valuation: Because a healthcare setting's cultur e of patient safety is demonstrat ed to be directly related to prevention of healthcare associated harm and re flects higher organizationa l just cultures, teams that hold strong allegiance to hi gh team performance are crucial within the context of the high reliability organization. The proj ect valuation is based on creating a care climate that potentially prevents adverse medical events. The projec t is valued based upon achieving waiver goals, meeting community needs, scope, and investment. 1378 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 085144601.3.1 PASS 1 3.IT4.10 Other Improvement Target (Potentially preventable complications and healthcare acquired conditions) University of Texas Health Scienc e Center at San Antonio TPI - 085144601 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 085144601.1.1 Point/Baseline: TBD in DY3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 P-1.

We will first target individuals with diabetes mellitus who have a mean hemoglobin (Hb) A1C level of >= 7.5% which increases the patients' risk of diabetes complications. Second, we will identify a similar cohort of persons who have sustai ned uncontrolled systol ic hypertension, which is the dominant form of uncontrolled hypertension. Third, we w ill identify persons who have chronic non-cancer pain and are treated with narcot ics long-term since these individua ls are known to be heavy users of emergency and hospital services as well as at risk for overdose events. Finally, we will identify HIV-infected persons in our local HIV clinic who have Ryan White or CareLink insurance because we have found that over 60% are overweight or obese and are still having significant weight gain. Milestones Year 2: P-1 Project Planning-engage stakeholders from study prac tices, administrators from involved health care systems and patients in those practices identify current capacity and needed resources.

But reductions are expected to be greater in Hispanics group because of poorer status at baseline. Year 5: 1380 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA (IT-11.1]: Improvement in clinical indicators of hypertension control, stabilization of BMI of HIV infected patients who are overweight or ob ese, hemoglobin A1C in both Hispanic and non- Hispanic populations but reducti ons are expected to be greate r in the former group because poorer status at baseline. Rationale: Related to Category 3 Outcome Measures, this project will address Outcome Dimension 11: Addressing Health Disparities in Minority Populations, specifica lly Improvement in Clinical Indicators in Latino Populations. The clinical indicators chosen for this project include hypertension control, HbA1c reduction, and HIV care goals of reducing excessi ve weight gain in persons who are overweight or obese. These me asures are a priority for the RHP because research and national surveys conducted by the CDC have shown that low-income, Latino populations are disproportionately affected by poor clinical and functional status reflecting poor achievement of chronic disease management goals and a high prevalence of overweight and obesity. Thus, morbidity and chronic disease management are areas of great concern for providers caring for Latinos. Our population is ov er 60% Latino in our primary care clinics and, in our HIV clinic, Latinos and African-American s represent 77% of our patient population. In terms of hypertension, the goal of this project is to improve the comprehensiveness of our data entry and its accuracy so that valid blood pressure data are recorded for at least 90% of our Latino population. For Latinos with a mean HbA1c over 7.5, efforts to reduce this level to under 7.5 is not only cost-effective bu t and reduces the risk of diab etes complications when <7% according to the ADA. We propose to reduce the mean HbA1c from the current 7.7% in our study practices to 7.3 (5% absolute reduction) by targeting the pe rsons who fail to keep their appointments and who have elevated HbA1c. We will also use our visit arrival status variable to target persons who need additional support. We have found that the average relative reduction in HbA1c for persons with an HbA1c over 8% at base line is -15.9% for pers ons who keep >75% of visits vs. only -9.5% for persons who keep <60% of visits. We will also target minority patients in our HIV clinic to raise cons ciousness about the risks of obesity and offer specific, culturally appropriate support programs to help control we ight gain - both in the practice and in the community (e.g. Weight Watchers). Similarly, we will reduce the propo rtion of Latinos who have uncontrolled hypertension despite thera py by 10% and achieve at least a 3-5 mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure. We will be ab le to achieve these goals by using the registry to define patients who need additional support to achieve goals and to implement evidence-based community health worker (promotora) interven tions to address thes e health risks through promotoras and peer support. In collaboration wi th the patient practices, promotoras and trained peers will provide culturally appropriate outrea ch aimed at reducing disp arities for low-income and Latinos. The use of promotora and peers su pport is particularly effective in minority populations and has been shown to significantly reduce HbA1c, systolic blood pressure, and improve receipt of needed cancer prevention se rvices. For example, to reduce significant disparities in cardiovascular risk, Dr. Turner le d a successful randomized c ontrolled trial of peer support for uncontrolled hypertension in an Afri can-American population that resulted in a reduction in systolic blood pressure that was e qual to adding a new drug (T urner BJ et al. JGIM 2012). As in prior research conducted by Dr. Turn er, we will train a community based providers, promotoras, and peers to support patients to ach ieve their disease goals. These are evidence- based interventions that offer culturally appropr iate outreach aimed at reducing disparities for low-income. Latino patients. The process milestones were chosen as stated above in order to deve lop a strong collaborative 1381 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA team approach between the clinical staff, ad ministrators, stakeholde rs, and participating practices. The first steps in DY 2 will be pr oject planning (P-1) through stakeholders who include community advisory board members, pr oviders from study practices, and Latino patients to review barriers to achieving re ductions in baseline poor contro l of (P-2) of HbA1C, systolic blood pressure and excessive increase in BMI in HIV-infected persons. The procedures for testing data collection will be evaluated using th e Plan Do Study Act (PDSA) cycles (P-4). In DY 3 a similar process will provide for accurate m easurement of baseline status on key clinical variables from which to measure the succe ss of the promotora and peer coach support intervention. In particular, we chose to add Process milestone P-3 --Develop and test data systems -- in order to determine any new systemic changes necessary to obta in needed data that were not available in DY2 especially targeting fa ctors that are important to Latinos. We chose to add (P-5) to disseminate findings, including lessons learned and best practices, to stakeholders in DY 4 and DY 5 to improve the understanding and us e of the registry. To accomplish this we will partner with the federally funded Area Health Education Cent er (AHEC) that has a strong relationship with healthcare providers throughout our regi on as well as key community stakeholders from major or ganizations and businesses. Outcome Measure Valuation: Achieves Waiver Goals: This project will work to reduce well observed disparities that patients from under-represented minorities -- especially t hose on Medicaid, receiving financial assistance for care, or uninsured -have in receiving high qu ality, patient-centered car e that will improve chronic disease care status as well as ultimatel y reduce unnecessary complications that increase hospital and emergency room utilization. Previous research on the effectiveness of patient registries shows that they facili tate identification of at-risk patie nts and, for diabetics, can direct programs to help patients met Hgb A1c control goals and reduce complications as well as costs of care. Dr Turner's previous research has used registries to examine racial disparities in hypertension control and manage ment of hyperlipidemia (Umscheid, Gross, Weiner, Hollenbeak, Tang, Turner, 2010; Turner, Hollenbeak, Weiner, Ten & Roberts, 2009; Turner, Hollenbeak, Weiner & Tang, 2011) Address Community Need(s): This project addresses community priority needs described in the Community Health Improvement Plan for Bexar County for: Healthy Eating and Active Living and Behavioral and Mental Well-Be ing. Priority health issues addr essed by this project include diabetes, obesity, and hypertensi on. Registries are increasingly a dopted nationally to effectively characterize patient health care needs and res pond with appropriate in terventions. Through the diabetes and other registries, we will make this unique resour ce available to providers and patients in order to guide efforts to achieve the goals of the Commun ity Health Improvement Plan for Bexar County. Project Scope: All the proposed database registries will include approximately 10,000 patients and 30 providers. Providers who ar e recruited and trained in usi ng these data will be more empowered to improve patient outcomes by targ eting interventions a nd support to those who need it most. The cost of diabetes is high (as of 2007, $91.8 billion in direct costs and $39.8 billion spent on indirect expenses ) and rising. Previous research es timates costs will be decreased if we are able to decrease hemoglobin A1c (a $2,536 cost differential accrued over 3 years between patients with an A1c of 6% to 7% vers us those 9% to 10% who had diabetes along with comorbid heart disease and hypertension) (Gilmer TP, O'Connor PJ, Rush WA, et al. Predictors of health care costs in adults with diabetes. Diabetes Care .2005;28:59-64). Similar to diabetes, obesity and hypertension also incur increased co sts of care relative to persons without these 1382 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA conditions. However one of the criti cal aspects of both diabetes and obesity are of the fact that it disproportionately affects minorities. In our Texa s region obesity is a major health risk for Latinos and it even affects HIV-in fected Latinos. Our goal in this project is to start to address some of these health disparities that put Latinos increased risk of diabetes complications as well as other ravages of obesity in regard to the degenerative joint diseas e and chronic pain. The proposed registry will allow us to see a decrease in the clin ical indicators of hypertension control, stabilization of BMI of HIV infected patients who ar e overweight or obese, hemoglobin A1C among Hispanics in the registry. Project Investment: The expected investment in this program for Human Resources will include the cost of promotoras , project coordinator, peer co aches and the data mining team. Equipment purchase and maintenance will be co vered by our accompanying project to develop a Health Information Exchange and improved data linkages between the data derived from the Sunrise electronic medical record and UT medicine billing data - making this a relatively cost- effective project. The time to implementation of updated diabetes and HIV registries will be one year which will be used to complete the registry and hire and train staff in use of the registry. Subsequent hypertension registry will be complete d in year 2-3 and staff trained by year 4. We will also develop the database of patients on long-term opioids by the end of year 3. Several organizational priorities will be met by the deve lopment of these longitudinal chronic disease registries but the most important is to insure that we provide comprehensive, value-based care that improves the health of the vulne rable populations that we serve. 1383 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 085144601.3.2 PASS 1 .3 3.IT-11.1 Improvement in clinical indicator in identified disparity group.

The clinical indicators chosen for this project include hypertension control, Hb A1C reduction to go al, and HIV care goals of reducing excessive weight gain in persons who are overweight or obes e. These measures are a priority for the RHP because research and national surveys conducte d by the CDC have shown that low-income, Latino populations are disproportionately affect ed by poor clinical and functional status reflecting poor achievement of chronic diseas e management goals and a high prevalence of overweight and obesity. This pr oject will focus on reducing gaps between Latinos and non- Hispanic whites. For persons with a mean HbA1 c over 7.5, efforts to reduce this level to under 7.5 is not only cost-effective bu t and reduces the risk of diab etes complications when <7% according to the ADA. For example we know that in our two primary car e clinics, 55.7% of Latinos (81.7% of all diabetic patients in these practices) have a HbA1c under 7.5 versus 61.2% of whites (11% of diabetics in practices). Although our African-American di abetic population is much smaller (7.1%), they will also benefit from this intervention because in that group the proportion with an HbA1c under 7.5 is only 50.4%. We propose to reduce the mean HbA1c from the current 7.7% in our study practices to 7.3 (5% absolute reduction) by targeting especially the Latinos persons who fail to keep their appointme nts and who have elevated HbA1c. Currently, we have found that the average relative reduction in HbA1c for persons with an HbA1c over 8% at baseline is -15.9% for persons who keep >75% of visits vs. only -9.5% for persons who keep <60% of visits. Thus, these patien ts are less likely to benefit fr om longitudinal diabetes care. Similarly, we will reduce the proportion of patie nts who have uncontrolled hypertension despite therapy by 10% and achieve at leas t a 3-5 mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure. In regard to obesity in the HIV clinic, the most rapid we ight gain among the persons who are overweight or obese is observed in the minority patients who have either CareLink or Ryan White insurance. We will be able to achieve these goals by usi ng the registry to define patients who need additional support to achieve goals and to implement evidence-based community health worker (promotora) interventions to addr ess these health risks through pr omotoras and peer support. In collaboration with the patient practices, promot oras and trained peers will provide culturally appropriate outreach aimed at re ducing disparities for low-income , Latino patients. To address health disparities, Dr. Turner led a successful randomized controlled trial of peer support for uncontrolled hypertension in a minority population th at resulted in a reduction in systolic blood pressure similar to adding a new drug (Turner BJ et al. JGIM 2012). As in prior research conducted by Dr. Turner, we will train non physician, community based providers and peers to support patients to achieve their disease goals. These are evidence -based interventions that offer culturally appropriate ou treach aimed at reducing disparit ies for low-income and Hispanic patients. In the past decade, diagnosis, management, and control of hypertension (HTN) has improved significantly but several groups continue to lag behind including: persons with diabetes mellitus (DM), non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican-A mericans (Gu, Burt, Dillon & Yoon, 2012). Similarly to hypertension, Hispanics are more likely than the general population to develop diabetes. It is estimated that 2.5 million, or 10.4 percent of Hispanic and Latino Americans aged 20 and older have diabetes. Hispanics also are mo re likely to have undiagnosed diabetes than non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks (N ational Alliance of Hispanic Health, 2010). Unfortunately, minority groups disproportionately bear this dual disease burden. We will also be measuring and addressing the BMI of HIV-inf ected persons who are primarily comprised of 1388 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Hispanics and blacks locally and nationally (Ha ll HI, Song R, Rhodes P, et al., 2008).Weight gain has been identified as a problem for HIV-in fected patients (Torriani, Fitch, Stavrou, et al., 2012) and this registry will allow us to target patients who require additional support to reduce rapid weight gain. The process milestones were chosen as stated above in order to deve lop a strong collaborative team approach between the clinical staff, ad ministrators, stakeholde rs, and participating practices. The first steps in DY 2 will be proj ect planning (P-1) through the use of a community advisory board members who will be referred to as stakeholders, then establishment of baseline rates (P-2) of HbA1C, diastolic blood pre ssure and BMI of HIV-infected persons. The procedures for testing data collection will be evaluated using the Plan Do Study Act (PDSA) cycles (P-4). In DY 3 a similar process will provi de for accurate measurement of baselines from which to measure the success of the promotora intervention. In particular, we chose to add Process milestone P-3 Develop and test data sy stems in order to determine any new systemic changes in data collection that the collaborations may have allowed for that may not have been available in DY2. We chose to add (P-5) Disseminate findings, including lessons learned and best practices, to stakeholde rs in DY 4 and DY 5 to improve on the understanding and use of the registry. Outcome Measure Valuation: Achieves Waiver Goals: This project assures that patients -- especially those on Medicaid or uninsured --will receive high qual ity, patient-centered care with high value services that will reduce use of costly urgent car e services and reduce unnecessary or duplicative tests/services. Previous research on the effectiven ess of patient registries show th at they facilitate identification of at-risk patients and, for diabetics, can direct programs to help patients met Hgb A1c control goals and reduce complications as well as costs of care . Address Community Need(s): This project addresses community priority needs described in the Community Health Improvement Plan for Bexar County for: Healthy Eating and Active Living and Behavioral and Mental Well-Be ing. Priority health issues addr essed by this project include diabetes, obesity and hypertensi on. Registries are increasingly a dopted nationally to effectively characterize patient health care needs and res pond with appropriate in terventions. Through the diabetes and other registries, we will make this unique resour ce available to providers and patients in order to guide efforts to achieve the goals of the Commun ity Health Improvement Plan for Bexar County. Project Scope: The proposed database registries will include approximately 10,000 patients with 30 providers (faculty, residents, a nd medical students). Providers w ho are recruited and trained in using these data will be more empowered to improve patient out comes by targeting interventions and support to those who need it most - especially Latinos. The cost of diabetes is high (as of 2007, $91.8 billion in direct costs and $39.8 billio n spent on indirect expenses) and rising. Previous research estimates costs will be decreased if we are able to decrease hemoglobin A1c (a $2,536 cost differential accrued over 3 years between patients with an A1c of 6% to 7% versus those 9% to 10% who had diabetes along with comorbid heart disease and hypertension) (Gilmer TP, O'Connor PJ, Rush WA, et al., 2005). Similarly to diabetes, obesity and hypertension also have high costs. This proposed registry will a llow us to identify the gap that exists between Hispanics and non-Hispanics in regard to spec ified clinical indicators. We will conduct multivariable analyses examining the association of race-ethnicity with improvement in clinical 1389 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA indicators - systolic blood pressure, HbA1c, and BMI (in HIV-infected persons). Project Investment: The expected investment in this program for Human Resources will include the cost of trainers, promotoras, pr oject coordinator and the data mining team. Equipment purchase and maintenance will be co vered by our accompanying project to develop a Health Information Exchange - making this a relatively cost-effective project. The time to implementation of updated diabetes and HIV registries will be one year which will be used to complete the registry and hire and train staff in use of the registry. Subsequent hypertension registry will be completed in year 2-3 and st aff trained by year 4. Several organizational priorities will be met by the development of thes e longitudinal chronic dis ease registries but the most important is to insure that we provide co mprehensive, value-based care that improves the health of the vulnerable popul ations that we serve. 1390 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 085144601.3.3 PASS 1 .3.3 3.IT-11.2 Improvement in disparate he alth outcomes for target population, including identifica tion of the disparity gap.( Addressing Health Disparities in Minority Populations) University of Texas Health Sc ience Center at San Antonio TPI - 085144601 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 085144601.1.2 Starting Point/Baseline: TBD in DY 2 Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 [P-1] Project Planning-engage stakeholders identify current capacity and needed resources.

DY5 IT-9.2 Decrease the number of emergency room visits per 100,000 indivi duals in San Antonio and South Texas Rationale: We need work to develop strategies that encour age graduates of all of these programs to remain and practice in South Texas. Th is will each program to learn from each challenges and successes of other programs and disciplines. Texas has a serious shortage of primary care providers. Working together should allow us to develop ideas to select train ees that are likely to stay in Texas and to encourage them to stay after training. Other projects within the overall proposal are designed to increase the primary care workforce. There is a natural collaborati on with all venues for increasi ng primary care training, but most specifically with those that increase Family Physic ian training. This will fit very well with the project to start a new Family Medicine residenc y in the McAllen area. We will also be in a position two develop some interdisciplinary trai ning with programs in the area that training Physician assistants and Fa mily Nurse Practitioners. Additionally, we work to develop strategies that encourage graduates of all of these programs to remain and practice in South Texas. This will each program to learn from each challenges and successes of other programs and disciplines. Texas has a serious shortage of primary care providers. Working together should allow us to develop ideas to sele ct trainees that are likely to stay in Texas and to encourage them to stay after training. There are also organizations and training program s training primary care pr oviders that are not part of the DSRIP process (ex. other Family Me dicine residency programs in Texas). We will plan to work with them clos ely on common issues. The Texas Academy of Family Physicians should be able to assist in developing fo rums to work on common problems with these 1393 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA stakeholders. Measurement and tracking of changes will be done through the Annual Review of program effectiveness process. These results are reported to the department chair. The Associate Dean for Graduate Medical Education also receives the results of this pro cess and has additional oversight for the educational processes. There are multiple academic meetings at which the results can be disseminated. The most important would probably be the Texas Family Medicine Leadership Conference, which is sponsored by the Texas Academy of Family Physic ians on a yearly basis. Most family medicine residencies in Texas have representatives at the meeting. Outcome Measure Valuation: Implementation of the Patient Centered Medical Home will require more primary care providers. Family Medicine is that specialty that trains the most physicians who remain in primary care for an extended part of their career. The number of physicians in pr actice is driven almost solely by the number of residency slots and is relatively unrelated to medical school training positions. Size of expansion is based on a realistic assessment of the potential for additional quality training in this medical center. A much greater expans ion is needed based on the future needs of the growing population of South Texas, but any expanded training mu st be high quality training. Additional, patient care will occur in the Fam ily Health Center as part of the residency expansion, but the greater impact will be in th e additional primary care physicians practicing in South Texas. 1394 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 085144601.3.4 PASS 1 3.IT9.2 ED Appropriate Utilization University of Texas Health Sc ience Center at San Antonio TPI - 085144601 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 085144601.1.3 Starting Point/Baseline: TBD IN DY 3 Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 P-1 Develop a plan for the residency expansion Data Source: The generated plan Process Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment $80,290 Process Milestone 3 [P-2] Develop baseline for residency expansion.

Once baseline satisfaction scores are available the outcome improvement target for DY 3-5 will be determined. DY 3 will be devoted to conducting Plan Do Study Act (PDS A) cycles, disseminating findings through learning collaboratives and beginning to demonstrat e improvement in patient satisfaction scores. The focus in DY 4-5 will be continued impr ovement in patient satisfaction scores. Rationale: The RHP 6 needs assessment identif ied access to specialty care as a key health challenge for the region, and continued population grow th is expected to exacerbate this problem in the future. A large academic medical center in the Midwestern US addressed a problem with specialty care access by implementing a web-based referral system , showing that referrals generated through that system were more than twice as likely to le ad to a scheduled visit with a specialty physician (Weiner, M, El Hoyek, G. A web-based generali st-specialist system to improve scheduling of outpatient specialty consultations in an academ ic center. J Gen Intern Med. 2009 Jun;24(6):710- 5). We expect that implementation of a similar web-based referral system (EpicCareLink) at UT Medicine will result in similar outcomes along with an improvement in patient satisfaction related to specialty referrals. The process milestones of project planning, de veloping and testing the EpicCareLink referral portal, and establishing baseline patient sati sfaction scores in DY 2 set the foundation for technical and operational success of the project . In DY 3 PDSA cycles and dissemination of findings to others and gaining knowledge from other groups through learning collaboratives will lead to further refinements in the technical configurat ion of the EpicCareLink referral portal and inform decisions on how to most effectively ope rationalize this technology to improve access to specialty care. We expect to see improvements in the outcome improvement target beginning in DY 3 through DY 5 and beyond.

In DY 3 we will begin to conduct Plan Do Study Act (PDSA) cycles to improve data collection and intervention activities, disseminate our findings to other groups and reduce the percentage of diabetic patients w ith HbA1C > 9.0% by 1% compared to the baseline that will be determined in DY 2. In DY 4 we will reduce the pe rcentage of diabetic patients with HbA1C > 9.0% by another 1%. In DY 5 we will reduce the pe rcentage of diabetic patients with HbA1C > 9.0% by another 1%, resulting in a reducti on of 3% by the end of the waiver. Rationale: We have chosen IT 1.10 Diabetes care: HbA1c poor control (>9.0%) NQF 0059 (Standalone measure) as the Category 3 outcome measure for this project. Diabetes registries have been shown to be an effective tool to help manage und erserved populations with diabetes as evidenced by improvements in A1C values (Seto W, Turner BS, Champagne MT, Liu L. Utilizing a diabetic registry to manage diabetes in a low-income Asian American population. Population Health Management 2012;15:220-229). Sixty pe rcent of the 16,000 deaths in RHP 6 in 2008 were the result of preventable causes includ ing diabetes. According to the RHP 6 Needs Assessment, \"Disease management ...programs are cr itical to reducing morbidity and mortality of these diseases.\" The process milestones of project planning, deve loping and testing the HI E and chronic disease registry, and establishing baseline rates of diabetic patients in the registry with HbA1C > 9% in DY 2 set the foundation for technical and operati onal success of the project. In DY 3 PDSA cycles and dissemination of findi ngs to others and gaining know ledge from other groups through learning collaboratives will lead to further refine ments in the HIE and chronic disease registry and inform decisions on how to most effectively operationalize this technology to improve the health of our underserved population. We exp ect to see improvements in the outcome improvement target beginning in DY 3 through DY 5 and beyond. Outcome Measure Valuation: In 2010 alone Bexar county had 14,769 potentia lly preventable hospitalizations costing approximately $372,000,000 at $25,212 per hospitalizat ion (www.dshs.state.tx.us/ph). Improved chronic disease management will reduce the number of potentially preventable hospitalizations as well as preventable emergency department vi sits. We conservatively anticipate that this project will prevent at least 500 hospitalizations over the four y ear project period resulting in a total savings of $12,606,000.The proj ect valuation section state the project is valued based upon achieving waiver goals, meeting comm unity needs, scope, and investment. 1399 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 085144601.3.6 PASS 1 3.IT1.10 Diabetes care: HbA1c poor control (>9.0%) University of Texas Health Sc ience Center at San Antonio TPI - 085144601 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 085144601.1.5 Starting Point/Baseline: 26% of diabetics with an 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 [P-1]: Project Planning - engage stakeholders, identify needed resources, document implementation plans Data Source: Chronic Disease Management Registry Committee (CDMRC) meeting minutes Process Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $35,684 Process Milestone 2 [P-3]: Develop and test data Data Source: Chronic Disease Management Registry - which will be populated by the HIE Process Milestone 2 Estimated Incentive Payment: $35,684 Process Milestone 3 [P-2]: Establish baseline rates Process Milestone 4 [P-4]: Conduct Plan Do Study Act (PDSA) cycles to improve data collection and intervention activities.

This can be done by assuring that accessible and effective outpatien t programs exist to refer patients to upon discharge from the initial hospital visit and by inte grating our program for seamless continuity of care follow-up for discharged patients. In DY2, three process milestones will begin to establish the STOP program envisioned as the accessible a nd effective outpatient treatment program. The goal of Project Planning (P-1) is to engage Univ ersity Health System st akeholders and hire the program faculty and staff necessary to develop an d establish the STOP pr ogram. Metrics include the recruitment of faculty and hi ring of staff, and the developm ent of program procedures and training plan, and integration of the STOP Program within University Health System Outpatient clinical programs. Success will be demonstrated through the documented achievement of these goals. We also will work with University H ealth System to Establish Baseline Rates (P-2) through data pulled from the EMR to track current rates of 30 day readmissions to the hospital or to the ER. Finally, we will Develop and Test Data Systems (P-3) capable of providing the outcome tracking necessary for the evaluation of program success. With these processes begun in DY2, two processes of DY3 will be devoted to evaluating and refining our program processes. First, we will conduct Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles (P-4) to evalua te our data collection processes for both the perfor mance metrics within the STOP Program and from the hospitalization records of STOP Pr ogram patients. Our goal is to establish and improve the level of STOP Program operational success in treatment and hospital/ER visit pr evention. Finally, it is critical to Disseminate Findings (P-5) to stakeholders and to id entify lessons-learned and best practices to assure success. With STOP Program operations and performance metrics in place, DY3-DY4 will see further expansion of our pa tient care capacity through the addition of community provider trainees and continued prog ram evaluation through PDSA cycle monitoring. Also in DY 4 and continuing through DY5, we can determine and improve upon the achievement of our Outcome Improvement Target to reduc e readmission rates by at least 10% through effective STOP Program involvement. Rationale: Outcome Measure OD-3-IT-3.8 seeks to reduce 30 day readmission rates which for the STOP Program includes both inpatient admissions and ER visits. Readmission is understood to occur when ineffective initial treatment is given or wh en there is lack of e fficacy for the follow-up treatment, or when there is lack of adherence to prescribed eff ective treatments. In the case of substance use disorder (SUD), neither hospitaliz ation nor ER visits alone are considered effective treatment and therefore the critical feature is to have accessible and effective programs for post-discharge aftercare. In adequate outpatient care infrastru cture for adults with moderate behavioral health needs includi ng substance abuse/dependence is well known and was identified in the Section III Needs Assessment Report. Also identified is the known reality that inadequate outpatient care programs result in unnecessary hospitalizations and Emerge ncy Room visits. The STOP Program is designed to provide the outpatien t continuum of care necessary for University 1402 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Health System to provide effective treatmen ts and long-term relapse prevention using the evidence-based medication and non-medication tr eatments required to prevent ER visits and hospitalization. Successful reha bilitation and maintenance of relapse prevention through the STOP Program also will reduce unnecessary Univ ersity Health System service utilization associated with comorbid disease deterioration. Outcome Measure Valuation: SUD is a chronically recurring disorder with a high ri sk of relapse that if le ft untreated, results in progressively more destructive patterns of disability, socioecono mic cost, and medical comorbidity. The STOP Program seeks to redu ce hospital readmission by increasing the access to the continuum and continuity of care requi red to maximize treatment outcome and minimize the chances of full-blown relapse. Prevention of hospital visits for patients with SUD could save $1,000-2,000 per ER visit, $1,000-$3,000 per day of Hosp ital Admission. Of course the costs of trauma care and transplant servi ces and the treatment of infecti ous diseases are much higher and effective outpatient treatment will also reduce th ese adverse outcomes. 3.

DY 5 IT-9.2 Improvement Target: ED appropriate ut ilization; Reduce Asthma ED visits by 20% over year 2 for established patients at the UTNCs who are Medicaid and or indigent. Rationale: In 2012, a survey from The Weather Channel and the Asthma and Allergy Foundation reported that San Antonio's spring allergy was the ninth wors t in the nation, up from number 42 in 2011. Allergies, along with pollu tion, are triggers for asthma. The Me dicaid and indigent populations are most susceptible to these triggers. One contributi ng factor is that the homes they occupy are not up to code for mold prevention; ther efore, many of them live with the allergen triggers not only in the outside air, but in the places they reside. According to the American Academy of Alle rgy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI), for the period 2007-2009 compared with adults, children had higher rates for asthma primary care and emergency department visits, similar hospitalization rates, and lower death rates from 2001 to 2009, health care visits for asthma per 100 persons with asthma declined in primary care settings, while asthma emergency department visit and hospitalization ra tes were stable. For the period 2008-2010, asthma prevalence was higher among children than adults. Th e number of people with asthma continues to grow. One in 12 people (about 25 million, or 8% of the U.S. population) had asthma in 2009, compared with 1 in 14 (about 20 million, or 7%) in 2001. More than half (53%) of people with asthma had an asthma attack in 2008. More chil dren (57%) than adults (51%) had an attack. 185 children and 3,262 adults died from asthma in 2007. As indicated, we will focus on keeping the asthma patients healthy and well-controlled in the primary care setting, thus reducing th e ED visits and hospitalizations. In the baseline year, we will establish the status of our UT NC patients with asthma. Outcome Measure Valuation: Per the AAAAI, asthma cost the US about $3,300 pe r person with asthma each year from 2002 to 2007 in medical expenses, missed school and work days , and early deaths. As thma costs in the US grew from about $53 billion in 2002 to about $56 billi on in 2007. More than half (59%) of children and one-third (33%) of adults who had an asthma a ttack missed school or work because of asthma in 1410 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 2008. On average, in 2008 children missed 4 days of school and adults missed 5 days of work because of asthma. Untreated asthma will lead to more costly respirat ory infections/illnesses, an increase in ED visits and hospitalizations, permanent narrowing of the ai rways, increased use of rescue medications, missed school days and getting behind in school, poor sleep and fatigue symp toms that interfere with play, sports and other activities th at promote health and development. Accessible, cost-effective prim ary care, patient/parent coach ing and education will allow maintenance of asthma care patients. This project will enable the UTNC to reduce ED visits by 10% over the baseline in DY4 and by 20% in DY5. 1411 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 085144601.3.11 PASS 1 3.IT-9.2 ED Appropriate Utilization University of Texas Health Sc ience Center at San Antonio TPI - 085144601 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 085144601.1.9 Starting Point/Baseline: See chart in Cate gory 1 narrative re: increasing encounters, service, providers, days of service.

The member is numerator compliant if the BP is less than 140/90 mm Hg. b Denominator: Patients 18 to 75 years of age as of December 31 of the measurement year with diabetes (type 1 and type 2) c Data Source: EHR, Registry This outcome will be improved by 5% at the end of the waiver. Rationale: Diabetes is one of the most costly and highly prevalent chronic di seases in the United States. Approximately 20.8 million Americans have diabetes, and half these cases are undiagnosed. Complications from th e disease cost the country nearly $100 billion annually. In addition, diabetes accounts for nearly 20 percent of all deat hs in people over 25 years of age. Many complications, such as amputati on, blindness, and kidney failure, can be prevented if detected and addressed in the early stages. Although many people live with diabetes years after diagnosis, it is a costly condition that leads to serious and potentially fatal health complications. Diabetes control can improve the quality of life for millions of Americans and save billions of health care dollars. The known prevalence of diabetes in Bexar County is 10% and more than double for African Americans (14%) and Hispanics (13%) compared to 6% among Non-Hispanic Whites. Hi spanics represent 54% of residents of RHP 6. These estimates do not account for undiagnosed di abetics and pre-diabetics. A highly functional primary care office in addition to increasing access will improve the quality of care for diabetics and hypertensives. The system changes needed to achieve this outcome will benefit both diabetic and hypertensive patient s treated at these clinics with substantial savings preventing major complications fr om both diseases. The process milestones selected are sequential and designed to address what we expect will be the major potential roadblocks to delivering this outcome goal and the practice engagement processes that will allow us to achieve this outcome. The initial project planning (P-1) will include an assessment of tools available for deve loping a registry of di abetics in Epic EHR, hiring a case management register ed nurse for care management, and implementation of capture of data to populate diabetes re gistry. The second process milest one (P-2) establishing baseline rates will occur during DY2. The third process milestone (P-3) developi ng and testing data systems will occur during DY3, at the same time PDSA cycles will be implemented in each of the clinics (P-4) to implemented and test different interventions that will improve data collection and improve expected outcome measure. 1413 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Outcome Measure Valuation: The project is valued based upon achieving waiver goals, meeting community needs, scope, and investment. Achieves waiver goals (score 5): The project directly addresses wa iver goals, with its objectives to assure that patients receive high-quality a nd patient-centered care in the most cost effective ways; improves health care infrastructure by expanding primary care and behavioral health access care access; further develops and maintain s a coordinated care delivery system; and improves outcomes while containing cost growth by avoiding expensive emergency department visits and improving preventive and chronic disease care. Addresses community needs (score 5): The project directly addresses multiple community needs including the recruitment and re tention of a primary care workforce and thus addressing the shortage and access to primary care; addresses the need to have in tegrated behavioral health and primary care services; and directly addresses car diovascular disease, cancer and diabetes, three of the top causes of death in the region Project Scope - (score 5) - By the end of this project, the region will have 10 additional primary care and behavioral health clinic ians practicing in the community. The primary care capacity of UT Medicine will be increased by 25% to al most 50,000 unduplicated patients in all primary care clinics from a baseline of 39,818. A recently pub lished article in Health Affairs provides us with an estimate of savings (Z. Song, D. G. Safran, B. E. Landon et al., \"The 'Alternative Quality Contract,' Based on a Global Budget, Lowered Medical Spending and Improved Quality,\" Health Affairs Web First, publishe d online July 11, 2012.) Properly implemented changes similar to those proposed here provi de savings as high as $22.58 per member per quarter. At the end of the project we expect to be caring for a panel of 9600 pa tients. At this rate the value in savings to the system could be as high as $867,072 at the final year in savings to the region. Project Investment - (score 5) - The expected capital investment in human resources, lease, equipment, medical supplies, IT infrastructure and support, and time to implement is relatively large. The sustainability of th e project is risky in that it requ ires a significant change in the payment structure for primary care from a fe e-for-service only to a medical home blended payment similar to those implemented in other states. 1414 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 085144601.3.13 PASS Diabetes care: BP contro l (<140/80mm Hg) NQF 0061 (Standalone measure) University of Texas Health Sc ience Center at San Antonio TPI - 085144601 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 085144601.1.11 Starting Point/Baseline: TBD in DY 2 Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 [P1]: The initial Project Planning (P-1) will include an assessment of tools available for developing a registry of diabetics in Epic EHR, hiring a case management registered nurse for care management, and implementation of capture of data to populate diabetes registry.

Rationale: We have selected IT-7.10. Other Outcome Improve ment Target: Proportion of children and adults with urgent dental care needs (Stand alone measure) a Numerator: Total number of patients s een by a new dental emergency clinic b Denominator: Total Number of children and ad ults with urgent dental pain care needs c Data Source: EHR, Claims d Rationale/Evidence: patients are le ss likely to suffer from more seve re, urgent oral health problems with adequate and regular access to dental care This outcome should be a priority for the RHP since it directly addre sses a community need for emergency/urgent dental care. Data are de scribed in the \"Starting Point/Baseline\" section, above. The proposed Category 1 project will help achieve this Category 3 outcome measure by providing emergency/urgent dental care to children and adult (i ncluding geriatric) patients. Thus, each patient treated contributes directly to the numerator for this Outcome Measure. As described in the Category 1 template, our web-based survey indicates that low -income populations with moderate/severe hea lth disparities comprise the majo rity of subjects contacting the UTHSCSA Dental Clinic with requ ests for access to emergency/urgent dental care. As of July 12, 2012, a total of 32,824 records have b een entered by prospective patien ts. An analysis of this database indicates that there is a large unmet need for treating oral emergencies. Nearly 55% of the 32,824 records included patients who en tered at least one of the follo wing keywords indicative of a milestones a nd metrics as well as outcome improvement targets selected for this project are specifically designed to achieve designated outcomes to enhance dental care access for patients needing urgent care. Two major conclusions emerge from this analysis. First, the UT HSCSA Dental School has a large catchment zone that includes broad representati on across our community. However, the second finding is even more significant. The zip codes most frequently used by prospective emergency dental patients are highly linked to elevated scores on the Commun ity Needs Index (CNI; see Fig 1 - Category I template). The CNI identifies the severity of health disparity fo r every zip code in the United States (5,6). It is a composite measure of income barriers, culture/language barriers, education barriers, insurance ba rriers and housing barriers. The CNI ranges from 1 (lowest socioeconomic barriers) to 5 (highe st socio-economic barriers). Th ere is >95% correlation between CNI scores and hospitalization rates, with admi ssion rates for communities with CNI scores of 5 being ~60% greater than ra tes observed in communities with CNI scores of 1 (5). Importantly, the 1417 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA mean CNI score for the top 20 zip codes in our databa se is 3.7. This analysis clearly demonstrates that there is strong need for an emergency dental clinic at UTHSCS A and that such a clinic will directly address populations with su bstantial health disparities.

Outcome Measure Valuation: Achieves Waiver Goals (Self-Scor e =5): This project will devel op a new dental care clinic for treating emergency/urgent care pati ents (process milestone) and provi des new training and rotations for dental students and residents (process milestone). A recent study indicates that the cost of treating dental emergency patients in a dent al clinic is about 10% of the cost of treatment provided in the ER (Graham et al., Ped Dent 22:134-140, 2000). Thus , this project addresses the Triple Aim by providing high quality and patient ce ntered care in a cost effective manner (improvement outcome). Addresses Community Needs (Self-Score =5): An analysis of web-based contacts to the UTHSCSA Dental School by potential patien ts indicates that nearly 55% of the 32,824 patient contacts to the UTHSCSA Dental School re quested emergency/ urgent care treatment. Proj ect Scope (Self-Score = 4): This project scope is large in impact from four perspectives. First, it provides a new dental care clinic that does not currently exist (improvement outcome). Second, it will employ expanded hours to increase patient visits/encounters (improvement outcome). Third, it will involve training of both dental students and residents to treat these populations increasing the number of recruited/trained practitioners for the population liv ing in the borders of RHP 6. (process milestone/improvement outcome) Fourth, it will provide savings from avoi ding unnecessary ER visits. (improvement outcome). Project Investment (Self-Score = 5): This project involves human resources (faculty, staff, dental students, residents), new clinic space, new equipment and time to implement with an overall plan that integrates improvement and process to achieve the milestones. 1418 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 085144601.3.14 PASS 1 3.IT7.10 Other Outcome Improvement Target: University of Texas Health Scienc e Center at San Antonio TPI - 085144601 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 085144601.1.12 Starting Point/Baseline: To be determined in DY2 Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 (P-1] Project Planning-engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timelines and document implementation plans.

(Proposed Standalone measure) Unique RHP ID: 085144601.3.15 - PASS 1 Performing Provider: University of Texas h ealth Science Center at San Antonio; TPI: 085144601 Outcome Measure Description: The Dental EHR will serve as a data source to measure milestones for the project. The system contains patient record information, clinic schedu les, transactional history for both patients and providers, billing information, consent forms and clin ical notes. Dental School faculty and staff in the office of Patient Care/Information techno logy will be responsible for the implementation of the project and for the traini ng of all the Dental School workfo rce providers involved in the delivery of patient care in the va rious general and specia lty clinics. At the e nd of the project, we expect to achieve a 10% increase in the number of specialized data elements, queries, and reports that will be used in the Quality Improvement pro cesses for patients treated in the DS and off-site clinics. PROCESS MILESTONES DY 2 AND DY 3: P-1 Project Planning-engage st akeholders identify current capacity and needed resources. P-2 Establish baseline rates P-3 Develop and test data P-4 Conduct plan, do Study Acts (PDSA) cycles to improve data collection & intervention activities P-5 Disseminate findings, incl uding lessons learned and best practices, to stakeholders P-7 Other activities described below: Process milestones are essential to the planni ng process and to enab le us to establish parameters and protocols essentia l to assessing clinical qualit y outcomes, patient safety and treatment effectiveness. Patient satisfaction surveys will assist in measuring timeliness, appropriateness and satisfaction w ith care and care experience. Re ference to P-1: a clinical informatics curriculum will be established in or der to train and calibrate all providers and staff on the use of Certified Electronic Reco rd. Treatment outcomes assessments that are based on standards of care will be perfor med on patients of the dental school and the aggregate data analysis will identify needs fo r improvement based on established targets. The category 3 Outcome target relates to the im plementation of the certified electronic record training of all faculty, students and staff involved in patient car e throughout all of the Dental School general and specialty clin ics, including outreach facili ties using the same clinic information system and analysis of patient data to support clinical qualit y measures. Each year, we will have a new cohort of students, including general and specialty residents as well as new faculty or staff who will require training. This information will enable us to make necessary changes to improve oral health quality and achie ve efficiency in the system. Our benchmark for compliance will be 85% after year 3 implementa tion with goal of 95-100% compliance in year 4. This will enable us to share st andardized data with other US dental schools using certified systems. 1420 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Rationale: We have selected IT-7.10. Other Outcome Improvement Target: In order to evaluate treatment outcomes, a comprehensive EHR with speciali zed designated data el ements need to be implemented. Software (acquired via EHR Incen tive Program) that has Core CMS quality measures that support meaningful use of HIT, hardware, network systems and workforce IT training along with the ability to add custom ized data elements, helps to provide the infrastructure (human and technological re sources) necessary for patient care quality improvement. This can be used to compare agai nst benchmarks and to indicate that standards have been met to attain quality improvement. a Numerator: Number of DS facu lty, students, residents and staff trained in use of Certified EHR b Denominator: Total number of faculty, students, residents and staff involved in patient care delivery at the Dental School and Off-campus sites c Data Source: Training logs/s chedules; training materials Rationale/Evidence: The ability to impact the ef fectiveness, timeliness and appropriateness of care within the UTHSCSA dental school and it s' off-campus sites which serve the general population of the Region, including low-income popul ations and have the capacity to share this information with other providers of health care services and dental edu cators is critical to maintaining the quality of dental educa tional institutions. (Fontaine et al). Outcome Measure Valuation: Outcome Measure (proposed): Enhance quality asse ssment of dental care via use of information technology. This project is intended to provide the in formation infrastructure needed to assess patient care and ensure that patients treated at the Dental School and off- site clinics receive high quality, patient-centered dental car e in a cost effective and effici ent manner; and that the dental care is coordinated and that better dental care outcomes are attained for all dental school patients, including the uninsured, Medicaid and CHIP as we ll as Title V and special needs patients. The DS will implement and train the dental school f aculty, staff, dental/dental hygiene students and residents in the use of the certifi ed electronic record with the CM S quality core measures added. Through this project, we will track dental treatmen t outcomes, cost savings, efficiency of dental care delivery and referral systems within dental school to specialty departments, reduction in dental errors/prosthetic replacements, measure student performance, provide broad array of clinical experiences required to train dentists, dental hygienists, and dental specialists to be competent practitioners, and iden tify gaps in training needs. Achieves Waiver goals: this project focuses on assuring that patients receive high-quality care through monitoring treatment via use of the certifi ed electronic health record. It improves the oral health care infrastructure to better serve all patients, including Medi caid patients and will enable the DS to further develop and maintain an internal coordinated care delivery system. The implementation of this project is expected to im prove oral health outcomes while containing cost and minimizing unneeded treatment. This project will also impact the DS urgent care clinic, facilitating reporting and standardization and imp acts all patients treated by the DS. The evidence supports implementation of the Certif ied EHR addresses Community Needs: this project supports all of the DS treatment programs and is exp ected to provide real-time evidence regarding treatment outcomes for patients, incl uding the underserved and uninsured, many of whom seek treatment in the DS. Project Scope: Patient visits/encounters will be tracked for all patients along with clinical core measures, providers will be tr ained and savings are anticipated due to better coordination of comprehensive dental care. Project Investment: this project involves 1421 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA human resources (faculty, staff, dental students , residents), new clinic facility, new equipment and time to implement with an overall plan that integrates improvement and process to achieve the milestones. 1422 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 085144601.3.15 PASS 1 3.IT7.10 Other Outcome Improvement Target The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio TPI - 085144601 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 085144601.1.13 Starting Point/Baseline: TBD in DY 2 Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 [P-1]: Project planning - engage stakeholders, identify current capacity and needed resources, determine timelines and document implementation plans.

We estimate that our target populations will have 80-120 such preventabl e admissions a year; we seek to reduce this by 20%. Decrease in hospitalization will be the out come measure in years 4 and 5. This estimate is based on our clinical experience that half of these hospitalizations are related to acute crisis/lack of access to outpatient care and coul d be avoided with through PROXIMA. The other half of hospitalizations are due to severe me ntal illness and require inpatient stabilization. Rationale: Psychiatric hospitalizations of children with ADHD and complex comorbidities (aggression, mood disorder) have risen dramatically in Texas. These admissions occur in crisis and rarely result in long term outpatient care to consolid ate any gains. Thus, th ere is often little long term benefit despite high costs. (We seek to reduce psychiatric hospital admission by 50% over baseline rates). PROXIMA will seek to reduce potentially pr eventable admissions (PPA, OD-2) through provision of integrated mental/ physical health services. Impr oved outcome for children with ADHD with integrated care has been shown by numerous studies (http://www.skipproject.org/ ) Process Milestones for Outcome: Milestone 1 will be to engage stakeholders (pediatricians, community) to ensure PROXIMA program meets the challenges these families present. Milestone 2 will establish the baseline rate of psychiatric hospitalization. This is a customized milestone critical to accurate assessment of our Improvement Target. Milestone 3 will be to test data collection procedures, while Milestone 4 will be to conduct Plan Do Study Act (PDSA) . We choose reduced hos pitalization as our Improvement Target due to the high cost of hospitalizati on and the lack of evidence that acute hospitalization improves long term functioning..

Process milestones and PDSA cycles monthly will focus on steps needed in preventing readmissions to hospital for behavioral health reasons. Improvement Goal is Behavioral Health readmi ssion rate. Our goal is to reduce the readmission rate by 20% by year 3 an d 30% in year 4. Rationale: With respect to our process milestones, we have selected a planning phase to identify the current capacity of the TCC and determine the needs for training and clinical car e based upon input from the community. We are in constant contact with hospitals to improve communication and services. We will also work to establish baseline rates based upon da ta from participating hospitals regarding readmission rates within 30 days. This will require collecting and merging data from a variety of sources to ensure that appropriate cases are counted. We will develop and test data systems to support our analysis of outcomes. We work closely with our data management staff to ensure that HIPPA compliant data systems can generate needed reports. Finally, we have extensive expe rience using PDSA to improve treatment delivery and patient outcomes in community mental health for SMI. We have been able to use this approach in numerous ways to improve outcomes (e.g. ensu ring providers follow guidelines for monitoring metabolic syndrome in community mental health ). With respect to outcome improvement targets, re-hospitalization was selected becau se hospitalization is the single most costly intervention for individuals with behavioral health diagnoses and preventing readmission and ED diversions is a primary goal of the community. The TCC will achieve this goal by providing rapid access to care and multiple ebps includ ing medication management, Cognitive Adaptation Training, Cognitive Behavior Therapy, and Case coordination. Our own published research demonstrates a reduction of up to 45% in 9 mont h readmission rates for individuals in wrap- around care versus standard care. While the TCC focuses on only the 3 months post-hospital period, this is the most critical period with continuing care provid ed by connecting individuals to existing community services. Reductions of 20% and 30% in DY4 and DY5 are based on the shorter length of time we will have working with these individuals versus our published reports. Focusing on preventing readmission will allow rapid and evidence-based treatment in the community where individuals have maximal i ndependence and costs of care are lower. Outcome Measure Valuation: Rehospitalization and emergency room revisit ra tes from Major Hinchman 2010 study yield the cost lack of care coordination between inpatient/ED and outpatient settings as well as of the delay in accessing care. We also used demonstrat ed savings from our pilot program for Superior Medicaid of $20,000/patient in hospital costs per year. The PDSA, includes collection of data from various hospitals and emergency department s as well as maintaining a data base and documenting the quality improvement process. 1430 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 085144601.3.20 PASS 1 3.IT3.8 Behavioral Health /Substance Abuse 30 day readmission rate The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio TPI - 085144601 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 085144601.2.3 Starting Point/Baseline: TBD in DY 2 Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 [P-1 Project Planning]: [Engage stakeholders identify current capacity and needed resources determine timelines and document implementation plans] Data Source: meeting minutes, completed assessment, form versions, updates to shared drive, monthly progress reports Process Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $53,527 Process Milestone 2 [P-2]: [Establish baseline rates] Data Source: Department annual report on hospitalizations, data from local hospitals, training records) Process Milestone 2 Estimated Incentive Payment : $53,527 Process Milestone 3 [P-3]: [Test data systems] Data Source: data system, outputs and reports Process Milestone 3 Estimated Incentive Payment $124,088 Process Milestone 4 [P-4]: [Conduct PDSA cycles to improve data collection and intervention activities] Data Source: form versions, updates to shared drive, monthly reports Process Milestone 4 Estimated Incentive Payment $124,088 Outcome Improvement Target 1 [IT-3.8]: Behavioral Health Admission rate.

Milestone P-3 will reflect our development of a comprehensive care management program for diabetes and hypert ension based on principles of the CCM. The milestone will be implemented by a practice impr ovement team meeting weekly. The team will include physicians, nurses, medical assistants, pharmacists, social work, and a practice facilitator with experience in practice change towards CCM . The team will assemble and adapt evidence- based protocols from the literat ure on CCM implementations in primary care. As the evidence- based protocols are assembled, we will train the relevant staff (Milestone P-2) in the CCM. We will also be working with our health system to create EHR reports tracking HbA1c levels and blood pressure readings for patients with diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Milestones P-2 and P-3 will establish baseline ra tes for the diabetes improvement milestone and develop and test data systems fo r creating a valid patient cohort based on the outcome measures and for reporting diabetes outcomes for these patients. DY3 The process milestones for this year will add CCM components to increase the comprehensiveness of our approach. These in clude P-1 Document Implementation Plans: Develop and implement a plan to help patients self-manage their chronic conditions. DY3 also includes our improvement Milestone I-17 in wh ich we identify our first cohort of 200 patients with poorly controlled diabetes fo r inclusion in our disease regi stry and CCM interventions as determined by the planning process. As program implementation begins, we will also implement PDSA cycles testing iterative sma ll improvements in our intervention. DY4 Milestones for this year include scaling up pr ocess and improvement milestones from DY3, so that more patients are included in the CCM regist ry and intervention, more participate in self- management and more participate in group visi ts. In addition, in DY4 we will introduce our Category 3 milestones: IT 1.10 Diabetes care,: HbA1c poor control. We have determined the baseline rate for HbA1c>9% to be 25% in our popul ation. Our goal for this milestone is to reduce it to 22.55 in DY4. We will continue to increase the numbers of patie nts participating in the intervention and to further decrease the prevalence of HbA1c >9%. The goal for HbA1c >9% is less than 17.5% absolu te prevalence among patients with diabetes in the CCM program. Rationale: The process milestones were selected to create a logical flow from planning, to developing an overall CCM approach, to developing specific el ements supporting the CCM (Hroscikoski et al, Ann Fam Med 2006;4:317). The selected Catego ry 3 outcome measure is IT 1.10 HbA1c poor control (>9%). We chose this measure because our system-wide assessments reveal that the 1432 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA prevalence of poor control is hi gh in our population. Although not all interventions based on the chronic care model are successful (e.g. Landon et al, NEJM 2007:356) a recent review concludes that the CCM has, overall, helped guide su ccessful interventions and improved outcomes (Coleman et al, Health Affairs 2009:75.) In our low-income population with poor health care access, we anticipate that improved connections to effective care and self-management support will decrease the proportion of patients with poorly controlled diabetes (Liebman et al, Diab Educ 2007;33:132S). Although HbA1c is an intermediate outcome rather than a direct measure of morbidity/mortality, it is very strongly associated with the latter (Wei et al, Diab Care 119;21:1167) and reductions in HbA1c reduce macrovascular and microvascular complications although data demonstrate that overly intensive treatment of glycemic levels is a ssociated with increased risk (Kelly et al, Ann Intern Med. 2009;151:394-403). Outcome Measure Valuation: The outcome selected (glycemic control for patients at highest levels of HbA1c) has strong evidence tying it to reduced compli cations, improved quality of life, and lower health care costs. The intervention framework and interventions have also been extensively studied and applied in the target population, with evidence of benefit fo r the Category 3 outcomes. For example, the short-term health care savings from lowering Hb A1c values higher than 9-10% is approximately $1500 per patient, based on the literature cited ab ove. This does not account for reducing the longer-term prevention of complications. 1433 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 085144601.3.21 PASS 1 22 3.IT-1.10 Diabetes care: HbA1c poor control (>9.0%) University of Texas Health Scie nce Center at San Antonio TPI-085144601 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 085144601.2.4 Starting Point/Baseline: Baseline level: 25% of patients with diabetes have HbA1c above 9%; BP baseline TBD Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 P-1 - Project Planning: Document implementation plans: Develop a comprehensive care management program Metric 1 : Documentation of a care management program based on Wagner's Chronic Care Model Baseline/Goal: Baseline of no plan documented to goal of approved care management plan Data Source: Program Materials including approved care management plan.

DY2 P-1: Project planning - engage stakeholders, id entify current capacity and needed resources, determine timelines and document implementa tion plans. Here we begin by establishing criteria for selecting patients for CHW services. We also develop work routines for collaboration of CHWs and members of the health care team : meeting frequency, attendance, appropriate modes of communication through voice, email, text, and EH R, and record keeping. The metric for P-1 is written documentation for the planning and pr otocols described. DY3 P-4 Conduct PDSA cycles. In this year, as CHW begin work with our pa tient panel we will hold weekly meetings of CHWs and clinical staff to review successes, stumbling blocks, and needed additional supports. Using PDSA methodology, we will iteratively frame small tests of improvement and evaluate the results. The metric for P-4 is meeting records and summaries of improvement projects. P-3 Develop and test data systems. We will work with our health system IT personnel to develop routine monthly reports on patients with diabetes from our panel th at will capture HbA1c levels, ambulatory visits (to identify pati ents not having regular visits), ED visits (to identify patients with critical disconnects from care), and hos pital admissions (to identify patients with complications). The metric for P-3 will be monthly data reports from the patient panel of glycosylated hemoglobin levels, patients exceeding the thresh old of 9%, and patients in the cohort working with CHWs who have ED visits or admissions. DY4 P-4 Conduct PDSA cycles. In this year, as CHW begin work with our pa tient panel we will hold weekly meetings of CHWs and clinical staff to review successes, stumbling blocks, and needed additional supports.

Metric 1 % of practice patients age 18-75 with mellitus with patients with poor control of HbA1c. 1437 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Metric 1 % of practice patients age 18-75 w ith diabetes mellitus with Data Source: EHR data. Rationale: Our Category 3 improvement target and valuation is based on the following considerations: there is strong evidence that moving patients from poor to fair or good glycemic control (a) reduces diabetes complications such as coronary dise ase, stroke, and renal failure; (b) decreases hospitalizations, and health care costs, and (c) improves patients' quality of life. This evidence is briefly summarized and quantified below. In recent years, data from UKPD S and other studies have led to a reconsideration of the utility and safety of aggressive glucose ta rgets in type 2 diabetes. Our goal in this project is therefore to reduce the prevalence of markedly abnormal glycemic control, wh ich we define as HBA1c >9%. Ample evidence documents the micro- and macro-vascular morbidity associated with uncontrolled diabetes. For example, persons with diabetes in a community-based cohort study (Atherosclerotic Risk in Comm unities) in the highest HbA1c quintile (A1c>8.2%) had a 2.8 fold increased risk of coronary heart disease events (on a baseline of 14.4%) compared with those in the lowest quintile (Selvin et al, Arch Int Med 2005). In a secondary analysis of data from the HOPE study, a randomized drug trial, a 1% rise in the HbA1c level was associated with a 7% increase in the risk of cardiovascular events, a 20% increase in the risk of hospitalization for heart failure, a 12% increase in total mortal ity risk, and a 26% increase in risk of overt nephropathy. Risks increased nonlinearly, with steep er increases in patients in the top 2 deciles of A1c (A1c >8.9%)(Gerstein, Diabetologia 2005 ). An observational Fallon Clinic showed poor glycemic control (A1c >10%) was associated with a high risk of hospitalization -- 31 per 100 per year, twice that of patients with fa ir control (A1c 8-10%). Mean adjusted hospital charges were also twi ce as high ($3040 vs. $1380/year; in 1998 dollars) (Menzin et al, Diabetes Care 2001). A larger follow-up study from 2010 in the same system confirmed the findings: annual costs for diab etes-related hospitaliza exceeded 10% (Menzin et al, J Managed Care Pharm 2010). And the Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound, found that reductions in HbA1c from a mean of 10% were associated with annual savings of $680-950 (in 1997 dollars). (Wagner et al, JAMA 2001). Improved glycemic control also improves quality of life. A randomized trial of intensified glycemic control (from mean Hb A1c of 9.3% to 7.5%) examining patients' functional outcomes, such as quality of life, work participation, bed- days, and restricted activ ity days, demonstrated substantial improvements in a wide range of QOL and activity measures (Testa, JAMA 2008). The evidence base supporting this CHW in tervention derives from a variety of CCM interventions that are being ad apted for low-income populations (e.g. Epping-Jordan et al, Qual Saf Health Care 2004;13:299-305; Lo rig et al, Nurs Res 2003;52:361) . In many of these models, CHWs collaborate closely with nurse care managers to deliver assessment and education in the home setting when patients have barriers limiting travel to the health center. In this project the CHW role encompasses 3 mo dels of care defined in the Community Health 1438 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Worker National Workforce Study (HRSA 2007): memb er of care delivery team, navigator, and organizer. These models, which the report noted we re not mutually exclusiv e, consist of working under the direction of clinicians (physicians or nu rses), helping patients navigate complex health systems, and working in communities to pr omote self-directed change and community development (HRSA 2007). The process milestones for CHW's unique patients served were estimated at follows. Our CHW model calls for assessments and teaching in th e patients' homes so as to provide data on contextual influences such as neighborhood sett ing for diet and physical activity, or family situations that interfere with self-management. We therefore estimate CHW's will make 8 visits per week x 50 wks or 400 visits per year per FTE. Conservatively estimating 5 visits per year per unique patient to allow for both assessment and self-management training, each CHW FTE will manage 80 unique patients per year. We allow for 50% capacity in the first year after hire. With 3 CHW hired in year 1 and 3 a dditional CHW hired in year 2, the target numbers for unique patients served in DY3/4 /5 are thus 180/540/720. Outcome Measure Valuation: The outcome selected (glycemic control for patients at highest levels of HbA1c) has strong evidence tying it to reduced compli cations, improved quality of life, and lower health care costs. Please see \"Rationale\" immediately above for details. The intervention mechanism has also been extensively studied and applied in the target popul ation, with evidence of benefit for the Category 3 outcome. For example, the short-te rm health care savings from lowering HbA1c values higher than 9-10% is approximately $1500 per patient, based on the li terature cited above. This does not account for re ducing the longer-term prev ention of complications. 1439 RHP UTHSCSA 085144601.3.22 PASS 1 3.IT-1.10 Diabetes care: HbA1c poor control (>9.0%] University of Texas Health Sc ience Center at San Antonio TPI - 085144601 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 085144601.2.5 Starting Point/Baseline: Baseline level: 25% of patients have HbA1c above 9%; Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 P-1 Project planning - document implementation plans: Establis hing criteria for CHW services.

In short, our goal is to help them increase a ll communication-related activities (World Health Organization). To assess the bene fit derived from amplification and the resultant reduction in hearing handicap and improved life quality, we will administer three brief questionnaires, prior to intervention (at the time of initial assessment) and following intervention (30 -45 days after the initial fitting of amplifi cation and initial communication c ounseling). Three standardized self-assessment measures will be used: The Client Oriented Scale of Improvement (COSI); The 10 item Hearing Handicap Inventory for the El derly Screening Version (HHIE),( Ventry & Weinstein, 1982) which assess both the social and emotional impact of hearing loss on the individual, and the 15 item Satis faction with Amplification in Daily Life scale (SADL) (Cox and Alexander, 1999), which assess positive effect co mprised of decreased co mmunication disability, improved self-confidence, improved sound quality, and overall assessment of worth; service and cost, comprising reliability , clinician competen ce, and cost; negative features comprised of reaction to background sounds, feedback, and the hearing aid's usefulne ss on the telephone; and personal image, comprised of appearance and th e apparent reaction of others. Pre and post measures will be taken to assess reduction in hearing handicap and increase in communication ability and overall satisfaction a nd improvement in life quality. 80-85 % of patients served with hearing aids and support services through the Drop In Hearing C linic will report improvement in quality of life/hearing handicap reduction scores as measured via the standardized HHIE and the SADL self-assessment inventories. Rationale: At the current time a significant ba rrier to access to hearing health care is lack of proximity of care, inappropriate level of care (e ntering the hearing health care syst em at a more costly level of triage/care, and cost), and high cost of care. This project addresses these current barriers. Appropriate intervention for hearing loss and me dical ear problems will both improve health status through primary preventi on, appropriate identification of and referral for intervention for ear disease, as well as reduction of the impact of heari ng loss, on the ability of individuals in this group to achieve communication independence and more fully function in society. In short; to more effectively claim their unalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 1442 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA Outcome Measure Valuation: The value of this project is in its creation of a new model for hearing health care delivery that incorporates both new and existing personnel and ne w and existing health care facilities in multi- level hearing health care assessment/treatment m odel designed to address the gross disparity in percentage of adults with heari ng loss receiving heari ng health care services versus all who need those services. Consistent with the defi nition of health care \"valu e\" as health outcomes per dollar spent, it is designed to provide more convenient patient access to lower cost effective hearing health care resulting in improved hearing/communicati on ability for an increased percentage of those who need effective hearing health care. The model acknowledges that a significant percentage of this population has se nsorineural hearing loss that is essentially bilaterally symmetrical, often noise-induced, with no other medi cally-related hearing/balance complications and who primarily need asse ssment of their hear ing and appropriate fitting/adjustment of digital signal processing hearing aid technology delivered and supported as close to their neighborhood as possible. A sma ller percentage of the adult hard of hearing population needs more extensive audiology and medical services. They are in need of triage from the Drop-In Hearing Clinic with referral to the next level of audiology/medi cal care. A goal of this project is to demonstrate an approach to the \"right care, each time for each patient\" for individuals entering the hearing health care sy stem with the ultimate goal of improving the quality of life for each patient served through appropriate intervention and ultimately hearing handicap reduction. This triage and referral pr ocess would be accomplished through the Drop-In Hearing Clinic access point staffed by remote co mmunity audiologists participating in the Drop- In Hearing Clinic Network, working in conj unction with onsite Te leaudiology Clinical Technician students whom they supervise. Next-l evel referrals would be facilitated to network audiology/ENT providers who the patients identify as located conveniently to them and/or who has the most immediate ability to schedule a next -level hearing health care appointment for the patient. This would enable the patient to begin th e referral relationship facilitated at the Drop-In Hearing Clinic site. The scope of this pilot project is limited to 1 site: UTHSCSA Student/Employee Health Clinic with audiology faculty and thei r Au.D. students providing the re mote audiology services from the UTHSCSA MARC, University Health Sy stems Audiology Department; or UT-Austin Department of Communication Sciences and Diso rders Audiology Clinic in conjunction with TCT course students from the UTHSCSA School of Nursing or other professional degree programs. This scope is designe d to bring hearing health care services to UTHSCSA students and employees and their families at a central campus location. Project outcomes for providers include: Up to 15 joint UT-Austin/UTHSCSA Do ctor of Audiology students will complete clinical rotations among the CECS D hearing/balance consortium partners in the San Antonio region including delivery of audiology servic es under faculty 15 to30 UTHSCSA nursing or other professional degr ee (e.g. PA) students will complete the Teleaudiology Clinical Course and engage in teleaudiology clinical service delivery under supervision in the Drop-In Hear ing Clinic. Project out comes for patients: 700 adult patients will be served at the Drop In Hear ing Clinic locations and either provided with high performance mini-BTE hearing aids or appropriately referred to the next level of hearing health care. 1443 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 085144601.3.23 PASS 2 3.IT-10.1 Quality of Life University of Texas Health Sc ience Center at San Antonio TPI - 085144601 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: : 085144601.1.15 Starting Point/Baseline: Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Milestone 1 P-1: Project planning: Providers will engage the stakeholders : a.

To achieve continuous quality improvement we shall assess the projects impact and make adjustments as necessary, share best practice a nd lessons learned, seize scaling opportunities to expand successful outcomes to broader populations, and rapidly disseminate successful outcomes to other providers across Texas. Rationale: Cancer is a leading public health issue in Texas (It is the number one cause of death for children in Texas age 1-14, and the leading cause of death for people in Texas age 85 or younger). In the absence of effective communication, pr oviders of cancer-care are forced to refer patients to tertiary care centers, and the patients and public are forced to travel enormous di stances to tertiary-care cancer centers at significant cost to their quali ty of life and financial health. Communication methods like telemedicine can improve cancer healthcare by enhancing cancer-related decision- making and motivate action to improve the quality of cancer care in underserved areas. The CTRC is committed to enhancing Cancer-Telemedicine to communities in underserved areas of South Texas by expanding use of telehealth to provide expert multidisciplinary cancer conferences and Tumor Boards to improve access to evidence-bas ed cancer decision-making across the disease spectrum from prevention to survivorship and end of life care. Increase the percent of providers in underserved areas of South Texas accessing sp ecialty cancer-care consultations by cancer 1448 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA telemedicine by 25% over baseline; and of patients in those areas re ceiving tertiary cancer-care by telehealth in their own communities by 30 % ove r baseline by Year-3 of implementation. Outcome Measure Valuation: Cancer is a huge burden in Texas an d it is important to point out that Cancer is the leading cause of death among Hispanics in the US\u2014t he largest and fastest growing minority group in the US. With 20% of all Hispanics in the US residing in Texas, we will need to prepare for 1 in 2 Hispanic men, and 1 in 3 Hispanic women being diagnosed with cancer, and the lifetime probability of dying from cancer is 1 in 5 for Hispanic men and 1 in 6 for Hispanic women (American Cancer Society, Cancer Facts and Figures for Hispanics and Latinos 201 2-2014), we will need to enhance the access to specialty cancer-care using telemedi cine and for this population. In addition, there are projected to be nearly 12 million cancer survivors by 2020, >60% of whom are age >65\u2014it is critical, therefore, to use the best technology to provide immediate access to specialty cancer-care across all areas of Texas urban and rural using telemedicine to deal with this magnitude of elderly cancer survivors who will need care, surveillance, and efforts to promote healthy aging (Parry C et al., Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 6 UTHSCSA 085144601.3.24 PASS 2 Un 3.IT-9.4 Other outcome improvement target University of Texas Health Scienc e Center at San Antonio TPI - 085144601 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: : Starting The CTRC rtnerships to provide canc er telehealth services and virtual Tumor Boards with cancer health providers and communities in Laredo, Harlingen, Edinburgh, with plans to extend services to Del Rio, Eagle Pass, Carizo Springs, Victoria, and Hondo.

Goals/Rationale: Implementing training for hematology-oncology fellows to serve in underserved areas with cultural competency curricula and skil ls will enhance specialty care in underserved areas as nearly 80% of trainees stay in Texas after training. Accreditation bodies such as the ACGME, and UTHSCSA GME will need to be engaged to a pprove innovative curricul a, approve increase in training slots. Finally, Memoranda of Understandi ng will need to be in place between the training program and the individual underser ved institutions and clinical trai ning sites. P-4: Conduct Plan- Do-Study-Act (PDSA) Cycles to improve data co llection and intervention activities. Metric: Improve the curriculum of cancer-care for unders erved population in combination with cultural competency education. PDSA cycles are wi dely accepted methods of continuous quality improvement. PDSA cycles q 6 months will be us ed to demonstrate improvement in training quality in underserved areas. The following PDSA format will be used PLAN: Design and Implement Curricula and Cultural Competency Skills Educa tion and Evaluation. DO: 6-month blocks of rotations in underserved areas. ST UDY: Pre- and Post-Test scores. ACT: Revise curriculum based on target scores Rationale: The main reason for selecting this project is the overwhelming burden of cancer affecting our population in Texas\u2014cancer is the le ading cause of death in this stat e, coupled with serious shortage of trained oncology providers\u2014Texas ranks 45th in the nation in the number of physicians per population: Therefore, we would like to educate the next gene ration of cancer care providers especially medical oncologists who can provide ideal cancer care from cancer prevention to survivorship care in rural and underserved areas of Sout h Texas. This is one of the highest priorities for the NCI-designated Cancer Center, the CTRC. We would like to increase the capacity to provide cancer care and oncology sp ecialty care services and the availability of highly trained specialty providers to better accommodate the hi gh demand for cancer care and oncology specialty care so that patients have efficient and effectiv e access to such services in their own community Outcome Measure Valuation: Cancer is a huge burden in Texas an d it is important to point out that Cancer is the leading cause of death among Hispanics in the US\u2014t he largest and fastest growing minority group in the US. With 20% of all Hispanics in the US residing in Texas, we will need to prepare for 1 in 2 Hispanic men, and 1 in 3 Hispanic women being diagnosed with cancer, and the lifetime probability of dying from 1452 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA cancer is 1 in 5 for Hispanic men and 1 in 6 for Hispanic women (American Cancer Society, Cancer Facts and Figures for Hispanics and Latinos 2012- 2014), we will need to enhance the number and quality of trained oncologists to serve this populati on. In addition, there are projected to be nearly 12 million cancer survivors by 2020, >60% of whom ar e age >65\u2014it is critical, therefore, to prepare a workforce to deal with this magnitude of elderl y cancer survivors who will need care, surveillance, and efforts to promote healthy aging (Parry C et al., Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 6 UTHSCSA 085144601.3.25 PASS 2 U 3.IT-9.4 Other outcome improvement target University of Texas Health Scienc e Center at San Antonio TPI - 085144601 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: : 085144601.1.17 Starting Point/Baseline: Texas Medical A ssociation (TMA) data show that physicians who complete both medical school and GME in the state are almost three times more likely to practice in Texas.

Baseline data will be collected from a sample of patients in each spec ialty area in DY1. Survey elements will include: A) Patient/parent impression of ease of access to specialist and timeliness of appointment B) Patient/parent impression of the qua lity of physician communication. C) Patient/parent impression of involve ment in shared decision making. The information collected through the survey pr ocess will be reviewed continually throughout the process. Quarterly feedback will be given to provi ders (physicians and NPs) in the specialty care clinics and to the clinic leadership. Indivi dual specialty clinic sites will be empowered to adopt changes to improve patient satisfaction. Successful improvements will be shared formally throughout the Specialty Care network semi-annually through a Learning Collaborative model. Rationale: The milestones chosen are to assure that the access expansion improves service to the children and families of greater San Antonio and the ot her areas in RHP6 that use San Antonio for pediatric specialty care. Add itionally, collecting information about \"Third Next Available Appointment\" and Patient Satisfaction will allow us to assure that access is fairly distributed throughout the community. The Patient Satisfacti on information will allow assurance that the other important characteristics of the patient experience are also fairly distributed throughout the community to assure that all of the specialty c linic sites provide a high quality service and that the outreach sites compare favorably with the ca re delivered in the main, central clinic. Outcome Measure Valuation: The overall target goal is to establish a networ k of pediatric specialty care clinic s throughout greater San Antonio which will enhance the ability for all children in San Antonio and the surrounding region to have timely and convenient access to pediatric spec ialty care. Overall health of the children of the region will be e nhanced through effective delivery of care and effective communication with referring practitioners through the use of modern EMR application. These improvements will enhance access for all children to the new children's hospital and will support the a ddition of needed pediatric specialty care providers. 1457 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 085144601.3.27 PASS 2 3.IT-6.1 Percent improvement over baselin e of patient satisfaction scores.

Research has shown that patient care experiences positivel y correlate to clinical quality processes and outcomes on both the practice and provider levels142. Additionally, patients with better care experiences are more engaged and adherent, and have better health outcomes. For example, a recent study in the Journal of Family Practice demonstrated that adhe rence rates were 2.6 times higher among primary care patients whose provide rs had \"whole person knowledge\" of them compared to patients of providers without that knowledge143. This translates to better, more cost effective healthcare and healthier patients. There are also other financial implications to consider, in the form of incentives, lower malpractice risk, and increased patient loyalty. Increasingly, patient experi ence is being tied to financial incentives, as is the case in Massachusetts and California144. And with the passage of the new healthcare law, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) will be making mandatory the implementation and reporting of patient experience survey results, and tying these measures to financial incentives145. We will most likely be monetarily penalized for not collecting and reporting on this data. The implementation of CG-CAHPS now puts us in the 142 Sequist et al.

Tracking patient experience data is cost efficient in other ways. The Journal of the American Medical Association146 has published several articles demonstr ating that good patient experience correlates with lower medical malpractice risk147. In fact, a 2009 study found that with each drop in patient-reported score along a five-step scal e from \"very good\" to \"very poor\", the likelihood of being named in a malpractice suit increased by 21.7%148. Measuring patient experience using the CG-CAHPS and with the assist ance of NRC Picker Service aler ts is a hands-on approach for identifying and addressing issues in care that could lead to lawsuits. Lastly, it is well known that patients keep or change providers based upon experience. Relationship quality is a key predictor of patient loyalty149, and in Bexar County where patients have many choices for their healthcare n eeds, they can vote with their feet. Outcome Measure Valuation: Implementing CG-CAHPS is a low-cost project th at serves not only the current patients of UTHSCSA, but future patients as well. A sampling of 50 responses per provider per year (8750 responses total, per year) en sures that many different pati ent populations are heard. 146 Levinson W, Roter DL, Mullooly JP, Dull V, Frankel RM.

Noncompliance with epilepsy me dication leads to an emergency room visits. With proper medical management, patient compliance with seizure medication will increase, seizure frequency will decrease, and frequency of emergency department visits will decrease. Outcome Measure Valuation: People with epilepsy who do not have access to specialty care genera lly seek care in an emergency room, at an average cost of $3,000 per visit. Difficulty in accessing needed medications will lead to noncompliance at a co st of about $5,000 per person. For those uninsured and without some type of assistance, epileps y medications can't be accessed through Pharma assistance programs ($1,338,525 in such assistan ce was facilitated by the EFCST in FY 2010 alone) and lost productivity in terms of work -related earnings for people with uncontrolled epilepsy amount to $8,953 per year per household. With seizure control due to appropriate treatment, approximately 60% of could return to work. The cost savings realized by this proposal detailed below is conservative, as it primarily accounts for benefits to those who are uninsured.

Process Milestones: Decrease recidivism for alcohol o ffenders by 25% to 50%. A 25% to 50% reduction was selected because this would represen t a clinically meaningful reduction in alcohol offending. See Table 1 for outcome rates Milestone 1 is to establish relationship with drug courts. This milestone was chosen because it is it allows us access to indigent adu lts who are in need of alcohol treatment, it provides information used to establish baseline for alcohol offending in our region which is used as comparison to our treatment outcomes. Processes 1, 2, and 3 are utilized to address Milestone 1. P-1 Project Planning-engage stakeholders identify current capacity and needed resources. Milestone 1 is to establish worki ng relationships with hospital emergency departments, social workers and Bexar Count y Judges and District Attorney's office to develop and pilot our program. During Y2 we will establish working relationships with stakeholders to gain their participation in th e development of this program. During Y3, Y4, and Y5 we will sustain involvement by judges and District Attorney's office in pilot programs and to use their input to refine the pilot program s. Process 1 was selected because successful implementation of this treatment program will require partnership with court. P-2 Establish baseline rates. As part of Milestone 1 (est ablish working relationships with Bexar County Judges and District Attorney's o ffice) we will estab lish baseline rates for alcohol driving offense recidivism in our local courts and continue to evaluate rates annually during the course of the project. Process 2 was selected be cause it is necessary to establish baseline rates in order to understa nd the scope of the health problem. P-3 Develop and test data. As part of Milestone 1 we will analyze current probation practices for alcohol related offe nses and conduct analyses of baseline outcome rates. This analyses will be conducted annuall y, resulting in a written repo rt of our findings. Process 3 was selected because it is necessary to establis h current practices of probation courts. This provides some context for comparison to prac tices and outcomes of this new treatment program. Milestone 2 is provide a treatmen t alternative to jail for legally indigent adults convicted of alcohol related driving offenses . This milestone was chosen it represents new access to alcohol treatment for the legally indigent. Process 4 is utilized to address Milestone 2. P-4 Conduct Plan Do Study Acts (PDSA) cycles to improve data collection and intervention activities. Based on our findings from Milestone 1, we will develop a treatment program to reduce alcohol misuse and further alcohol related driving offenses among legally indigent adults convicted of alcohol related driving offenses. This treatment will provide transdermal alcohol monitoring for program pa rticipants and utilize this monitoring to individualize treatment plans to reduce alcohol mi suse. The goals of this program are to treat the following number of adults by year: 100 in Y2, 150 in Y3, 200 each in Y4 and Y5. This process was selected as a proof of concept program, that is intended to be disseminated to 1467 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA drug courts across the state based on this initial pilot project. Milestone 3 is to reduce rates of alcohol recidiv ism by 25% to 50% of that rate observed for typical probation. This milestone was chosen as an object measure of success of this novel treatment program. Processes 5 and 7 ar e utilized to address Milestone 3. P-5 Analyze data from program participants. As part of establishing the effectiveness of Milestone 2, we will compare rates of recidi vism from program participants to typical recidivism rates for Bexar county (established in P-2 and P-3). P-6 Disseminate findings, including lessons lear ned and best practices, to stakeholders. Test of outcomes from Milestone 3 will be the bases for a report that outlines our success in treating alcohol offenders. Additionally, we will use our experience to develop a manualized treatment plan that drug courts can adopt, wh ich will facilitat e their use of transdermal alcohol monitoring to enhance pr obation success. This process was selected as a means to facilitate adoption of this alc ohol program by other drug courts. P-7 Other activities not de scribed above if any. The treatment providers are interested in developing a training institute to education cour ts and probation offices on best practices for adopting this novel treatment. Rationale: Alternative programs need to be developed to addr ess the issue of intoxicated driving, because the current approach is ineffective and costly. The necessary metrics are clear , and these include number of enrollments in the program, in carceration rates, and reductions in recidivism. Additional metrics will include the number of offenders remaining gainfully employed, reduction in the number of motor vehicle accidents, and those able to con tinue providing support for their children and/or families. Outcome Measure Valuation: Cost of alcohol monitoring and integration with specialized treatment ar e the two main factors accounting for the valuation of $6,175,000. 1- Cost of alcohol monitoring. An indigent pers on could not afford the $4,500 cost long term alcohol monitoring used by the therapist to guide treatment. 2.- Cost of therapy. Use of contingency manageme nt with motivational inte rviewing for treatment of substance use disorder is available only at a few academic medical cente rs (e.g. University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences) and delivered by ther apists with specialized training. Treatment cost for these providers is $200/visit. A patient requir ing a full 6-months of weekly session could spend almost $5,000 for these services. 1468 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 UTHSCSA 085144601.3.33 PASS 2 3.IT-9.1 3.

Rationale: DY 2 will be a short year with only 6 months to perform, but important to engage stakeholders, achieve community consensus concerning timelines , location of homes and expectations related to providing these new and innovative services in community settings. We will put our efforts into engagement and development. DY 3 presents the opportunity to identify and refine data sources and establish the baseline for admission to juvenile justice facilities. We need the juvenile justice system data in order to measure our Improvement Target. The Improvement Target for DY 4 and 5 is a sta nd-alone measure. We selected this measure because the goal of this project is to help youth successfully retu rn to family and community. We feel that reductions in removal from home an d community is the best measure of success. Outcome Measure Valuation: The project seeks to provide crisis respite to 16 y outh in DY 4; and to provide crisis respite to 30 youth in DY 5. These are very high intensity youth who otherwise would be removed from home and placed in a psychiatric hospital or Juve nile Justice residential treatment facilities. Both of these options are expensive and separa te the family from the treatment process and seriously reducing the chances for reunification w ith the family. The valuation calculated for this project used cost-utility analysis which m easures program cost in dollars and the health consequences in utility-weighted units that were applied to the factors existing in this underserved area, including: limited access to prim ary care and to behavioral health care, poverty and the link between chronic health conditions an d chronic behavioral health conditions. The valuation study was prepared by professors H. Shelton Brown, Ph.D. and A. Hasanat Alamgir, Ph.D. both of the UT Houston School of Public Health and Thomas Bohm an, Ph.D. of the UT Austin Center for Social Work Research based on a model that included quality-adjusted life- years (QALYs) and an extensive literature of si milar interventions and co st savings and health outcomes related to those interventions. The QALY index incorporat es costs averted when known (e.g., emergency room visits that are avoided). We assigned a value of $320,101 through DY 5.

We selected this measure because the goal of this project is to help people who have been in some inpatient or other detoxification program to transition to stable living in the community by providing access to community outpatient services. We will measure readmission. Outcome Measure Valuation: The outcome for this project will be a reduction in re-hospitaliza tion which is a good indicator of success for the program and a good indicator of su ccess on a personal basis for those enrolled in the program. Low income individuals cannot no w access outpatient care and are left in this cycle of relapse. Extended s obriety and productivity will impr ove their health outcomes.

Process Milestones for DY 3 will be: P 2 Establish baseline rates P 3 Develop and test data systems Improvement Target for DY 4 and 5 will be: IT3.1 All cause 30 day readmission rate NQF 1789 for patients 18 and older Rationale: DY 2 We must work with community providers and multiple health care systems to inventory capacity, determine when to initiate program, iden tify resource needs, complete agreements for data sharing and agreements for site utilization DY 3 This population of high frequent visitors to ED is not identif ied or characterized. We must develop sources of information across multiple health care systems; identify the group and establish a baseline. The Improvement Target for DY 4 and 5 is a sta nd-alone measure. We selected this measure because the goal of this project is to help people who have been fr equent visitors to ED and even though a root cause might be the presence of beha vioral health conditions, the admission cause will vary across a variety of physical and mental conditions. We believe that measuring the reduction in re-hospitaliza tion will be a good indicator of succe ss for the program. Over the four years of the project we expect to dramatically reduce the number of ED visits for the target population and the associated inpatient admissi ons. These reductions will occur by improved chronic disease management, linkage to a primary care provider and medical home. Outcome Measure Valuation: By targeting and serving 30 high utilizers of ED se rvices in DY 4 and 50 in DY 5 we expect to improve lives and cost and effectiveness of th e health care system. We are confident we will impact hospitalization use. The valuation calculated for this project used cost-utility analysis which measures program cost in dollars and the health consequences in utility-weighted units that were applied to the factors existing in th is underserved area, including: limited access to primary care and to behavioral health care, poverty and the link between chronic health conditions and chronic behavioral health condit ions.

We selected this measure because the goal of this project is to help people who have been hospitalized or experien ced a crisis event that could have resulted in a hospitalization to transition to stable living in the community. That transition will be made because of the program interventions that im prove functioning and the skills needed for successful community living. When the goal is ac hieved then program pa rticipants will self- manage their recovery and wellness and there sh ould be a reduction in sy mptoms and a reduction in crisis events. The outcome of this is fewe r readmissions to the hospital both for 30 days and in the long term. Outcome Measure Valuation: We expect to provide transitional housing to this group of individuals who have multiple hospital admissions, are frequently homeless and have diff iculty with community tenure. We will serve 12 people in DY 4 and 18 people in DY 5.

P-7 (Other activities) Impl ementation plans: i.e. Facility acq uisition, architect drawings, building financing, contractor reten tion, operational budget including staffing requirements, policy procedure development, etc. Improvement Target: Decrease in mental health admissions and readmissions of persons needing crisis stabilization services to institutional faci lities (hospital emergenc y rooms, State Hospitals, jails, private psychi atric facilities). Numerator: The number of individua ls receiving project crisis st abilization services who were diverted from institutional facilities. Denominator: Total number of individuals requiring crisis stabilization services. Data Source: Project Data: Profile consumers/history of frequent us ers of institutional facilities. Those meeting profile or havi ng history would be counted. Crisis stabilization services will increase by at least 25% by the end of the waiver project. Rationale: The process milestones and outcome improvement targets selected are those most directly respond to the Transformation Waiver goals an d objectives. These milestones and outcome improvement targets directly relate to the prov ision of community based crisis stabilization services and are milestones and outcomes th at are measureable. The outcome improvement targets will be determined in DY 2 for implementation in DY3. The following evidence supports selection of th is project and related outcome targets: 1) Sledge and other research proj ects have concluded that, in many cases, residential programs are cost effective and viable alternative to hospitalization. E.g., G oodwin, R. & Lyons, JS, An emergency housing program as an alternativ e to inpatient treatment for persons with severe mental illness. Psychiatric Serv ices, 2001; 52:92-95; Hawthorne, kW, Green, EE, Gilmer, T, P, Hough, R, Lee, M, Hammond, L, Lohr, JB: A randomized trial of short-term acute residential terans. Psychiatric Se rvices, 2005: 56: 1379- 1386. 2) The preparatory research supported the conclusion that psychiatric cris es requiring acute care with hospitalization acco unt for the largest expenditures in community care. Fenton, W>S., Hoch, JS, Herrell, JM, Moshcer, L & Dixon, L., Co st and cost-effectiveness of hospital vs. residential crisis care for patients who have se rious mental illness. Arch Gen Psychiatry, 202; 59; 357-364. 1481 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Camino Real Community Services 3) Sledge, et al concluded that alternative programs had not be \"widely implemented\" because of the existence of an \"incen tive structure that discourages their use\" and because it is assumed that psychiatric hospitalization is the \"most effective method of treatment of those acutely ill psychiatric patients.\" P. 1075. Outcome Measure Valuation: Project valuation takes into consideration: 1) Costs for both state operated Psychiatric Hospitals. 2) Costs of private Psychiatric Hospitals. 3) Local Emergency Room and Hospital costs. 4) Cost of local judicial systems. 5) Cost of local City and County law enforcemen t systems both in their intervention activity as well as the provision of transportati on for consumers needing treatment. 6) Significant value will be gi ven to a program that can pr ovide services much more responsive to consumer needs with significantly reduced time frames and efficient use of limited resources! 1482 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Camino Real Community Services TPI-121990904.3.1 PASS 2 3.IT-9.4 Other Outcome Improvement Ta rget: Decrease mental health admissions and readmissions of pe rsons needing crisis stabilization services to institutional facilities.

According to Practice Guidelines: Core Elements for Responding to Mental He alth Crisis (HHS P ub. No. SMA-09-4427;2009) about 6 percent of all hospital em ergency department visits reflect mental health emergencies and due to a lack of available alternatives, 79 percent of hospita l emergency departments report having to \"board\" psychiatric patients who are in crisis and in need of inpatient care, sometimes for eight hours or longer . As further discussed in the Prac tice Guidelines, in addition to the human case for improving crisis se rvices, a strong business case can be made and data should be collected accordingly. Current appr oaches to crisis services n eedlessly perpetuate reliance on expensive, late-stage interventi ons (such as hospital emergency departments) and on settings that have inherent risks for harm for people with mental health needs (f or instance, jails and juvenile justice facilities). In 2008, Mental Health or Subs tance Abuse disorders were th e principal reason for 1.8 million inpatient community hospital stays, accounting for 4.5 percent of stays in the U.S. This is according to Brief #117 (Agency for Healthcare Re search and Quality, June 2011). It was also noted the MH and SA conditions most frequently treated in community hospitals were mood disorders (depression and bipolar disorder), schi zophrenia and other psycho tic disorders, alcohol- related disorders and drug-related disorders. Th ese MHSA hospital stays cost $9.7 billion ($7.7 billion for MH; $2.1 billion for SA) nationwide, the MH average length of stay was 8.0 days and the SA average length of stay was 4.8 days with an average cost $5100. 1485 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Camino Real Community Services Citations: Practice Guidelines: Core Elements for Responding to Mental Health Crises.

This work will be made available to University Health System to advise project valuation and outcom e measures going forward. Valuations should be based on economic evalua tion principles that identify, measure, and value the relevant costs and consequences of two or more alternatives. Typically, one alternative is a new program while the second is treatment as usual. Cost-utility analysis (CUA) measures the cost of the program in do llars and the health consequences in utility- weighted units. This valuation uses a qualit y-adjusted life-years (QALYs) analysis that combines health quality (utility) with length of time in a particular health state. Cost-utility analysis is a useful tool for assessing the value of new health service interventions due to the fact that it provides a standard way of valuing multiple types of interventions and programs. The valuation also incorporates costs averted when known (e.g., emergency room visits that are avoided). In orde r to make the valuations fair acr oss potentially di fferent types of interventions, the common health goal, or ou tcome, is the number of life-years added. 1504 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services 137251808.3.6 PASS 1 3.IT-9.1 Decrease in mental health admissions and readmissions to criminal justice settings Center for Health Care Services TPI - 137251808 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 137251808.2.1 Starting Point/Baseline: 244 adults Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Process Milestone 1 P-4: Conduct Plan Do Study Act (PDSA) cycles to improve data collection and intervention activities Data Source: PDSA reports Process Milestone 1 Estimated Incentive Payment: $180,924 Process Milestone 2 P-4: Conduct Plan Do Study Act (PDSA) cycles to improve data collection and intervention activities Data Source: PDSA reports Process Milestone 2 Estimated Incentive Payment: $419,433 Outcome Improvement Target 1 IT-9.1 Decrease in mental health admissions and readmissions to criminal justice settings.

(Stringfellow) Rationale: The IHWWP will help to meet an existing need for a comprehensive, safe, structured, integrated care management program for high-need, homeless females in Bexar County. Because the target population often has a complex combination of physical and behavioral health care needs combined with concomitant issues of substance abuse, traumatic injury, cognitive challenges and a lack of daily living skills and natural suppor ts, they are frequent users of Emergency Departments (ED) and other public health services. This project will expand available treatment options (SS, WSM, and Matrix Psychosocial EB Ps) for males and females and will establish a parallel, 24 bed dormitory (IHWWP) for females, which will improve outcomes and drive down 1518 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Center for Health Care Services costs.

It impacts the individual's self care as well as their ability to cope with their environment. When an individual is unable to prope rly care for themselves or to cope with their local environment, they are at greater risk of unemployment and poor health. The Activities of Daily Living will be utilized to provide an overview of functional status, determine activity limitations, establish a baseline for treatment, provide a guide for inte rvention planning, to evaluate interventions and monitor progress and to plan for future and for discharge. The DLA-20 Functional Assessment is a functional assessment, proven to be reliable and valid, designed to assess what daily living areas are im pacted by mental illne ss or disability. The assessment tool identifies where outcomes are need ed so clinicians can address those functional deficits on individualized service plans. THE DL A-20 is intended to be used by all disabilities and ages. THE DLA-20 utilizes the followi ng 20 domains: Health Prac tices, Housing Stability and Maintenance, Communication, Safety, Managing Time, Nutrition, Problem Solving, Family Relationships, Alcohol/Drug Use, Leisure, Co mmunity Resources, Social Network, Sexuality, Productivity, Coping Skills, Behavior Norms, Pe rsonal Care/Hygiene, Grooming, and Dress. For the targeted population, individuals needing Trauma Informed Care, the DLA-20 will help 1521 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers identify areas the trauma has impacted in thei r lives such as coping skills, problem solving, family relationships, communication, and safety and be able to track improvement in the areas of the course of treatment. Outcome measures are based on th e number of individuals that have begun treatment in the Trauma Informed Care program and were kept m odest due to the interven tion requiring a change in the individual's lifestyle which will take time to implement and due to individuals continuing to enter the program throughout the demonstration years. The Activities of Daily Living will be utilized to measure how a person is functioning at the present time, and to identify improvement over time. By measuring the Activities of Daily Living of an individual before and after treatment , the impact of the trea tment on an individual's capability to function appropriately in society, th us increasing the potential for employment and for better health, will be captured to demonstrate the success of the project. Outcome measures were kept modest due to the inte rventions requiring a change in the individual's lifestyle which will take time to implement or where the individual may be resistant to change. In addition, throughout the waiver, Hill Country w ill be working with other Community Centers in a learning collaborative to select a small se t of outcome measures for Category 3, based on the valuation studies conducted by health care economist s at the University of Texas and University of Houston. The collaborative will develop a stra tegy for collection of that data through HIEs or other shared data sources in local communities. Centers are currently in the process of engaging a consultant to provide leadersh ip and consultation for this proj ect. The outcome of this project may result in future refinement of the Category 3 Improvement Outcome metrics. Outcome Measure Valuation: Project valuation is based on a weighted aver age of Achieving Waiver Goals, Addressing Community Needs, Project Scope, and Project Inve stment. The valuation for this project was based on an economic evaluation model and extensiv e literature review c onducted by professors at the University of Houston School of Public H ealth and University of Texas at Austin Center for Social Work Research. The valuation is s upported by cost-utility analysis which measures program cost in dollars and the health conseque nces in incorp orate costs averted when known (e.g., emergency room visits that area avoided). The valuation on this project is based on 190 consumers over the life of the project resulting in a valuation overall of $15,642 per individual served. 1522 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers 133340307.3.1 PASS 1 3.IT-10.2 Activities of Daily Living /Mobile Crisis Outreach Teams Hill Country Community MHMR Center (dba Hill Country MHDD Centers) TPI - 133340307 Related Category 1 or 2 Projects: 133340307.2.1 Starting Point/Baseline: Service not currently offered Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Outcome Improvement Target 1 IT-10.2: Activities of Daily Living Improvement Target: 10% have improvement on subsequent Activities of Daily Living Data Source: Hill Country MHDD records/EHR Outcome Improvement Target 1 Estimated Incentive Payment : $72,574 Outcome Improvement Target 2 IT-10.2: Activities of Daily Living Improvement Target: 15% have improvement on subsequent Activities of Daily Living Data Source: Hill Country MHDD records/EHR Outcome Improvement Target 2 Estimated Incentive Payment : $116,455 Outcome Improvement Target 3 IT-10.2: Activities of Daily Living Improvement Target: 20% have improvement on subsequent Activities of Daily Living Data Source: Hill Country MHDD records/EHR Outcome Improvement Target 3 Estimated Incentive Payment : $168,776 Year 2 Estimated Outcome Amount: Year 3 Estimated Outcome Amount: $72,574 Year 4 Estimated Outcome Amount: $116,455 Year 5 Estimated Outcome Amount: RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country MHDD Centers Identifying Outcome Measure and Provider Information: Title of Outcome Measure (Improvement Target): IT-12.5 Other USPSTF-endorsed screening outcome measures (PHQ-A/BDI-PC) Unique RHP outcome Identification number: 133340307.3.2 - PASS 1 Performing Provider: Hill Country Community MHMR Center (dba Hill Country MHDD Centers) TPI: 133340307 screeni ng outcome measures (PHQ-A/BDI-PC) Category 3 outcome measures will be based on th e following screening categories performed by primary care physicians: PHQ-A/BDI-PC for Adolescents (12-18 years old) The number of PHQ-A/BDI-PC performed by Primary Care Physicians on patients/individuals enrolled to receive behavioral health consultation will be divided by the population ages 12 to 18 of Bandera, Comal, Edwards, Gillespie, Ke ndall, Kerr, Kinney, Medina, Real, Uvalde and Val Verde as determined by Texas Department of State Health Servi ces population estimates Process Milestones: Not applicable Outcome Improvement Targets for each year: DY2 - Not Applicable DY3 IT12.5 2% of population 12 to 18 years ol d have received PHQ-A/BDI-PC assessment DY4 IT12.5 3% of population 12 to 18 years ol d have received PHQ-A/BDI-PC assessment DY5 IT12.5 5% of population 12 to 18 years ol d have received PHQ-A/BDI-PC assessment Rationale: Screening instruments for depressi on and substance use disorder ar e beneficial when behavioral health supports are available.

Linking patients who have receiv ed a diagnosis of HIV infec tion to prevention and care is essential. HIV screening without such linkage confers little or no benefit to the patient. Although moving patients into care incurs su bstantial costs, it also triggers sufficient survival benefits that justify the additional costs. 158 Even if only a limited fraction of patients who receive HIV- positive results are linked to care, the survival benefits per dollar spent on screening represent good comparative value . Mean cumulative tr eatment expenditures ranged from $27,275 to $61,615 higher for late than early presenters.

The more high risk clients screened and counseled, the faster the ultimate goal of preventing new syphilis infections is achieved. Outcome Measure Valuation: The outcome measure selected addresses a need to screen for syphilis within high risk populations in Bexar County. Bexar County's pr imary and secondary syphilis rate in 2011 was 2.3 times higher than the national and state rate. There was a 309% increase in primary and secondary syphilis cases, between the year 2002 and 2011 in the county. Additionally, disparities among racial/ethnic groups in Bexa r County are deep, with the 2011 rate for non- Hispanic African Americans, the highest at 20.4, compared to 11.8 for Hispanics and 6.2 for the non-Hispanic Whites. 1580 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District Based on recommendations from the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) screening for syphilis is important for detecting new syphilis cases and increased opportunities to treat these individuals.160 Furthermore, the USPSTF states that \"the benefi ts of screening persons at increased risk for syphilis infecti on substantially outweigh the potential harms.\"1 If left untreated, even during pregnancy, the syphili s infection can lead to a multitude of costly complications for the individua l and even the newborn baby.161 Valuation for category 3 outcomes are based on the sa me criteria and ranking as the valuation of the associated category 2 project overall. 160 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.

Bexa r County is considered a high prevalence area for syphilis based on current rates. With 18 cases in 2012, the congenital syphilis rate in Bexar County was 75.3 per 100,000 live births, a rate fa r surpassing any recent year. From 2008-2011 the Bexar County annual rate was 40.9 per 100,000 live births, which is 30% higher than the average rate for Texas for that same period (a t 28.6 per 100,000 live births) and five times the national average (8.5 per 100,000 in 2011). Third trimester syphilis testing is important to the prevention of congen ital syphilis due to the potential for infection during the pregnancy after first trimester testing has been completed and because of the effectiveness of available trea tments in preventing c ongenital syphilis if the woman is treated during her pregnancy. This outcome improvement target was select ed to reflect CDC r ecommendations and to demonstrate the impact of case management act ivities on third trimester congenital syphilis screening which should lead to th e identification and prevention of potential congenital syphilis cases. Additional supportive information will be available based on reports of congenital syphilis cases and case manager files docu menting clinical outcomes. 1583 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 San Antonio Metropolitan Health District Outcome Measure Valuation: Based on locally obtained data fo r 2011 the average cost to deliver and treat an infant born with congenital syphilis was $54,677. The average length of hospital stay in these cases was 14 days (ranging from 1 to 45 days). These costs do includ e the costs to the mother or of ongoing care needed for infants that may be born with signif icant physical and/or developmental disabilities. Using the 2011 average cost to an infant, the pr ojected cost of care to the 18 infants with a presumptive diagnosis of congenital syphilis in 2012 would be $984,186. Bexar county hospitals could see these costs reduced when a pregnant woma n with syphilis is also tested for syphilis in the third trimester, in accordance with CDC STD treatment guidelines 162 to prevent congenital syphilis in the infant.

Category 4: Population-Focused Improvements (Hospitals only) Performing Provider: Performing Provider name: VHS San Antonio Pa rtners, LLC d/b/a Baptist Health System TPI: 159156201 Domain 1 - Potentially Preventable Admissions Description: AHRQ reports that our nation's hospitals spend a pproximately 10% of all care provided or up to 4 million patient hospitalizations which may be preven table with effective outpatient care. Reducing preventable hospitalizations is a priority in reducing the rise of healthcare costs. Reporting Measures: Congestive heart failure admission rates Diabetes admission rates Behavioral health and subs tance abuse admission rate Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma in adults admission rates Hypertension admission rates Pediatric asthma returns to ED visit within 15 days Increase in bacterial pneumonia immunizations Increase in influenza immunizations Exempt Domains: Baptist does not expect to re port on preventable admi ssions for Behavioral Health and Substance Abuse as we do not have ambulatory Behavioral Health programs to address preventable admissions. Baptist does not expect to report on preventa ble admission rates for diabetes short term complications, since we cannot track the denominat or which is # of residents > 18 years with diabetes who have had 2 or more primary care visits in past 12 months within the RHP. Baptist projects were selected to impact the tr iple aim goals of assuring patients receive high- quality, patient-centered care, though cost eff ectiveness and to meet our community needs. All of our Category 1,2,3 projec ts relate to and should impr ove preventable admissions : Expand primary care capacity 1.1.1: Baptist plans to expand existing sites and add additional primary care physicians over the next four years. This expansion will increase access to vital preventative care and early intervention in acute episodes which should reduce decreas e preventable admissions. RHP 6 and Texas overall has a demonstrated need to improve qua lity of care for prevalent chronic conditions such as diabetes and cardiac care as well as other health disparities. Expand specialty care capacity 1.9.2: Baptist plans to expand existing sites and add additional specialty care physicians over the next four years. This expansion will increase access to vital preventative care and early intervention in acute episodes which should reduce decreas e preventable admissions. RHP 6 and Texas overall has a demonstrated need to improve access and quality of care in cardiac disease, maternal/infant care and behavioral health a ll of which will be addressed through BHS plans 1592 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Baptist Health System for expansion of specialty care. Enhance performance improvement and reporting capacity 1.10.1 Design, develop and implement a program of continuous, rapid process improvement methodology to improve quality/efficiency 2.8.1: Through the implementation of lean and six si gma performance improvement methodology in our health system, Baptist will create a PI infrastructure focused on educating employees and physicians. Through the implementation of these t ools we will change work processes, improve cost efficiency, improve patient care and outcomes, and address RHP goals of - Triple Aim - Improve health care infrastructu re to better serve Me dicaid and uninsured - Further develop and maintain a coordinated care delivery system - Improve outcomes while containing cost growth Through the PI structure and training, we will ex amine clinical care processes seeking reduced variation, improve patient teachi ng and transitional care, change physician practices, all of which can lead to reduced inpatient care and prevent admissions. Baptist expects these projects to result in improve d outcomes for this domain's measures to benefit the RHP population by reducing preventable admi ssions, improving overall ambulatory health management and providing improved, effectiv e inpatient care for chronic conditions. Valuation: Baptist values each project based on the specific needs of the community, the projected impact on the health outcomes of the community, the level of advancement to the healthcare delivery system, and the time, effort, and clinical resources necessary to implement each project. In valuing the project, Baptis t took into account the extent to which Potentially Preventable Admissions reporting could meet the goals of th e Wavier (improve outcomes while containing costs, improve the healthcare infr astructure), the extent to which it will address the community needs, the population served, and resources a nd costs necessary to implement the project.

BHS is developing teams at each hospital for con tinuous review of the patient's experience that trigger re-admission including representatives from Nursing, Case Management, Social Service and Medical staff. The centerpiece of the BHS re -admission strategy is early intervention through a team approach. BHS has a process to identify bot h high risk and moderate risk patients for re- admission. With readmission a notification is sent el ectronically to Case Ma nagers who then visit the patients. During rounding, the Case Manage r in conjunction with nursing and physicians communicate and monitor handoffs together. This he lps the patient and family members understand the diagnosis, treatment plan and post discha rge care. It also facilitates and enhances communication between the multi-disciplinary care team. BHS will work with the medical staff to comple te the discharge summaries on all discharged patients within 24 hours post discharge. Copies ar e sent to the primary /referring physician to facilitate continuity of care. We are also engaging the medical staff to use the physician portal by granting all affiliated physicians access to the electronic record. We are currently using PI to simplify what we te ach patients and assess patient's understanding of what has been taught and then revising. We w ill use \"Teach Back\" during hospitalization, follow- up phone calls assessing patient and family caregiv er understanding of inst ructions as well as ability to perform self care. Using PI tools we continue review of pr ocesses and policies to standardize care, ensuring appropriate treatment and discharge instructions. We will be recruiting Case Managers for Transition Care Manager (TCM) position at all five hospitals. Their primary responsibility is to impr ove discharge planning and transition out of the hospital by improving that transiti on, providing care coordination at the interfaces between care settings as well as enhancing coaching, educat ion and self management. Part of the TCM responsibility will be to work w ith other health care providers for follow up visits of at risk patients. TCMs will ensure that chronically ill pa tients and elderly have appointments with their primary physicians, scheduled by the TCMs. The TCM will provide the physician with an electronic summary of the discha rge summary, make follow up call to the patients do the patient sees their primary care physician within five days. We also continue to develop pa rtnerships and relationships with our Home Health Agencies and Nursing Homes to ensure that they are equipped with the resources to take care of the patients assigned to their service and care. BHS is enhancing the admission r econciliation of medications. The patient and family caregivers 1594 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Baptist Health System are involved during the medication history taken at admissi on. The assessment includes over-the counter and alternative or herbal medicines. The medication reconci liation is documente d as part of the medical record. Valuation: Baptist values each project based on the specific needs of the community, the projected impact on the health outcomes of the community, the level of advancement to the healthcare delivery system, and the time, effort, and clinical resources necessary to implement each project. In valuing the project, Baptis t took into account the extent to which Potentially Preventable Admissions reporting could meet the goals of th e Wavier (improve outcomes while containing costs, improve the healthcare infr astructure), the extent to which it will address the community needs, the population served, and resources a nd costs necessary to implement the project. Performing Provider: Performing Provider name: VHS San Antonio Pa rtners, LLC d/b/a Baptist Health System TPI: 159156201 Domain 3: Potentially Preventable Complications Description: Reporting Measure: Hospital performing providers subject to required Ca tegory 4 reporting must report on the 64 PPC measures listed in Domain 3 in DY 4 5. The metrics for Potentially Preventable Complications (PPC) span the full spectrum of care provided and intersect within th e populations cared for in car diovascular, cancer, diabetic, maternal and child health, as well as behavioral health as outlined in Categories 1, 2 and 3. Efforts to improve organizational performance improvement acumen assist in reduc ing the incidences of PPCs. Baptist Health System (BHS) actively monitors and sets safety and improvement goals to meet or exceed the state/national averages for all of the PPCs. The system utilizes improvement tools such as Crimson, a quality and financial database based on coded data, to provide information related to PPCs down to the indivi dual practitioner level. This data can then provide the team valuable insights for system improvements as well as information to the individual provider via the Ongoing Performance Practice Evaluation (OPPE). Reduction in the PPC impacts outcomes for all acute care populations, reduces length of stay, and reduces the overall cost of care. To provide examples of the system's focus on reducing PPCs the following is the focus on some of the current improve ment efforts that tie to our Category 1 and 2 projects : Enhance performance improvement and reporting capacity 1.10.1 Design, develop and implement a program of continuous, rapid process improvement methodology to improve quality/efficiency 2.8.1: 1595 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Baptist Health System Cardiovascular Co-Management Agreement: Cardiovascular improvements and a focused a pproach within the ca rdiovascular surgery arena strives to reduce postoperative infections , sepsis, post-hemorrhage, AMI, ventricular fibrillation, etc. Efforts on CABG procedures initially focus on achie ving metric goals to national and/or state averages w ith the outcome to improve to the top decile performance. Several efforts are underway to create these improvements; this includes a cardiovascular co-management agreement that encompasses s uperior care as outline d by the Society for Thoracic Surgeons metrics - that include many of these particular PPCs. A Cardiovascular Surgery Site Infection Task Fo rce has been implemented to bring together Surgeons, Operational leaders and Infecti on Prevention to cons ider operational and process improvements in order to reduce th e incidence of post operative infections. DRG-Care Reliability Lean Team: Improvements within the bowel procedure (APR -DRG 221) arena will have an anticipated reduction in major and other gastrointestin al complications, post operative infections, gastrointestinal ostomy complications, and in fections due to centra l venous catheters. With a focused improvement in the utilizati on of TPN there can be a direct correlation found with the evidence of a d ecrease in infections related to central ve nous catheters. Beyond the targeted areas, all patients receive ca re that focuses on reduction of PPC. In the current year, there are targeted efforts to improve sepsis recognition and ti mely treatment as well as timely and appropriate screening and treatment for VTE. BHS uses data obtained from the E- ICU and Emergency Services to evalua te evidence-based care provided. Baptist Health System is also actively focuse d on \"driving to zero\" w ith hospital-acquired infections which account for a number of the PPCs. BHS participates in a collaborative with the Texas Medical Care Foundation (TMF) to reduce the incidence of catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI). This coll aboration has resulted in signi ficant improvements in the past quarter 2012. This was accomplished with a grass- roots education targeted to the bedside nurse. Additionally, in January 2013, the system will part icipate in the TMF collaborative to reduce the incidence of surgical site infections (SSI) as well as a clostridium difficile colitis in the inpatient populations. Valuation: Baptist values each project based on the specific needs of the community, the projected impact on the health outcomes of the community, the level of advancement to the healthcare delivery system, and the time, effort, and clinical re sources necessary to implement each project.

MTD scoring is reported weekly although all of our Department Directors have sy stem access to review daily. Each facility conducts weekly patient experience meetings with department staffs th at are not at goal. PI tools are used intradepartmen tally to evaluate processes such as the effectiv eness of hourly rounding, patient communication boards, bedside shift reporting, key words at key times and numerous other \"Best Practice\" techniques. Thr ough the Studer organization Baptist contracts for a coach that assists both facility senior leaders as well as new and experienced department leaders on \"must haves\" to impr ove patient experience. We currently have a monthly scorecard for all fi ve facilities and those results are shared at employee department meetings, employee CEO forums and at all medical staff meetings. Most of our physician contracts have patient experience tied to reimbursement. Baptist is currently evaluating a rapid cycle improvement movement to reach and sustain patient satisfaction at the 75 th percentile. To improve medication management , BHS pharmacy department will begin to deploy a pharmacist at the point of care to f acilitate the medication reconciliation pr ocess. The clinical pharmacist will review medications, teach patients regarding new medications or medication changes and review discontinued medications. They will also track adve rse drug events and serve as a resource to the bedside nurse.

Using PI processes a nd techniques, Baptist uses data and analyzes, breaking down the time into the following components: decision to admit, time to get orders and time to move to nursing unit. As an example , this PI process identified opportunity to use bridge orders that would eliminate the time asso ciated with waiting for admission orders. We will pilot a transition team to aid in a patient-centered safe and timely transition of patients from ED care to care on the floor and ensure orde rs are not missed, care con tinues, and patient is moved to appropriate level of care. BHS is adding hospitalist mid-level providers during peak hours to work w ith nocturnists between admissions to provide cross call coverage and support patient codes which will allow for a smoother inpatient admission flow. BHS has a system-wide initiative on increasing disc harge by noon percentages. The point of this is to create capacity and precede the demand peak fro m the ED allowing for quicker patient transition to the floor. The delays to discha rges are discussed and analyzed in several forums including daily nursing leadership huddles and daily hospitalist meetings. We will continue to evaluate and trial new and st reamlined processes to impact the time the patient waits in the ED before being tran sferred to a nursing un it bed as the PI tools yield new information.

Reducing preventable hospitalizations is a proven way to help reduce these rising costs. Each CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health System project was carefully selected for its ab ility to impact the triple aim goals of assuring patients receive hi gh-quality and patient-centered care, in the most cost effective ways. Expand Primary Care Capacity (1.1.2): CSRHS plans to expand beyond its existing clinic space and add an additional 4 primary car e physicians over the next four years. In doing so, CSRHS will increase access to much need ed preventative care, which will result in a decrease preventable admissions. Patient-Centered Medical Homes (2.1.2): As a result of this project, CSRHS expects to see a marked increase in access to primary care and a significant improvement in the management of chronic conditions over the next 5 years, which has been proven to successfully reduce the number of unnecessary hospital admissions. Care Transitions - Intervention Nurse Program (2.12.1): The primary goal of this project is to significantly reduce unplanned re -admissions for patient populations with the principal diagnosis of congestive heart failure (CHF), pneumonia (PN) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Health System expects th e above projects to result in improved outcomes for the following measures under this domain: 4. Decrease in congestive hear t failure admission rates 5.

Our Category 1 Project, to enhance service availability, directly links to potentially preven table admissions, a key outcome of 2.13. Improving the health of low-income populati ons will lead to long-term sustainable outcomes while decreasing societal burden. The selected Category 3 measure is located with in OD-2, \"Potentially Preventable Admissions\" and the related standalone outcome m easure of 3-IT 2-4. This measur e's goal is to reduce Emergency Department visits for one of several optional target conditions, one of which is behavioral health/substance abuse. However, because this meas ure is available only for patients 18 and older, we were advised by HHSC to utilize the custom /optional measure of 2.13 to address that our outcomes would be related to youth, ages 3-17. Our project is of be nefit to all performing providers in the region, as children are presenting in lo cal Emergency Rooms without access to \"right care, right setting\" and displacing beds for treatment pl ans that can be addressed effectively by the local hospitals. Further, treating childre n when they are children prevents a host of unwelcome outcomes, including but not limited to su icide, incarceration, dropout, alc ohol and drug abuse and many other societal ills. Valuation: The total scope of adding additiona l services, including a bed expans ion, hiring additional providers, infrastructure updates, etc., is close to $8M in scope. Local funding is in the form of IGT funding by our affiliation partner, University Health System, who will provide $1,968,152. The 1115 Waiver will add $2,350,064 in funding for a tota l of $3,936,807. The remaining costs will be covered through development efforts of our nonpr ofit agency and self-funding through bonds.

By providing the right care in the right setting, we can provide services that lead to more effective outcomes, thereby preventing complications. Clarity Child Guid ance Center reports PPCs as part of our internal measurement system and also provides hospital provide ra w discharge data to DSHS, through HCIC. In consultation with HHSC, we were advised that our da ta may not be statistically significant since we offer specialized services, and HHSC would report to us as a provider that we are not required to report. At reporting time, if HHS C advises us, we would note that we \"lack sufficient data, as confirmed by HHSC.\" With all of this noted, research does reveal that hospital emergency rooms are the least effective method of creating a therapeutic al liance for a child/adolescent suffe ring from mental illness. By providing the right care in the right setting, we believe we can reduce PPCs. As an example, a local emergency room boards psychiatric patients presenti ng in their hospital in the NICU area, where a child who is suicidal or homicidal has access to syringes and other potentially damaging items. Our setting is safe, secure and nurturi ng in order to create a trusted relationship for therapeutic care.

By providing the right care in the right setting, we can provide services that lead to more effective outcomes, whether medication management related or patient satisfaction. Our internally administered survey approach (based on HCAHPS) for patients who have been hospitalized benchmarks against bot h local and nationally respected organizations. Since we serve children ages 3-17, the caregiver/responsible party completes the survey. Clarity Child Guidance Center created the internal pr ocess several years ago, since HCAHPS does not currently make available a survey for children, which is our prim ary patient. HHSC has a dvised us to report as follows - \"we will not have data to report for Ca t 4 for HCAHPS as the measures currently address adult care.\" However, internal data can be ma de available if required. HCAHPS is conducting field trials for children focused surveys and it's po ssible that by DY5 HCAHPS would have measures related to our patient population, children. We anticipate patient satisfaction a nd medication management to improve as a result of treatment.

Additional primary care clinics and providers will provide care for unassigned patients and will coordinate care with specialist s and hospital emergency departme nt to expand access to health services. The increased access to primary care a nd thus specialty services will allow patients suffering from chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease to have local access to a care. In turn, there will be better coordination between the primary care provider and specialist to prevent hospital admissions. Valuation: One of the community needs addressed in our RHP Pl an is that the high prevalence of chronic disease and related health disparities re quire greater prevention efforts a nd improved management of patients with chronic conditions. Moreover, hospitalization rates are an important indicator of quality of life and patient morbidity. Patients admitted with CHF, COPD, and ESRD caused by diabetes account for the majority of hospitalizations and Medicare expenditures. Measures of the frequency of hospitalization help efforts to c ontrol escalating medical costs, a nd play an important role in providing cost effective healthcare. Additionally, the leading causes of death in Wilson county are rela ted to cardiovascular conditions (30% of all deaths) and heart dise ases (24%). This project and a ssociated outcomes' focus on disease management and risk reduction allows Connally Me morial Medical Center the opportunity to achieve our RHP goals of Improves outcomes while containing cost growth. This projec t will also help meet our goal to assure patient s receive high-quality and patient-cente red care in the most cost effective way. Performing Provider Performing Provider name: Connally Memorial Medical Center TPI: 135151206 Domain 2: entable Readmissions - 30 days Description: Hospital readmission rates have been proposed as an important indicator of quality of care because they may result from actions taken or omitted during the initial hospital stay. A readmission may result from incomplete treatment or poor care of the underlying problem, or may reflect poor coordination of services at the time of discharg e and afterwards, such as incomplete discharge planning and/ or inadequate access to care. This is directly rela ted to our Category 1 project of increasing access to primary care and establishing additional clinics. 1622 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Connally Memorial Medical Center Valuation: The relationship between hospital readmission rates and quality of care is well-documented, and is driven by a general consensus that readmissions may result from circumstances surrounding the initial hospital stay. Readmission rates for the following individual medical conditions: Congestive heart failure, diabetes, COPD, stroke and asthma. All of these conditions ar e identified as community needs in our Regional Health plan. Performing Provider Performing Provider name: Connally Memorial Medical Center TPI: 135151206 Domain 3: Potentially Preventable Complications Description: In Category 1, Connally Memorial Medical Center proposes to esta blish hospital owned and operated primary care clinics. These clinics will provide serv ices for unassigned patien ts and will coordinate care with necessary specialists, and hospital emergency department to expand access to specialty and primary care services. Although, Connally Memorial Medical Center serv es a population of over 40,000 residents there are limitations to our comm unity having the full scope of primary and specialty services and thus being able to prevent certain potential complications. As part of our goal to expand primary care capac ity, CMMC hopes to provide additional services to prevent complications such as stroke and intracr anial hemorrhage. By providing these services we can also work to prevent complications from conge stive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction and cardiac arrhythmias. Valuation: With increasing medical care costs and a weakeni ng economy more attention is being placed upon obtaining value from how health care dollars are sp ent. Initiatives to obtain increased value from health care purchases are especially focused upon perceived waste. The frequency and cost of hospital acquired complications are at the forefront of perceived waste sin ce hospitals, patients and payers are all adversely impacted by their occurren ce. While there have many advances in medicine preventable complications and conditions remain a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients. 1623 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Connally Memorial Medical Center Performing Provider Performing Provider name: Connally Memorial Medical Center TPI: 135151206 Domain 4: Patient-Centered Healthcare Description: An organizational strategy will be developed so th at the Hospital will manage patient experience and create avenues to implement the strategic plan. Pe rformance will be measured by the extent to which patient experience improves systematically. Data and performance measurement will be collected by utilizing patient experience of care measures from the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) in addition to CAHPS and/or ot her systems and methodologies to measure patient experience. The overall goal of this project is to improve how the patient e xperiences care and the patient's satisfaction with the care provided. Valuation: The state healthcare transformation is counting on a robust healthcare system to improve quality as well as the patient experience. Over time, impl emented projects have the potential to yield improvements in outcomes while containing cost gr owth, maintaining a coordinated care delivery system and ensuring patients receive high quality, patient centered care. CMMC will implement a survey of employee experien ce as well as integrating the patient experience into employee training. Integrati ng patient experience into organi zational learning is considered a best practice as it prompts staff to consider the patient experience in all parts of thei r day-to-day job duties. Performing Provider Performing Provider name: Connally Memorial Medical Center TPI: 135151206 Domain 5: Emergency Department Description: Connally Memorial Medical Center will measure th e admit decision time to ED departure time for admitted patients. This measure is important because it measures not only the processes of care that occur while the patient is in the emergency depart ment, but also reflects the coordination of care, communication, and efficiency of service provisi on beyond the walls of the emergency department. These measures also assess the prevalence of \"boardi ng\" which is the length of time a patient actually stays in the ED, after the patient ha s been admitted to the hospital, but before being transferred to an inpatient unit. They are more significant to patient safety and quality and a growing body of evidence has shown that boarding can increase the patient's length of stay in the hospital and can compromise quality care This reporting domain ties in with one of the overa ll aims of the waiver: to reduce inappropriate use of the ED. It also ties with other reporting domains such as creating a strategy for Patient Centered Healthcare and reducing Preventable comp lications. One cause of extended ED departure times results from an overcrowded ED. CMMC inte nds to expand access to primary care for patients who currently are unable to access primary care due to factors such as the lack of primary care providers in the community, and to improve follow-up care for discharged patients diagnosed with chronic health conditions, which CMMC expects w ill reduce the number of inappropriate ED visits 1624 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Connally Memorial Medical Center and therefore allow for better management of ED processes such as admit decisions. Valuation: The value Connally Memorial Medical Center pl aced on this domain is based upon the value the hospital attributes to knowing how well it is currently performing in the ED and to making goals for self-improvement. Long ED wait times can lead to complications, poor outcomes and patient dissatisfaction. The goals of the Waiver are to reduce the cost of providing care and to improve patient health outcomes. Understanding our starti ng point and tracking our improvement is essential to making progress. CMMC values this reporting domain at $71,333 over DY 3-5. 1625 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Connally Memorial Medical Center Category 4: Population-Focused Measures Connally Memorial Medical Center/135151206 Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Capability to Report Category 4 Milestone: Status report submitted to HHSC confirming system capability to report Domains 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6.

Expansion of clinic hours will provide improved healthcare access, which will reduce unnecessary emergency room visits, and admission rates for chronic illnesse s. This will provide a dedicated resource for care to those in the community who are less fortunate, and provide access to me dications to help the management of chronic illness. Category 2 (2.9.1) Establish/Expand a Patient Care Navigation Program aims to establish a patient navigation system to assist high utilizers of the ED to receive coordinated, timely and appropriate healthcare services. Patient navigators will help pa tients and their families navigate the healthcare system and the obstacles that it entails thereby reducing PPA's. Category 2 (2.12.2) Implement/ Expand Care Transitions Program aims to promote the Triple Aim of improving the health of our population, enhanci ng the patient experience of care, and reducing the per capita cost of care. Through the development of a Transitional Care program, targeting patients with a primary diagnosis of CHF, COPD, DM, Pneumonia, as well as being highly sensitive to those uninsured, covered by Medicaid, or at / below the 2012 HHS pove rty level, GRMC will have a positive material effect on said Triple Aim goals. GRMC has identified a gap in care transitions that create potentially preventa ble readmissions. Through a Transitional Care Coordinator and established policy and procedur es GRMC will educate the targeted population, monitor and support through the discharge process to the home, and ensure necessary resources are referred. Category 3 (I.T. 1.10) Expand Existing Primary Care Capacity- Diabetes Care: HbA1c poor control The outcome improvement target to control diabetic HbA1c levels was chosen in conjunction with our process improvement measures of expanding pr imary care access, clinic hours and staffing as a way to make the greatest impact on community need. Due to the high prevalence of uncontrolled di abetic cases in the Seguin community, it was determined that creating a system to identify pati ents through this newly established clinic would assist in providing care and/or management of patients diabetic A1c levels which will assist in reducing PPA's. Valuation: Our rural service area includes many low income and uninsured/under-insured individuals and families. Significantly reducing unnecessary admissi ons will improve the quality of life for our community as well as contribute to the continued viability of our organiza tion and opportunities to expand services. The scope of the Navigation Program project should be categorized as large, due to the various coordination efforts and data colle ction processes that will need to be developed to manage and achieve short and long-term goals. The number of di abetic related ER visits and patient admissions 1628 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Guadalupe Regional Medical Center is frequent do to the lack of primary care access for those patients who ar e uninsured, and unable to pay for their diabetic medications. This populations ' education level also pr esents challenges for long-term success and adds to the complexity of this project, because of their ability to understand the importance of their disease and thei r need to comply with treatment. Performing Provider: Provider Name: Guadalupe Regional Medical Center TPI: 138411709 Domain 2: Potentially Preven table Readmissions - 30 Description: RD2 Potentially Preventable 30 day readmissions for CHF, diabetes, behavioral health and substance abuse, COPD, stroke, a nd pediatric asthma relate to the following categories as outlined below: Category 1 (1.1.2)- project I.T. 1.10 Expand Pr imary Care Capacity will improve primary care access and outcomes of the uninsured population with iden tified chronic illnesses. Expansion of clinic hours will provide improved healthcare access, which will reduce unnecessary emergency room visits, admission and readmission rates for chronic conditions. This will provide a dedicated resource for car e to those in the community who are less fortunate, and provide access to medications to help the management of chronic illness, as well as patients suffering strokes. Category 2 (2.9.1) Establish/Expand a Patient Care Navigation Program will establish a patient navigation system that as sists high utilizers of the ED to receive coordinated, timely and appropriate healthcare services. Patient navi gators will help patients and their families navigate the healthcare system and the obstacles that it entails thereby reducing PPA's and PPR's. Category 2 (2.12.2) Implement/ Expand Care Tr ansitions Program will promote the Triple Aim of improving the health of our population, e nhancing the patient expe rience of care, and reducing the per capita cost of care. Through the development of a Transitional Care program, targeting patients with a primary di agnosis of CHF, COPD, DM, Pneumonia, as well as being highly sensitive to those uninsur ed, covered by Medicaid, or at / below the 2012 HHS poverty level, GRMC will reduce admissions and readmissions. All-cause 30 day readmissions for GRMC re lates to the project expanding primary care capacity, which will provide access to patient care for uninsured populations and promote disease prevention and management of chronic i llnesses, specifically: diabetes. The project to implement/expand care transitions would implement improvements in transitioning patients and coordination of car e from inpatient to outpatien ts, post-acute care, and home care settings, whereby, decreasing readmissions. Lastly, the establishment of a patient care navigation program will assist patients to ma nage their health issues through outpatient resources, clinics and counseling services outside of the acute care setting. Through implementation of these programs GRMC will see a reduction in 30 readmissions and unnecessary Emergency Department visits. 1629 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Guadalupe Regional Medical Center Valuation: Acute care readmissions within 30 days of discha rge create an economic and capacity hardship for the healthcare system. The Cent ers for Medicare and Medicaid Se rvices (CMS) estimates the cost of avoidable readmissions at more than $17 billio n each year. Additionally, such readmissions have a negative impact on the quality of life for patents and their families. The ability to coordinate care across the continuum is increasingly recognized as an indicator of the effectiveness of healthcare organizations. Adequately pr eparing patients for discharge and providing support during the transition process has been shown to contri bute significantly to th at coordination. Our rural service area includes many low income and uninsured/under-insured individuals and families. Significantly reducing readmission rates will improve the quality of life for our community as well as contribute to the continued viability of our organiza tion and opportunities to expand services. The Navigation Program will assist patients through outpatie nt resources, clinics and counseling services outside of the emergency department. The project should be categorized as large, due to the various coordination efforts and data collection processes that will need to be devel oped to manage and achieve short and long-term goals. The number of diabetic rela ted ER visits and patient admissions is frequent do to the lack of primary care access for those patients who are un insured, and unable to pay for their diabetic medications. This populations' educ ation level also presents challenges for long-term success and adds to the complexity of this project, because of their ability to understand the importance of their disease and their need to co mply with treatment. The lack of diabetic resource management in the community is a real issue. By implementing and improvement target, we will help reduce the level of chronic dise ase currently recognized in the community, and hopefully, reduce the fu ture rise of this illness. GRMC is currently receiving no local funding to support the manageme nt of this type of project.

Even though this domain will not affect th e measures, GRMC will report on this domain. Performing Provider: Provider Name: Guadalupe Regional Medical Center TPI: 138411709 Domain 5: Emergency Department Description: Expanding primary care project will provide for care to be provided in an office setting, which will decrease the number of ED visits. Decreasing th e number of ED visits improves ED throughput by decreasing the number of unnecessary visits, which will improve admit decision time to ED departure by increasing the amount of time ED pr oviders have to assess patients and make the decision to admit. RD 5 Emergency department admit decision time to ED departure time for admitted patients relates to GRMC's category 3 project The Navigation Progr am which will assist in the management of behavior health/substance abuse patients through outpatient res ources, clinics and counseling services outside of the emergency department, wh ich will decrease the number of ED patients, allowing providers to decrease the amount of tim e it takes to make a decision to admit. 1631 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Guadalupe Regional Medical Center Valuation: Unnecessary use of the ED is a la rge financial hardship for the inst itution, especially those patients that are uninsured.

Since we will be testing for diabetes, hypertension, colorectal cancer, cervical cancer, obesity, hypertension, and many other conditions in project 136430906.2.1, we will be identifying cases of chronic diseas e in earlier stages than they w ould have otherwise been found, If these conditions are caught early in the disease pro cess, then care can be re ceived in an appropriate setting rather than inpatient admissions becoming necessary. Secondary preventive interventions can be initiated and the patient s can begin to receive care in the appr opriate outpatient setting. If the conditions are not screened for and noted early, patie nts are more likely to end up in the emergency or inpatient setting in either more critical c ondition or because they ha ve no medical home. We anticipate that the number of unins ured individuals with potentia lly preventable admissions will decrease by at least 5% by the e nd of DY5. A decrease of this size would be a cost savings to the community of at least $500,000 base d on average costs of chronic disease care for the target population size. Valuation: The National Quality Forum identifies the value of measuring potentially preventable admissions as: \"A significant portion of all costs incurred by patients and payers in today's healthcare system is due to \"care defects\" - errors , avoidable hospitalizations, and other pr ocess failures that cause patients to incur unnecessary services and some harm. For ex ample, a recent report by the Agency of Health Care Research and Quality (AHRQ) highlighted that, in 2006, 4.4 million out of 39 million (11%) hospital stays could have been pr evented (amounting to $30.8 billion of hospital costs), and one in five admissions for Medicare beneficiaries were for a potentially preventable condition. To improve accountability in the delivery of chronic care, AHRQ has developed a list of prevention quality indicators (PQIs) to identify ambulatory care sens itive conditions (ACSCs) and to measure rates of admissions that could have been potentially avoide d with good outpatient care. While most of these studies (and their associated metr ics) focus on a condition, our appr oach has been to focus on the patient and include all potentiall y avoidable complications that impact that patient. The core principle is to develop a patient-centered metric that creates accountability for all physicians that manage and co-manage the patient - whether they co-manage consciously or not. While cardiologists may feel that they s hould only be responsible for PACs related to a patient's diabetes or lung disease, we consider th at a patient's cardiologist, intern ist, pulmonologist and any other physician should be jointly accountable for the mana gement of the patient's CHF, Diabetes and Asthma, and that any PAC related to any of thes e co-morbid conditions would be counted as such and tagged to each physician. It is only by creating acc ountability in this fashion that we can hope to encourage the true coordination of care and the development of systems of care centered around the patient\" (NATIONAL QUALITY FORU M, National Voluntary Consensus Standards for Patient Outcomes, Measure, Summary Measure Number: OT2 02209, Measure Name: Proportion of patients with a chronic condition th at have a potentially avoidabl e complication during a calendar year). Systems will need to be developed to ensure we ar e appropriately capturing this key data, especially during the transition to ICD 10 coding. So, in add ition to the funding requested for this category, 1635 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country Memorial Hospital Hill Country Memorial Hospital will be providin g an estimated additional $50,000 in staff time and technical systems to support this metric. Performing Provider: Performing Provider name: Hill Country Memorial Hospital TPI: 136430906 Domain 2: Potentially Preventable Readmissions Description: Though preventive care screenings (project 136430906.2.1) that this performing provider has selected for Categories 2 and 3) are not interven tions that directly impact readmissions, it is anticipated that the over all health of the community will im prove through the program. Patients who do not enter the hospital with a chronic condition in the first pl ace because it is being managed appropriately in a medical home, will not have read missions for conditions that are preventable with this kind of care. Though our read mission rate is already at benchm ark performance levels of 5-6% for all cause, 30 day readmissions, we believe that we may see a decr ease in this number as well over the next several years as the health of th e uninsured community improves. Even a slight decrease in readmissions has a major impact on cost to the community. Valuation: The Centers for Medicaid and Medi care Services have reported th e value of readmission reduction: Beyond improving the quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries with chronic conditions\u2014who comprise over 80 percent of all Medicare enrollees\u2014 the CMS Office of the Actuary (OAct) projects that this provision, when fully implemented, will reduce Medicare costs by $8.2 billion from implementation through 2019 (ACA Update, Implemen ting Medicare Cost Savings). The June 2007 MedPAC report to Congress on \"Pro moting Greater Efficiency in Medicare\" highlighted that, in 2005, $12 billion were spent on potentially preventabl e readmissions alone within 30 days of discharge from the hospital. Another study by Jenc ks and colleagues found that roughly 19.6% of Medicare patients incurred re-hospitalizations with in 30 days of discharge. When hospitalizations do occur, they must be managed expeditiously and readmissions following discharge should be avoided. Readmissions after admissions for chroni c conditions such as readmissions after heart failure hospitalizations form a subset of our PA Cs. Some studies have reported readmission rates after heart failure discharge as high as 45% at 6 months (NATIONAL QUALITY FORUM, National Voluntary Consensus Standards for Pa tient Outcomes, Measure, Summary Measure Number: OT2 02209, Measure Name: Proportion of patients w ith a chronic condition that have a potentially avoidable complicat ion during a calendar year). A study of Texas Medicaid readmissions found that the most common reasons for readmission, in ro ughly equal proportions, are medical readmissions for the same condition, medical readmissions for other acute conditions, and readmissions for mental illness or substan ce abuse (Texas Health and Human Services Commission, Potentially Preventabl e Readmissions in the Texas Medi caid Population, Fiscal Year 2009). Hill Country Memorial Hosp ital will be providing an estimated additional $50,000 in staff time and technical systems to support this metric. 1636 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country Memorial Hospital Performing Provider: Performing Provider name: Hill Country Memorial Hospital TPI: 136430906 Domain 3: Potentially Preventable Complications Description: Though it is not directly relate d to the Category 2 project (P roject 136430906.2.1,) that we have submitted, the outcomes in this measure set are rele vant to several projects in our region. Through our learning collaboratives, we l ook forward to learning best practi ces from other providers in our region to improve our care and de crease our rate of complicat ions. Potentially preventable complications are a key focus of Hill Country Me morial Hospital, and we anticipate that the numbers of these events should d ecrease by at least 5% over the next for years. We have a number of teams and initiatives in place to address the comp lication rates at the hospita l, especially surgical site infections, venous thromboembolism, and birth injuries. Preventing even one additional complication is a cost savings of around $10,000. Valuation: High complication rates, after ad justing for patient characteristics and severity of illness, indicate low-quality care, waste, and, therefore, potential cost savings. In fact, the estimated incremental increase in cost per potentially prev entable complication is approximately $10,000. So for every complication that's eliminate d, $10,000 on average is saved and profit margin improves. According to the study, savings gene rated by many of our national improvement priorities can be substantial. For each catheter-related bloodstr eam infection avoided, savings average $18,000 to $22,000 per case. For every decubitus ulcer avoided, $17,500 to $28,000 is saved. Postoperative infections with deep wound disruption costs an additional $14,400, and venous thrombosis costs approximately $11,000 to $16,000. The implications for our hospitals are stagge ring. Potentially preventa ble complications add approximately 9.5 percent to our inpatient cost s, or $88 billion per year to our national healthcare expense, according to the study. (Fuller, R.

Through our learning collaboratives, we l ook forward to learning best practi ces from other providers in our region to improve the patient experience for our cu stomers as well. Our goal is to be in the 95 th percentile on every HCAHPS and Press Ganey indicat or of patient satisfac tion and engagement. The majority of our metrics do fall at or close to this goal. Those that fall shor t are being aggressively addressed through strategic objectiv es. Therefore, we anticipate th at our performance on all four these indicators will improve to at least 95th percentile by the end of the fifth demonstration year. An improvement in the patient experience assures that our community is receiv ing better value care. 1637 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country Memorial Hospital Valuation: The HCAHPS (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Hea lthcare Providers and Systems) survey is the first national, standardized, public ly reported survey of patients' perspectives of hospital care. HCAHPS (pronounced \"H-caps\"), also known as the CAHPS\u00ae Hospital Survey, is a survey instrument and data collection methodology for meas uring patients' percepti ons of their hospital experience. While many hospitals have collected information on patient satisfaction for their own internal use, until HCAHPS there was no national standard for collecting and publicly reporting information about patient experience of care that allowed valid comparisons to be made across hospitals locally, regi onally and nationally. Three broad goals have shaped HCAHPS. First, the survey is designed to produce data about patients' perspectives of care that allow objective and meaningful comparisons of hospitals on topics that are important to consumers. Second, public reporting of the survey results creates new incentives for hospitals to improve quality of care. Third, public repor ting serves to enhance accountability in health care by incr easing transparency of the quality of hospital care provided in return for the public investment. With these goa ls in mind, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the HCAHPS Pr oject Team have taken substant ial steps to assure that the survey is credible, useful, a nd practical. (Centers for Medica re & Medicaid Services (CMS). CAHPS\u00ae Hospital Survey (HCAHP S). Quality assurance guidelines. Version 7.0. Baltimore (MD): Centers for Medicare & Medica id Services (CMS); 2012 Mar. p. 586) Hill Country Memorial Hospital will be providing an estimated additi onal $50,000 in staff time and technical systems to support this metric. Performing Provider: Performing Provider name: Hill Country Memorial Hospital TPI: 136430906 Domain 5: Emergency Department Description: This is not something that is cu rrently systematically measured at Hill Country Memorial Hospital, so beginning to measure and set targets for improvement will have significant positive impact on our ability to see patients quickly and move them to the appropriate leve l of care. Though it is not directly related to the Category 2 (Project 136430906.2.1) or 3 projects that we have submitted, it is similar to several projects in our region. Through our learning collaboratives, we look forward to learning best practices from other providers in our region to improve our care and ED efficiency. Valuation: Reducing the time patients remain in the emerge ncy department (ED) can improve access to treatment and increase quality of care. Reduci ng this time potentially improves access to care specific to the patient condition and increases the capability to provide additional treatment. In recent times, EDs have experienced significan t overcrowding. Although once only a problem in large, urban, teaching hospitals, the phenomenon has spread to other suburban and rural healthcare organizations. According to a 2002 national U.S. surv ey, more than 90% of large hospitals report EDs operating \"at\" or \"over\" cap acity. Approximately one third of hospitals in the U.S. report increases in ambulance diversion in a given year, whereas up to ha lf report crowded conditions in the ED. In a recent national survey, 40% of hosp ital leaders viewed ED cr owding as a symptom of workforce shortages. ED crowding may result in dela ys in the administration of medication such as antibiotics for pneumonia and has been associated with perceptions of compromised emergency 1638 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country Memorial Hospital care. For patients with non-ST-segment-eleva tion myocardial infarction, long ED stays were associated with decreased use of guideline-reco mmended therapies and a higher risk of recurrent myocardial infarction. Overcrowdi ng and heavy emergency resource demand have led to a number of problems, including ambulance refusals, prolo nged patient waiting times, increased suffering for those who wait, rushed and unpleasant treatment environments, and potentially poor patient outcomes. When EDs are overwhelmed, their abili ty to respond to community emergencies and disasters may be compromised (Specifications manual for national hospital inpatient quality measures, version 3.1a. Centers for Medicare & Me dicaid Services (CMS), The Joint Commission; 2010 Apr 1. various p.). Hill Country Memorial Hosp ital will be providing an estimated additional $50,000 in staff time and technical syst ems to support this metric. 1639 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Hill Country Memorial Hospital Category 4: Population-Focused Measures Hill Country Memorial Hospital / 136430906 Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Capability to Report Category 4 Milestone: Status report submitted to HHSC confirming system capability to report Domains 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6.

For the diagnoses with a denominator of reside nts > 18 years old living in RHP counties (CHF, uncontrolled diabetes, diabetes long term comp lications, COPD, HTN,) we will use our EHR (electronic health record) to determine the numer ator value of patients discharged. We do not qualify for metrics involving RHP primary clinics such as the diabetic short term complication denominator (2. i. Diabetes, short term complica tions (derived from AHRQ PQI #1) . For behavioral health and substance abuse admission rate, we will use our EHR to determine the patients and rates. For pediatric asthma, we will track ED visits by our ED EHR. Once these rates and patients are identified, we can target selected patients and patients living in se lected zip codes within the RHP counties to admit at risk patients to our navigator programs through hospital based navigators (CHF) and home care pa rtners (all others) to coordinate a Medical Home and appropriate outpatient care to reduce potentially avoidable admissions. We expect to improve preventable admissions in DYs 2-5 by using these reporting requi rements and making improvements to clinical care. We will continue our current physician-approved management protocols, tracking and reporting for Bacterial Pneumonia and Influenza Immunization rates in hospitalized patients.

A number of studies have demonstrated that improvement s in care at the time of patient discharge can reduce 30-day readmission rates. 19,20,22,27-34,38 Hospitals, in collaboration with their medical communities, can take a number of actions to reduce readmissions: ensure patients are clinically ready at discharge; reduce risk of infection; reconcil e medications; improve communications among providers involved in tran sition of care; encourage strategies that promote disease management principles; and ed ucate patients about symptoms to monitor, whom to contact with questions, and where and when to seek follow-up care. 19,20,22,27-34,38 Studies also show that it can ta ke more than 14 days for the bene fits of these interventions to appear.39 (source: National Quality Forum Measure Submission and Evaluation Worksheet 5.0) 30-day timeframe is consistent with the ot her CMS readmission measures approved by the National Quality Forum (NQF) and publicly reported by CMS. Factors most relevant to readmission risk: o medication reconciliation o patient education o post- discharge follow up o communication with outpatient clinicians How this relates to categories 1, 2 & 3 o As addressed in category 1, expanding Te lemedicine/Telehealth programs for patients, so they may be able to access specialty care programs, and expanding specialty care capacity in the emergenc y departments, may assist in reducing readmissions. 1643 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Methodist Hospital o As addressed in categories 2 & 3, impr oving patient experience may help in reducing readmissions as the following areas can direc tly reduce readmission rates: quality of care during the initial admissi on; improvement in communication with patients, their caregivers and their clinic ians; patient education; predischarge assessment; and coordination of care after discharge .

MHS has a system reporting potentially avoidabl e complication with a focus on AHRQ Patient Safety Indicator software since 2009. This has allowed us to identify and track many of these complications that have been identified as AHRQ PSI s. We have developed specific procedures and protocols to reduce those th at were above national rates such as pressure sores, falls, central line associated blood steam infections, etc. We have also been able to participate in several improvement projects through MHS hos pital network. There are additio nal complications listed in this project that we have not been tracking. The funding from this project will allow us to include these additional complications and apply our demonstrated performance improvement methodologies to reduce these complications. This will require an attentive focus from our Quality Improvement and Patient Care teams. We expect to improve potentially preventable complications in DYs 2-5 by using these reporting measures and adjusting clinical care as necessary.

By measuring the frequency of these types of hospitalizations among patient subpopulations, PRMC and its providers can identify those areas most in need of improvements in discharg e teaching and education as well as post- hospitalization follow-up from the discharge ad vocate (DA). Rates of potentially preventable hospitalizations are higher for vulnerable populat ions with limited access to care. During the patients hospitalization the DA can target issues in access to primary care that may serve to narrow disparities in health outcomes and improve the quality of care while reducing costs. Hospitalizations for diabetes complications are generally considered preventable with high-quality health care and patien t adherence to treatment. C linical studies suggest that prevention activities, quality outpatient care, and greater patient self-management of diabetes may prevent or reduce the prevalence of cardiova scular disease, lower extremity amputations, and multiple hospitalizations associated with diabetes. Patient self-management\u2014taking medications appropriately, controlling blood suga r levels, and managing diet with regular exercise\u2014are important components an important component of the DA's patient education of diabetes care. With appropriate primary care for diab etes complications, nearly $2.5 billion in hospital costs might have been averted, with sign ificant potential savings obtained in Medicare ($1.3 billion of total costs) and Medicaid ($386 million of total costs). PRMC's Health care/system redesign invol ves making systematic changes to chronic care management, transition of care, and patien t discharge planning to improve the quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of patient care. Frameworks, models, and concepts such as the Chronic Care Model and the evidence based ca re transition/discharge model, Patient Re- Engineered Discharge (Project RED), can be us ed together to reorganize care delivery for the purpose of improving patient outcomes. The redesign of these practices includes the following: Adopting strategies for transforming our prac tice to improve quality, reduce costs, and better satisfy the needs of patients and families. Include preventive services and self-managem ent support into patient care and discharge teaching. Empowering all clinic staff to suggest a nd help implement effective changes. Develop leadership for change and ongoing quality improvement. Involvement of the DA, Chronic Diseas e Educator, and the Care Coordination Department to help with the pr ocess of health care redesign Diabetes is one chronic c ondition whose treatment and outcomes are heavily dependent on how well the patient monitors and manages the disease outside the health care setting. An important approach to quality improvement for diabetes is improving pa tient self-management. Project RED will emphasize and focus on patient education and behavior modification. The DA will work with patients to build their confid ence in managing their own disease, in working within the health care system and the community to have their needs met, and in managing the emotional effects of their illness prior to being discharged from the hospital. Patients are 1657 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Peterson Regional Medical Center informed about their disease and trained using evidence-based information in how they should manage their condition. Thus, the DA using the discharge model, Project RED, emphasizes a collaborative approach among hea lth care teams to develop new a nd better clinical procedures and systems that support providers and patient s in treating and managing chronic illness over time. When patients that are considered high risk for a preventable admission come into the hospital, the triage nurse can alert the emergenc y department case manager or if available, the DA whom discharged the patient during their last hospital admissi on. Patients who meet criteria for an intervention include patients who were disc harged from the hospital in the past 30 days, or have had five emergency departme nt visits in the last year, th ose who are homeless, living in a shelter, or who have tenuous housing situations. These \"patient navigators\" can meet with the patient before he or she is evaluated by the phys ician. They work with the physician to determine an alternative to hospitalization by arranging se rvices in the community. We will emphasize to the emergency department staff and physic ians that we are not telling them not to admit patients if they need it, but that we are working with th em to provide resources to prevent an unnecessary admissions if reasonable. Some admissions are not preventative because patients have complex medical conditions that require a hospital stay, but by having case managers in the emergency department and the discharge advocates collaborating with the clinicians and provid ing feedback to the people who take care of the person at home and/or in the outpatient setting (home health, primary care provider, etc.), we can establish continuity in care across settings and into the community. This program will play a significant role in changing the mindset of the emergency department team. It will give them the confidence and comfort le vel to discharge people back to the community when resources are in place and available for th e patients use. Changes in these potentially preventable admission rates over time should sign al an improvement in the quality of our ambulatory care environment, patient access to ti mely and effective treatment, or in patient adoption of healthy behaviors. Valuation: Please see last page for narrative on Valuation Performing Provider Provider name: Peterson Re gional Medical Center TPI: 127294003 Domain 2: Potentially Preven table Readmissions - 30 days Description: Hospital readmissions are an important measur e for assessing performance of the health care system. One strategy for improving health ca re quality and lowering costs is to reduce the rates of preventable readmissions. Health care co sts are three times higher for diabetes patients with multiple hospitalizations as compared to diabet es patients with a single stay in a given year. Patients with diabetes who are racial/ethnic minor ities, enrolled in public insurance programs, or living in low-income communities are more likel y to experience multiple hospitalizations and have higher hospital costs th an their counterparts. According to Pat Rutherford , RN, MS, vice president at the Institute for Healthcare 1658 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Peterson Regional Medical Center Improvement, hospitals can improve patients' discharge from th e hospital by enhancing current discharge processes and by maki ng the following changes: Gain a deeper understanding of the comprehe nsive post-discharge needs of the patient through an ongoing dialogue with the fam ily, caregivers, and community providers. Gain a deeper understanding of patient a nd family caregiver comprehension of the clinical condition and self- care needs after discharge. Develop a post-acute care plan based on the a ssessed needs and capabi lities of the patient and family caregivers. Effectively communicate post-acute care pl ans to patients and community-based providers of care. A readmission may result from incomplete treatment or poor care of the underlying problem, or may reflect poor coordination of servi ces at the time of discharge and afterwards, such as incomplete discharge planning and/ or inadequate access to care. Assessing the reason for readmissions is important not only as quality screens, but also because they are expensive, consuming a disproportionate share of expenditu res for inpatient hospital care. The DAs can therefore focus their attention on the critical time of a patient's acute illness when the patient is in transition between inpatient and outpatient phases of treatment. PRMC's hospital administrators and patient care unit directors vi ew discharge planning as a major part of the solution to meet thei r financial woes, assuming that good discharge planning will reduce costs and increase reimbursement. Equally important, patients, and families value the discharge planning process, which ha s become a significant quality indicator for institutional accreditation. Specifically, JCAHO has established expectations that health care providers coordinate care and incl ude patients in their planning of care, and has emphasized that the hospital staff should recognize that they are one part of an inte grated system of health care practitioners, settings , and services. Another key to the success of Project RED is to encourage patients and their family members or caregivers to ask questions and then as k them questions to veri fy their understanding of what they were just taught. The idea is to communicate to patients frequently, that it's important to us that they ask questions and unders tand the answer. Some of our patients, in the past, have made comments about not wanting to ask questions because they feel that they're being a burden when they ask them. PRMC and its staff will constantly reinforce that we want them to ask any questions they have so they can know as much as possible when/before, they go home. The entire staff, including th e non-clinical staff, such as social workers and dieticians, will reinforce the need for patients to ask questions when they make rounds and invite them to ask questions. In addition to writing the discharge orders, physicians reconcile medication, and if the patients are getting new medication the DAs will make sure, they understand which medications at home they should continue to take or stop taking. The DAs will also call patients two days after discharge to make sure that all the patients ' questions are answered, and to find out if there are other issues, such as home health worker s not showing up or worsening in their condition that might potentially cause them to need to retu rn to the hospital. They make sure the patients have a number to call with questions and c oncerns, and they have their medication and understand how to take it. Using Project RED, the DA will educate the patient and their family members or caregivers on the patient's reconciled medication list they will receive at discharge and the transition record (with all elements to be received by the patients PCP and specified elements to be received by patient/family/car egiver). Project RED's compone nts include timely transmission 1659 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Peterson Regional Medical Center of transition record to the PCP and/or any other agencies providi ng post discharge patient care. Elements of the patients tr ansition record will include: 1. Principal diagnosis and problem list (PCP and patient) 2.

Up to about $2.5 billion\u2014roughly two-thirds of the total\u2014might have been averted with appropria te primary care for individuals with diabetes complications. A significant amount of these poten tial savings might have been obtained from public insurance programs. The Medicare progr am had the largest share of potentially preventable costs\u2014$1.3 billion was attributable to diabetes-relate d hospital costs. Costs to the Medicaid program for potentially prev entable hospital stays were $386 million. As diabetes rates continue to rise in our community, substantia l gaps in care for diabetes exist, preventable complications occur all too fr equently, and the Nation is paying the price in higher health care costs and lowe r productivity and quality of life. Diabetes is the sixth most expensive condition nationally (C ohen and Krauss, 2003). On averag e, medical expenditure for a person with diabetes in 2002 cost more than $13,000 per year versus ju st $2,500 for the average person without diabetes (Hogan, Dall, Nikolov, 2003) . About half of the lifetime, health care costs for patients with diabetes are related to potentially preventable complications (Herman and Eastman, 1998). AHRQ also reports that diabet es has tremendous impact on both public and private health care spending and on the quality of life for t hose diagnosed with the disease. Yet Type 2 Diabetes, the most common form of diabetes, can be prevented and controlled. It is not inevitable that more Americans develop diabetes as they ag e, nor is it inevitable th at people with diabetes experience the long-term complications such as lower limb amputations, kidney failure, and premature death. As the health care reform unfolds, PRMC lik e many other hospitals are looking for ways to control costs while maintaining or improvi ng quality. By implementing Project RED and disease management program targeting diabetes, we seek to increase patient knowledge and self- management skills and implement technology to tr ack patients more effectively. Improved care management for diabetes is aimed at decreasi ng preventable complicatio ns, thereby controlling 1660 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Peterson Regional Medical Center costs and potentially improving long term health outcomes. A few of our goals in implementing this project include: Prevention of acute and long-term diabetic complications Providing quality of diabetes care to our community An intervention and treatment that can potenti ally prevent development of complications for diabetics The potential for return on investment for our health care system as a whole with diabetes quality improvement The presence of too much glucose in th e blood causes damage to blood vessels and, subsequently, to nerves, organs, and tissues; over time this results in various long-term complications, including: heart disease, hypertension, heart a ttacks, stroke, nerve damage, lower limb ulcers, eye problems and bli ndness, kidney disease or failure , critically high or low glucose levels and many other complications. None of th e complications listed is a predestined outcome of having diabetes. With quality care and pr oper self-management education provider with Project RED, individuals with diabetes can prev ent or delay the onset of these complications.

Project RED was f ounded on 12 discrete and mutually reinforcing components, and has been proven to reduce rehos pitalizations and yield high rates of patient satisfaction. It contains inte rventions that are patient-cent ered, and allows for a more standardized approach to disc harge planning. Initially develope d through research conducted by Dr. Brian Jack of the Boston University Me dical Center and funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Project RED improves patient preparedness for self care and reduces preventable readmissions. It is an in-hospital discha rge planning and case management protocol for patients and incorporates many principles of patient-centeredness and se lf-care aimed at improving the patient's preparedness for self care and at reducing the likelihood of readmission. This intervention is a patient-centered, standardized approach to discharge planning and discharge education. Proper health care and patient em powerment can help control and minimize the complications of diabetes for those who have the disease. Diabetes is a complicated chronic condition that requires patients to take charge of many aspects of their care. Project RED will encourag e good patient self-management after discharge; this has been shown to decrease the rates of di abetes complications in other hospitals already using this model. Providing adequate info rmation, good patient-physician communication, and the use of participatory decisi are critical to enhanc ing patient self-management. 1661 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Peterson Regional Medical Center Measures that assess patients' satisfaction wi th the information they are provided and the adequacy of self-management support will be consid ered as additions to technical measures for the evaluation of Project RED's quality Patient self-management is particularly impor tant for managing diabetes and preventing complications. Studies have demonstrated that patient self-management programs that include measures which are also used in Project RED ar e effective tools for improving patient outcomes. One Stanford University study funded by AHRQ found th at over a 2-year peri od participants in a chronic disease self-management program showed reductions in health distress, made fewer visits to the doctor's office and emergency room , had not experienced any further increases in disability and had increased se lf-efficacy (Lorig, Ritter, Stewart, et al., 2001). Systematic reviews of the literature on self-management programs for diabetes found positive effects on patients' knowledge, self-monitoring of blood gl ucose, diet, and glycemic (Norris, Caspersen, et al., 2002; Norris, Engelgau, Narayan, 2001). Valuation: Please see last page for narrative on Valuation Performing Provider Provider name: Peterson Re gional Medical Center TPI: 127294003 Domain 5: Emergency Department Description: Emergency departments (EDs) are an important consideration in t oday's health policy dialogue. Previous studies note that annual ED visits have increased over time, while reimbursement for emergency care by insurers has steadily decreased. These challenges are magnified in rural areas, which typically have fewer health ca re resources, including medical staff, facilities, adequate fina ncing, and modern technologies. Our healthcare system will make system wide changes to better manage patients who have chronic disease such as diabetes; have em ergency physicians work w ith case managers and community-based services; and im prove collaboration between th e emergency and primary-care teams. Using Project RED, hospital stays could possibly be prevented with better ambulatory care, improved access to effec tive treatment, or patient adoption of healthy behaviors. Proactively engaging a population of patients a nd focusing on their health goals, needs, and abilities to achieve desired health outcomes. Reducing hospital admission rates for uncontro lled diabetes and for the short-term complications of diabetes, as with most othe r preventable hospital admissions, can be achieved by proper outpatient treatment and patient adhe rence to recommended care. Uncontrolled high blood or low blood sugar ultimately results in li fe-threatening short-term and/or long-term complications. While transition programs show promise in helping hospitals reduce their readmission rates, predictive models are also being used successfully in tandem with these programs. One AHRQ-sponsored study conducted by Stanford University researchers showed that 2 years after participating in a se lf-management program, study partic ipants showed reductions in health distress, made fewer visits to th e doctor's office and emergency room, had not 1662 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Peterson Regional Medical Center experienced any further increases in disability, and had increased self-efficacy (Lorig, Ritter, Stewart, et al., 2001).

Category 4 VALUATION for ALL Domain Measures Valuation: Deciding which health care options represent best value for money depends on being able to weigh up the benefits and costs of each. Given a fixed budge t, spending on one option means those same resources cannot be used in anot her way. That is, every decision carries an opportunity cost - the benefits th at would have been possible from the next best alternative use of them. Weighing up the benefits possible from each potential option imposes the important requirement that the benefits be measured in a comparable way. This task requires an evaluation of the costs and effects (outco mes) of different treatments. The measure, known as the quality, weights the outcome of an in tervention also to include the patient's perception/e xperience of that intervention a nd its outcome. Assessing value for money in health care involves evaluating the change in quality that is caused by the treatment relative to the cost of achieving those quality gains. Patient repor ted outcome measures are now beginning to capture important aspe cts of health care's impact on the things that patients most value their mental wellbeing, their ability to carry out normal physical ac tivities, understanding of their disease and treatment of it, their discha rge experience and so on. Healthcare process improvements, like any other area of public po licy, have to be about making people's lives better. Outcome measures designed for use in healthca re services provide a way of monitoring impact of innovative patient care models and to compare the impact of diffe rent interventions to evaluate their impact on patient outcomes as we ll as their value on health care costs. The ultimate goal of quality measurement in diabet es is to motivate quality improvement and decrease long-term diabetes complications with in and throughout our community and those that 1663 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Peterson Regional Medical Center surround it. There is evidence that some improvements in processes of care are motivated by the quality monitoring process itsel f, especially when incentives for better performance were incorporated. We anticipate seeing this once Pr oject RED has been implemented. Project RED has been demonstrated to be effective in ensuri ng patients have clear a nd correct instructions, solid education and appropriate follow up care that result in mee ting the needs of each of these quality measures in some way, shape or form. Th is project will allow PRMC to help patients realize the value of this evidence based approach while improving the quality of their care in our health care system.

Through the goal of improving access to specialty care, the project will impact the following: - Enhance availability of resources to asse ss and refer residents of rural communities for cardiovascular healthcare resulti ng from mobile screening assessment, which could also result in incidental recognition/det ection of signs and symptoms of CHF, adult COPD/asthma, new onset of diabetes and hypertension. - By early recognition/detection, referral and treatment of thes e disease processes this could decrease ED utilization and inpa tient admissions thru early inte rvention and management as an outpatient. - Pneumococcal and influenza vaccination screeni ng could be included in the mobile screening assessment. Project 2 - Through the development of a Gestational Di abetes Program for RHP 6 region, pregnant women at risk for or diagnosed with gestational diabetes will have access to high-quality, patient centered care with the goal of impr oved outcomes for mother and baby. Through the goal of early identification, management and education of gestational diabetes in the pregnant woman, the pr oject could result in: - A decrease in hospital admissions due to undia gnosed gestational diabetes and/or resultant stillbirths. -A decrease in hospital days for both mo ther and baby for birth of newborn. - A decrease in babies admitted to the NICU due to premature delivery, low birth weight and birth trauma related to diabetes in pregnancy. -A decrease in fetal deaths due to undiagnosed or poorly manage d gestational diabetes in the pregnant woman. Through the implementation of a structured Gesta tional Diabetes program involving Obstetricians and Maternal Fetal Medicine physicians, perinatal nur ses and a diabetic educat or pregnant women in the RHP6 region would have access to care on a flexible outpatient basis that would meet their needs. Valuation: Project 1 -The approach for valuing each domain and rationale/justification would be as follows: CHF- currently the hospital participates in Core Measure (HF is one of the measures) reporting through CMS. The number of CHF cases identified and referred through in cidental recognition and intervention during the mob ile assessment screening could be tracked and compared to the number of the CHF patients admitted at our facility. Cost avoidance would be evidenced each time early diagnosis, intervention, referral and treatment was provided that resulted in avoidance of ED utilization and/or hospital admission. Adult COPD/asthma and hypertension- The number of COPD/ast hma and hypertension cases identified and referred through incidental recognition and inte rvention could be tracked and compared to the number of the COPD/asthma and hype rtensive patients admitted and treated at our facility for the same time peri od through utilization of CPT code s. Cost avoidance would be 1667 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Southwest General Hospital evidenced each time early diagnosis , intervention, referral and trea tment was provided that resulted in avoidance of ED utilization and/or hospital admission for these diagnoses. Diabetes- Currently Healthways, Inc. manages the Diabet es Service Line within the facility. The number of newly diagnosed cas es identified and referred thro ugh incidental recognition and intervention during the mob ile assessment screening could be tracked and compared to the number of the newly diagnosed patients admitted and treat ed at our facility. The project scope would include adults diagnosed with newly diagnosed diabetes within RHP 6. Pneumococcal and influenza vaccination -By providing pneumococcal and influenza vaccines through the mobile specialty care un it screening this would provide another avenue for the targeted population to receive preventative care. The nu mber of patients admitted for pneumonia and influenza could be tracked, trended and compared to previous years to determine if this additional vaccination site impacted ED utiliz ation as well as hospital. Project 2 - The project for Southwest General Hospital is designed to increase the capacity to provide specialty care services and the availabil ity of targeted specia lty providers to better accommodate the high demand for services and thus have increased access to services. Southwest General Hospital will develop and implement a Gestational Diabetes program to educate and monitor patients, therefore, improving fetal outcomes. Valuation could be realized thru: -Number of ED visits and hos pital admissions resulting from undiagnosed or poorly managed gestational diabetes could be monitored, measured and compared to present as well as previous years admissions. -Number of births admitted to NICU of mothers with gestational diabetes could be monitored, measured and compared to present as well as previous years admission. -Number of clinic visits and referrals could be monitored and m easured to determine utilization of program by pregnant women in the RHP 6 region. Performing Provider Performing Provider name: S outhwest General Hospital TPI: 136491104 Domain 2: Potentially Prev entable Readmissions - 30 days Description: Project 1 The Mobile Cardiovascular Screening Program will contribute to assuring patients receive high-quality, patient centered care with the goal of improved access to care to support the identification and intervention for cardiovascul ar problems and any other disease processes incidentally identified during the assessment pr ocess such as CHF, COPD/asthma, new onset of diabetes and hypertension. By incidental recognition/detection, referral and treatment of these disease processes ED utilization and inpatient admissions could be decreased as well as readmissions thru early intervention and management as an outpatient. Since many of the patients treated within RH P 6 have co-morbidities any incidental 1668 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Southwest General Hospital identification and management during the mob ile screening possess co uld potentially avoid an acute exacerbation of the co-morbidity thus decreasing ED utilization and possible hospital admission. By providing easier and more convenient acce ss to services such as pneumococcal and influenza vaccines the incidence of pneumonia and flu cases should be decreased in RHP 6 and thus resulting in decreased ED utiliz ation and hospital admi ssion not only by person screened but by avoidance of transmission of disease to others due to having been vaccinated. Project 2 Of the 7 potentially preventable readmissions listed the impact that the Gestational Diabetes program and clinic would have the greatest im pact on would be diabetes. With screening, identification, education and provision of pren atal care for the pregnant woman with gestational diabetes this could greatly decrease preventable readmissions. Unless pre-existing conditions of CHF, Behavior al Health and Substa nce Abuse, COPD and Stroke existed in population domai n measures would be exempt. Valuation: Project 1 The valuation for this domain is not applicable as this does not pertain to the vascular screening mobile assessment project which is outpatient. Project 2 To evaluate the usage and effectiveness of the Ge stational Diabetes program by pregnant women of the RHP 6 region readmissions due to diabetes would need to be monitored. Internal reports already available could be utilized without additional costs. Performing Provider Performing Provider name: Southwest General Hospital TPI:136491104 Domain 3: Potentially Preventable Complications Description: Project 1 -The potentially preventable complications re lated to the mobile specialty care unit for vascular screening relate to the decrease in ED utilization and hosp ital admission. By early recognition and outpatient management of not only cardiovascular dise ase but any incidental disease processes identified during the screening the multip le complications associated with inpatient admission could be prevented to include: Pneumonia and Other Lung Infections Pulmonary Embolism Shock Venous Thrombosis Clostridium Difficile Colitis 1669 RHP 6 Plan March 2013 Southwest General Hospital Urinary Tract Infection Decubitus Ulcer Other Complications of Medical Care Inflammation and Other Complica tions of Devices, Implants or Grafts Except Vascular Infection Infection, Inflammation and Clot ting complications of Periphe ral Vascular Catheters and Infusions Infections Due to Central Venous Catheters Since the cardiovascular screen ing is non-invasive none of the above preventable complications would be applicable, whereas an ED visit or inpa tient admission could potentia lly be susceptible to the above complications during the course of treatment. Project 2- Of the potentially preventable complications listed expected improvements would be seen in the following for those pregnant women who accessed and utilized the services offered by the Gestational Diabetes clinics: Pulmonary embolism Shock Urinary Tract Infection Poisonings due to Anesthesia Transfusion Incompatability Reaction Post-operative Infection and Deep Wound Disruption with Procedure Diabetic Ketoacidosis and Coma Obstetrical Hemorrhage without transfusion Obstetrical Hemorrhage with Transfusion Obstetric Lacerations and other Trauma without Instrumentation Obstetric Lacerations and other Trauma With Instrumentation Medical and Anesthesia Obstetric Complications Major Puerperal Infection and Other Major Obstetric Complications Other Complications of Obstetrica l Surgical and Perineal Wounds Delivery with Placental Complications Other In-Hospital Adverse Events Valuation: Project 1 Refer to Project Description, Starting Point/Baseline, Rationale and Related Category 3 Outcome Measure and Project Valuation for specific size factor, proj ect scope, populations served, community benefit, cost avoidance, addressi ng community need and estimated local funding. Project 2 The potentially preventable compli cations listed above do not direct ly pertain to the Gestational Diabetes Program and clinic but to the result ant hospitalization for mo ther and baby upon delivery of the newborn. The above could be tracked and tr ended for those pregnant women with gestational diabetes who utilized the services and resources re lated to the Gestational Diabetes Program versus those that did not. 1670 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Southwest General Hospital Performing Provider Performing Provider name: Southwest General Hospital TPI: 136491104 Domain 4: Patient-Centered Healthcare Description: Projects 1 and 2 The reporting of Patient Satisfact ion and Medication Management measures are limited to the inpatient setting.

In addition, the project will faci litate hospitalization for TB care of those patients who cannot be successfully treated as outpatients, ther eby reducing the risk of disease spread. The Category 2 metrics for this project include I-7-1 : Increase the percentage of relevant minority target populations in RHP 6 by 3% over baseline a nd I-7.2: Increase the numb er of encounters as defined by the intervention. The related Category 3 Improvement Target is: IT-11.1 Improvement in the clinical indicator in the identified Disparity Group Category 4 RD 1-3 Do not apply to this demonstration project becau se, as a specialty hospital the number of preventable admissions, readmissions, and potentially preventable complications is statistically insignificant for reporting purposes. As such, the appropriate Category 4 measure th at will demonstrate improvement resulting from program implementation is Domain 4: Patient Centered Healthcare. Within Domain 4 the standardized Patient Satisfaction Tool, HCAHPS will be used to assess patient satisfaction with the categories of interaction with the healthcare syst em and providers. Critic al to the successful management of TB for those patients who require hospitalization is adherenc e to the patient care plan. Therefore, the Domain 4 category of Medica tion Management is the second metric that will be used for Category 4 reporting. RD5 - Emergency Department reporting does not appl y. This specialty hospital does not have an emergency department. Valuation: TB continues to be a significant and expensive pub lic health issue in Texas. The project includes targeted testing for latent TB infection (LTB I), effective treatment of LTBI in order to prevent future cases, case identification with referral for appropriate therapy (inpatie nt or outpatient) with aggressive contact invest igation. The project will be implemented in RHP 6 to demonstrate a model of case identification and treatment delivery that is effective in reducing the spread of the disease while providing better health outcomes with improved patient satisfaction . Minority populations especially th ose who are poor, continue to e xperience an undue burden of this chronic, infectious disease. Effective new tr eatment regimens are available however, not implemented broadly enough at this time to reduce the spread of the disease. People who do not have access to primary care servic es are the least likely to be di agnosed with LTBI and therefore, present a risk for spreading as well as developi ng the disease. This creates an unnecessary burden on the healthcare system that can be managed and a voided. The valuation of th is project is justified 1674 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Texas Center for Infectious Disease based on the following elements that will improve access to care, improve patient satisfaction, reduce health care costs, improve the health of populations, and provide access to specialty consultation 24 hours per day, seven days per week. The project will serve residents of one large urban region of Texas The project will be provided through the Texa s Center for Infectious Disease which specializes in treatment of tuberculosis. Targets minority populations who ar e at highest risk for disease exposure and spread with an evidence-base, cost-effective management and prevention strategy Provides enhanced access to comprehe nsive, fully integrated TB care This approach will reduce the current and futu re financial burden on the healthcare system by contributing to the decline of TB rates among Texas residents. 1675 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Texas Center for Infectious Disease Category 4: Population-Focused Measures Texas Center for Infectious Disease / 133257904 Year 2 (10/1/2012 - 9/30/2013) Year 3 (10/1/2013 - 9/30/2014) Year 4 (10/1/2014 - 9/30/2015) Year 5 (10/1/2015 - 9/30/2016) Capability to Report Category 4 Milestone: Status report submitted to HHSC confirming system capability to report Domains 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6.

As such, VVRMC has chosen DSRIP projects that will a im to expand access to care, both primary and specialty care. RD-1 (potentially preventable admissions) ought to be favorably impacted\u2014all other things equal\u2014by virtue of having more prim ary care providers and specialists among the community. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) Admission rate - related to : 119877204.1.1, 119877204.1.2, 119877204.1.3. All three projects have th e potential to reduce the hosp ital's CHF admission rate. In 119877204.1.1, VVRMC will expand primary care capacit y. This increased access to primary care providers should correlate with a higher percen tage of the population re ceiving regular health screenings and check-ups. As primary care capac ity expands, providers will have more time to ensure best practices (e.g. patie nt follow-up) are followed concer ning chronic disease management. This will improve CHF prevention efforts and may reduce the CHF admission rate. In, 119877204.1.2 specialty care capacity will be expanded. One targeted specialty for expansion is cardiology. Increasing patient access to cardiologist s has the potential to reduce CHF admissions through prevention and disease management. In 119877204.1.3, a telemedicine program will be developed for specialties where permanent sp ecialist recruitment is not feasible (see 119877204.1.2). This may include cardiology, in whic h case a telemedicine program allowing access to a cardiologist should have so me impact on the CHF admission rate. Diabetes Admission Rates - related to : 119877204.1.1. Implementing 119877204.1.1 will increase primary care capacity. This increase in access to primary care may correlate with an increased percentage of the population who receive regular screenings and check-ups. As primary care capacity expands, providers will have more time to ensure best practices (e.g. patient follow-up) are followed concerning chronic diseas e management. This will improve diabetes prevention efforts and has the potential to redu ce diabetes admission rates Behavioral Health and Substance Abuse Admission rate - related to: 119877204.1.2, 119877204.1.3 The behavioral health measure stands to be improved upon by virtue of adding specialists in our service area that are experts in psychiatry. Like most rural communities, Del Rio is lacking an abundance of behavioral health specialists. If we are successful in bringing more resources to our community, reduced utilization of hospital inpatient and ER services is likely (i.e. potential reductions in the beha vioral health and substance abus e admission rate). If recruiting a psychiatrist (119877204.1.2) is not fe asible for our region, then accessing this specialty through a telemedicine program may occur (119877204.1.3). Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease or Asthma in Adults Admission rate - related to : 119877204.1.1. Implementing 119877204.1.1 will increase primary care capacity. This increase in access to primary care may correlate with an incr eased percentage of th e population who receive regular screenings and check-ups. As primary care capacity expands, providers will have more time to ensure best practices (e.g. patient follo w-up) are followed con cerning chronic disease 1693 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Val Verde Regional Medical Center management. This will improve COPD and Asthma prevention/management efforts and has the potential to reduce admission rates for these conditions. Hypertension Admission rate - related to : 119877204.1.1. Implementing 119877204.1.1 will increase primary care capacity. This increase in access to primary care may correlate with an increased percentage of the population who receive regular screenings and check-ups. As primary care capacity expands, providers will have more tim e to ensure best practices (e.g. patient follow- up) are followed concerning chronic disease management. This will improve Hypertension prevention/management efforts and has the poten tial to reduce admission ra tes for these conditions. Pediatric Asthma - related to : 119877204.1.1 Implementing 119877204.1.1 will increase primary care capacity. This increase in access to primary car e may correlate with an increased percentage of the population who receive regular screenings and check-ups. As primary care capacity expands, providers will have more time to ensure best practices (e.g. patient follow-up) are be followed concerning chronic disease management. This will improve Pediatric Asthma management efforts and has the potential to reduce ad mission rates for these conditions. Bacterial pneumonia immunization - related to : 119877204.1.1 This project will provide greater access to primary care providers. This should in crease the number of people who receive the bacterial pneumonia immunization. Influenza Immunization - related to : 119877204.1.1 This project will provide greater access to primary care providers. This shoul d increase the number of pe ople who receive the influenza immunization. Valuation: When considering how to weigh the value of reporting and improving in five key areas: preventable admissions, 30-day readmissions, complicat ions, patient experience and ED, we decided to weigh the five equally. In many respects, they are intertwined. As the team mobilizes resources to prepare for these projects, it will not be difficult to have the experts address multiple projects given their similarities (especially preventable admissions, readmissions a nd complications) at the same time. Patient experience ought to be a result of improved progress in each of these domains as well as with progress with our other Category 1 projects.

Performing Provider: Performing Provider name: Val Verd e Regional Medical Center (VVRMC) TPI: 119877204 Domain 2: Potentially Preven table Readmissions - 30 days Description: Relation of Category 4 Measures to VVRMC Category 1 & 3 Projects The overwhelming outcome of the Val Verde County/Del Rio community needs assessment was to 1694 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Val Verde Regional Medical Center increase the supply of medical pr oviders to our rural, medically- underserved community. As such, VVRMC has chosen DSRIP projects that will a im to expand access to care, both primary and specialty care. RD-2(30-day readmissions) ought to be favorably impacted\u2014all other things equal\u2014by virtue of having more primary care providers and sp ecialists among the community. Better access to doctors we believe will move more care to the outpatient/clinic setting and reduce the stress placed on the hospital. Several of the measures (HF readmission rate, diabetes readmission rate, COPD readmission rate and stroke readmission rate)) are hi gh-profile diagnoses that in Del Rio the primary care doctors are actively managing in the c linic. As clinic resour ces are expanded, and knowi ng that the prevalence of these diseases is so high in and around Del Rio, there will be a focus to more proactively manage these patient populations. The behavioral health measure stands to be im proved upon by virtue of adding specialists in our service area that are experts in psyc hiatry which is also tied to a Ca tegory 1 project. Like most rural communities, Del Rio is lacking an abundance of behavioral health sp ecialists, and to the extent we are successful in bringing more resource to our community, reduced utilization of hospital inpatient and ER services is likely. So often the cause of immediate readmission into the hospital is due to lack of coordination and follow-up after initial discharge from the hospital. For those patients being followed in the hospital clinic, there will be added focus on the hand off and care coordination to ensure that patients receive efficient and appropriate care as an outpatient in order to prevent unnecessa rily returning to the hospital for readmission. If additional primary care providers create an environment which encourages and allows better acce ss for preventative and more routin e care, then readmissions stand the chance of being reduced. Expected Improvements in Category 4 Domains The expected improvements will be to reduce 30-d ay readmissions. In order to accomplish this goal, which is impacted by so many things, it will take great coordination between the clinic and the hospital to transition care back-and-forth. The impact on these initiatives as well as our overa ll strategy to improve access to care we believe will significantly drive patient satisfaction with the healthcare system in Val Verde County. It is our desire that for members of our community who chos e to seek healthcare elsewhere, which adds the cost of travel time at least 2 \u00bd hours in both direct ions, they will gain more confidence in the local system. For those patients who do not have the m eans to travel elsewhere and depend solely on VVRMC and the local clinics for their healthcare needs, we hope to educate them on how best to access the services and do an outstan ding job while all are under our care either in the hospital or the clinic. Valuation: When considering how to weigh the value of repor ting and improving in five key areas: preventable admissions, 30-day readmissions, complications, patie nt experience and ED, we decided to weigh the five equally. In many respects, they are intert wined. As the team mobilizes resources to prepare for these projects, it will not be difficult to have the experts address multiple projects given their similarities (especially preventable admissions, r eadmissions and complications) at the same time. Patient experience ought to be a result of impr oved progress in each of these domains as well as with progress with our other Category 1 projects. 1695 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Val Verde Regional Medical Center Progress across all of these initiatives will work to meet the needs of the community as identified by those asked of their opinion earlier this year.

While this effort w ill be focused on clinic activity, clearly the mechanics of improving patient experience are consistent whether in the outpatient or i npatient setting. RD-4 (Patient- centered Healthcare) in large pa rt is about tracking patient satisfaction (through HCAHPS) and showing progress toward set goals. VVRMC is very focused on improv ing the patient experience both in the clinic as well as the inpatient setting. 1696 RHP 6 Plan March 8, 2013 Val Verde Regional Medical Center Expected Improvements in Category 4 Domains The impact on these initiatives as well as our overa ll strategy to improve access to care we believe will significantly drive patient satisfaction with the healthcare system in Val Verde County.
