Therapeutic massage helps to increase blood flow and circulation, release muscle tension, and promote healing. Your massage therapist will review with you where you are at and can discuss which modalities they perform that may best suit your needs. Deep Tissue Massage Your massage therapist will utilize deep to very deep pressure during your session. This can help with the relief of pain, muscle tension and soreness. If you have large knots or stiffness related to injury, sports activities, or sitting too long at your desk or in your car, a deep pressure massage can ease that pain and improve mobility. This modality can include the use of knuckles, forearms and elbows, so expect some discomfort and possibly bruising. Acupuncture This ancient Chinese therapeutic treatment uses very thin needles (about the width of a cats' whisker) that are inserted into specific acupuncture points on the body. These points stimulate the nervous system, release endorphins, relax muscles through trigger points, and activate your body's innate healing response by stimulating qi (energy). The main goal of treatment is to bring your body back to a balanced, healthy state of being. When your body is balanced and stress is decreased, you can fight off disease better and recovery time is quicker. Acupuncture can be used to help a variety of ailments including chronic/acute pain, stress, anxiety, digestive issues, and much more.

Cupping Cupping therapy is an ancient form of alternative medicine in which a therapist puts special cups on your skin for a few minutes at a time to create suction. Cupping helps to instantly reduce pain and inflammation, increase blood flow, promote relaxation and well-being, and as a type of deep-tissue massage. Table Thai Massage Thai Massage has been around for thousands of years, and helps to lower stress, boost energy, and improve athletic performance. This modality uses gentle pressure and stretching techniques to relax the whole body. Reiki Reiki is a Japanese form of energy healing that seeks to balance one's energy centers, and helps promote relaxation and relieve stress and anxiety through gentle touch. Prenatal Massage Prenatal Massage is a nurturing massage that focuses on the special needs of mothers-to-be during pregnancy. Positioning, pillows, and cushions are used to enhance support, decrease pressure and increase relaxation for both body and mind. This type of service does require an intake form, [which can be found here](https://www.healingstpete.com/client-intake-forms/). Reflexology The theory behind reflexology is that areas of the foot correspond to organs and systems of the body. Pressure applied to the foot brings relaxation and healing to the corresponding area of the body. Reflexology can help reduce pain and psychological symptoms, such as stress and anxiety, and enhance relaxation and sleep. Infrared Sauna Yes, we have an Infrared Sauna on site! Unlike a traditional sauna that heats the air, an infrared sauna uses infrared rays that penetrate the body, encouraging more profuse sweating at tolerable temperatures, allowing your body to eliminate a higher percentage of toxins.
