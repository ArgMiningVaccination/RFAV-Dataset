Sitting in circle and drinking this flower as a tea, participants are guided on an inner journey designed to help bring forward spiritual insight and support. Ancient Egyptians revered the Blue Lotus Flower for its ability to open up the third eye, which they referred to as \"the seat of the soul,\" and facilitate lucid dreaming. During the ceremony, participants will engage in a \"sitting and sipping\" meditative practice while being led through various meditation and journaling exercises designed to help connect with your intuition and bring forward healing, wisdom, and guidance.
