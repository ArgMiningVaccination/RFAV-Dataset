Known as floriography, flowers have long been used to reveal sentiments of love and affection, and, if arranged in a certain way, they could even convey a secret message or meaning. Honeysuckle was one such flower used to relay deep affection and strengthen the bonds of love. Recognized by a delicately sweet aroma and long vines dappled with unusually-shaped pink or yellow-orange blossoms, Japanese Honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica) flower extracts have many medicinal benefits. Honeysuckle has been shown to lower blood cholesterol levels and have antibacterial and antiviral properties. Externally, the flowers are applied as a wash to skin inflammations, rashes, and sores. Though there are many ways to prepare Japanese honeysuckle, tea is one of the most popular. Teas made from honeysuckle leaves, buds and flowers can be enjoyed on their own or in combination with other \"like-minded\" herbs such as passiflora or lemon balm. A complement to its use in strengthening the bonds of love, honeysuckle is also seen as a useful aid in letting go of the past, releasing memories, and moving forward with life, one sweet sip at a time.
