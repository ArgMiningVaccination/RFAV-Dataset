In li ght of this results, the IDMC in volved in the safety data review of the CYD dengue vaccine clinical development prog ram concluded, in and ad hoc meeting held on 3-4 November 2017, that there is a strong evidence that the CYD dengue vaccine prot ects exposed subjects from symp tomatic, hospitalized and severe dengue while, in unexposed subjects, th e vaccine confers limited short term benefit against symptomatic dengue and induc es an increased risk of hospitalized or severe dengue in the long term starting on the third year after the first injection (findings based on follow-up of dengue unex posed subjects having received 3 CYD dengue vaccine doses). The IDMC recommend ed that no further vaccinati on occurred in unexposed subj ects in ongoing o r future trials, and on precautionary basis, includi ng partially vaccinated subjects in ongoing trials. Given the IDMC recommendations, Sanofi Pasteur paused all vacci nations in this study (CYD66) and amended this study protocol. To determine the basal serostatus of the subjects already included in the study, the PRNT assay w ill be used on blood samples provided by th e subjects before th e first vaccination. As per IDMC recommendations, the following changes will be appl ied to this trial: x All vaccinated subjects will be informed about their baseline d engue serostatus and what it means as soon as possible x All subjects will be asked about their willingness to continue participating in this study, and consent will be formalized by signing an ICF an d/or AF addendum, as applicable. x Subjects seropositive at baseline will additionally be asked fo r consent to receive remaining CY D dengue doses. x Subjects seronegative at baseline will be able to continue in t he study for safety follow-up if they consent to, but will not receive further inje ctions of CYD dengue vaccine. x Subjects seronegative at baselin e who were vaccinated during th is study will have timely access to appropriate care in the event of suspecte d dengue, for 10 years from the date of l ast dengue vaccination. Time between communication of the results from the exploratory analyses and approval of Protocol Amendment 1 by the competent authorities a nd for the associated logistic tasks will result into a hold of study acti vities of several months (approximately 4-6 months). Study-hold intervenes V0 4 or V05, depending on each subject's visit-calendar at the time of study -hold (see table below). In order to communicat e to each subject his /her dengue serostat us at baseline, there will be either 1 unscheduled vi sit or phone call during the stu dy-hold before the next visit initially planned (V06 at the latest): The subject will consent to continue participation in the study by signing an ICF/AF addendum 1 at subject's next planned visit (either V04, V05 or V06). Thus, dose 2 and 3, or dose 3 only (provided that dose 2 was re ceived, as planned) will be administered selectively to those subjects dengue serop ositive at baseline who consent continue participation in the study and consent rec eiving the remaining CYD dengue doses CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 10 of 102 For all subjects who received at l east 1 dose and who consent t o continue participation in the study, a 6 month safety follow up is plann ed. This period will start after the last CYD dose th e subject received (whether 1, 2 or 3 doses). At the time vaccinations were pa used, subjects already provided 2 or 3 blood samples (BL), depending on their allocation group. Only dengue- exposed subjects who will continue in th e study and choose to receive remaining CYD dengue doses will provide 1 subsequent BL, as initially planned in Protocol version 1.0. The following table summarizes those study procedures (visits, vaccine injections and blood sampling) that were carried out as per protocol versi on 1.0 before Protocol amendment 1 and those paused (study hold) and planned during the study.

V04 and/or V05 (if they were not carried out) and V06 and V07 will take place, for those subjects dengue seropositive at baseline w ho consent continue participat ion in the study and consent administration of remaining CYD dengue doses. All other subject s will not attend their next scheduled visit unless it is to provide consent to study continuation. Additional BL may be drawn for virological confirmation of hosp italized suspected dengue case during the du ration of the trial. For the 2 vaccines, s olicited reactions will be collected after each injection between Days 0-7 for injection site reactions and between Days 0-14 for systemic reactions. Unsolicited adverse events (AEs) will be collected between Days 0-28 after each injection . Sanofi Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 11 of 102 Serious AEs (SAEs) will be reporte d throughout the study (from inclusion until 6 months after the last injection). Serious and non-serious AEs of special interest (AESIs) will be collected in defined time windows according to the type of AESI. In addition, hospitalized suspected dengue cases occurring at a ny time in the trial will be collected and documented. Subjects will be followed for safety from the first injection u p to 6 months after the last injection. Independent Data Monitoring Committee An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be involve d in the regular review of hospitalized virologically-confirmed dengue c ases (VCD), including assessment of severit y. Additionally, any related SAE or death will be promptly reviewed by the IDMC. Early Safety Data Review: This trial will not include an early review of safety data. How ever, it may be interrupted at any time if new da ta about the investigational p roduct become available, and/or on advice of the Sponsor, the Independent Eth ic Committees (IECs)/Institutional Review Board s (IRBs), or the governing reg ulatory authorities in the Philippines where th e trial is taking place. If the trial is prematurely ter minated or suspended, the Sponso r will promptly inform the Investigators, the IECs/IRBs, and the regulatory aut horities of the reason for termination or suspension. If the trial is prematurely termi nated for any reason, the Inve stigator will promptly inform the subjects and/or the s ubjects' parents/legally accept able representatives and should assure appropri ate therapy and follow-up. An internal safety evaluation te am (SET) will perform a safety analysis on safety data during the conduct of the trial.

However, SAE s will be record ed from inclus ion and subjects from Group 1 will receive a SAE-specific DC at V01 tha t will be collected at V02. Depending on the item, these could include: nature (Medical Dic tionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA] p referred term), time of onset, duration, number of days of occurrence, grade of severity, relationship to vacci ne, action taken, whether the AE led to early termination from the study, serious ness, or outcome. Hospitalized suspected dengue ca se is defined as an acute febri le illness with diagnosis of dengue requiring hospitalization (with bed attribu tion). In such cases, 1 unplanned acute blood sample (within the first 5 days after f ever onset) will be collected for virological confirmation of hospitalized suspecte d dengue case. A hospitalized suspected case will be considered VCD if there is a detection of wild type (WT) dengue virus by dengue non-structural protein 1 (NS1) tran scriptase-polymerase or GCI designated labo ratory). Note: Acute blood sample for all hospitalized suspected dengue cases should be collected within the pre -specified timeframe as described above . If this cannot be accomplished, this sample should still be obtained as soon as p ossible thereafter, for IDMC severity assessment. Planned Sample Size: As per Protocol version 1.0 , a total of 688 subjects were plan ned to be enrolled: Group 1: n = 344 (86 subjects per age group) Group 2: n = 344 (86 subjects per age group) As per Protocol Amendment 1 , only dengue-exposed subjects prior to vaccination will be eligible to continue and complete dengue study vaccinat ion schedules. Sanofi Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 14 of 102 Schedule of Study Procedures: The study procedures (Visits, v accinations and BLs) are summari zed in the Table presented in the Trial Desig n and Methodology section. Visits/phone call: As per Protocol version 1.0, all subjects attended 3 visits (V0 1 to V03), and some subjects attended 4 or 5 visits (V01 to V 04, or V01 to V05, res pectively). All subjects had 1 interim phone call approximately 3 months after the first dose of the CYD dengue vaccine. Upon implementation of Protocol Amendment1: x All subjects will attend an unsch eduled visit or have an unsche duled phone call after the hold of activities and before their next schedul ed visit to be informed about their serostatus at baseline. x All subjects who consent to con tinue in the study will attend t heir next scheduled visit to sign the ICF/AF addendum1. x All subjects who consent conti nue participation in the study wi ll receive a 6 months follow up \"safety phone call\" 6 months after their last vaccine dose received. x Seropositive subjects who consent to continue participation in the study and consent to receive remaining CYD dengue doses will attend their next planned visits and have interim phone c alls as initially planned (per p rotocol version 1.0); ie, 7 planned visits overa ll; V01 to V07, and 2 more inte rim phone calls during the 6-month period after dose 2 and dose 3 of the CYD de ngue vaccine (approximately 3 months after each vaccine injection). Vaccination: As per Protocol version 1.0, all subjects, depending on the gro up they were randomized to, received the first dose of the CYD dengue vaccin e and the booster dose of Tdap as follows: x Group 1: subjects were administered the first dose of CYD deng ue vaccine concomitantly with the booster dose of Tdap vaccine at the seco nd visit (V02; M1) x Group 2: subjects received Tdap vaccine at the first visit (V0 1; D0), and then CYD dengue vaccine 28 days later at the se cond visit (V02; M1) All but 19 subjects (b oth, from Group 1 a nd from Group 2) recei ved the dose 2 of the CYD vaccine at V0 4 (M7), as planned. Upon implementation of Protocol Amendment1: Only seropositive subjects who pr ovide consent to continue part icipation in the study and to receive remaining CY D doses will be administered d ose 2 (applicable to subjects who did not receive dose 2 ye t), and dose 3 of the CYD dengue vaccine, as initially planned. A ll other subjec ts will not rece ive remaining CYD dengue doses. Blood Sampling: As per Protocol version 1.0, all subjects provided 2 (Group 1) or 3 (Group 2) BLs before the study hold. Note that in Group 2 the BL 28 days after Tdap vaccination corr esponds to the BL prior to the first dose for CYD dengue vaccine. Upon implementation of Protocol Amendment1: Only seropositive subjects who co nsent to continue participatio n in the study and to receive further CYD dengue doses will provide 1 more BL, as initially Sanofi Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 15 of 102 Individual samples will not exceed 6 mL: x for Tdap immunogenicity assessments (2 mL) before the first vac cination (D0 for Group 2 and M1 for Group 1) and 28 days after vaccinati on with Tdap vaccine (M1 for Group 2 and M2 for Group 1) x for CYD dengue vaccine immunogenic ity assessments (4 mL) before the first vaccination (M1 for both groups) and 28 days after the fi rst and third vaccinations with CYD d engue vaccine (M2 and M14 for both group s) Additional blood samples might be collected: x In case of hospitali zed suspected dengue case, one unplanned BL (=acute BL, of approximately 3 mL) will have to be collected within the first 5 days after fever onset for virological confirmation of dengue d isease. x In case of SAEs (including AESI). x To assess AEs that may be indicative of viscerotropic or neurot ropic disease opic AE). Urine sampling: All female subjects of childbearing potential will provide urin e samples for urine pregnancy test before each injection. Duration of Participation in the Trial: For seropositive subjects who co nsent continue participation in the study and administration of remaining CYD dengue doses, due to period of study-hold, the duration of each subject's participation in the trial will be a pproximately 23-25 months, since it will be extende d by 4-6 months with respect to the initial plan (ie, as per protocol version1.0: approximately 19 months, including a vaccination phase of 12 months for subjects in Group 1 and 13 months for su bjects in Group 2, followed by a safety follow-up period of 6 months after the thi rd injection of CYD dengue vaccine). For seropositive subjects who co nsent continue participation in the study but refuse to receive remaining CYD dengue doses and seronegative s ubjects who provide their consent to continue participation in the study, t heir participation in the trial will be les s than 19 months as initially planned.

This applies to the co-primary objectives, and the secondary objective. Otherwise, descriptiv e analyses will be performed. Primary Objectives: Tdap immunogenicity A non-inferiority testing approach will be used to compare geom etric mean concentrations (GMCs) for PT, FHA, PRN, FIM2+3, 28 days after t he booster dose of Tdap, for each antigen \"i\" based o n the following (=log 10 [1.5]), for each antigen \"i\". Non-inferiority for antigen \"i\" will be demonstrated if the low er bound of the 2- sided 95% CI is greater than - \u0011 For each of the 4 antigens, the statistical methodology will be based on the use of the age-stratified two- sided 95% CI of the ratio of GMCs between groups. The age-stratified CI will be cal culated using an ANOVA model (type II analysis) of log 10-transformed titers. T he age groups (9 to 11 years, 12 to 17 years, 18 to 4 5 years and 46 to 60 years) wi ll be used as the stratifying factor in the model. Additionally, a non-inferiority testing approach will be used t o compare seroprotection rates of T and D, 28 days after th e booster dose of Adacel\u00ae. Seroprotection is defined as anti -D and anti-T Ab concentration superior to 0.1 IU/mL.

I mmunogenicity point estimates an d their 95% CI will be presented for each and any group, before and after the first and third injections for CYD dengue vaccine and before and after the boos ter vaccination for Tdap. A complementary analysis on CY D dengue vaccine a nd Tdap vaccine immunogenicity after each dose w ill be conducted for each and a ny group according to the age groups (9 t o 11 years, 12 to 17 years, 18 to 45 years and 46 to 60 years). A complementary analysis on CY D dengue vaccine immunogenicity a fter each dose will be conducted for each and any gr oup according to the dengue status at baseline. The 95% CIs will be calculated using: x The normal approximate method for GMCs/GMTs and geometric mean of concentration ratios [GMCRs]/ge ometric mean the titer CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 20 of 102 Assuming that log 10 transformation of the titers/concentrations follows a normal distribution, at first, the mea n and the 95% CI will be calcula ted on log 10 (titers/concentrations) using the usual calculation for normal distribution (using Student's t distribution with n-1 degree of freedom), then anti log transformations will be applied to the results of calculations, in order to pro vide geometric means and their 95% CI using: x The exact binomial distribution fo r percentages (Clopper-Pearso n's method, quoted by Newcombe) In addition, the booster response against pertussis components (PT, FHA, PRN, and FIM2+3) will be cal culated based on Ab concentration rises between pre- and post-vaccination defined as: x A post-YDFFLQDWLRQ\u0003$E\u0003FRQFHQWUDWLRQ\u0003\u0095 4 x the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) when pre-vaccination concentration is < LLOQ x A post-YDFFLQDWLRQ\u0003$E\u0003FRQFHQWUDWLRQ\u0003\u0095 4 x pre-vaccination Ab concentration when pre- YDFFLQDWLRQ\u0003FRQFHQWUD WLRQ\u0003LV\u0003\u0095\u0003//24\u0003EXW\u0003 4 x LLOQ x A post-YDFFLQDWLRQ\u0003$E\u0003FRQFHQWUDWLRQ\u0003\u0095 2 x pre-vaccination Ab concentration when pre- YDFFLQDWLRQ\u0003FRQFHQWUDWLRQ\u0003LV\u0003\u0095\u0003\u0017\u0003[\u0003//24 Safety All analyses will be descriptive ; no hypotheses will be tested. Safety will be assessed for all subject s after the booster dose of Tdap vaccin e and after each and any dose of CYD dengue vaccine. A complementary analysis will be conducted for each group accor ding to the age groups (9 to 11 years, 12 to 17 years, 18 to 45 years and 46 to 60 years). A complementary analysis after eac h and any dose of CYD dengue va ccine will be conducted for each and any group according to the dengue status at baseline. For the main parameters, 95% CIs of point estimates will be cal culated using the normal approximation for quantitative data and the exact binomi al distribution (Clopper-Pearson method) for proportions. Calculation of Sample Size: A total of 688 subjects will be enrolled: 344 subjects per trea tment group (86 subjects per age group). Considering a potential attrition rate of 10%, it was initially planned that such sample size would provide 618 eva luable subjects in the Per-Ppr otocol population of Tdap and CYD dengue vaccine. This sample size (based on SAS pr oc Power) targeted a global po wer over 90.0% for the non-inferiority testing co rresponding to the co-primary objectives (i.e., after the booster dose of Tdap and afte r the first dose of CYD), and over 99.0% for the non-inferiority corresponding to the secondary objective (ie, t esting after the third dose of CYD dengue vaccine) However, as per protocol amendment 1, the number of evaluable s ubjects will be reduced since only dengue seropositive subjects will be include d in the Per- Protocol populations. Thus, the non-inferiority testing will be carried out only if a global power of at leas t 80% for the co-pri mary objectives and secondary objective can be attained (i.e., if the num ber of evaluable subjects is a t least 510 for the co- primary objectives a nd 324 for the secondary objective). The following assumptions were considered for the non-inferior ity of Tdap: an alpha level of 2.5% (one-sided hypotheses), a maximum acceptabl e difference of 0.176 for GMCs and of 10% for seroprotection rates, and the fo llowing rates and standard deviations Sanofi Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 21 of 102 x 7\u0003\u0095\u0003\u0013\u0011\u0014\u0003,8\u0012P/\u0003 - 99% of subjects x '\u0003\u0095\u0003\u0013\u0011\u0014\u0003,8\u0012P/\u0003 - 99% of subjects x PT SD - 0.4 x FHA SD- 0.4 x PRN SD - 0.5 x FIM2+3 SD - 0.6 (Based on TD519, TD506 and TD526 studies and on Keith S. Reisin ger). The following assumptions were considered for the non-inferiori ty after the first dose of CYD dengue vaccine: an al pha level of 2.5% (one-sided h ypotheses), a maximum acceptable difference of 0 .301 for GMTs, a nd a SD of 1. 0 for serotype 1, 0.8 for serotypes 2 and 3, 0.7 for serotype 4 (based on CYD2 2 and CYD47 studies conducted in Asia Pacific). The following assumptions were considered for the non-inferiori ty after the third dose of CYD dengue vaccine: an alpha level of 2.5% (one-sided h ypotheses), a maximum acceptable difference of 0 .301 for GMTs, a nd a SD of 0. 8 for serotypes 1 and 2, 0.7 for serotypes 3 and 4 (based on studies conducted in Asia Pacific). This sample size will also provide a 95% probability of observi ng an AE that has a true incidence > 0.87% in each group (N=344per group). Interim analysis: Two or three planned statistical analyses will be performed: x A first interim statistical analysis will be performed on resul ts obtained after a partial database lock of data collected up to the 28 days post first dose of CYD dengue vaccine (V03; M2). x A second interim analysis might be performed on results collect ed up to the 28 days after the third dose of CYD dengue vaccine (V06; M13). x The final analysis will be perform ed on data collected at the e nd of the study.

Dengue Dengue is the most common mosqu ito-borne viral disease in human s, found in tropical and sub- tropical regions around the world. In recent years, transmissio n has increased predominantly in urban and semi urban areas and has become a major international public health concern. Dengue virus is essentially transmitted by mosquitoe bites primarily b y the female Aedes aegypti , but the global spread of dengue due to A. albopictus is increasing. There are f our closely related, but antigenically distinct, dengue virus serotypes (1, 2, 3, 4) of the genus Flavivirus (FV) that cause dengue. All four serotypes can cau se the full spectrum of disea se from subclinical infection to a mild self-limiting disease, dengue fever (DF) and severe diseas e that may be fatal, due to dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) (1). The clinical presentation of acute dengue is non-specific and i s characterized by biphasic fever, headache, pain in various part s of the body, prostration, rash, and lymphadenopathy for which recovery is usually complete in 7 to 10 days. However, 5-10% of patients progress to DHF/DSS which is characterized by abnorma lities of homeostasis and incr eased vascular permeability that can lead to hypovolemia and hypotensi on (DSS), often complicate d by severe internal bleeding. The case fatality rate of DHF can be as high as 10% without the rapy, but is below 1% in most centers with modern inten sive supportive therapy. Routine laboratory diagnosis of dengue infections is based on t he detection of dengue virus- specific antibodies (Abs) (imm unoglobulin M [IgM]) and/or isola tion of the virus or detection of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) by rev erse transcription-polymeras e chain reacti on (RT-PCR) or viral non-structural 1 (NS1) antigen (Ag) by enzyme-lin ked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (2) (3) (4). The diagnosis of dengue falls int o 2 stages: Stage I, the acut e fever period lasting a few days when viremia and NS1 Ag may be detected; and Stage II, the early post-febrile period lasting a few weeks when IgM and immunoglobulin G (IgG) are increased. According to the World Health Org anization (WHO), an estimated 3.9 billion people are at risk living in dengue endemic countri es in Africa, the Americas, the Eastern Medite rranean, South East Asia, and the Western Paci fic. The American, South East As ian and the Western Pacific regions are the most seriously a ffected. The WHO currently esti mates there may be 390 million dengue virus infections worldwi de every year, of which 96 milli on are associated with clinical manifestations of dengue. An estimated 500,000 people with seve re dengue require hospitalization each year of which 2.5% of those die (1). The populations most affected by dengue are pre-adolescents, adolescents and adults living in dengue en demic areas. All 4 dengue Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 29 of 102 serotypes vary unpredictably ove r time, causing a continuous ri sk of infection in populations living in dengue-endemic regions . No currently available preven tative measures have significantly impacted dengue disease, thus as recognized by the WHO, the nee d for a safe and effective vaccine against all 4 serotypes of dengue virus to protect peop le in endemic countries. Tetanus Tetanus is an acute and often f atal infection caused by an extr emely potent neurotoxin produced by a bacterium, Clostridium tetani , which is most commonly found in t he soil. The disease is not communicable but is acquired thro ugh environmental contaminatio n of flesh wounds by the bacteria which can lead to diseas e characterized by severe, pai nful muscle contractions accompanied by hypersensitivity, hyperreflexia, and increased a utonomic stimulation of the affected body part(s). Complicati ons associated with tetanus in clude laryngospasms, spinal and long bone fractures, and hypertension. Diphtheria Diphtheria is an acute infec tion caused by toxin-producing stra ins of the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae, which can be transmitted from person to person via respiratory droplets. The main site of infec tion is the upper respiratory t ract presenting as a sore throat often with a mild fever. Complications associated with severe diphthe ria include ai rway obstruction, myocardidits, and aparalysis. The case fatality rate is as high as 30-95%, despite modern medical care. Pertussis Pertussis (whooping cough) is a hi ghly contagious disease of th e respiratory tract caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis , which is transmitted by the respiratory route. The illness is characterized by several coughing s pasms, which may or may not be associated with classic inspiratory 'whooping'. In severe disease, the coughing spasms can vary in length and severity but may become so severe, that resp iration is compromised leading t o hypoxia and even subsequent neurological damage. Pneumonia may also occur in severe cases. Although pertussis is most severe and complications most frequent in children < 1 year of age, pertussis can affect persons of any age. Antimicrobial therapy is effective in t reating disease but does not alter progression of disease unless administered ear ly when pertussis is rarely susp ected, thus disease control is based on vaccine prophylaxis. 1.2 Background of the Inve stigational C YD ant technology to obtain a live- attenuated vaccine, is currently indicated for the prevention o f dengue disease caused by all 4 serotypes (1, 2, 3, 4) in individu als 9-60 years of age livin g in endemic regions. Immunization against dengue is based on a 3-dos e immunization schedule, 6 mo nths apart (0, 6, and 12 months) administered subcutaneously w ith CYD dengue vaccine. The indica ted population has been defined based on a Benefit/Risk evaluation of the overall popul ation included in the clinical development plan. Sanofi Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 30 of 102 In support of this product profile , an extensive clinical devel opment program, compliant with WHO and EMA guidelines has been conducted (5), for which the CYD dengue vaccine efficacy, immunogenicity and safety has been assessed in various formulat ions, schedules and populations. x In Phase I trials, a total o f 396 subjects aged 2-49 years of a ge were evaluated for safety. Subjects were evaluated in both non-endemic and endemic areas a nd were received at least one dose of Phase I lots of CYD dengue vaccine containing eithe r 4 log 10 or 5 \u00b1 1 log 10 cell- culture infectious dose 50% (CCID 50) per serotype. x In Phase II trials, a total o f 4903 subjects aged 12 months-45 years were enrolled to evaluate safety and immunogenicity in non-e ndemic and endemic areas incl uding Asia Pacific and Latin America which supported the selection of the final formul ation of 3 doses of CYD dengue vaccine of 5 log 10 CCID 50 per serotype as 3 injections a dministered 6 months apart. A proof of concept efficacy study (C YD23) in Thailand in 4-11 yea r olds has been completed in 2012. Subjects from CYD23 were follo wed for safety in a long-te rm follow-up study (CYD57) for a total of 5 years post-dose 3. x In Phase III trials, a total of 23,140 subjects aged 9 months t o 60 years have received at least 1 dose of Phase III lots of CYD dengue vaccine (4.5 - 6.0 log 10 CCID 50 per serotype). Two pivotal large scale e fficacy studies (CYD14 (6) and CYD15 (7) conducted in Asia Pacific (10,275 subjects aged 2 to 14 years) and Latin America (20,869 subjects aged 9 to 16 years) respectively, have completed t he 25-month active phase and the 1st year of the Hospital Phase of the long-term follow-up. These efficacy studies were powered to independently demonstrate significant vaccine efficacy (VE) of the CYD dengue vaccine and they met their primary endpoints (8). To include the totality of effi cacy studies (CYD14, CYD15) ana lyzed over the 25 month Active Phase, and the availability of further safety data for an additional one year of long term follow-up in t he Hospital Phase, post-hoc meta-analyses was performed with improved point estimate pr ecision for descriptive outcomes (6). Consistent VE was demonstrated during the 25-month active phase for virologically confirmed everity of dengue disease, cau sed by any and each of the 4 dengue serotypes, severe dengue 93.2 % (95% have been ident ified in subjects 9-16 years of age during the 25 month active period or during the first year of long term follow-up in the H ospital Phase (6) (7) (9). This included no observed increase in de ngue disease severity compar ed to the placebo group (6). In interim results of the long t erm follow-up, for the first ye ar (year 3) of the Hospital Phasepooled efficacy results demonstrated a continued benefit i n subjects who were 9 years and above with lower risk of hosp italized VCD, RR 0.50 in the vacci ne compared to the placebo group. All subjects who were hospi talized due to dengue fully r ecovered after receiving appropriate supportive treatment . However, in CYD14, in the fir st year of the Hospital Phase (year 3), the relative risk sugge sts an overall trend to increa sed risk of hospitalized VCD in the vaccine compared to the placebo group among subjects < 9 years of age, RR 1.58; in particular in the 2 to 5 years old age group. Sanofi Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 31 of 102 Up to November 2016, a total of 28 completed or ongoing clinica l studies in 15 endemic and non- endemic countries including Lati n America and Asia pacific have been conducted, comprising more than 41,500 subjects from 9 months through to 60 years of age. Of these subjects, 21,215 were aged 9 through to 60 years a nd received at least 1 dose of CYD dengue vaccine formulation. Furthermore, the CYD dengue vaccin e has demonstrated a consiste nt and acceptable safety profile, comparable with placebo du ring its clinical developmen t across many populations (age groups, gender, region, and dengue immune status) in subjects 9 to 60 years of age. The high post- injection neutralizi ng antibody titers obser ved in adults livin g in endemic areas, allows the extrapolation of vaccine efficac y through immunological bridgin g to adult populations living in endemic areas. Considering the totality of th e efficacy and safety of CYD deng ue vaccine studies, a favorable benefit-risk ratio supports the c laimed indication for the prev ention of dengue disease caused by all 4 serotypes in ind ividuals 9 to 60 years of age living in e ndemic regions. As of October 2017, the CYD dengue v accine (commercial name Den gvaxia\u00ae) has been licensed in 19 countries (in alphabetical or der): Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Brazil, Cambodia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Indones ia, Malaysia, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, the Philippines , Singapore, Thailand, and Venez uela for the prevention of dengue disease caused by all 4 virus ser otypes (1, 2, 3, 4) in individ uals 9/12 to 16/45/60 years living in endemic areas. As of December 2017, the Sanofi labe l proposal is being reviewe d by national regulatory agencies in each country where the vaccine is registered or under regist ration. 1.3 Potential Benefits and Risks Detailed risk/benefit analysis i s presented in the Investigator 's Brochure version 19.0 dated 9 February 2017, and recent Investigat or's Brochure Amendment ver sion 1.0 dated 21 December 2017. 1.3.1 Potential Benefits to Subjects In terms of benefit, the subjects participating in the present clinical trial may develop immunity and protection against dengue dise ase after vaccination with CY D dengue vaccine. Results from the two large-scale Phase III effica cy trials show ed the potential for CYD dengue vaccine to reduce the probability of a subject's having symptom atic VCD, hospitalized VCD due to any of the 4 serotypes (vaccine efficacy [VE] estimates agai nst symptomatic VCD during the whole Active Phase due to any of the 4 serotypes were CYD15). In addition, efficacy was observed against each of the 4 serotypes with high efficac y seen against severe VCD case s and hospitalized VCD cases during the Active Phase. A number of supplemental exploratory analyses (see section 1.4 ) have provided strong evidences that, for subjects that were dengue seropositive prior to CYD d engue vaccination, the vaccine protects against symptoma tic dengue, hospitalized dengue, and s evere dengue disease. The subjects receiving Adacel\u00ae may increase their current i mmunity and protection against diphtheria, tetanus a nd pertussis disease. Sanofi Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 32 of 102 As with any vaccine, immunological protection may not be elicit ed in all individua ls against the disease they are designed to prevent. 1.3.2 Potential Risks to Subjects CYD Dengue Vaccine During the clinical development of dengue vaccine as well as du ring the Active Phase of the Phase III efficacy studies, no safet y concerns after administra tion of the CYD dengue vaccine emerged from the pooled safety ana lysis, providing sufficient e vidence that the s afety profile of the CYD dengue vaccine is accepta ble and similar to the safety profile of licensed vaccines in similar population. Potential unwanted effects als o include injec tion site reaction s such as erythema, swelling, induration, and pain. General dis orders may also be observed su ch as fever, malaise, asthenia, myalgia and headache. As for a ny drugs, a risk of allergic reac tion cannot be exc luded. Vasovagal malaise linked to the injection procedure may be observed in su sceptible individuals. Full list of expected adverse events (AEs) can be found in the Investigator' s Brochure. As CYD dengue vaccine has a yellow fever (YF) vaccine backbone, and YF vaccination has been rarely associated wit h viscerotropic and neur otropic AEs, this risk has to be considered. This theoretical risk linked to viscer otropism and neurotropism is f urther addressed in the \"Guidelines for assessing viscerotropic and ne urotropic AE\" document. In th e previous studies conducted with the CYD dengue vaccine, no confirmed viscerotropic or neurotrop ic AEs have been observed. Although an unexplained higher inci dence of hospitalization for dengue in year 3 of follow-up among children younger than 9 years was observed in CYD14 effic acy trial, in particular in children from 2 to 5 years old, the c ombined analysis of the ef ficacy trials during year 3 showed a lower risk of hospitalization f or dengue among participants who were 9 years of age or older in the vaccine group than among thos e in the control group. All su bjects who were hospitalized due to dengue fully recovered after r eceiving appropriate supportiv e treatment (6). Considering the totality of long-term follow-up data during the Hospital Phase across the 3 efficacy studies, no evidence of increased severity of dengue disease or increase in frequency of hospitalized dengue cases has b een observed in subject from 9 t o 16 years old vaccinated with the dengue vaccine. Following a number of supplemental exploratory analyses (see Section 1.4) , it was shown that subjects that were dengue ser onegative prior to CYD dengue vacc ination have an i ncreased risk of hospitalized or severe disease, a s compared to subjects who rec eived the placebo, with an onset from the third year after the first injection. Tdap vaccine (Adacel\u00ae) Tdap vaccine (Adacel\u00ae) may not protect 100% of vaccinated individuals. Following vac cination with Adacel\u00ae, the most common local adverse r eactions include injection sit e pain, erythema, and swelling; the most common systemic adverse events include heada che, body ache, tiredness, and fever. Adacel\u00ae is contraindicated in persons with known systemic hypersensiti vity to any of their components or a life-threateni ng reaction after previous admini stration of either vaccine or a vaccine containing the same substances. Because of uncertainty as to which vaccine component Sanofi Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 33 of 102 may be responsible, no further vacc ination with the diphtheria, tetanus, or pertussis components found in Adacel\u00ae should be carried out. All subjects The potential risks associate d with blood drawing include local injection site reactions such as erythema, swelling, induration, a nd pain, bruising and, rarely infection. General disorders may also be obs erved such as fever, malaise, asthenia, myalgia and headache. The potential risk for vasovagal syncope (fainting) can occur f ollowing, or even before, any vaccination in this age group ( CYD dengue vaccine or Adacel\u00ae), as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. This is sometim es associated by other neurolo gical signs such as transient visual disturbance, paraesthesia and t onic-clonic movements on resolut ion of syncope. The potential risks listed here are not exhaustive; refer to th e package inserts of Adacel\u00ae for additional information regarding po tential risks. Full list of expected adverse eve nts (AEs) for the CYD dengue vaccine can be found in t he Investigator's Brochure. 1.4 Rational for the Trial Preventive measures presently rel y on mosquito c ontrol and pers onal protection. These measures are limited in efficacy, difficult to enforce, and expensive. T he best method of prevention lies with the development of a safe and eff ective vaccine directed at the 4 serotypes of dengue virus responsible for the disease. It is preferable that CYD dengue vaccine is administered at an existing scheduled visit as part of the routine immunization schedul e. There is currently no data o n concomitant administration of CYD dengue vaccine with other va ccines in the indicated populat ion aged 9-60 years of age. Co- administration of CYD dengue vacc ine with other vaccines has be en assessed in clinical studies outside the age indication, i n infants and toddlers 9 to 15 mon ths of age at inclusion in dengue endemic countries. A Phase II study was conducted to evaluate t he co-administration of CYD dengue vaccine together with Phase III studies (CYD29 and CYD33) were conducted to evaluate the co-a dministration of CYD dengue vaccine together with [live]; Sanofi Pasteur) Pasteur). These trials demonstrated that the C YD dengue vaccine could be admini stered concomitantly with these pediatric vaccines and no saf ety concerns or impact on the immu ne response was observed. The present post-licensure Phase IIIb study CYD66 will investig ate the immunogenicity and safety of CYD dengue vaccine and Tdap vaccine when both vaccine s are administered concomitantly or sequentiall y to subjects aged 9 to 60 years li ving in the Philippines. CYD dengue vaccine may be given concomitantly with Tdap. Tdap vacci ne is indicated for the prophylaxis of diphtheria caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae , Clostridium tetani , and pertussis (whoopi ng cough) caused by Bordetella pertussis in individuals 4 through 64 years of age as a booster according to the national vaccination policies. Tdap vaccine is a sterile liquid suspension of adsorbed tet anus, low-dose diphtheria CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 34 of 102 components, intended for intramu scular administration. Tdap vac cine is licensed in a total of 67 countries, and is administere d as a single booster dose in a dolescent and adult public and private vaccination schedules in the Philippines. Dengvaxia\u00ae is currently indicated in subjects 9 to 45 years of age. In order to genera te further data in older sub jects, it was decided to also administer the Dengvaxia\u00ae to 46-60 year-old subjects in the present study. As multiple Ags are administered concurrently, it is necessary to demonstrate that there is no impact on either the immunogenici ty or safety profile of CYD va ccination on Tdap or the inverse. Furthermore, the administration of CYD dengue vaccine at the sa me time as a booster dose of Tdap vaccine might reduce the number of vaccination visits, and thereby increase vaccine compliance and coverage of co-administered vaccines, and facili tate dengue program. implementation. Protocol Amendment 1 This amended protocol introduces important changes to the origi nal protocol of the ongoing CYD66 clinical study. In July 2016, the WHO issued a pos ition paper on Sanofi Pasteur 's CYD dengue vaccine based on the Strategic Advisory Group of E xperts' (SAGE) assessment that recognized its potential public health value when introduced i n highly endemic countries. In ad dition, the SAGE also underlined the importance of addressing the question of the potential risk , over time, of hospitalized/severe dengue in individuals with no prio r exposure to dengue before v accination (11) (12). Other scientific, public health, and r egulatory leaders have expresse d similar interest in obtaining more information on the long-term sa fety and efficacy of the CYD vac cine in seronegative individuals. Sanofi Pasteur recognized thi s knowledge gap and remained commi tted to further evaluate the performance of the CYD vaccine. Analyzing long-term safety according to dengue serostatus at ba seline presented an important challenge as serostatus had onl y been assessed in a subset of s ubjects (the so-called immunogenicity subset) in each the 3 efficacy studies (CYD14 , CYD15 and CYD23/57). As a consequence of this, and in orde r to address th e question of va ccine performance in seronegative individuals, Sanofi Pasteur d ecided to conduct an Exploratory C ase-Cohort study using a time point for which a blood sample w as collected in all study parti cipants: approximately 1 month after the third injection of CYD dengue vaccine or placebo (mon th [M] 13). The rationale behind this approach was tha t the classificati on of study participants according to dengue serostatus at this time point (as a surrogate of prior natural dengue exposur e) could be used as a baseline for the evaluation of outcomes that occur later. However, the PRNT assa y routinely used to quantify neutralizing Ab scriminate wild-type dengue virus and dengue virus. Said otherwise, a positive PRN T assay at M13 can be the result of either prior dengue exposure or CYD dengue vaccination. To overcome this challenge, Sanof i Pasteur leveraged an assay o riginally developed at University of Pittsburg (Pittsburg, PA, USA ) and optimized by Sanofi Paste ur's Global Clinical Immunology (GCI) Department. This assay m easures total immunoglobulin G (I gG) antibodies against the non- structural protein 1 (NS1) of the dengue virus by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Because the NS1 protei n is not conserved between the d engue virus and the yellow- fever virus, previous exposure to CYD dengue vaccine is not exp ected to Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 35 of 102 levels of antibody against the de ngue NS1 protein. The applicat ion of the Dengue ELISA assay to M13 samples was the refore considered useful for expanding the existing data on both VE and potential risk of de ngue hospitalization and/or sev ere dengue according to baseline serostatus in the CYD dengue vaccine efficacy trials. Thus, den gue serostatus was used in a supplemental case-cohort study as a covariate to assess the eff ects of CYD dengue vaccine for outcomes that occur after M13. In addition, the Dengue anti-NS1 IgG ELISA values were used in conjunction with multiple additional variables in imputation mo dels to predict the D0 PRNT50 serostatus, to evaluate outcomes occurring after M0 and measured (when available), or imputed PRNT50 serostatus. Sanofi Pasteur presented the fu ll data of this supplemental ana lysis to the IDMC in an ad hoc meeting held on 3-4 November 2017. D uring this meeting, the IDM C reviewed the data from these extended safety and efficac y analyses. It concluded that, in the case of subjects exposed to dengue prior to vaccination (hen ceforth, 'exposed subjects' or seropositive subjects), there is strong evidence that the vaccine protects them from symptomatic dengue, hospitalized dengue and severe dengue. In the case of subjects not exposed to dengue be fore vaccination (henceforth, \u00b5XQH[SRVHG\u0003VXEMHFWV\u0003RU\u0003VHURQHJDWLY H\u0003VXEMHFWV \u000f\u0003WKH\u0003FRQFOXVLRQ\u0003 ZDV\u0003WKDW\u0003DOWKRXJK\u0003YDFFLQDWLRQ\u0003PD\\\u0003 confer limited short-term benefit against symptomatic dengue, i t also induces an increased risk of severe disease in the longer term . The IDMC stated that these f indings are based on follow-up of dengue unexposed subjects having received 3 CYD dengue vaccine doses and no data exist to conclude if the risk in partia lly vaccinated dengue unexposed s ubjects is different from that in fully vaccinated dengue unexposed subjects. Given these conclusions, the ID MC recommended that no further v accination occur in unexposed subjects in ongoing or future trials, and on precautionary basi s, including partially vaccinated subjects in ongoing trials. In addi tion, they recommended makin g available information on baseline serostatus for all vacc inated subjects whenever possib le. Finally, for unexposed subjects that were vaccinated during a st udy, the IDMC recommended insti tuting mechanisms to provide timely access to appropriate care in the event of suspected den gue, for 10 years from the date of last vaccination. Given the IDMC recommendations, S anofi Pasteur is amending this study protocol. As a general rule, only subjects assessed as de ngue exposed at baseline (ie, before receiving the first injection) will be eligible to receive any further dose of CYD dengue vacc ine in an ongoing study. In this study (CYD66), all subjects will be informed about these latest results and their serostatus at baseline and what it means. Mor eover, all subjects will be aske d about their willingness to continue participat ing in this study by signing an updated ICF and/or AF, as applicable. Subjects assessed as dengue exposed will confirm their participation in the study and will continue to be eligible to receive remaini ng CYD dengue doses planned. Subject s classified as unexposed at baseline, will only be able to c ontinue in the study for a 6-mo nth safety follow-up. Their consent will also be asked for.

The Principal Investigators and any sub-Investig ators at the individual sites will be coordinated by one Coordinating Investigator. Details of the trial centers, the In vestigators at each center, and the Coordinating Investigator(s) are provided in the \"List of Inves tigators and Centers Involved in the Trial\" document. Independent Data Monitoring Committee An Independent Data Monitoring C ommittee (IDMC) will be involve d in the regular review of hospitalized VCD cases, including assessment of severity. Addit ionally, any related serious adverse event (SAE) or death will be promptly reviewed by the I DMC. Sanofi Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 37 of 102 Subjects were randomized according to a 1:1 ratio into one of t he 2 following groups with stratification on age (9 t o 11 years, 12 to 17 years, 18 to 45 years and 46 to 60 years): x Group 1 : subjects were administered t he first dose of CYD dengue vacci ne concomitantly with the booster dose of Tdap vaccine at the second visit (V02; M1) x Group 2 : subjects were administered Tda p vaccine at the first visit (V 01; D0), and then CYD dengue vaccine 28 days later at the second visit (V02; M1) The stratification wi ll be considered in orde r to balance the p otential difference in terms of booster response by age group for the pert ussis antigens (PT, FHA, PRN and FIM2+3). Since dengue is administered according to a 3-dose sche dule, given 6 months apart, initial trial design included administration of the second and third doses of CYD dengue vaccine at V04 (Month 7 [M7] and at V 06 (M13) in all subjects. All but 19 subjects (from bot h, Group1 and Group 2) did receive dose 2 of the CYD dengue vaccine as planned. However, as per changes in the conduct of t he study reflected in this Protocol Amendment 1 (see also Section 1.4) , the following will be applied: x All vaccinated subjects will be informed about their baseline d engue serostatus and what it means as soon as possible x All subjects will be asked about their willingness to continue participating in this study, and consent will be formalized by si gning an ICF and/or AF addendum , as applicable. x Subjects seropositive at baseline will additionally be asked fo r consent to receive remaining CYD dengue doses. x Subjects seronegative at baselin e will be able to continue in t he study for safety follow-up if they consent to, but will not rec eive further injections of CYD dengue vaccine. x Subjects seronegative at baselin e who were vaccinated during th is study will have timely access to appropriate care in t he event of suspected dengue, fo r 10 years from the date of last dengue vaccination. Time between communication of the r esults from the exploratory analyses and approval of Protocol Amendment 1 by the compe tent authorities and for the a ssociated logistic tasks will result into a hold of study activit ies of several months (appro each subject's v isit-calendar at the time of study- hold.

Thus, dose 2 and 3, or dose 3 only (pr ovided that dose 2 was re ceived, as planned) will be administered only to those subjects dengue seropositive at base line who consent continue participation in the study and c onsent receiving the remaining CYD dengue doses planned. A 6 months safety follow up is planned for all subjects who rec eived at least 1 dose and who consent to continue participat ion in the study. This period wil l start after the last CYD dose the subject received (whether 1, 2 or 3 doses). At the time vaccinations were pa used, subjects had already prov ided 2 to 3 blood samples (BL), depending on the allocation gr oup. Only dengue-exposed subjects who will continue in the study and choose to receive remaini ng CYD dengue doses will provide 1 subsequent BL, as initially planned in Protocol Version 1.0. Additional blood samples might be c ollected in case of SAEs (in cluding AEs of special interest [AESIs]) and to assess AEs tha t may be indicative of viscerotro pic or neurotropic disease (see Guidelines for Assessing Viscer otropic and Neurotropic AE). In case of hospitaliz ed suspected dengue case, one unplanned BL (= acute BL) will have to be collected within the first 5 days after fever onset for virolog ical confirmation of dengue disease. (If this cannot be accomplished, this sample should still be ob tained as soon as possible thereafter, for IDMC severity assessment). All female subjects of childbear ing potential will provide urin e samples for urine pregnancy test before each injection. Immunogenicity of the Tdap booster dose will be evaluated befor e and 28 days after injection in both groups. Immunogenicity of the CYD dengue vaccine will be e valuated before the first injection and 28 days after the f irst and the third injections in both groups. The saf ety of the two vaccines will be assessed after each injection in both groups. For seropositive subjects who cons ent continue participation in the study and administration of remaining CYD dengue doses, due to period of study-hold, the du ration of each subject's participation in the trial w ill be approximately 23-25 months, since it will be extended by 4-6 months with respect to the ini tial plan (ie, as per protocol ve rsion1.0: approximately 19 months, including a vaccination phase of 12 months for subjects in Grou p 1 and 13 months for subjects in Group 2, followed by a safety follo w-up period of 6 months afte r the third injection of CYD dengue vaccine).

Sanofi Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 40 of 102 5.1.2 Justification of t he Trial Design There is currently no data on conc omitant administration of CYD dengue vaccine with other vaccines in the indicated popul ation aged 9-60 years of age. Ba sed on the current age indication of the dengue vaccine, co-administration with Adacel\u00ae, currently used in public sector school-based vaccination programs in subjects aged 9 years and above, is nee ded and will be incorporated into the post-licensure plan. Theref ore, the present CYD66 study wil l investigate the immunogenicity and safety of the CYD dengue vaccin e when it is administered co ncomitantly or sequentially (at least 28 days apart) with Adacel\u00ae. In the Philippines, the CYD dengue vaccine received an indication for use in the 9-45 y ear-old subjects. In order to g enerate further data in older subjects, it was decided to also administer the CYD dengue vaccine to 46- 60 year-old subjects in the present study. 5.1.3 Trial Plan A schedule of assessments and study vaccinations is provided in the table of study procedures . All information collected duri ng the study visits must be repor ted into the source documents.

If it did occur, follow the instructions for reporting it . The Investigator or designated s tudy personnel will also remind the instructions to the parent/legall y acceptable representative an d to complete regularly the DC. A follow-up visit can be arrange d depending on the info recorded during the phone call. Sanofi Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 43 of 102 Unscheduled visit/phone call comprised betw een V03 [28+14 [ini tially planned at per Protocol Amendment 1, thi s unscheduled visit/phone call is to take place as soon as possible after study-hold (bet ween V03 and V06). During this vi sit/phone call, subjects will be informed about their dengue s erostatus at baseline, and about t he increased ris k of hospitalized or severe dengue for subjects not exposed to dengue infection prio r to the first inj ection with the CYD dengue vaccine. The subject will consent to continue participation in the study by signing an ICF/AF addendum 1 at subject's next planned visit (either V04, V05 or V06). At the latest, this visit will take place at the same time as V06. The scheduled calendar for the next visits and phone calls may be impacted (delayed) by the length of the study hold. It will be adapted accordingly. Visit 4 (initially planned at Month 7; 6 months [\u00b1 20 days] after Visit 2) The Investigator or desig nated study personnel will: 1) Review the DC pages with the pare nt/legally acceptable represen tative. 2) Perform a physical examination 3) Record the subject's axi llary temperature. 4) Collect information regarding the s ubject's medi cation status s ince the previous visit. 5) For female subjects of childbear ing potential, perform a urine pregnancy test. 6) Review temporary and definitive co ntraindications to vaccinatio n. 7) Inject the second dose of CYD dengu e vaccine to all subjects. 8) Keep the subject under observa tion for 30 minutes, and record a ny immediate AE in the source document. 9) Record the date of injection, the site and side of injection an d the route of administration, as well as the dose number of the vaccine. 10) Give the subject or parent/legal ly acceptable representative a DC. 11) Remind the subject or parent/legally acceptable representative to bring back the DC when they return for Visit 5 at a specified date and time. 12) Complete the relevant eCRF pages for this visit.

In addition, subject or parent/legally acceptable representative will be given a memory aid (MA). 6-Month Safety Follow-up After the Last Vaccination During the 6-month safety follow- up after the last vaccination, subjects will be hi ghly invited to contact the sponsor in case of SAE. In case of hospitalized sus pected dengue case, one unplanned acute blood sample will have to be collected within the first 5 days after fever onset for virological confirmation of dengue disease. If this cannot be a ccomplished within the first 5 days after fever onset, this sample should still be obtained as soon as possible thereafter, for IDMC severity assessment. Safety Follow-Up Telephone Call (6 months af ter the last vaccination): Collection of SAEs After the last CYD dengue dose received (whether 1, 2 or 3 dose s), subjects will still be contacted by telephone. This contact will be made 6 months after the las t vaccination or the closest possible to that date, considering th e potential delay triggered by the study-hold. During this contact, the Investigator or designa ted study personnel will: 1) Ask the subject or parent/legally a cceptable representative if the subject has experienced any SAE, including hospitalized suspe cted dengue case, in the time since vaccination. If it did occur, follow the instru ctions for reporting it. 2) Complete the relevant eCRF pages for this contact. A follow-up visit can be arrang ed depending on the information recorded during t he phone call. SAEs and AEs That Are Related to Vaccina tion or That Led to Discontinuation: At any time during the study, a subj ect who experiences an SAE or an AE must be followed if either of the following is true: x The SAE or AE is considered by t he Investigator to be related t o vaccination, and is not resolved by the end of the subject' s participation in the trial x The subject has been discontinue d from the trial because of the SAE or AE Any such subject must be followed until the condition resolves, becomes stable, or becomes chronic. Sanofi Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 45 of 102 5.1.5 Planned Trial Calendar The following dates are approximate. The actual dates may diffe r as they may be impacted by the study-hold and they depend on the ob tention of the appropriate regulatory and ethical approvals.. Planned trial period (FVFS to LCLSa): Q3 2016 to Q2 2019 Planned vaccination period: Q3 2016 to Q3 2018 Planned end of trial b: Q 2 2019 Planned date of final cli nical study report: Q4 2019 The initial expected duration of each subject's participation i n the trial is approximately 19 months, including a safety fo llow-up period of 6 months after t he third injection of CYD dengue vaccine. 5.1.6 Early Safety Data Review This trial will not include an early review of safety data. How ever, it may be interrupted at any time if new data about the inves tigational product become avail able, and/or on advice of the Sponsor, the IECs/IRBs, or the gove rning regulatory authorities in the Philippines where the trial is taking place. If the trial is prematurely te rminated or suspended, the Sponso r will promptly inform the Investigators, the IECs/IRBs, a nd the regulatory authorities of the reason for termination or suspension. If the trial is prematurely te rminated for any reason, the Inve stigator will promptly inform the subjects and/or the subjects' parents/legally acceptable repres entatives and should assure appropriate therapy and follow-up. An internal SET will perform a s afety analysis on safety data d uring the conduct of the trial. 5.2 Enrollment and Retention of Trial Population 5.2.1 Recruitment Procedures Before the start of the trial, t he Investigator and/or study st aff will determine the recruitment strategy to be used for this st udy (e.g., advertising, database , direct mail, word of mouth referral). Using the relevant methods they w ill contact an appropriate poo l of potential subjects and invite them to participate in the study. T he site will ensure that any advertisements or materials they plan to use to recruit subjects (e .g., letters, pamphlets, posters, etc.) are submitted to Sanofi Pasteur for review prior to submission to the IEC/IRB for approval. a FVFS: first visit of first sub ject; LCLS: last contact of las t subject. b End of trial is defined as the date of the last contact with a trial subject within t he scope of the trial. Sanofi Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 46 of 102 5.2.2 Informed Consent Procedures Informed consent is the proces s by which a subject and an appro priate and legally acceptable representative voluntarily conf irms his or her willingness to p articipate in a particular trial. Informed consent must be obtained before any study procedures a re performed. The process is documented by means of a written, signed, and dated ICF or AF ( according to local EC regulation). Following the amendment of the orig inal protocol, subject/subje ct's parent(s) or legally acceptable representative(s) are to sign a n addendum to the AF and /or the ICF, as per local regulations. In accordance with GCP, prior t o signing and dating the consent form, the subject and an appropriate and legally acceptable representative must be infor med by appropriate study personnel about all aspects of t he trial that are re levant to making the decision to participat e, and must have sufficient time and opport unity to ask any questions. If the subject and the appropriate and legally acceptable repre sentative are not able to read and sign the ICF, then it must be signed and dated by an impartial witness who is independent of the Investigator. A witness who si gns and dates the consent form is certifying that the information in this form and any other written information had been accurately explained to and understood by the subject or his/he r representative. The actual ICF and AF used at e ach center may differ, depending on local regulations and IEC/IRB requirements. However, a ll versions must contain the st andard information found in the sample ICF/AF provided by the S ponsor. Any change to the conten t of the ICF and/or AF must be approved by the Sponsor and the IEC /IRB prior to the form being used. If new information becomes availa ble that may be relevant to th e subject's or legally acceptable representative's willingness t o continue participation in the t rial, this will be communicated to him/her in a timely manner. S uch information will be provided v ia a revised ICF and/or AF or an addendum to the original ICF and/or AF. Informed consent forms will be provided in duplicate, or a phot ocopy of the signed consent will be made. The original will be ke pt by the Investigator, and the copy will be kept by the subject or the subject's legally acceptable representative. Documentation of the consent pr ocess should be recorded in the source documents. 5.2.3 Screening Criteria There are no screeni ng criteria other than the inclusion and ex clusion criteria. 5.2.4 Inclusion Criteria An individual must fulfill all of the following criteria in ord er to be eligible for trial en rollment: 1) Subject aged 9 to 60 years (i.e., f rom the day of the 9th birth day to the day prior to the 61th birthday) on the day of inclusion 2) Subject in good health, based on m edical history and physical e xamination 3) Informed consent form (ICF) or assent form (AF) has been signed and dated by the subject (based on local regulations), a nd/or ICF has been signed and da ted by the parent(s) or another Sanofi Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 47 of 102 legally acceptable representa tive (and by an independent witnes s if required by local regulations) 4) For subject aged 9 to 11 years: know n (documented) receipt of a t least 4 previous doses of diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid a nd acellular pertussis-conta ining (DTaP) vaccines, with the last dose not within the last 5 years prior to enrolment OR For subject aged at least 12 years: known (documented or self-r eported) receipt of at least 3 previous doses of diphtheria toxoid , tetanus toxoid, and who le cell pertussis-containing (DTwP) vaccines, with the last dose not within the last 5 years prior to enrolment 5) Subject (or subject and parent[s] /legally acceptable representa tives) able to attend all scheduled visits and to compl y with all trial procedures 5.2.5 Exclusion Criteria An individual fulfilling any of the following criteria is to be excluded from trial enrollm ent: 1) Subject is pregnant, or lacta ting, or of childbearing potential (to be considered of non- childbearing potential, a f emale must be pre-menarche a or post-menopausal for at least 1 year, surgically sterile, or using a n effective method of contracepti on or abstinence from at least 4 weeks prior to the first vacci nation until at least 4 weeks aft er the last vaccination) 2) Participation at the time of s tudy enrollment (or in the 4 week s preceding the first trial vaccination) or planned participation during the present trial period in another clinical trial investigating a vaccine, drug, medical device, or medical proce dure 3) Planned receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks following any tri al vaccination 4) Previous vaccination against de ngue disease with the trial CYD dengue vaccine 5) Receipt of immune globulins, blo od or blood-derived products in the past 3 months, which might interfere with assessm ent of the immune response 6) Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency (inc luding HIV infection with impaired immune function); or rece ipt of immunosuppressive ther apy such as anti-cancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the preceding 6 months ; or long-term systemic corticosteroids therapy (prednisone or equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks within the past 3 months) 7) A previous severe reaction to pert ussis, diphtheria or tetanus vaccine including immediate anaphylaxis, encephalopathy with in 7 days or seizure within 3 d ays of receiving the vaccine a For pre-menarche females, the young female patients will decl are by themselves (and/or their parent(s) or other legally acceptable representative) if they have no t yet started menstruation.

Any such conditions will be documented in the sour ce document. Significant medical history (reported as dia gnosis) including conditions fo r which the subject is or has been followed by a physician or conditions that could resume during the course of the study or lead to an SAE or to a repetitive outpati ent care will be collected in the eCRF. The significant medical history section of the eCRF cont ains a core list of body system s and disorders that could be used to prompt comprehensive reporti ng, as well as space for the rep orting of specific conditions and illnesses. For each condition, the data collected will be limited to: x Diagnosis (this is preferable t o reporting signs and symptoms) a The components of the vaccines used in the trial are listed i n Section 6.1 and in the Investigator's Brochure or summary of product characteristics. Sanofi Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 49 of 102 x Presence or absence of the condition at enrollment The reporting of signs and sympt oms is strongly discouraged. Dates, medications, and body systems are not to be recorded, an d the information collected will not be coded. Its purpose is to assist in the later interpretation of safety data collect ed during the trial. 5.2.7 Contraindications for Subsequent Vaccinations 5.2.7.1 Temporary Contraindications Should a subject experience one of the conditions listed below, the Investigator will postpone further vaccination until the condition is resolved. Postponeme nt must still be within the timeframe for vaccination indicated in the Table of Study Procedures . 1) Febrile LOOQHVV\u0003 WHPSHUDWXUH\u0003\u0095 38.0\u00b0C) or moderate or severe acute illness/infection on the d ay of vaccination, according to Investigator judgment 2) Receipt of any vaccine other the trial vaccination in the 4 wee ks preceding the trial vaccination 5.2.7.2 Definitive Contraindications Should a subject experience one of the conditions listed below, the Investigator will discontinue vaccination: 1) Pregnancy, as indicated by a posit ive urine test, or lactation 2) An anaphylactic or other signifi cant allergic reaction to the p revious dose of vaccine 3) Individual with acquired imm unodeficiency (including HIV infect ion with impaired immune function); or receipt of immunos uppressive therapy, such as ant i-cancer chemotherapy, radiation therapy or systemic cor ticosteroid thera py (prednison e or equivalent) 4) Ongoing clinical AE related to the previous trial vaccination, and in the Investigator's opinion, contraindicating further vaccination 5) SAE related to the study vaccine following the previous trial v accination 6) Subject classified as a dengue une xposed subject (seronegative) at baseline Subjects will not be withdrawn du e to contraindication but will be followed up for safety and possibly immunogenicity assessment. If a subject has been classified as a \"dengue unexposed\", she/h e will have the poss ibility to continue participating in the safety follow-up. 5.2.8 Conditions for Withdrawal Subjects/Parents/Legally acceptable representatives will be inf ormed that they have the right to withdraw or withdraw their chil d from the trial at any time. x At the discretion of the Investig ator or Sponsor due to safety concerns (withdrawal) without the subject's permission x At the request of the subject/par ents or legally acceptable rep resentatives Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 50 of 102 The following will result in automatic withdrawal or exclusion of a subject from the study: x Significant non-compliance wit h the protocol, based on the Inve stigator's judgment The reason for a withdrawal or dropout should be clearly docume nted in the source documents and on the eCRF. The Investigator must determine whether voluntary withdrawal is due to safety concerns (in which case, the reason for disc ontinuation will be noted as \"SA E\" or \"other AE\" as appropriate) or for another reason. Withdrawn subjects w ill not be replaced. 5.2.9 Lost to Follow-up Procedures In the case of subjects who fail to return for a follow-up exam ination, documented reasonable effort (i.e., documented telephone calls and certified mail) sh ould be undertaken to locate or recall them, or at least to determine th eir health status while fully respecting their rights. These efforts should be documented in the eCRF and in the source documents. 5.2.10 Classification of Subjects Who Discontinue the Trial For any subject who discontinues th e trial prior to completion, the most significant reason for early termination will be checke d in the eCRF. Reasons are list ed below from the most significant to the least significant (refer to the eCRF completion guidelin es for additional details and examples): Serious adverse event: To be used when a subject drops ou t of or is withdrawn from th e study by the Investigator becau se of the occurrence of an SAE, as define d in 9.2.2.1. Other adverse event: To be used when a subject drops out of or is withdrawn from th e study by the Investigator becau se of the occurrence of an AE other than an SAE, as defined in Section 10. Non-compliance with protocol: To be used when the Investigator withdraws a subject from the study because of failure to follow the protocol, including when it is retrospectively discovered that a subject did not fulfill the e ligibility criteria. The Investi gator will provide a comment as to the specific cause of non-compliance. Lost to follow-up: To be used when the Investigator withdraws a subject from the study because of failure to establish contact, as outlined in Section 5.2.9. The Investigator will provide documentation that contact was a ttempted (i.e., return of unsig ned certified letter receipt). Voluntary withdrawal not due to an adverse event: To be used when a subject drops out of the study for any reason other than those listed above. As per Protocol Amendment 1, every effort will be made to c ontact unexposed subjects who discontinued after dengue vaccine injection(s) to inform them a bout their dengue status and their rights to access medical care fo r 10 years after the last dengu e vaccine injection. Sanofi Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 51 of 102 5.2.11 Follow-up of Discontinuations The site should complete all sc heduled safety follow-ups and co ntact any subject who has prematurely terminated the tri al because of an SAE, other type of AE, non-compliance with the protocol, or loss of eligibilit y, including definite contraindi cations. For subjects where the reason f or early termination was lost to follow-up or if the subject withdrew informed consent and s pecified that they do not want t o be contacted again and it is documented in the source document , the site will not attempt to obtain further safety information. For subjects where the reason f or early termination is voluntar y withdrawal, the s ite will attempt to contact them for the 6-mont h follow-up, except if they speci fied that they do not want to be contacted again and it is docum ented in the source document. 5.2.12 Follow-up and Reporting of Pregnancies Pregnancy is an exclusion criteri on for enrollment in this stud y, but a subject could potentially become pregnant during her partic ipation. In case of pregnancy and if at least one dose of the study vaccine(s) has been adminis tered, the subject will not be discontinued from the trial and will be followed for safety assessm ent (and may be followed for immu nogenicity assessment, if applicable). However, no additiona l vaccination will be adminis tered. All pregnancy cases should be r eported if they occurred during the study and during the 6 month follow up period. To report the pregnancy case, the Investigato r must fill out an electronic Pregnancy Reporting Form in the E lectronic Data Capture (EDC) s ystem and inform the Sponsor within 1 month after identifying a pregnancy case. Study staff must then maintain c ontact with the subject to obta in information about the outcome\u2014 i.e., details about the delive ry and the newborn, or about preg nancy termination\u2014and must update the electronic Pregnancy Reporting Form. This information shoul d be provided to the Sponsor within 1 month of delivery. Additional follow-up visits may be performed according to the local regulations. Pregnancy itself is not conside red an AE, but any complications during pregnancy are to be considered as AEs, and in some cases could be considered SAEs. Spontaneous abortions, fetal death, stillbirth, and congenital anomalies reported in the bab y are always considered as SAEs, and the information should be provid ed to the Global PharmacoVi gilance (GPV) Department regardless of when the SAE occu rs (e.g., even after the end of the trial). 5.3 Modification of the T rial and Protocol Any amendments to this trial pl an and protocol must be discusse d with and approved by the Sponsor. If agreement is reached concerning the need for an ame ndment, it will be produced in writing by the Sponsor, and the a mended version of the protocol will replace the earlier version. All substantial amendments e.g., t hat affect the conduct of the trial or the safety of subjects, require IEC/IRB approval, and must also be forwarded to regulat ory authorities. An administrative amendment to a protocol is one that modifies some administrative or logistical aspect of the trial but does not affect its design or objective s or have an impact on the subjects' Sanofi Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 52 of 102 safety. The IECs/IRBs and regul atory authorities must be notifi ed of administrative changes and will provide approval according to local regulations. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that changes to an approved trial, during the period for which IEC/IRB approval has already been given, are not init iated without IEC/IRB review and approval, except to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to sub jects. 5.4 Interruption of the Trial The trial may be discontinued if ne w data about the investigati onal product resulting from this or any other trials become available ; or for administrative reason s; or on advice of the Sponsor, the Investigators, and/or the IECs/ IRBs. If the trial is prematurel y terminated or suspended, the Sponsor shall promptly inform the Investigators, the regulatory authorities, and the IECs/IRBs of the reason for termination or s uspension, as specified by the a pplicable regulatory requirements. The Investigator shall promptly i nform the trial subjects and a ssure appropriate therapy and/or follow-up for them. 6 Vaccines Administered Subjects will receive the CYD de ngue vaccine according to a 3-d ose schedule, given 6 months apart, with the first dose of C YD dengue vaccine administered e ither concomitantly or sequentially with a booster dose of Tdap vaccine (Adacel\u00ae). 6.1 Identity of the Invest igational Presentation: Monodose F o r m : P o w d e r a nd solvent for suspens ion for injection Dose: 0.5 milliliters (mL) of the reconstituted vaccine Route: Subcutaneous (SC) injection Batch number: To be determined 6.1.1.1 Composition Each 0.5 mL dose of reconstituted vaccine contains the followin g components: x Active Ingredients: 4.5 - 6 log 10 cell-culture infectious dose 50% (CCID 50) of each live, attenuated, recombinant dengue virus serotype 1, 2, 3, 4 x Excipients : essential amino aci ds, non-essential Information CYD66 323 - CYD Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 53 of 102 6.1.1.2 Preparation and Administration Sanofi Pasteur's CYD dengue vacci ne consists of a powder and so lvent for suspension for injection and must be stored between +2\u00b0C and +8\u00b0C. The vaccine must be removed from the refrigerator, reconstitute d with the solvent supplied for this purpose, and used immediat ely after reconstitution. The vaccine is to be administered subcutaneously in the deltoid region of the upper arm in a volume of 0.5 mL. Prior to administration, all st udy products must be inspected v isually for cracks, broken seals, correct label content (see Section 6.3.1) , and extraneous particulate ma tter and/or d iscoloration, whenever solution and container permit. If any of these conditi ons exists, the vaccine must not be administered. Another dose is t o be used, and the event is to b e reported to the Sponsor. Subjects must be kept under obser vation for 30 minutes after ea ch vaccination to ensure their safety, and any reactions during t his period will be documented in the eCRF. Appropriate medical equipment and emergency medications, including epinephrine (1:1 000), must be available on site in the event of an anaphylactic or other immediate allergic rea ction. If a vial or syringe is acciden tally broken and the product spi lled out, appropriate disinfection procedures must be used (please refer to the Operating Guidelin es and/or trial center's procedures). 6.1.1.3 Dose Selection and Timing Tetravalent vaccine: CYD01 assessed safety and immunogen icity of a dose of mo novalent dengue virus seroptype 2 chimeric vaccine which demonstrated a satisfactory immune response to serotype 2 but low seropositivity rates to other serotypes thus confirming the need for a tetravalent vaccine. In CYD04, CYD05, and CYD06 the choi ce of a tetravalent vaccine against all 4 serotypes was confirmed as assessed by immunoge nicity responses in several po pulations across different age group and with different flaviviru s background (FV na\u00efve or imm une). Furthermore this was supported by CYD11, whereby several bivalent formulations did n ot improve the immune response compared to tet ravalent formulations. 5 log 10 CCID 50 per serotype ( 5555) Formulation: The results of an early Phase I study (CYD02) showed that a tet ravalent formulation with 4 log 10 CCID 50 per serotype (2 doses given at 5 to 9 month interval) induced moderate but unbalanced Ab levels against the four serotypes (13). Based on these results, it was decided to evaluate a formulation with a higher virus concentration 5 log 10 CCID 50 per serotype (5555) and to introduce a third injection. The safety and immunogenicity of the 5555 fo rmulation of CYD dengue vaccine (5 log 10 CCID 50 per serotype) was thus evaluat ed in additional Phase I trials, CYD04,CYD05,CYD06,CYD12. The 5555 f ormulation reliably induced an immune response against all 4 serotypes afte r 3 injections in various populatio Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 54 of 102 Vaccination schedule: The schedule was selected base d on the results from phase I stu dies CYD02, CYD04, CYD05, and CYD06 in groups receiving tetr avalent vaccine at a 3-inject ion regimen 0,3/4,12 months in different age groups (childre n, adolescents, adults), different regions (non-endemic USA and Latin America , and endemic Asia Pacific) and different baselin e FV status at baseline. The data from initial Phase I studies demonstrated that increasing the i nterval between injections was beneficial. Furthermore, the be nefit of the third injection in terms of seropositivity rate was more marked in younger children and/or subjects who were FV non-immu ne at baseline. A potential priming effect was also observe d following administration of YF vaccine (CYD06) (14). The choice of the final 3 dose sc hedule at 6 month intervals ap art of 5555 formulation was based on data from phase II studies, especially CYD12. The 3-dose sch edule (0, 3-4, and 12 months) and 2-dose schedule (0 and 8-9 months ) were adapted to adjust f or the higher immunogenicity that occurred when Dose 2 w as delayed, balanced by providing pr otection as soon as possible. CYD12 was the first phase II study testing the final 5555 formu lation with the 3 dose schedule 0, 6, and 12 months demonstrating a sa tisfactory immune response t o all 4 serotypes in FV non- immune subjects. Overall, 3 inj ections at 0, 6 and 12 months of 5555 formulation led to consistent immune response against all sero types in all age groups, regard less of baseline FV status (15). 6.1.2 Identity of injection in a vial Dose: 0.5 mL Route: Intramuscular (IM) injection Batch number: Commercial 6.1.2.1 Composition Each 0.5 mL dose of vaccine contains the following components: x Active Ingredients: o Tetanus toxoid 5 Lf o Diphtheria toxoid 2 Lf o Pertussis toxoid 2.5 g o Filamentous Hemagglutinin 5 g o P e r t a c t i n 5 g o Fimbriae types 2 and 3 5 g x Excipients: o aluminum phosphate (adjuvant) 1.5 mg o 2-phenoxyethanol Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 55 of 102 6.1.2.2 Preparation and Administration Sanofi Pasteur's Tdap vaccine con sists of a powder and solvent for suspension for injection and must be stored between +2\u00b0C and +8\u00b0C.

Each vaccine shipment will include a temperature-monitoring dev ice to verify maintenance of the cold chain during tra nsit. On delivery of t he product to the si te, the person in charge of product receipt will follow the instru ctions given in the Operating Gui delines, including checking that the cold chain was maintained during s hipment (i.e., verification o f the temperature recorders). If there is an indication that the cold chain was broken, this per son should immediately quarantine the product, alert the Sanofi Pa steur representative, and reque st authorization from Sanofi Pasteur to use the product. 6.3.2.2 Product Storage The Investigator will be pers onally responsible for product man agement or will designate a staff member to assume this responsibility. At the site, products must be ke pt in a secure place with restr icted access and must be protected from light. Vaccines will be store d in a refrigerator at a temp erature ranging from +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C. The vaccines must not be frozen. The temperature must be monito red and documented (see the Operating Guidelines) for the entire time that the vaccine is a t the trial site. In case of accidental freezing or disruption of the col d chain, vaccines must not be administered and must be quarantined, and the Investigator or authorized designee should contact the Sanofi Pasteur representative for f urther instructions. 6.3.2.3 Product Accountability The person in charge of product management at the site will mai ntain records of product delivery to the trial site, product invent ory at the site, the dose(s) g iven to each subject, a nd the disposal of or return to the Sponsor of unused doses. The necessary information on the pr oduct labels is to be entere d into the source document and the eCRF. If applicable, informati on may also be entered into the s ubject's vaccination card. The Sponsor's monitoring staff will verify the trial site's pro duct accountability records against the record of administered doses in the eCRF. In case of any expected or poten tial shortage of product during the trial, the Investigator or an authorized designee should alert the Sanofi Pasteur representat ive as soon as possible, so that a shipment of extra doses can be arranged. Sanofi Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 57 of 102 6.3.3 Replacement Doses If a replacement dose is required (e.g., because the syringe br oke or particulate matter was observed in the syringe), the sit e personnel must follow the in structions given in the Operating Guidelines. 6.3.4 Disposal of Unused Products Unused or wasted products will be either disposed of or returne d to the Sponsor in accordance with the instructions in the Op erating Guidelines. Product acco untability will be verified throughout the trial period. 6.3.5 Recall of Products If the Sponsor makes a decision t o launch a retrieval procedure , the Investigator(s) will be informed of what needs to be done. 6.4 Blinding and Code-b reaking Procedures The study CYD66 will be an open-labeled study, no blinding is r equired. 6.5 Randomization and A llocation Procedures Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into Group 1 or Grou p 2. Stratification a ccording to age will be applied (9 to 11 year s, 12 to 17 years, 18 to 45 years and 46 to 60 years) to balance the potential difference in terms o f booster response by age group for the pertussis antigens (PT, FHA, PRN and FIM2+3). The full detailed procedures for randomization are described in the Operating Guidelines. Subject numbers will be 8 digits long, with a 3-digit center id entifier and a 5-digit subject identifier. For example, Subject 001-00001 is the first subject enrolled in center number 1 and Subject 002-00001 is the first s ubject enrolled in center numbe r 2. Subject numbers will be an 8-di git string, consisting of a 3-di git study center identifier and a 5- digit subject identifier. The 5- digit subject identifier will c orrespond to the age group (the first digit will be used to identify t he age group, with \"0\" for subj ects aged 9 to 11years, \"1\" for subjects aged 12 to 17 years, \" 2\" for subjects aged 18 to 45 ye ars, and \"3\" for subjects aged 46 to 60 years) and to chronological ord er of enrollment in the cente r. Subject identifier will be: x From 00001 to 09999 for subjects a ged 9 months through 11 years x From 10001 to 19999 for subjects aged 12 years through 17 years x From 20001 to 29999 for subjects a ged 18 years through 45 years x From 30001 to 39999 for subjects aged 46 years through 60 years For example, Subject 001-10001 is th e first subject in the 12-1 7 year-old age group enrolled in the study center number 1 and Subject 002-20001 is the first subjec t from the 18-45 year-old age group enrolled in the study center number 2. Subject numbers should not be reassigned for any reason. Sanofi Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 58 of 102 The Statistical Platform of the Sponsor will provide scratchabl e randomization lists (one per site). These lists will mention the randomization number of the subjec t and the corresponding study group covered by a silver-colored pa tch. After subject number a llocation to a subject, the Investigator will scratch off the list to know the study group. Once scratched, each randomization line will be dated and signed by the Investigator or the sub-In vestigator in charge of administering the study vaccine(s). Each subject will be vaccinate d with the product(s) correspondi ng to the group mentioned on the randomization list. If the dose initially taken for the vaccina tion is broken or cannot be used, the Investigator will take another dose of the same vaccine. 6.6 Treatment Compliance The following measures will ensure that the vaccine doses admin istered comply with those planned, and that any non-compliance is do cumented so that it can be acc ounted for in the data analyses: x All vaccinations will be adm inistered by qualified trial person nel x The person in charge of product management at the site will mai ntain accountability records of product delivery to the trial site, product inventory at the site, dose(s) given to each subject, and the disposal of unus ed or wasted doses 6.7 Concomitant Medications and Other Therapies At the time of enrollment, ongoi ng medications including other therapies e.g., blood products, should be recorded in the source do cument as well as new medica tions prescribed for new medical conditions/AEs duri ng trial participation. Documentation in the e CRF of concomitant medication will be lim ited to specific categories of medication of interest beginning on the day of vaccination. Thi s may include medications of interest that were started prior to the day of vaccination. Reportable medications will be co llected in the eCRF from the d ay of vaccination to the end of the solicited and unsolicite d follow-up period (e.g., 28 day sa fety follow-up) as they may impact the response to the vaccination a nd impact the consistency of t he information collected on concomitant medications at any vaccination. The \"reportable\" medications are distributed according to two c ategories: x Category 1 (Restricted inhaled and topical ster oids should not be captured x Category 2 (Prohibited the rapies for the PP): x Vaccines (other than the trial vaccines) in the 4 weeks before and after each trial vaccination x Immunosuppressive therapy such a s anti-cancer chemotherapy or r adiation therapy or long-term systemic corticosteroids (for more than 2 consecutive weeks) in the 4 weeks after each trial vaccination Sanofi Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 59 of 102 x Immune globulins, blood or blood-de rived products in the 4 week s before and after each trial vaccination The information reported in the eCRF for each reported medicati on will be limited to: x Trade name x Given as treatment or as prophylaxis x Medication category x Start and stop dates Dosage and administration route will not be recorded. Homeopath ic medication will not be recorded. Topical treatment will not be recorded. The fact that a medication was gi ven in response to an AE will be captured in the \"Action Taken\" column of the AE only. N o details will be reco rded in the co ncomitant medication module of the eCRF unless the medicati on received belongs to one of the prelisted categ ories. Medicat ions will not be coded. 7 Management of Samples Blood samples for the assessment of Ab responses will be collec ted at Visits 1, 2, 3, and 7. See the Table of Study Procedures and Section 5.1.3 for details of the sampling schedule. 7.1 Sample Collection 7.1.1 Serum Samples for Neutralizing Ab Assessment At Visits 1, 2, 3, and 7, 2 to 6 mL of blood will be collected in tubes provided by or recommended by the Sponsor. Immediately pri or to the blood draw, the staff member performing the procedure will verify the subjec t's identity; will write the assigned sub ject's number on the pre-printed label that contains that subject's num ber and the sampling stage; and will attach the label to the tube. Blood is to be taken from the limb opposite to the one that wil l be used for vaccination for sequential injecti on (Group 1), or from the limb that will be u sed for Tdap opposite to the one that will be used for CYD dengue vaccine for concomitant injection ( Group 2). At the time of study-hold, subj ects already provided 2 or 3 blo od samples (BL), depending on their allocation group. Blood samples collected before administ ration of the fir st dose of CYD dengue vaccine will be used for ba seline dengue serostatus asse ssment. partic ipants. Dengue exposed subje cts as initially planned.

The acute blood sample for all hospitalized suspected dengue cases should be collected within the pre-specified timeframe as described above. If this cannot be accomplished, this sample sh ould still be obtained as soon as possible thereafter, for IDMC se verity assessment. This blood s ample will be used to confirm whether a hospitalized suspecte d dengue case is dengue disease or not, and upon confirmation of infection, to identify dengue virus serotype. For all hospitalized suspected de ngue cases, the Investigator m ust ensure that key biological (aspartate aminotrans ferase [AST], bilirubin, and hemato crit count) have been checked or are planned to be checked as part of local standard of care at the hospital. If these parame ters have not been measured, additional blood specimens will be taken to perform these tests for the assessment of severity according to the WHO/IDMC classification (see Section 9.2.3 for more details). Table 7.2 presents the additional serum aliquots to be taken from subjec t with hospitalized suspected dengue case at any time during the trial. Additional details are found in the Operating Guidelines.

More deta iled instructions are detailed in the Guidelines for Assessing Viscerotropic and Neurotropic AE (16) (17) (18) document. 7.1.4 Urine Samples Pregnancy tests are applicable only for any female subjects of childbearing potential. Urine samples for pregnancy tests at the vaccination visits (V01 [Gro up 2], V02, V04, and V06) will be taken and analyzed at the trial center. 7.2 Serum Sample Preparation Detailed instructions on how to pr epare blood samples for asses sment of Ab response are contained in the Operating Gui delines provided to the site. An overview of the procedures is provided here. Following the blood draw, the samp ling tube should be stored at room temperature for a minimum of 60 minutes and a maximum of 2 h ours to allow the blood to cl ot before centrifugation. The tube must be stored vertically and will not be shaken. Beyond 2 hours, the sampling tube mu st be refrigerated at a tem perature of +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C and must be centrifuged within a maximum of 24 hours. After clotting and centrifugation, the serum will be harvested and divided into appropriate number of aliquots. Samples will then be handled one subject at a time to avoid a mix-up of subjects' blood tubes. Serum will be trans ferred to the appropriate numbe r of tubes, pre-labeled with adhesive labels that clearly i dentify the subjec t's number and sampling stage or visit number. The subject's identification nu mber and code, the date of sampl ing, the number of aliquots obtained, and the date and time of preparation are to be specif ied on a sample identification list. Space is provided on this list for comments on the quality of s amples. Serum will be aliquoted in tubes which are specified in the Ope rating Guidelines. Aliquots will be frozen immediately at -20\u00b0C or below until testing. 7.3 Sample Storage and Shipment During storage, serum tubes are to be kept in a freezer whose t emperature is set and maintained at -20\u00b0C or below. The temperatu re will be monitored and documente d on the appropriate form during the entire trial. If it ri ses above -10\u00b0C for any period of time, the Clinical Logistics Coordinator must be notified. See th e Operating Guidelines for further details. Shipments to the laboratories will be made only after appropria te monitoring, and following notification of the C linical Logistics Coor dinator. Sera will b e shipped frozen, using dry ice to maintain them in a frozen state , in the packaging container pro vided by the carrier. Again, temperatures will be monitored. Shipments must be compliant wit h the International Air Transport Association (IATA) 602 regulations. Sanofi Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 62 of 102 Samples will be shipped to GCI a t Sanofi Pasteur. The address i s provided in the Operating Guidelines. 7.4 Future Use of Stored Seru m Samples for Research Any unused part of the serum samples will be securely stored at the Sanofi Pasteur serology laboratory (GCI) for at least 5 ye ars after the la st license ap proval in the relevant market areas has been obtained for the va ccine being tested. Subjects or subjects' parents/legally representatives will be a sked to indicate in the ICF whether they will permit the future use of any unused stored serum samp les for other tests. If they refuse permission, the samples will not be used for any testing other than that directly related to this study. If they agree to this use , they will not be paid for giv ing permission (anonymity of samples will be ensured). The aim of a ny possible future research is un known today, and may not be related to this particular s tudy. It may be to improve the know ledge of vaccines or infectious diseases, or to improve laborat ory methods. Genetic tests will never be performed on these samples without individual informed consent. 8 Clinical Supplies Sanofi Pasteur will supply the t rial sites with protocols, ICFs , AFs, eCRFs, DCs, MAs, and other trial documents, as well as wit h the following trial materials: all study vaccines and injection materials, blood collection tubes , cryotubes, cryotube storage boxes, cryotube label s, temperature recorders, shipping containers, r ulers, and digital thermometer s. The means for performing Electronic Data Capture (EDC) will be defined by Sanofi Pasteur. If a computer is provided by Sanofi Past eur, it will be retrieved at the end of the trial. The Investigator will supply a ll vaccination supplies, phleboto my, and centrifugation equipment, including biohazard and/or safety supplies. The biohazard and s afety supplies incl ude needles and syringes, examination gloves, la boratory coats, sharps disposal containers, and absorbent countertop paper. The site will ensure that all biohazard waste s are autoclaved and disposed of in accordance with local practices. The Investigator will also sup ply appropriate space in a temperature-monitored refrigerato r for the storage of the produ cts and for the blood samples, and appropriate space in a temperatu re-monitored freezer for serum aliquots. In the event that additional s upplies are required, study staff must contact Sanofi Pasteur, indicating the quantity require d. Contact information is provid ed in the Operating Guidelines. They must allow approximatel y 1 week for an order to be filled and to have the supplies sent to their site.

Purified P T, FHA, PRN, or FIM2+3 Ag is adsorbed to the wells of a microtiter plate. Diluted serum samp les (test samples, reference standards, and quality c ontrols) are incubated in the wells. Sp ecific Abs in the serum samples bind to the immobilized Ag to form Ag-Ab complexes. Unbound Abs are washed from the wells, and enzyme-conjugated anti-human IgG is added. The enzyme conjugate binds to the Ag-Ab complex. Excess conjugate is washed away a nd a specific colorimetric sub strate is added. Bound enzyme catalyzes a hydrolytic reaction c ausing color development. The intensity of the generated color is proportional to the amount of s pecific Ab bound to the wells. T he results are read on a spectrophotometer (ELISA plate r eader). An in house reference s tandard serum assayed on each plate is used to calculate the a mount of specific PT, FHA, PRN, or FIM2+3 Ab in the test samples in ELISA unit (EU)/mL by compari son to the reference standard c urves. The LLOQ for the anti- PT, PRN, and FIM ELISA is 4 EU/mL and the LLOQ for the anti-FHA ELISA is 3 EU/mL . Antibodies to Tetanus Toxin Assays will be performed by ELISA a t Sanofi Pasteur. Purified T etanus Ag is adsorbed to the wells of a microtiter pl ate. Diluted serum samples (test sample s, reference standard, and quality control) are incubated in the well s. Specific Abs in the serum samples bind to the immobilized Ag. Unbound Abs are washed from the wells, and enzyme-conjugate d anti-human IgG is added. The enzyme conjugate binds to the Ag-Ab complex. Excess conjuga te is washed away and a specific colorimetric substra te is added. Bound enzyme catalyze CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 64 of 102 causes color development. The int ensity of the generated color is proportional to the amount of specific Ab bound to the wells. T he results are read on a spect rophotometer (ELISA plate reader). A reference standard assayed on each plate, WHO human standard lot TE3, is used to calculate the amount of specific anti-Tetanus Ab in the unitage assigned by the reference standard (IU/mL of serum). The LLOQ for the an ti-Tetanus ELISA is 0.01 IU/mL. Antibodies to Diphtheria Toxin (MIT Method) Assays will be performed by an MIT-TNA at Sanofi Pasteur. Seria l dilutions of human sera are mixed with diphtheria challenge toxin and incubated with Vero c ells that are sensitive to the toxin. Neutralizing Abs specific to di phtheria toxin c ontained in the serum samples bind to and neutralize the toxin. The neutr alized toxin does not affect cel lular viability, therefore the cultured cells continue to metabolize and release CO 2, reducing the pH of the culture medium. Cell survival correlates with the c hange in the color of the pH indi cator (phenol red to yellow at pH \u0094 7.0) contained in the medium. In the absence of neutralizing A bs, the challenge toxin reduces cellular metabolism and CO 2 production, therefore the pH does not decrease and a color cha nge is not detected. The LLOQ is 0.005 IU/mL. Dengue Neutralizing Abs Dengue neutralizing Ab will be measured by PRNT 50 (using parental dengue virus strains of constructs) by Sanofi GCI, Swiftw (or outsourced ext ernal laboratory). Serial, two-fold dilutions of serum to be tested (previously he at-inactivated) are mixed with a constant challenge-dose of each dengue virus serotype 1, 2, 3 o r 4 (expressed as plaque-forming unit [PFU]/mL). The mixtures ar e inoculated int o wells of a mic roplate with confluent cell monolayers. After adsorption, ce ll monolayers are incubated for a few days. The presence of dengue virus infected cells i s indicated by formation of plaque s. A reduction in virus infectivity due to neutralization by Ab present in serum samples is detecte d. The reported value (end point neutralization titer) represents the highest dilution of serum at whicK\u0003\u0095 50% of dengue challenge virus (in plaque counts) is neut ralized when compared to the me an viral plaque count in the negative control wells which rep resents the 100% virus load.

Adverse Event: An AE is any untoward medical occu rrence in a patient or clinic al investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necess arily have to have a causal relationship with this treatmen t. An AE can therefore be any un favorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory f inding, for example), sympto m or disease temporally associated with the use of a med icinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Therefore an AE may be: x A new illness x The worsening of a concomitant illness Sanofi Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 66 of 102 x An effect of the vaccination, i ncluding the comparator x A combination of the above All AEs include serious and non-serious AEs. Surgical procedures are not AEs; they are the action taken to t reat a medical condition. It is the condition leading to the action take n that is the AE (if it occ urs during the t rial period). Pre-existing medical conditions a re not to be reported as AEs. However, if a pre-existing condition worsens in frequency or i ntensity, or if in the asses sment of the treating physician there is a change in its c linical significance , this change should be reported as an AE (exacerbation). This applies equally to recurri ng episodes of pre-existing cond itions (e.g., asthma) if the frequency or intensity inc reases post-vaccination. Serious Adverse Event: Serious and severe are not synonymous. The term severe is often used to descri be the intensity of a specific event as corresponding to Grad e 3. This is not the s ame as serious which is based on patient/event outcome or action cr iteria usually associated wit h events that pose a threat to a patient's life or functioning. S eriousness, not severity, serve s as a guide for de fining regulatory reporting obligations. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: x Results in death x Is life-threateninga x Requires inpatient hospitalizati on or prolongation of existing hospitalizationb x Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacityc x Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect x Is an important medical eventd a The term \"life-threatening\" ref ers to an event in which the s ubject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caus ed death if it were more severe. b All medical events leading to hospitalizations will be record ed and reported as SAEs, with the exception of: hospitalization planned before inclusion into the study or out- patient treatment with no hospitalization. c \"Persistent or si gnificant disability or incapacity\" means th at there is a substantial di sruption of a person's ability to carry out normal life functions. d Medical and scientific judgmen t should be exercised in decidi ng whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threat ening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the health of the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the def inition above. These should als o usually be considered serious. Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatm ent in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi talization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse, new onset diabetes, or autoimmune disease . Sanofi Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 67 of 102 Additionally, the following importa nt medical events are to be considered as SAEs and reported to the Sponsor according to the procedure described in Section 10: Adverse Reaction: All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product rel ated to any dose should be considered adverse reactions (AR). (The phrase \"responses to a medic inal product\" means that a cau sal relationship between a medicinal product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibilit y) Unexpected Adverse Reaction (UAR): An UAE is an AR, the nature or severity of which is not consist ent with the applicable product information (e.g., Investigator's Brochure for an unapproved in vestigational medi cinal product). The following additional definiti ons are used by Sanofi Pasteur : Solicited Reaction: A solicited reaction is an event that is prelisted in the eCRF . The assessment of these AEs post- vaccination is mandatory. A so licited reaction is defined by a combination of: x Symptom and x Onset post-vaccination e.g., injection site pain between D0 and D7 post-vaccination, o r headache between D0 and D14. A solicited reaction is therefore an AR observed and reported u nder the conditions (symptom and onset) prelisted (i.e., solicite d) in the eCRF and considered a s related to vaccination. Unsolicited AE/AR: An unsolicited AE is an observed AE that does not fulfill the c onditions prelisted in the eCRF in terms of diagnosis and/or onset post-vaccination, i.e., excludi ng solicited reactions, e.g., if headache between D0 and D14 is a solicited reaction (i.e., prel isted in the eCRF), then a headache starting on D14 is a solicited r eaction, whereas headache start ing on D15 post-vaccination is an unsolicited AE. An unsolicited non-serious AE is a n unsolicited AE excluding SA Es. Injection Site Reaction: An injection site reactiona is an AR at and around the injec tion site. Inje ction site reac tions are commonly inflammatory reactions. Systemic AE: Systemic AEs are all AEs that a re not injection site reactions. They therefore include systemic manifestations such as headache , fever, as well as localized or topical manifestations that are not associated with the vaccinati on site, e.g., erythema that is lo calized but that is not at the injection site. a All injection site AEs are cons idered to be related to vaccin ation and are therefore all injection site reactions Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 68 of 102 Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs): AEs of special interest are AE s that are considered by the Spon sor to be relevant for the monitoring of the saf ety profile of the inve stigational vaccine . 9.2.2.2 and CYD dengue vaccine safety in each group are: x Occurrence of immediate AEs re ported in the 30 minutes after ea ch/any injection x Occurrence of solicited (i.e., pr e-listed in the subject's DC a nd eCRF) injection site reactions (pain, erythema and swelling) within 7 days following each/any injection x Occurrence of solicited systemi c reactions (fever, headache, ma laise, myalgia, and asthenia) occurring up to 14 days following each/any injection x Occurrence of unsolicited (spontan eously reported) AEs within 2 8 days following each/any injection x Occurrence of non-serious AESI s* occurring up to 7 days followi ng each and any injection x Occurrence of SAEs, including ser ious AESIs* (with specific tim e windows according to the type of AESI*) thr oughout the trial** x Occurrence of hospitalized VCD cases throughout the trial (i.e. , from D0 through the end of the study) * Hypersensitivity/allergic r eactions (serious or not) wit hin 7 days after each CYD dengue vaccine injection, serious viscerotropic disease within 30 days after each CYD dengue vaccine injection, serious neurot ropic disease within 30 a fter each CYD dengue vaccine injection; serious dengue cases requiring hospitalization (i.e. , hospitalized sus pected dengue case) occurring in all subjects at any time during the study. ** Subjects from Group 1 will not be vaccinated at V01 but wi ll receive the first vaccinations at V02. However, SAEs will be recor ded from inclusion and subjects from Group 1 will receive a SAE-specific DC at V01 tha t will be collected at V02. Depending on the item, these could i nclude: nature (Medical Dic tionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA] preferred term), tim e of onset, duration, number of da ys of occurrence, grade of severity, relationship to vaccine, action taken, whether the AE led to early termination from the study, seriousness, or outcome. Hospitalized suspected dengue cas e is defined as an acute febri le illness with diagnosis of dengue requiring hospitalization (with be d attribution). In such cases , 1 unplanned acute blood sample (within the first 5 days after fe ver onset) will be collected f or virological confirmation of hospitalized suspected dengue cas e. A suspected case will be co nsidered VCD if there is a detection of WT dengue virus by de ngue NS1 Ag ELISA and/or deng ue RT-PCRs (at the GCI or GCI designated laboratory). Note: Acute blood sample for all hospitalized suspected dengue cases should be collected within the pre-specified timeframe as described above. If this cannot be accomplished, this sample should still be obtained as soon as possible thereafter, for ID MC severity assessment.

All rele vant data will be transcribed i nto the eCRF according to the instructions provided by the Sponsor. 9.2.2.3.1 Immediate Post-vaccination Surveillance Period Subjects will be kept under obser vation for 30 minutes after ea ch vaccination to ensure their safety. The post-vaccination sur veillance should be documented in the source document. Any AE that occurs during this period w ill be noted on the source docu ment and recorded in the eCRF, as follows: x Any unsolicited systemic AE occurring during the first 30 minutes post-vaccination will be recorded on the eCRF as immedi ate unsolicited systemic AE x Solicited and unsolicited injec tion site reactions and solicite d systemic reactions will be recorded and analyzed as starting on the day of vaccination x Any SAE occurred during the first 30 minutes post-vaccination w ill be reported in the same way as any other SAE and to the Sponsor, according to the proce dures described in Section 10 9.2.2.3.2 Reactogenicity: Solicited Rea ctions From Day 0 to Day 7 (inject ion site reactions) or Day 14 (systemic reactions) After Each Vaccination After each vaccination, subjects or legally acceptable represen tatives will be provided with a safety DC, a digital thermomete r, and a flexible ruler, and wil l be instructed how to use them.

Sanofi Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 74 of 102 Important notes for the accurate assessment of temperature: Subjects or legally acceptable representatives are to measure b ody temperature once per day, preferably always at the same time. The optimal time for measur ement is the evening, when body temperature is the highest. Tempe rature is also to be measured at the time of any apparent fever. The observed daily temperature and the route of measurement are to be recorded in the DC/MA, and the highest temperature wi ll be recorded by the site in the eCRF. The preferred route for this trial is axillary. Pre-vaccinati on temperature is also systemat ically collected by t he Investigator in the eCRF for subjects age d between 9 and 11 years old, and on t he source document for other subjects. Tympanic thermometers must not be used. 9.2.2.3.3 Unsolicited Non-serious Adv erse Events From Day 0 to Day 28 Aft er Each Vaccination In addition to recordi ng solicited reactions , subjects or legal ly acceptable representatives will be instructed to record any other medical events that may occur du ring the 28-day period after each vaccination to be taken as per the trial design.

Any SAE occurring at any time duri ng the trial will be reported by the Investigator through the EDC system and according to the completion guidelines provided by the Sponsor. All information concerning the SAE is to be repor ted, either as part of the ini tial reporting or during follow-up reporting if relevant information became available later (e.g., outcome, medical h istory, results of investigations, copy of hospitalization repor ts. The Investigat or will assess the causal relationship between the SAE and the investigat ional product as either \"Not related\" or \"Related\", as described in Section 10.4. See Section 10 for further details on SAE reporting. 9.2.2.3.5 Adverse Events of Special Interest The following AESIs will be considered: Non-Serious AESIs x Non-serious hypersensitivity/aller gic reactions oc curring in al l subjects within 7 days after vaccination. Serious AESIs x Serious hypersensitivity/allergi c reactions occurring in all su bjects within 7 days after CYD dengue vaccine injection x Serious viscerotropica disease occurring in all subject s within 30 days after vaccina tion CYD dengue vaccine injection x Serious neurotropica disease occurring in all subjects within 30 days after vaccina tion CYD dengue vaccine injection x Serious dengue cases r equiring hospitalizationb, occurring in all subjects at any time during the study a Specific guidelines will be provided to the Investigator to he lp in the assessment of AEs that may be indicative of viscerotropic or neurotropic dis ease (see Guidelin es for Assess ing Viscerotropic and Neurotropic AE). b Serious dengue case requiring hospitalization a d suspected dengue Sanofi Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 76 of 102 9.2.2.3.6 Assessment of Causality The Investigator will assess the causal relationship between each unsolicited systemic AE and vaccination as either not relate d or related, based on the foll owing definitionsa: 0: Not related - The AE is c learly/most probably caused by othe r etiologies such as subject's underlying condition, therapeutic intervention, or concomitant therapy; or the delay between vaccination and the onset of the AE is incompatible wit h a causal relationship; or the AE started before vaccinati on (screening phase, if applicab le) 1: Related - There is a \"reasona ble possibility\" that the AE w as caused by the vaccination, meaning that there is evidence or arguments to suggest a causal relationship Note: By convention, all injec tion site AEs (solicited and unso licited) and all solicited systemic reactions are considered to be r elated to vaccination and refer red to as reactions, and therefore do not require the Investigat or's opinion on relatedness. AEs likely to be related to the p roduct, whether serious or not , that persist at t he end of the trial will be followed up by the Investig ator until their complete di sappearance or the stabilization of the subject's condition. The Invest igator will inform the Spons or of the date of final disappearance of the event. 9.2.3 Methods for Assessing Virologica l Confirmation of Hospitalized Suspected Dengue Case and Assessment of Case Severity In the event of a hospitalized s uspected dengue case, the follo wing tests will be performed on the acute BL based on the pro cess described below. Dengue Screen RT-PCR Dengue screen RT-PCR test will be performed by Sanofi Pasteur G CI, Swiftwater, USA or GCI designated laboratory. Assessment and quantitation of de ngue viremia is determined by testing serum samples with a nucleic-acid based assay. RNA is extracted from the serum to di scard potential Taq polymerase inhibitors or interfering factors , using a commercial kit. Then , a RT-PCR is carried out with primers from a gene sequence conserved among dengue viruses. Du e to a virus standard included in each run, results can be expressed as a concentration of log 10 plaque forming unit (PFU)/mL. Dengue NS1 Ag ELISA The NS1 Ag ELISA will be performe d using a Ag test is a one-step sandwich-ELISA b ased assay that enables detection of NS1 serum. The test uses murine monoclonal a ntibodies (MAbs) for capture and revelation. Samples and controls are directly and simultaneously incubated with the conjugate within the microplate wells coa ted with MAb. If NS1 Ag is prese nt in the sample, an immune- a ICH Guidelines, Clinical Safety Data Management E2A Sanofi Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 77 of 102 complex MAb-NS1-MAb/peroxidase w ill be formed. The presence of immune-complex is demonstrated by addition of a chr omogenic solution that initiat es a color development reaction. After 30 minutes of incubation at room temperature, the enzymat ic reaction is stopped by addition of an acid solution. The optic al density (OD) r eading obtained with a spectrophotometer set at 450/620 nm is proportional to the a mount of NS1 Ag present in t he sample. The presence of NS1 Ag in an individual sample is determined by comparing the OD re ading of the sample to the OD of the cutoff control serum. Sample ratios of < \u0013\u0011\u0018\u000f\u0003\u0095 \u0013\u0011\u0018\u0003WR\u0003\u0094 1.0, and > 1.0 will be indicative of negative, equivocal, and positive results, respectively. SimplexaTM Dengue RT-PCR Serotype identification of by testing serum samples with a nucleic-acid based assay. B riefly, RNA is extracted from the serum to discard potential polymerase inhibitors or interf ering factors, using a commercia l kit. Then the Simplexa dengue RT-PCR assay is dengue sequences. The qualitatively and reported for each dengue serotype as detected or not detected. This assay will be used on all dengue screen RT-PCR positive or Dengue NS1 Ag ELISA positive for serotype identif ication. In addition sequencing ana lysis may be attempted on isolates from the serotyped samples.

Hematology - Biochemistry Hematology and biochemistry parameters (AST, creatinine, b lood cell count, total bilirubin, and hematocrit count) will be meas ured by local laboratories us ing standard methods as per routine standard of care in the Philippines. However, the measu rement of any of these biological parameters may be undertaken (or repeated), based on the Invest igator's judgment, to ensure the adequate evaluation of hospitalized VCD case severity. It is no teworthy that hematocrit and platelet counts are re quired parameters in the WHO/IDMC severit y assessment protocol. The results will be collected in the eCRF. The assessment of biological par ameters will be: within normal range or outside normal range. Normal ranges for each biological parameter will be provided by the local laboratory and collected in the eCRF.

The designation of a hospitalized V CD case as severe will be ma de on a case by case basis by the IDMC. 9.2.4 Efficacy There are no secondary objectives for efficacy. 9.3 Observational Endpoints and Assessment Methods There are no observational objectives in this study. 10 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events In order to comply with current regulations on SAE reporting to health authorities, the Investigator must document all SA Es regardless of causal relati onship, and notify the Sponsor and the Clinical Research Associate ( CRA) and/or the Regional Clini cal Trial Manager (RCTM) within the notification timelin es stated in the following secti ons. The Investigator will give access and provide the Sponsor and the CRA and/or the RCTM with all ne cessary information to allow the Sponsor to conduct a detaile d analysis of the safety of the investigational product(s). It is the responsibility of the Investigat or to request all necessary doc umentation (e.g., medical records, Sanofi Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 79 of 102 discharge summary, autopsy) in or der to provide comprehensive s afety information. All relevant information must then be transcr ibed into the SAE Reporting For m. 10.1 Initial Reporting by the Investigator SAEs occurring during a subject's participation i n the trial or experiment must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor's GPV Department and to the CRA. Every SAE must be reported, even if the Investigator considers that i t is not related to the vaccin e. The SAE form must be signed by a licensed physician (M.D. or D.O.) for whom the task is listed o n the Study Task Delegation and Signature List after each update to the Form. The Investigator must complete t he \"eSAE Form\" in the EDC appli cation. After validation, an e- mail alert will automatically be sent to the GPV mailbox, the C RA and the Global Medical Expert. This message will include the country, the study code, the subject number, whether the report is initial or a follow- up, the diagnosis and/or symptoms , the seriousness criteria, and the outcome, if fatal. If the EDC system is unavailable , the site must notify the Spon sor using the paper version of the SAE Reporting Form, as follows: The Investigator must complete the SAE Reporting Form, check of f the \"Initial Reporting Form\" box, and send it to the Sponsor by on e of the following means: x By fax, to the following number: +33 4 37 37 71 32 x In PDF format to the followi ng e-mail address, using a method o f transmission that includes password protection: pv.outsourcing@sanofipasteur.com x By express mail, to the followi ng address, using a method of tr ansmission that includes password protection: Sanofi Pasteur 14, Espace Henry 69007 Lyon - France When the system becomes availabl e, the Investigator must transc ribe the information from the paper version of the eSAE Form into the EDC system. If there is need for urgent cons ultation, the Investigator is t o contact a designated Sponsor representative. The contact infor mation is provided in the \"Inv estigators and Study Participants\" Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 80 of 102 10.2 Follow-up Reporting by the Investigator The eSAE Form completed ini tially must be updated within 24 hou rs after the Investigator has become aware of any new relevant information concerning the SAE (e.g., outcome, precise description of medical history, results of the investigation). After validation, an e-mail alert will be sent automatically to the GP V Department and to the CRA and/ or the RCTM. All relevant information must be included dire ctly in the eSAE form. Copies of documents (e.g., medical records, discharge summary, aut opsy) may be requested by the GP V Department. The anonymity of the subject must always be respected when forw arding this information. 10.3 Reporting of SAEs Occurring Aft er a Subject Has Completed the S tudy Any SAE that occurs after a subj ect has completed the study but that is likely to be related to the product or to the experiment must also be reported as soon as p ossible. In such a case, the reporting procedure to be followed i s identical to that describ ed in Section 10.1. 10.4 Assessment of Causality The causal relationship betwee n the SAE and the product will fi rst be evaluated by the Investigator, using the following definitions: 0 - Not related : The AE is clearly/most proba bly caused by other etiologies su ch as an underlying condition, therapeutic intervention, or concomitant therapy; or the delay between vaccination and the onset of the SAE is incompatible with a cau sal relationship; or the SAE started before vaccination (screening phase, if applicable). 1 - Related : There is a \"reasonable possibil ity\" that the SAE was caused by the vaccination, meaning that there is evidence or arguments to suggest a causal relationship. (ICH Guidelines, Clinical Safety Data Management E2A) Following this, the Sponsor's P roduct Safety Officer (PSO) will also assess the causal relationship to the product, based on the ava ilable information and current medical knowledge. The decision to modify or discon tinue the trial may be made aft er mutual agreement between the Sponsor and the I nvestigator(s). 10.5 Reporting SAEs to Health Au thorities and IECs/IRBs The Sponsor will inform the relevant health authorities of any reportable SAEs according to the local regulatory requirements. R eporting to the health authorit ies will be according to the Sponsor's standard operating procedures. The Sponsor's RMO will notify the Investigators in writing of t he occurrence of any reportable SAEs. The Investigators/Sponsor will be responsible for informi ng the IECs or IRBs that reviewed the Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 81 of 102 11 Data Collection and Management 11.1 Data Collection and eCRF Completion Individual safety DCs, specifica lly designed for this trial by the Sponsor and provided to the study sites, will be given to study part icipants for the recording of daily safety information as described in Section 9.2.2.3. These DCs will include prelisted terms and intensity scales (s ee Table 9.1 to Table 9.3) as well as areas for free text to capture additional safety in formation or other relevant details. Subjects or legally acceptable representatives will al so be provided with rulers for measuring the size of injection site reactions, and with standa rd digital thermometers for measuring daily temperatures. To ensure consistency of reportin g, the study sites will instruct subjects or legally acceptable representatives on how to correc tly use these tools. The 6-month follow-up will be done by interviewing subjects eit her during a visit or over the telephone using a questio nnaire to capture SAEs and AESIs, if a pplicable. A memory aid will be provided to the subjects at th e preceding trial visit to help t hem record information on events occurring between this visit and the 6-month follow-up. Relevant information will be trans cribed into the eCRF. Any SAE s captured during this 6-month follow-up period will be reported a nd followed-up as per the no rmal process for reporting SAEs. The clinical team may decide to replace the MA by a DC if a fol low-up visit is planned for the subjects. At specified intervals, the I nvestigator or an authorized desig nee will interview the subjects or legally acceptable representativ es to collect the information r ecorded in the DC, and will attempt to clarify anything that is inc omplete or unclear. All clinical trial information gathered by the study site will be reported elect ronically by the Investigator or authorized designee using a web- based eCRF. (Any information tha t was not documented in the DC will first be captured in the source document and then reporte d electronically.) The eCRF has been designed specifically for this trial under the responsib ility of the Sponsor, using a val idated Electronic Records/Electronic Signature-compliant platform (21 CFR Part 11). To ensure the correct and consis tent completion of the eCRF, th e Sponsor or authorized representative will provide all necessary tools, instructions, and training to all site staff involved in data entry prior to study start. Additional instructional do cuments such as training manuals and completion guidelines will be provided to assist with data entr y during the course of the trial. Upon completion of training, each user requiring access to the EDC system will be issued a unique username and password. In the event of a change in trial personnel, each newly assigned individual will receive a unique username and password; the use rname and password of a previous user may not be reissue d. If any trial personnel leave the study, the Investigator is responsible for informing the Spons or immediately so that their access is deactivated. An audit trail will be initiated in the ED C system at the time of the fi rst data entry in or der to track all modifications and to ensur e database integrity. The Investigator is responsible for the timeliness, completenes s, and accuracy of the information in the eCRF; must provide explan ations for all missing informat ion; using Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 82 of 102 11.2 Data Management 11.2.1 Management of Clinical Data Data generated during the trial will be managed following two d ifferent processes: x Clinical data, defined as all da ta reported in the eCRF, and la boratory data will be handled by the Sponsor's Clinical Data Ma nagement (CDM) platform or aut horized representative. x Data pertaining to SAEs and pregna ncies, which are reported by the Investigator respectively on the eSAE Forms or SAE Reporting Forms and e-Pre gnancy Forms, will be handled by the Sponsor's GPV Department. During the trial, clinical data r eported in the eCRF will be in tegrated into the clinical database under the responsibility of the S anofi Pasteur CDM platform. Da ta monitoring at the sites and quality control in the form of c omputerized logic and/or consis tency checks will be systematically applied in order to detect e rrors or omissions. In addition, da ta reviews may be performed several times by the Sponsor's staff in t he course of the trial. Any qu estions pertaining to the reported clinical data will be submitted to the investigator for resolut ion using the EDC system. Each step of this process will be monitored through the implementation of individual passwords to maintain appropriate database access and t o ensure database integrity. The validation of the immunogenicity data will be performed at the laboratory level following the laboratory's procedures. Informa tion from the laboratory will b e checked for consistency before integration into the clinical database. After integration of all correcti ons in the complete set of dat a, and after the SAE information available from CDM and the GPV Department has been reconciled, the database will be released for statistical analysis. 11.2.2 Data Management of SAEs and Pregnancies During the trial, data pertain ing to SAEs reported on eSAE Form s and data pertaining to pregnancies reported in e-Pregnancy Form will be integrated int o the Sponsor's centralized GPV database. Upon receipt of an eSAE Form, the data will be entered into the GPV database after a duplicate check. Each SAE case will be ass igned a case identification num ber. Each case will be entered in the GPV database and assessed by the case management platform o r its delegate before being reported to the relevant authori ties as necessary. Assessment o f related cases will be done in collaboration with the PSO and t he RMO. Follow-up information c oncerning a completed case will be entered into the GPV database, and a new version of the case will be created. The information pertaining to SAEs in the GPV database will be reconciled with that in the clinical database. 11.2.3 Data Review A review of the data is anticip ated through the data review pro cess led by Data Management before each database lock. Sanofi Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 83 of 102 12 Statistical Methods and Det ermination of Sample Size 12.1 Statistical Methods All statistical analyses will be performed under the responsibi lity of the Sponsor's Biostatistics Platform using the SAS\u00ae software, at least Version 9.4 ( SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). A detailed Statistical Analysi s Plan (SAP) will be written befo re database lock. In accordance with the protocol, the SAP will describe all analyses to be per formed, statistical tables, and listings including descriptions of the analysis conventions use d. Non-inferiority testing will on ly be carried out with seroposit ive subjects and providing that the number of evaluable subjects atta ins a global power of at least 80%. This applies to the co- primary objectives and the seconda ry objective. Otherwise, desc riptive analyses w ill be performed 12.1.1 Hypotheses and Statistical Methods for Primary Objectives 12.1.1.1 Hypotheses Non-inferiority on Tdap vaccine The objective is to demonstrate that the humoral immune respons e to the Tdap booster dose administered concomitantly with the first dose of CYD dengue va ccine is non-inferior to the humoral immune response to the Tdap booster dose administered a lone 28 days before the first dose of CYD dengue vaccine. Individual hypotheses on Tda p response for each antigen: A non-inferiority testing approac h will be used to compare geom etric mean concentrations (GMCs) for PT, FHA, PRN, FIM 2+3, 28 days after the booster dose of Tdap, for each antigen \"i\" based on the following (=log 10 [1.5]), for each antigen \"i\". Non-inferiority for antigen \"i\" w ill be demonstrated if the low er bound of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) is greater than \u0003 \u0015\u0011\u0018\b\u0003RQH -sided). For each of the 4 antigens, the statistical methodology will be based on the use of the age-str atified two-sided 95% CI of the ratio of GMCs between groups. The age-s tratified CI will be calculate d using an ANOVA model (type II analysis) of log 10-transformed titers. The age groups (9 to 11 years, 12 to 17 ye ars, 18 to 45 years and 46 to 60 years) will be used as the stratifying fa ctor in the model. Sanofi Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 84 of 102 Additionally, a non-inferiority testing approach will be used t o compare seroprotection rates of T and D, 28 days after the booster dose of Tdap vaccine. Seroprot ection is defined as anti-D and anti-T Ab concentration superior to 0.1 IU/mL. The individual tested hypotheses for the antigen \"i\" will be as follows: with: i, antigen {T, D} \u000f\u0003QRQ -inferiority limit is set at 10% for both T and D. Non-inferiority for antigen \"i\" w ill be demonstrated if the low er bound of the 2-sided 95% CI is greater than - \u0011 Global hypotheses for non-in feriority on Tdap response: The global hypotheses are: H0G: Non inferiority of Tdap booster dose co-administered with the first dose of CYD dengue vaccine versus Tdap booster dose administered alone is n ot demonstrated for at least one antigen. H1G: Non-inferiority of Tdap booster dose co-administered with the first dose of CYD dengue vaccine versus Tdap booster dose administered alone is d emonstrated for all the antigens. Non-inferiority on CYD dengue vaccine after 1 dose The objective is to demonstrate that the humoral immune respons e to the first dose of CYD dengue vaccine administered concomitantly with Tdap booster dos e is non-inferior to the humoral immune response to the first dose of CYD dengue vaccine adminis tered sequentially 28 days after the Tdap booster dose. Individual hypotheses on CYD response after one dose for each s erotype: A non-inferiority testing approac h will be used to geom etric mean of titers (GMTs), for dengue serotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4, 28 days a fter the first inject ion of CYD dengue vaccine between Group 1 and Group 2 for each serotype \"i\" based on the Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 85 of 102 i, serotypes in {1, 2, 3, 4}. \u000f\u0003QRQ -inferiority limit is set at for each serotype \"i\". Non-inferiority for serotype \"i\" will be demonstrated if the lo wer bound of the 2-sided 95% CI is greater than - \u0011 Global hypotheses for non-inferi ority on CYD response after one dose: Overall, non-inferiority among t he groups will be demonstrated if, for each antigen of Tdap and each serotype of CYD dengue vaccine, the two-sided CI - 12.1.1.2 Statistical Methods Non-inferiority on Tdap vaccine The non-inferiority test will be performed using the 95% 2-side d CI of the difference between Group 1 and Group 2 for seroprotecti on rates and of the differe nces of the means of the log 10 transformed post-vaccinati RQ\u0003FRQFHQWUDWLRQV\u0012WLWHUV\u0003IRU\u0003*0&V\u0012*07V\u0003 \u0015\u0011\u0018\b\u0003RQH -sided). The 95% CIs will be calculated ba sed on the Wilson score method wit hout continuity correction as quoted by Newcombe (19) for seroprotection rates and us ing normal approximation log- transformed titers for GMCs/GMTs. Non-inferiority on CYD dengue vaccine after one dose The statistical methodology will be based on the use of the two -sided 95% CI of the differences of the means of the log 10 transformed post-vaccinatio n titers between Group 1 and Group 2. The CI for differences will be calculated using normal approximation o f log-transformed titers. 12.1.2 Hypotheses and Statistical Meth for Secondary Objectives 12.1.2.1 Hypotheses Non-inferiority on CYD dengue vaccine after three doses The objective is to demonstrate that the humoral immune respons e of 3 doses of CYD dengue vaccine with the first dose admi nistered concomitantly with the Tdap booster dose is non-inferior to the humoral immune respons e of 3 doses of CYD dengue vaccine administered sequentially with the Tdap booster dose admin istered 28 days before the firs t dose of CYD dengue vaccine. Individual hypotheses on CYD res ponse after three doses for eac h serotype: A non-inferiority testing approac h will be used to compare GMTs (dengue serotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4) 28 days after 3 injections of C YD dengue vaccine between Gro up 1 and Group 2 for each serotype \"i\" based on Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 86 of 102 with: i, serotypes in {1, 2, 3, 4}. \u000f\u0003QRQ -inferiority is set at for each serotype \"i\". Non-inferiority for serotype \"i\" will be demonstrated if the lo wer bound of the 2-sided 95% CI is greater than - \u0011 Global hypotheses for non-inferi ority on CYD response after thr ee doses: Overall, non-inferiority among t he groups will be demonstrated if, for each serotype of CYD dengue vaccine, the two-sided 95% CI lies above - \u0011 Non-inferiority on Tdap vaccine No statistical hypothesis will be tested on Tdap for secondary objectives. 12.1.2.2 Statistical Methods Non-inferiority on CYD dengue vaccine after 3 doses The statistical methodology will be based on the use of the two -sided 95% CI of the differences of the means of the log 10 transformed post-vaccin ation titers between G URXS\u0003\u0014\u0003DQG\u0003*URXS\u0003\u0015\u0003 \u0015\u0011\u0018\b\u0003 one-sided). The CI for differences will be calculated using nor mal approximation of log- transformed titers. Descriptive analysis on CYD dengue vaccine and Tdap vaccine immunogenicity No hypotheses will be tested. Immunogenicity point estimates an d their 95% CI will be presented for each and any group, before and a fter the first and third in jections for CYD dengue vaccine and before and after the booste r vaccination for Tdap. A complementary analysis on CYD dengue vaccine and Tdap vaccine immunogenicity after each dose will be conducted for each and any group according to the age groups (9 to 11 years, 12 to 17 years, 18 to 45 years and 46 to 60 years). A complementary analysis on CYD dengue vaccine immunogenicity a fter each dose will be conducted for each and any group according to the dengue status at baseline. The 95% CIs will be calculated using: x The normal approximate method for GMCs/GMTs and Geometric mean of concentration ratios [GMCRs]/Geometric mean of the titer ratios CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 87 of 102 Assuming that log 10 transformation of the titers/con centrations follows a normal d istribution, at first, the mean and the 95% CI will be calculated on log 10 (titers/concentrati ons) using the usual calculation for normal distributi on (using Student's t distribu tion with n-1 degree of freedom), then antilog transformations will be applied to the results of calculations, in or der to provide geometric means (GMs) and their 95% CI. x The exact binomial distribution f or percentages (Clopper-Pearso n's method, quoted by Newcombe (20)) In addition, the booster response against pertussis components (PT, FHA, PRN, and FIM2+3) will be calculated based on Ab concentr ation rises between pre- and post-vaccination defined as: x A post-YDFFLQDWLRQ\u0003$E\u0003FRQFHQWUDWLRQ\u0003\u0095 4 x the lower limit of quan tification (LLOQ) when pre- vaccination concentration is < LLOQ x A post-YDFFLQDWLRQ\u0003$E\u0003FRQFHQWUDWLRQ\u0003\u0095 4 x pre-vaccination Ab concentration when pre- vaccination concent UDWLRQ\u0003LV\u0003\u0095\u0003//24\u0003EXW\u0003 4 x LLOQ x A post-YDFFLQDWLRQ\u0003$E\u0003FRQFHQWUDWLRQ\u0003\u0095 2 x pre-vaccination Ab concentration when pre- YDFFLQDWLRQ\u0003FRQFHQWUDWLRQ\u0003LV\u0003\u0095\u0003\u0017\u0003[\u0003//24 Safety All analyses will be descriptiv e; no hypotheses will be tested. Safety will be assessed for all subjects after the booster dose of Tdap vaccine and after each and any dose of CYD Dengue vaccine. A complementary analysis will be conducted for each group accor ding to the age groups (9 to 11 years, 12 to 17 years, 18 to 45 y ears and 46 to 60 years). A co mplementary analysis after each and any dose of CYD dengue vaccine w ill be conducted for each and a ny group according to the dengue status at baseline. For the main parameters, 95% CIs of point estimates will be cal culated using the normal approximation for quantitative data and the exact binomial dist ribution (Cloppe r-Pearson method, quoted by Newcombe (20) ) for proportions. 12.2 Analysis Sets Three analysis sets will be used: the Per-Protocol Analysis Set (PPAS), the Full Analysis Set (FAS), and the Safety Ana lysis Set (SafAS). 12.2.1 Full Analysis Set The FAS is defined as the subs et of subjects who received at le ast one dose of each of the study vaccines (CYD and Tdap).

In the FAS, subjects will be anal yzed by the vaccine group to which they were randomized. All other immunogenicity analy ses will be performed on the FAS, and subjects will be analyzed by the vaccine group to whic h they were randomized. The SafAS will be performed on the safety analysis set. Subject s will be analyzed according to the vaccine they actually received. 12.3 Handling of Missing Data and Outliers 12.3.1 Safety No replacement will be done. Imputations may be done for a limi ted number of scenarios. These will be described in the SAP. 12.3.2 Immunogenicity For the computation of GMT/GMCs , any titer/concentration report ed as < LLOQ will be converted to a value of \u00bd LLOQ. While a single approach was use d for GMT/GMCs, two different ap proaches for GMTR/GMCR will be applied: x For Tdap Vaccine, < LLOQ will be converted to \u00bd LLOQ for a nume rator and < LLOQ will be converted to LLOQ for a denom inator when only one of either the numerator or denominator is < LLOQ. If both t he numerator and denominator ar e < LLOQ, then both will be converted in the same way. x For CYD dengue vaccine, < LLOQ w ill be converted to \u00bd LLOQ for a numerator and < LLOQ will be converted to LLOQ for a denominator Missing data will not be impute d. No test or search for outlier s will be performed. 12.3.3 Efficacy Not applicable. 12.4 Interim/Preliminary Analysis Two or three planned statistical analyses will be performed: Sanofi Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 91 of 102 x A first interim statistical analysis (interim analysis) will be performed on results obtained after a partial database lock of da ta collected up to the 28 days pos t first dose of CYD dengue vaccine (V03; M2). x A second interim analysis might be performed on results collect ed up to the 28 days after the third dose of CYD dengue vaccine (V06; M13). x The final analysis will be perf ormed on data collected at the e nd of the study. No statistical adjustment is n ecessary because there will be no repeated analyses of the primary objectives (as the primary tests w ill be performed at the time of the first statistical analysis). 12.5 Determination of Sample Si ze and Power Calculation A total of 688 subjects will be enrolled: 344 subjects per trea tment group (86 subjects per age group). Considering a potential attriti on rate of 10%, it was initially planned that such sample size would provide 618 evaluable subjects i n the PPAS of Tdap and CYD deng ue vaccine (PPT and PPC1). This sample size (based on SAS pr oc Power) targeted a global po wer over 90.0% for the non- inferiority testing correspondi ng to the co-primary objectives (i.e., after the booster dose of Tdap and after the first dose of C YD), and over 99.0% for the non-in feriority corresponding to the secondary objective (ie, testi ng after the third dose of CYD de ngue vaccine) However, as per this protocol a mendment 1, the number of evalua ble subjects will be reduced since only dengue seropositive subjects will be included in the Per-Protocol populations. Tus, the non-inferiority testing will be c arried out only if a global po wer of at least 80% for the co-primary objectives and secondary objective can be attained (i.e., if th e number of evaluab le subjects is at least 510 for the co-primary obj ectives and 324 for the seconda ry objective). The following assumptions were considered for the non-inferiori ty on Tdap: an alpha level of 2.5% (one-sided hypotheses), a maximum acceptable difference of 0.176 for GMCs, and of 10% for seroprotection rates, and t he following rates and standard deviations (SDs): x 7\u0003\u0095\u0003\u0013\u0011\u0014\u0003,8\u0012P/\u0003 - 99% of subjects x '\u0003\u0095\u0003\u0013\u0011\u0014\u0003,8\u0012P/\u0003 - 99% of subjects x PT SD - 0.4 x FHA SD- 0.4 x PRN SD - 0.5 x FIM2+3 SD - 0.6 (Based on TD519, TD506 and TD526 st udies and on Keith S. Reisin ger (21) ). The following assumptions were considered for the non-inferiori ty after the first dose of CYD dengue vaccine: an alpha level of 2.5% (one-sided hypotheses), a maximum acceptable difference of 0.301 for GMTs, and a standar d deviation of 1.0 for serotype 1, 0.8 for serotypes 2 and 3, 0.7 for serotype 4 (based on CYD 22 and CYD47 studies conducted in A sia Pacific). The following assumptions were considered for the non-inferiori ty after the third dose of CYD dengue vaccine: an alpha level of 2.5% (one-sided maximum acceptable difference Sanofi Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 92 of 102 of 0.301 for GMTs, and a standar d deviation of 0.8 for serotype s 1 and 2, 0.7 for serotypes 3 and 4 (based on studies conduc ted in Asia Pacific). The following tables indicate the individual powers for the non -inferiority testing considering a number of evaluable subjects of 309 per group for the co-primar y and secondary objectives, or 255 per group for the co-prim ary objective (Table 12.3) and 162 per group for the secondary objective (Table 12.1 and Table 12.2) .

Sanofi Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 93 of 102 13 Ethical and Legal Issues and Investigator/Sponsor Responsibilit ies 13.1 Ethical Conduct of the Tria l/Good Clinical Practice The conduct of this trial will be consistent with the standards established by the Declaration of Helsinki and compliant with the ICH guidelines for GCP as well as with all local and/or national regulations and directives. 13.2 Source Data and Source Documents \"Source data\" are the data contained in source documents. Sourc e documents are original documents or certified copies , and include, but are not limited to, DCs, medical and hospital records, screening logs, informe d consent/assent forms, telepho ne contact logs, and worksheets. The purpose of trial source documents is to document the existe nce of subjects and to substantiate the integrity of the trial data collected. Investigators must m aintain source documents so that they are accurate, complete, legible, and up to date. For missing or discrepant data o n a DC, the study coordinator w ill obtain verbal clarification from the subject, enter the response in to the \"investigator's commen t\" page of the DC, and transfer the information to the eCRF. The subject pre-scr eening log should list all individuals conta cted by the Investigators to participate in the trial, r egardless of the outcome. The Investigator must printa any electronic records on a n ongoing basis, sign and date them immediately after creation, and k eep the printouts on file as s ource documents that can be verified by the Sponsor or an inspector again st the electronic records. Any later changes of an electronic record require the record to be re-printed, dated (with an indi cation of the date of change), and signed. Such records must also be kept together with the origin al printed copy. 13.3 Confidentiality of Data and Access to Subject Records Prior to initiation of the trial , the Investigator will sign a fully executed confidentiality agreement with Sanofi Pasteur. Sanofi Pasteur personnel (or de signates), the IECs/IRBs, and re gulatory agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, requi re direct access to all stud y records, and will treat these documents in a confidential manner. In the event a subject's medical records are not at the investi gational site, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain t hose records if needed. a Unless the electronic medical records are managed by validate d computerized systems that are compliant with US 21 CFR Part 11, in which case th ey are acceptable on their own. Sanofi Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 94 of 102 13.4 Monitoring, Auditing, and Archiving 13.4.1 Monitoring Before the start of the trial ( i.e., before the inclusion of th e first subject), the Investigators and the Sponsor's staff or a representative will meet at the site-initi ation visit to discuss the trial protocol and the detailed trial procedur es. Emphasis will be placed on i nclusion and exclusi on criteria, visit timing, safety procedures, informe d consent procedures, SAE rep orting procedures, eCRF completion, and the handling of sam ples and products. The Spons or's staff or a representative will ensure and document that all mat erial to be used during the tri al has been received at the site; and that the study Investigator team and local Sponsor/delegate sta ff have been properly informed about the trial, GCP and regulat ory requirements, and the Spons or's procedures. Specific training sessions for the study Investigat or team and the CRAs on these topics may be performed as necessary, and should be documented. The following instruction manuals will be provided: the eCRF Co mpletion Guidelines for entering data into the eCRF, and the Opera ting Guidelines for detailed t rial procedures such as the product management and sample-handling procedures. After the start of the trial, t he Sponsor's staff or a represen tative will be in regular contact with the investigational team through telep hone calls and regular follow -up visits. The Investigator or delegate must be available for these visits, and must allow the Sponsor/delegate staff direct access to subject medical files and eCRF . During these visits, the Spo nsor/delegate staff will: x Evaluate the quality of the trial progress (adherence to protoc ol and any study-specific guidelines, quality of data col lection and document completion, signature of consent forms, occurrence of SAEs, sample and product management, cold-chain m onitoring, archiving) x Source-verify completed eCRF and any corresponding answered que ries. x Determine the number of complete or ongoing issues identified a t monitoring visits (e.g., protocol deviations, SAEs). Any identified problems will be dis cussed with the Investigator, and corrective or preventive actions will be determined, as app ropriate. x After all protocol procedures ha ve been completed and the data have been entered into the eCRF, the Investigator must sti ll be available to answer any qu eries forwarded by the Sponsor. All data-related queries must be completed prior to database lo ck. At the end of the trial, a close -out visit will be performed to ensure that: x The center has all the documents necessary for archiving x All samples have been shipped to the appropriate laboratories x All unused materials and products have been either destroyed or returned to the Sponsor Sanofi Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 95 of 102 13.4.2 Audits and Inspections A quality assurance audit may be performed at any time by the S ponsor's Clinical and Medical Quality Operations department ( C&MQO) or by independent auditor s to verify that the trial has been conducted according to the protocol, GCP and ICH requireme nts, and other applicable regulations. An inspection may be conducted by regulatory autho rities. The Investigator must allow direct access to trial documents during these inspections and audits. 13.4.3 Archiving The Investigator must keep all trial documents after the comple tion or discontinuation of the trial, whatever the nature of the inves tigational center (private prac tice, hospital, or ins titution), for as long as required by applicable law s and regulations. In the abs ence of any applicable laws or regulations, trial documents will be kept at a minimum for the duration indicated on the Clinical Trial Agreement (CTA). In no event, should study personnel dest roy or permit the destruction of any trial documents upon less tha n 90 days advance written noti fication to the Sponsor. In addition, trial documents should c ontinue to be stored, at Spon sor's sole expense, in the event that the Sponsor requests in writing that such storage continues for a period of time that exceeds that required by any applicable law or r egulation or the CTA. The In vestigator will inform Sanofi Pasteur of any address change or if they will no longer be able to house the trial documents. Archived data may be held on electro nic records, provided that a back-up exists and that a hard copy can be obtained if require d. The protocol, documentation, approvals, and all other documents related to the trial, i ncluding certificates attestin g that satisfactory a udit and inspection procedures have been carried out, will be kept by the Sponsor i n the Trial Master File (TMF). Data on AEs are included in the TMF. All data and documents wil l be made available if requested by relevant authorities. 13.5 Financial Contract and Insurance Coverage A CTA will be signed by all the parties involved in the trial's performance, if relevant. The Sponsor has an insurance policy to cover any liabilities that m ay arise from use of the product and/or the study protocol. Specifically for the subjects ide ntified as unexposed/seronegat ive at baseline, Sanofi Pasteur will also cover reasonable expenses r elated to healthcare for dengue illness for 10 years after the last dengue vaccine injection receive d. Details will be communicated to IEC/IRB and to study participants. 13.6 Stipends for Participation Expenses that are directly relat ed to the subject's participati on in the trial (for example cost of transportation for atte nding visits) will be compensated. Subje cts/parents/legally acceptable representatives will not receiv e any remuneration for participa tion in the Pasteur Confidential/Proprietary Information CYD66 323 - CYD Dengue Vaccine Protocol Version 2.0 Page 96 of 102 13.7 Publication Policy Data derived from this trial are the exclusive property of Sano fi Pasteur.
