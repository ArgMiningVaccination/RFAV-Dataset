National Code Set issuance alone may not be construed as coverage or a covered service by the Authority; \u00b6 (e) The Authority adopts by reference the National Code Set revisions, deletions, and additions issued and published by the American Medical Association (Current Procedural Terminology - CPT) and on the CMS website (Healthcare Common Procedural Coding System - HCPCS). This code adoption may not be construed as coverage or as a covered service by the Authority. \u00b6 (7) Claims: \u00b6 (a) Upon submission of a claim to the Authority for payment, the provider agrees that it has complied with all Division program rules. Submission of a claim, however, does not relieve the provider from the requirement of a signed provider agreement; \u00b6 (b) A provider enrolled with the Division shall bill using the Authority assigned provider number, or the National Provider Identification (NPI) number if the NPI is available, pursuant to OAR 410-120-1260; \u00b6 (c) The provider may not bill the Division more than the provider's usual charge (see Definitions) or the Page 23 of 56reimbursement specified in the applicable Division program rules; \u00b6 (d) Claims shall be submitted on the appropriate form as described in the individual Division program rules or electronically in a manner authorized in OAR Chapter 943, Division 120; \u00b6 (e) Medicare will send crossover claims to the Authority or contracted health plan after adjudication by Medicare.

Providers may not \"unbundle\" services in order to increase the payment. \u00b6 (10) Third-Party Liability (TPL): \u00b6 (a) Federal law requires that state Medicaid agencies take all reasonable measures to ensure that in most Page 24 of 56instances the Division shall be the payer of last resort; \u00b6 (b) Providers shall make reasonable efforts to obtain payment first from other resources. For the purposes of this rule, \"reasonable efforts\" include determining the existence of insurance or other resources on each date of service by: \u00b6 (A) Using an insurance database such as Electronic Verification System (EVS) available to the provider; \u00b6 (B) Using the Automated Voice Response (AVR) or secure provider web portal on each date of service and at the time of billing;\u00b6 (C) Asking the Medicaid recipient at the point of service or prior to billing if they have other health insurance; \u00b6 (D) If the provider identifies from the client or other source third-party insurance that is unknown to the state or that is different from what is reported in one of the Division verification systems, the provider shall report the coverage to the Health Insurance Group (HIG) using the secure online form at www.reporttpl.org.\u00b6 (c) Except as noted in section (10)(d)(A)-(E) of this rule, when third-party coverage is known to the provider prior to billing the Division, the provider shall: \u00b6 (A) Bill all third-party insurance the client is covered by, which could include Personal Insurance Protection (PIP) or Workers Compensation if the claim is related to a personal injury; and \u00b6 (B) Except for pharmacy claims billed through the Division's point-of-sale system, the provider shall wait 30 days from submission date of a clean claim and have not received payment from the third party; and \u00b6 (C) Comply with the insurer's billing and authorization requirements; and \u00b6 (D) Appeal a denied claim when the service is payable in whole or in part by an insurer. \u00b6 (d) In accordance with federal regulations, the provider shall bill the TPL prior to billing the Division, except under the following circumstances: \u00b6 (A) The covered health service is provided by an Intermediate Care Facility for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (ICF/ID); \u00b6 (B) The covered health service is provided by institutional services for the mentally and emotionally disturbed; \u00b6 (C) The covered health services are prenatal and preventive pediatric services; \u00b6 (D) Services are covered by a third-party insurer through an absent parent where the medical coverage is administratively or court ordered; \u00b6 (E) When a negligent third party caused an injury or illness to a client, a provider may choose to bill the Liability Insurance (see Definitions), bill the liable third party, place a lien on a tort settlement or judgement, or bill the Division.

Otherwise, the Division shall process the claim and, if applicable, pay the Division's allowable rate for these services and seek reimbursement from the liable third-party insurance plan; \u00b6 (G) In making the decision to bill the Division, the provider shall be cognizant of the possibility that the third-party payer may reimburse the service at a higher rate than the Division and that once the Division makes payment, no additional billing to the third party is permitted by the provider. \u00b6 (e) The provider may bill the Division directly for services that are never covered by Medicare or another insurer on the appropriate form identified in the relevant provider rules. Documentation shall be on file in the provider's records indicating this is a non-covered service for purposes of Third-Party Resources. See the individual provider rules for further information on services that shall be billed to Medicare first; \u00b6 (f) In the case of known third-party coverage, a provider may bill the Division if payment from the third-party coverage is not received within 30 days.
