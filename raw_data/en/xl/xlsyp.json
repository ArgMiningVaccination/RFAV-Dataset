Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), compared to the conventional Western medicine, is a distinct culture-related medical system. The foundation of TCM theory is the concept of yin and yang--anything in the universe (including the human body) is defined as two opposing aspects. When yin and yang are in balance, the body is optimally healthy. If yin and yang are out of balance, the body will be in dis-order. Acupuncture is one of the major components of TCM. Other therapies and techniques of TCM include Chinese Herbology, Zhenggu (bone setting and joint manipulation), Tuina (Chinese massage and acupressure), Qigong (breath exercises) and Taichi, etc. Click for [BROCHURE](https://www.acupuncturechiropractichouston.com/_files/ugd/70f5e6_4479312385a74fe088b7c59f1cf90c4a.pdf) CHIROPRACTIC Chiropractic is a healthcare profession or discipline that diagnoses, treats and prevents the mechanical disorders of the neuromusculoskeletal system, especially the spine.
