Often referred to as the \"blood\" or \"life force\" of a plant, each essential oil is comprised of a unique profile of beneficial properties and constituents, which much like the human immune system, serve to defend the plant from disease and environmental stresses, and dictates how the oil may best be used therapeutically. Though therapeutic profiles vary from oil to oil, most essential oils are inherently anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-septic and anti-parasitic, all properties which can be particularly beneficial in addressing various skin conditions and as first aid preparations. Exhibiting high anti-oxidant properties, many oils can also assist in neutralizing the free radicals that assault our bodies at the cellular level. Still others contain estrogen-like constituents, making them particularly beneficial in balancing and regulating hormonal fluctuations. Like all living organisms, plants also emit bio-electrical energy and because essential oils retain a high bio-electrical field, they can prove useful in regulating, enhancing and balancing the body's vibrational frequency, as well as, opening and aligning the chakras. A partial listing of some of the other therapeutic properties exhibited by essential oils are: Analgesic, Anti-biotic, Anti-depressant, Anti-inflammatory, Anti-spasmodic, Stimulating and Uplifting. In short, the benefits to be gleaned from essential oils, when used on their own, are astounding, and their therapeutic potential when one considers the infinite number of blends that could be created, is limitless. And, as an increasing number of people shift to a more natural approach to wellness and we further explore and develop our knowledge and understanding of the mind/body connection, the potential of essential oils for the promotion of physical, emotional and spiritual well-being will undoubtedly continue to evolve and expand.
