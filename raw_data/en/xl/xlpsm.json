The COT evaluation publis hed in 1999 can be found in C hapter 7 of the report paragraphs 7.12-7.7.29. Studies in Individuals with a History of Acute Poisoning 2. The COT concluded; 'Despite their methodological limitations the findings in studies of poisoned subjects are unlikely to be wholly attributable to confounding effects or to chance. The patterns of abnormality reported are not entirely consistent, but this may in part reflect diffe rences in the severity of the poisoning which subjects had suffered. On balance, the Working Group interpreted the studies as providing reasonable, al though not conclusive, evid ence that OP poisoning of sufficient severity to require hospital ad mission can lead to persistent cognitive impairment. This effect is most evi dent in neuropsychologi cal tests involving sustained attention and speeded, flexible cogniti ve processing, for example, the digit symbol substitution test. T he studies reviewed provide no evidence that long-term memory is affected by acute OP poisoning a part from impaired visual memory in one investigation. Thus, if low-level ex posure to OPs causes neuropsychological abnormalities these are most likely to be sh own on tests of cognitive function other than memory.' 3. The overall conclusion reached (paragraph 1.13) was ' The balance of evidence supports the view that neuropsychol ogical abnormalities can occur as a long-term complication of acut e OP poisoning, particularly if the poisoning is severe. Such abnormalities have been most evident in neuropsychological tests involving sustained attention and speeded flexible cognit ive processing (\"mental agility\"). In contrast, current evidence suggests that long-term memory is not affected after acute poisoning' . Studies in Individuals wi th No Past History of Acute OP Poisoning 4. The COT concluded 'When account is taken of t hese limitations* and of the inconsistencies between studies, the research reviewed provides little support for the hypothesis that prolonged low-le vel exposure to OPs gives rise to long-term changes in the cognitive functions that would be expected to show impairment in the postulated syndrome of COPIND. The most consistent findings are with respect to simple reaction time and a test (digit-s ymbol substitution) that depends on multiple THIS IS A DRAFT PAPER FOR DISCUSSION.

No study, including those with positive results on other measures, has indicated effects of OP exposure on long-term memory function. It is noteworthy that the finding of positive effects on the digi t-symbol substitution task, but without a decrement in long-term memory, is simila r to that in people who have previously been acutely poisoned by OPs. Possible differences between exposed and c ontrols other than OP exposure, not adequately taken into account in the statistical analyses [*Small study size so that effects that are large enough to be medically important may not have been distinguishable from random variation Possible biases due to an association betwe en a subjects' willingness to participate in the research and their state of health. The inclusion of some subjects with an unr ecognised past history of acute poisoning Restriction to workers currently or recent ly exposed to OPs. This means individuals too ill to remain in employment will have been excluded.] 5. The overall conclusion reached (paragraph 1.18) was ' Although some studies suggest impairment in the same tests that are affected after acute poisoning, others do not. The balance of evidence does not support the existence of clinically significant effects on performance in neur opsychological tests from low-level exposures to OPs. If such effects do occu r, they must either be relatively uncommon or so small that they are not consistent ly detectable by standar d methods of testing '. OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE PUBLISHED AFTER COT 1999 REPORT 6. Short summaries of the key studies are given below. Detailed information can be found in Annex 4 Table 6 (methods) and Table 7 (results). Assessment of neuropsychology test data has been groupe d into functional domains, although individual tests cited may provide data on several or many of the domains. A summary of neuropsychological tests outcomes grouped into functional domains is appended as Table 8. Inclusion of tests in a particular domain is based on the domains suggested by the majority of in vestigators, although there were a few differences between the studies reviewed. An overview of the neuropsychological tests considered in the draft COT discussi on paper is provided (table 9) to aid members understanding and consideration of the tests. The influence of confounding factors, which included age and education, has been considered in the tables. THIS IS A DRAFT PAPER FOR DISCUSSION. IT SHOULD NOT BE QUOT ED, CITED OR REPRODUCED 3 ACUTE EXPOSURE WITH CHRONIC NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL ABNORMALITIES Cohort Study 7. The literature review id entified one prospective cohor t study of subjects from Nicaragua who were poisoned (hospitalised) with OPs, and who were followed for a period of up to 2 years (data for 53 poisoned subjects at all time points up to and including 2 years, compared to data from 28 controls from fish/cattle cooperatives) (Delgado et al 2004) (Annex 4, Table 6. A.1). A limited range of neuropsychological tests were administered. A persistent reduction in Digit symbol (a test of psychomotor performance) was reported over the 2 year follow up period which was significant after adjustment for age, educat ion and alcohol consumption (decrement 2y compared to discharge was -7.69 (-17.6- 2.24) (Annex 4, Ta ble 7.A.1). This finding is consistent with the conclusion s reached by the COT Working Group in 1999. This was a good study of poisoned s ubjects with 85% of the cohort tested at the 2-year follow-up. T he authors considered a range of potential confounding factors. Cross-Sectional Studies 8. Cross-sectional investigations of five different exposure scenarios were retrieved. These were Banana workers wit h acute cholinergic poisoning, subjects with acute organophosphorous pois oning from India, subj ects with acute OP (and carbamate) poisoning from Spain, follow-up studies of Gulf War Veterans exposed acutely to OPs arising from the Khamisiyah incident and individuals exposed to sarin following the Tokyo subway incident. Thes e very different exposure situations are considered separately. Banana workers 9. Wesseling et al 2002, undertook neuropsyc hological testing of 81 Costa Rican banana workers identified from re ports to the National Insu rance Institute regarding cholinergic poisoning. Pesticides respons ible for poisoning were reported for 78 subjects and included OPs for 54 cases and carbmates for 24 cases. It was reported that all poisoned subjects needed m edical attention but poisoning was not sufficiently severe to require hospitalis ation. A control group of 130 non-poisoned banana workers identified from pay rolls was used (Annex 4, Table 6.A.3). A comprehensive set of neuropsychological tests was undertaken at least one year after the poisoning incident. Poisoned subjec ts performed less well than controls in 13 out of the 14 tests administered, but differ ences were small. The only statistically significant finding was a decrease in WA IS Digit symbol performance (regression coefficient -2.7 (P<0.05)), but other tests of psyc homotor performance were unaffected. The difference between poiso ned/non-poisoned was evident in both subjects with and without rec ent handling of pesticides (3 months) but were more evident in workers with recent contact wit h cholinesterase inhibitors. A range of factors was included in t he analysis including age, educat ion cumulative life-time exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors, alcohol use, solvent exposure, loss of consciousness, examiner, time of test ing and plasma AChE. There were no THIS IS A DRAFT PAPER FOR DISCUSSION. IT SHOULD NOT BE QUOT ED, CITED OR REPRODUCED 4 statistically significant effects of attent ion, visuo-spatial function, memory or vocabulary. The authors repor ted that deficits (across a ll neuropsychological tests) were more clearly seen in data for OP exposed subjects than carbamate exposed subjects (Data presented graphically) (Wesselin g et al 2002) (Annex 4, Table 7.A.3). Subjects with acute organophosphate poisoning- India 10. Mittal T et al 2011, un dertook neuropsychological te sting of 28 patients with acute OP poisoning. Testing was undertaken just prior to discharge and at 3 months after discharge. A control group of hospi tal employees or attendants of patients matched for age and gender was used (Annex 4, Table 6.A.3). At discharge and at 3 months after discharge significantly impai red performance in verbal fluency, visual recognition, and verbal retention (subtests of the PGI memory scale, which is a modification of the Weschler memory scale) were reported in OP poisoned subjects. In addition poorer performance of the Bender-V isual-Motor-Gestalt te st (a test of visual-motor coordination) was reported in OP poisoned subjects. The authors did not report information on any confounding variables included in the analyses. However, patients with any abnormal neurocognitive dysfunction to any cause prior to OP poisoning were excluded by Mittal et al 2011.(Annex 4, Table 7.A.3) Subjects with acute organophospha te/carbamate poisoning-Spain 11. Roldan-Tapia et al 2006, undert ook comprehensive neuropsychological testing of 24 green house workers (gender not stated) who had been poisoned with OPs and carbamates at 3 months and 1 year after hospital discharge. The investigators compared the data for these su bjects to unexposed controls (26 males) and 40 male subjects with prolonged exposur e to OP/carbamate pesticides (20 high exposed (>10years), 20 low exposed (<10 years)). The authors undertook analyses by grouping tests into domains (Annex 4, T able 6.A.3). Results showed significant differences in some tests for assessment 3 months after poisoning related to memory (Rey Auditory learning test, Bent on Visual Retention Test and recall of Rey Osterrieth Figure Complex) but overall th is domain was not significantly affected (F(24,207=1.11, p0.326). Significant changes in per ceptive and visuomotor domains were reported. Perceptive dom ain (F(9,222)=2.74, p=0.005); Benton Visual Recognition Form Test, Pictur e completion Visuomotor domain (F (9,222)=2.31, p=0.003) Block design and qua lity and time of copy of Rey Osterrieth Complex Figure. For acut ely poisoned subjects, 1 year after discharge there was reduced performance in a test of perc eption (Picture completion) , reduced performance in tests of memory (Rey-Audit ory Verbal learning, Logical memory and Rey-Osterrieth Figure Test, and visuomotor components of tests (Rey-Osterrieth Figure Test and Benton Visual Form Test). At the 1 year evaluati on, the previously increased anxiety score (at 3 months) was no longer evident. The authors controlled for possible confounding by age, education and BuChE level. This study was limited in that the selection process for exposed and control subjects was not reported in detail, an assessment of exposure (in poisoned subjects) was not undertaken, and the loss of subjects to 1 y ear follow-up was not reported. (Roldan-Tapia et al 2006) (Annex 4, Table 7.A.3). THIS IS A DRAFT PAPER FOR DISCUSSION. IT SHOULD NOT BE QUOT ED, CITED OR REPRODUCED 5 Gulf War veterans 12. Gulf War veterans were exposed to sa rin/cyclosarin for a two week period in early March 1991 following a munitions expl osion at Khamisiyah. Follow up studies of 3.5-5 years and 10 years after the incident were published (Proctor et al 2006, Chao et al 2010). A separate follow-up study was published by Spencer et al 2001, but there are too few details in the availa ble report to draw any conclusions (Spencer et al 2001). Proctor et al 2006, undertook neuropsychological assessment of 70 Gulf War veterans (3.5-5 years post incident ) with reported moderat e/high exposure to OPs (as defined by the author s) compared to a group of 70 veterans with low or no exposure to OPs (Annex 4, Table 6.A.3). It is notable that Gulf war veterans did not report acute cholinergic symptoms after t he incident. The authors reported a dose- dependent reduction in performance of Purdue pegboard (timed, fine manual dexterity) (decrement in hi gh exposed ; dominant -0.93 (- 16 -0.28) construction with a motor component) (decrem ent in high exposed -4.0 (-5.8 to -2.2) P<0.0001). However, an im provement in Finger T apping was reported. Performance of Purdue pegboard was signific antly reduced after adjusting for Finger Tapping performance. Covariates incl uded age, gender, officer status during Gulf War, WAIS-R test (intel ligence), head injury and PTSD symptomatology. There were no effects on tests of attention, ex ecutive function. Memo ry tests were not administered in the 3.5-5 year follow up inve stigation (Proctor et al 2006) (Annex 4, Table 7.A.3). 13. Chao et al 2010, published a 10 year follow-up and undertook neuropsychology tests in 40 Khamisiyah expos ed veterans compared to 40 veterans with no exposure to OPs (Annex 4, Tabl e 6.A.3). (There were no differences between the groups with regard to gender, age, education, handedness, PTSD, major depression or chronic multisymptom illness.) The study did not identify any effects on groove pegboard or di git symbol tests of psychomot or performance, or the Block Design test or tests of memory (Cha o et al 2010) (Annex 4, Table 7.A.3). 14. These studies are difficult to interp ret in terms of potential effects of OP exposure as it is known that Gulf war veterans who report symptoms associated with the conflict perform more poorly on neur obehavioural measures (of memory, attention and response speed) when compared to veterans who did not report symptoms (Storzbach D et al, 2000). Self-r eported exposure to chemical warfare agents among Gulf war-deployed veterans is associated with poorer performance of cognitive tests of memory and attention (Whi te RF et al 2001). Psychological stress, including perception of a chemical warf are agent has been reported to be associated with chronic multi-symptom illness in Gulf War veterans (Riddle JR et al 2003). Tokyo subway sarin incident 15. Fire crew and police officers who attended the Tokyo sarin incident were acutely exposed to sarin. Obu and collea gues reported that over 5,500 were injured in the attack. Of these, 641 were seen at St Lukes Internationa l Hospital on the day of the attack, five were in a critical condition, 106 were hospitalised with moderate severity, and 531 were categorised as mild and treated as outpatient s (Ohbu S et al THIS IS A DRAFT PAPER FOR DISCUSSION. IT SHOULD NOT BE QUOT ED, CITED OR REPRODUCED 6 1997). Follow up neuropsychological testing was undertaken at three periods after the attack. These were 2 years 9 months-3 years 10 months, 5years, and at 7 years. 16. Nishiwaki et al 2001, evaluated neuropsychological test performance in 27 male Fire Department rescue staff and 30 polic e officers at 2 years 9 month-3 years 10 months after the Tokyo subway inciden t. Referents were fire staff and police officers with no exposure to sarin (Annex 4, Table 6.A.3). Some evidence for decreased psychomotor function was r eported in finger tapping (dominant) performance (132.7 (SD 1.2) in high expose d compared to 120.7 (SD1.2) in controls, P<0.05 in multiple regression model). The authors also reported an OR of 3.19 (95% CI 1.06-10.38) for decreased performance of digit span (Backward) in the high exposed which was interpreted as an effect on memory. There were no differences between these two groups in performance of digit span (forward), simple and choice reaction times, finger tapping non-dominant and the Benton visual retention test. Adjustment for age, height, weight, alcohol , smoking, education and measures for current PTSD and mental health was included in the analysis. (Nishiwaki et al 2001) (Annex 4, Table 7.A.3). 17 A more limited neuropsychological investigation (visual memory) was undertaken at 5 years after the incident in a small (self-selected) group of Tokyo subway incident victims who had been tr eated at one emergency department (11 subjects with PTSD and 23 refe rents) (Ohtani et al 2004) (Annex 4, Table 6 A.3). Decreased visual memory (97.6 \u00b113.1, compared to 108 \u00b110.4, P<0.05) was reported in exposed subjects who al so had symptoms of PTSD. Potential confounding factors were not reported (Annex 4, Table 7.A.3). Only limited weight of evidence can be attached to this result. 18 Miyaki et al 2005, undertook a mo re comprehensive neuropsychological investigation of Tokyo subway workers 7 years after the in cident (Miyaki et al 2005). Data were also presented for a combined group with data for 3 year and 7 year follow-up. There were 23 exposed subway workers included in the 7 year follow up (13 subway workers in referent group) . The combined 3 year and 7 year group (which comprised subway workers, re scue workers and police officers) had 80 subjects (combined referent group contained 65 subjects) (Annex 4, Table 6.A.3). At 7 years there was a reduction in perfo rmance of Finger tapping (dominant and non-dominant) but no effects were reported in tests for att ention (Digit span forward and backward), psychomotor function (simpl e and choice reaction times) and visual memory (Benton). Combined data for 3 y ear and 7 year follow-up reported reduced performance in finger tapping (dominant (O R for high exposure 3.44 (95% CI 1.18- 10.1)), and non-dominant (OR for high exposure 2.77 (95% CI 1.0-7.70)), and a nearly significant effect on digit span (backw ard) (P=0.055), but no effect on visual memory. The authors reported that sympt oms of PTSD were higher in sarin exposed individuals. Pot ential confounding factors cons idered included age, BMI, education, smoking, alcohol and measures of PTSD a nd current mental health (Annex 4, Table 7.A.3). THIS IS A DRAFT PAPER FOR DISCUSSION. IT SHOULD NOT BE QUOT ED, CITED OR REPRODUCED 7 Case-Series Investigation 19. Dahlgren et al 2004, published a case-s eries investigation of a family who were acutely exposed to diazinon when t heir house was inadvertently excessively sprayed (Annex 4, Table 6.A.4) . The follow-up investigat ions reported effects on memory psychomotor functions in a number of these pati ents 3 years after exposure (Dahlgren et al 2004) (Annex 4, Table 7.A.4). Case-Report 20. Loh et al 2010, reported effects on information processing and reduced attention to task in a senior explosive dis posal officer acutely ex posed to sarin (Loh 2010) (Annex 4, Table 6. A.5 and Table 7.A.5). Conclusion on Acute Exposure wi th Chronic Neuropsychological Abnormalities 21. The most consistent information fo r the assessment of acute OP exposure (leading to overt cholinergic poisoning) resulting in chronic neuropsychological effects comes from the cohort study by Delgado et al 2004 and the cross-sectional study of banana workers (Wesseling 2002), The results of both of these studies support the conclusion reached by the CO T working group in 1999 that acute intoxication can lead to persistent deficits in psychomotor performance (particularly with respect to reduced performance in digi t symbol test). Th e study of acute OP/carbamate poisoning in Spain reported evidence for persistent effects 1 year after poisoning on a range of tests measur ing perception (Picture completion), memory (Logical memory and Rey-Osterrie th Figure test) and also on visuomotor skills (quality of copy of Rey-Osterrieth Figure and time of copy of Benton Visual Form test) (Roldan-Tapia 2006). These parti cular tests have not been used in other studies and additionally the functions a ssessed have not been investigated in detail in other studies. It is difficult to draw any definite conclusions based on this study. The study of Mittal et al 2011 was undertak en at only a comparatively short 3-month period after OP poisoning. It is difficult to draw any conclusions as to whether OP exposure induced neuropsychol ogical deficit in Gulf War veterans exposed to sarin/cyclosarin at the Khamisiyah inci dent, particularly as neuropsychological deficits have been found in Gulf war veterans irrespective of exposure to sarin/cyclosarin. There is some limited evid ence for a deficit in psychomotor function and in the digit span (backward) test (whi ch was interpreted as an effect on short term memory) in indivi duals exposed to sarin from t he Tokyo incident, but results between studies which covered different periods of follow-up are inconsistent (Nishiwaki et al2001, Ohtani et al 2004, Miyaki et al 2005). CHRONIC LOW-LEVEL EXPOSURE Cohort Studies 22. Three cohort studies reporting neuropsychological testing of OP exposed subjects was retrieved. THIS IS A DRAFT PAPER FOR DISCUSSION. IT SHOULD NOT BE QUOT ED, CITED OR REPRODUCED 8 Study of Dow employees manu facturing chlorpyrifos-USA 23. Albers and colleagues administered t he Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and a qualitative questionnaire (o f reading, memory, concentration and problem solving) to Dow employees engaged in the manufacture of Chlorpyrifos (Albers et al 2004b). A total of 53 OP ex posed individuals were examined at the initial and at the one year follow-up. A control group of 60 employees engaged in the manufacture of Saran plasti c film wrap was used (58 at the second examination) (Annex 4, Table 6.B.1). Exposure to cho linesterase inhibitors was confirmed by biological monitoring (urinary excretion of Chlorpyrifos metabolites and decreased plasma butylcholinesterase activity). There were no differences between exposed and controls (engaged in manufacture of Sar an plastic film) with regard to qualitative assessment of neuropsychological func tion (reading memory, concentration and problem solving) or from the Mini m ental State Examinat ion (MMSE). Exposed and referents were matched for age, heigh t, weight, BMI, reading scale, smoking and anxiety (Annex 4, Table 7.B.1). 24. This study provides evidence to support the view that chroni c OP exposure is not associated with neuropsychological effect s. There was 80% participation of eligible subjects but the extent of neur opsychological testing was limited and the duration of follow up was only 1 year. Study of pesticide applicat ors Iowa and North Carolina 25. Starks et al 2012a, undertook neur opsychological tests of 701 male participants selected from the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) (Starks et al 2012a). The AHS is a large prospective cohort study of private pesticide applicators, their spouses and commercial pesticide applicat ors. Enrolment was between 1993-1997 at the time of pesticide lic ensing and recertification. The authors administered tests from the Neurobehavioural Ev aluation System version 3 (which included Continuous Performance, Digit Symbol, Fingertapping ( dominant), Auditory Ve rbal learning Test (AVLT-three subtests), Sequences A and B) and the Groove pegboard (dominant) test. Neuropsychology tests were adminis tered by trained technicians unaware of participants exposure status. The mean age of participants was 61 years (SD 12 years). Data on ever-use (assumed to be one season) and life-time days of use of 16 OP pesticides were obtained from AH S interviews undertaken between 1993- 2007 and at the Neurobehavioural (NB) test appointment (Annex 4, Table 6.B.1). 26. There was no association between total OP dose and any NB test. There were some associations between exposures to specific OP pesticides and poorer performance in NB tests (e.g. ever use of ethoprop and life-time days malathion use and reduced performance in the Digit Symbol te st. In contrast t here several findings of improved performance in NB tests (e .g. exposure to chlorpyrifos, coumaphos, parathion, phorate and tetrachlorvinphos and improved performance AVLT The authors note these results could have oc curred by chance. Overall, it was concluded that there was no consistent evidence for an association between OP pesticide exposure and adverse performance of neuropsychological tests. It was noted that this was an older sample of pesticide workers than previous studies and possible selection bias could have occurr ed. However, major advantages of this study was the large sample tested and the re liability and accuracy of the estimation THIS IS A DRAFT PAPER FOR DISCUSSION. IT SHOULD NOT BE QUOT ED, CITED OR REPRODUCED 9 of pesticide use. There was possible sele ction bias in that only 40% of potential participants provided information on potent ial exposure and neuropsychological testing was undertaken in 701/1807 of thes e subjects. The aut hors reported that they had oversampled at the high end of lif etime OP use (Starks et al 2012a) (Annex 4, Table 7.B.1). Study of Israeli subjects exposed to OPs 27. One publication reporting a retrospective study of Israeli subjects exposed to OPs was retrieved (Annex 4, Table 6.B.1) . Although effects on Trails B and Digit symbol were reported, there are insufficient details were available to make any assessment. (Finkelstein et al 2010 ) (Annex 4, Table 7.B.1). (A literature search for Finkelstein revealed publications on post -mortem AChE levels in OP poisoned subjects and a publication on antidotal therapy for acute OP poisoning but no further studies on neuropsychology assessment.) Case-Control Study 28. One study was identified. (Jamal et al 2002) (Annex 4, Table 6.B.2). However too few details of results were availabl e to make any assessment of this study (Annex 4, Table 7.B.2). Cross-Sectional Studies 29. Fourteen cross-sectional studies we re retrieved. These have been grouped according to the country where the study was undertaken. Studies undertaken in England Study of Orchard Sprayers 30. Stephens et al 2004, undertook neuropsychol ogical testing of 37 male orchard sprayers who used chlorpyrifos from diffe rent regions of England and compared the test results to data from neuropsychological testing of pig farmers (26 males) and construction workers (41 males) (Stephens et al 2004). The response rates in the exposed group was 68%, but details of the selection procedure for the initial cohort of 60 orchard sprayers was not reported (e.g. how many farms were approached and how many agreed to participate). For pig fa rmers, the site response rate was 9%. For construction workers 100 potential s ubjects were approached and 41 agreed to participate. A period of at least 2 m onths between last application of OP and neuropsychological testing was applied to ensure the absence of acute effects (Annex 4, Table 6.B.3). Biol ogical monitoring at this time suggested that levels of OP metabolites in urine samples were sim ilar in all three groups. Orchard sprayers had significantly reduced performance in t he Automated Cognitive Test System (ACTS) Syntactic reasoning response to negative statements compared to construction workers (P=0.012 corrected). T he investigators considered this result indicated a slowing of processing speed. Performance of orchard sprayers and pig farmers was similar for many of the other neuropsychological tests used. The study THIS IS A DRAFT PAPER FOR DISCUSSION. IT SHOULD NOT BE QUOT ED, CITED OR REPRODUCED 10 investigators reported no reduc ed performance in orchard sp rayers for other tests of attention/psycho- motor functions (e.g. simp le reaction time, digit span (backward), processing speed (digit symbol), and tests of memory (e.g. digit span forward, location recognition, category search, subjec tive memory questionnaire). There was no relationship between cumulative OP exposure and neurobehavioural test performance. Weekly alcohol consumption was substantially higher in construction workers. There were no statistically sign ificant differences between the groups with respect to age and education, although a higher percentage of orchard sprayers (16%) and pig farm workers (12%) were educated to degree level compared to construction workers where none were edu cated to degree level (Annex 4, Table 7.B.3). Study of Sheep Dippers 31. Mackenzie-Ross et al 2010, undert ook neuropsychological testing of 127 sheep farmers with at least 5 years exposure to OPs (67 working, 60 retired due to ill health), compared to 78 rural policemen (38 working, 40 retired on ill health grounds) (Mackenzie-Ross et al 2010). Recruitment of sheep farmers involved writing to farm owners listed on the relevant databases (U K national Business Directory, National Farmers Union membership lists) and telephoning every 5th person on list held by Wool Marketing Board). 393 sheep farmers were contacted; 59% response. Additional farmers recruited through advertising or reply to articles in media. Initially a total of 434 farmers came forward; exclusion of 67% using inclusion/exclusion criteria. Inclusion included age 18-70 y, living in South West or North England, retired subjects on basis of ill-health and ex posure to OPs for minimum of 5 years prior to 1991. Exclusion criteria included on history of psychiatric, neurological or serious medical problems, substance abus e (including alcohol) or acute OP intoxication. Recruitment of controls was under taken by enlisting the help of local constabularies and the National Association of Retired Police Officers who contacted members by email or newslette r. The study was also adve rtised in the police press. Initially 252 police officers came forwar d; exclusion of 63% (inclusion/exclusion parameters included having worked in rural setting in South West or North England retired on ill health grounds and with no know n exposure to OPs). A semi-structured interview was used to assess exposure whic h was highly variable ranging from 8-49 years for the working group and 5-66 years for the retired group. The number of years since last dipping varied from 0-37 years for the working group and 0-42 years for the retired group. The num ber of days spent dipping/year also varied from 0.5-30 days/year for the working group and 1-21 days/year for the re tired group. A comprehensive set of neuropsychological tests was undertaken (Annex 4, Table 6.B.3). 32. Farmers (both working and retired) we re significantly impaired (P<0.05) on measures of memory (working- Digit s pan forwards/backwards, letter number, arithmetic), response speed (Digit symbol, Trails A), fine motor control (Groove pegboard), mental flexibility (Trails B, Str oop, CALCAP) and strategy (verbal fluency) (full details are provided in Table 10). There were no impairments on verbal abilities, visuo-spatial abilities and visual and verbal reasoning. A signi ficant effect of exposure was reported for Full Scale WAIS but was due to patchy under- functioning on certain WAIS subtests. General inte llectual ability was reported to be well preserved. This pattern of findings was confirmed if the data were compared to THIS IS A DRAFT PAPER FOR DISCUSSION. IT SHOULD NOT BE QUOT ED, CITED OR REPRODUCED 11 normative comparison standards. Farmers and controls were matched for gender, education and premorbid IQ. Age corrected psychometric test data was used. Analyses were run controlling for anxiety and depression. Significant negative correlations between poorer performance and exposure duration were reported in auditory and visual memory (WMS III visual /auditory tests), verbal ability (WAIS III vocabulary), strategy making (verbal fluency) and fine motor control (Groove pegboard). It is possible that the sele ction procedure may have preferentially included sheep farmers with ch ronic illhealth (Mackenzie-Ross et al 2010) (Annex 4, Table 7.B.3). Studies undertaken in USA Study of Apple Orchard Thinners 33. Keifer et al 2000, investigated neur opsychological function (using WHO Core Test battery) in orchard thinners exposed to azinphos-methyl following treatment of apple trees to control codling moth (Keifer et al 2000). Neuropsychology testing was undertaken prior to the 1994 spray season (to investigate the effects of past chronic low-level exposure) and after the 1994 seas on (to investigate seasonal change). There were 137 subjects included in the first examination and 90 in the second examination (data fo r 87 available). The authors di d not report the participation response rate for this study. Each exposed farm worker was matched on age, gender and education with a non-agricultura l referent (employed in garment manufacturing, hotels and restaurants) (A nnex 4, Table 6.B.3). Pre-1994 tests revealed poorer performance (P<0.05) in test s of attention (Digit span (backwards), Trailmaking A) and in a test of psychom otor function (Santa Ana dominant) (see Table 10 for full details). The authors noted that other tests of attention and psychomotor function were unaffected. Addi tionally there was no seasonal effect in any test in the WHO Core Test battery. The authors measured the Peabody Picture Vocabulary (which correlates with educati on) at the first ex amination (pre-1994 season) and included gender , age and haemoglobin level in the analysis. The authors considered that there was no consist ent effect of a season of thinning on neuropsychological test performan ce (Annex 4, Table 7.B.3). Study of Tobacco Workers 34. Salvi et al 2003, administered t he MMSE and word span tests to tobacco workers after 3 months of exposure to OPs (n=37), in particular to chlorpyrifos, and again 3 months after the cessation of OP us e (n=25) (Salvi et al 2003) (Annex 4, Table 6.B.3). There was no effect on plasma cholinesterase levels in this study suggesting exposures were low. Perfo rmance in MMSE and word span was within expected range for the population. There we re no differences between the two time points assessed. There was no description of the selection procedure for the 37 exposed subjects or the response rate. There was no consideration of confounding factors (Annex 4, Table 7.B.3). Study of Oregon Farmworkers 35. Rothlein et al 2006, undertook neur opsychological testing of 92 Hood river Oregon Hispanic immigrant farmworkers who liv ed in close proximity to orchards THIS IS A DRAFT PAPER FOR DISCUSSION. IT SHOULD NOT BE QUOT ED, CITED OR REPRODUCED 12 sprayed with OPs (Rothlein et al 2006). C ontrol subjects were taken from Hispanic immigrant workers from Newpor t, Oregon (a tourist costal to wn with little agriculture). The selection procedure for exposed and c ontrols was reported but the response rate was not provided. Neuropsychology te st data were available from 45 control subjects. Exposure to OPs was confirm ed in dust samples from farm workers' homes and in biomonitoring investigations (analysis of urine samp les for thiomethyl phosphate metabolites). A comprehensiv e set of psychomotor and cognitive function tests was undertaken (Annex 4, Tabl e 6.B.3). After adjusting for age, sex and years of education poorer perfo rmance (P<0.05) in 5/16 test attention/psychomotor indices was asso ciated with higher levels of average combined thiomethyl- metabolites (selective attention latency, symbol digit latency, preferred hand finger tapping, alter nate hand finger tapping, and continuous performance hit latency). (Negative findi ngs for Digit span (forward/backward), Progressive ratio, Reaction time, Selective attention trials, selective attention inter stimulus interval, serial digit learning, finger tapping non-preferred hand, Continuous performance; %hits, % correct rejects, and false alarm latency.) These data suggest a deficit on attention and psychomotor functions (Annex 4, Table 7.B.3). Study of Termiticide Work ers Applying Chlorpyrifos 36. Steenland et al 2000, undertook neuropsychological testing of termiticide applicators from a 12 county area of North Carolina wh o had applied chlorpyrifos from 1987-1997 (Steenland et al 2000). The Neurobehavioural Ev aluation System (NES) was administered consisting of vo cabulary test, mood scales, digit span, continuous performance, simple reactions ti me, digit symbol tes t, pattern memory. In addition, the investigators also administe red Trails A and B tests. The selection procedure and response rates for exposed and controls were reported. A total of 193 applicators were tested. Controls were either friends of exposed subjects who attended the test centre (106) or Nort h Carolina state employees (83) with no exposure to pesticides. Information on pesticide use was gathered by telephone interview and current chlorpyrifos ex posure was measured by analysis of 3,5,6- trichloro-2-pyridinal (TCP) ex cretion in urine . Approximately 34% of applicators had used chlordane (medi an 4.5 years (range 0.5-28years)) prior to 1988 when chlorpyrifos was introduced. The period of chlorpyrifos use was relatively short (median 1.8 years (range 0. 1-10.3 years)). Creatinine corrected values for TCP in urine from applicators ex posed in last week, not exposed in last week and non-exposed were 331, 55 and 3 ug/g creatinine re spectively. Apart from poorer performance in the P egboard task, there were no significant differences between Termiticide applicators and controls for any other neuropsychological test. The level of TCP did not significantly pr edict performance in any test except for Vocabulary, for which subjects with more TCP did significantly worse (p=0.02). There were no associations for current v former exposure, duration of use of chlorpyrifos, chlordane or other pesticides . Self-reported poisoning by chlorpyrifos (eight subjects) was associated with dec rease in Continuous performance test (p=0.0001) and on Simple reaction time (p=0. 06). Overall, there was no convincing evidence for poorer neuropsychological perfo rmance in this group of termiticide applicators with current exposure to chlo rpyrifos. The author s reported possible selection bias in that 38% of termitici de applicators could not be traced (Annex 4, Table 7.B.3). THIS IS A DRAFT PAPER FOR DISCUSSION. IT SHOULD NOT BE QUOT ED, CITED OR REPRODUCED 13 Study of Subjects Exposed to Chlorpyrifos 37. Kilburn and colleagues undertook comprehensive neuropsychological testing of 22 patients (10 self-referred, 12 attorney referred) with exposure to chlorpyrifos, predominantly arising from treat ment of homes or offices of the occupants (Kilburn et al 1999). These patients were selected from 384 patients evaluated for possible neurobehavioural effects of chemicals in a n eurotoxicology clinic (6% response rate) (Annex 4, Table 6.B.3). The authors report limited information on possible exposures with a mixture of acut e and repeated exposures documented. Neuropsychological tests of the 22 pati ents revealed a wide range of deficits following analysis of variance. Testi ng revealed a perceptual motor function impairment (peg board, Trails A and B were all decreased). There were finger writing errors in the left (but not ri ght) hand. Story recall and long term memory functions of information, picture completion diminished (but similarities was not). Profile of Mood States (POMS)/depression sco re was elevated in the patients. This study was limited by the select ion process which resulted in self/attorney referrals which may have selected patients with pr e-existing neuropsychol ogical deficits (Annex 4, Table 7.B.3). Studies undertaken in Egypt Studies of Cotton Field Sprayers 38. Farahat et al 2003, un dertook neuropsychological test ing of 53 cotton workers exposed to a range of OPs and other pesticides (none had been hospitalised for acute poisoning) and 50 male clerks who liv ed and worked near to cotton fields as a control group The authors reported a res ponse rate of 81% for exposed participants (Farahat et al 2003). A descr iption of potential routes of exposure of sprayers and agricultural field workers was provi ded (Annex 4, Table 6.B.3). Serum cholinesterase was significantly reduced in the exposed group. A comprehensive set of neuropsychological tests was underta ken. Statistically poorer performance (P<0.05) of six tests was reported wh ich included tests of verbal abstraction (Similarities), attention/memory (Dig it span (forward and backward) and Benton Visual Retention test), visuomotor speed (Digit symbol, Trails A and B), and attention (Letter cancel). No effects of expos ure were reported for Block Design (visuo- spatial), the Paced Auditory Serial Attent ion test (PASAT, attention/working memory) and Story recall A and B (memory). The authors concluded that moderate chronic OP exposure may not only affe ct visuomotor speed as repor ted previously, but also verbal abstraction, attention and memory . Analysis included adjustment for age and education. The possibility that some of the exposed group had suffered acute intoxication with OPs cannot be ex cluded (Annex 4, Table 7B.3). 39. Abdel-Rasoul et al 2008, investigated the effects of occupational exposure to OPs resulting from spraying cotton fi elds on neurobehavioural performance in children (Abdel-Rasoul et al 2008). Male children from 5/50 villages (randomly chosen) were approached. 56 were identified. 50 participated (response rate 89.3%). Two age groups were studied, 9-15 years and 16-19 years. Data for the 16-19 year group (n=20) have been summarised. For ea ch sprayer, a control subject who had never worked in the cotton fields was sele cted from friends/relatives living in the same community and attending the same school s. Data on spray application history THIS IS A DRAFT PAPER FOR DISCUSSION. IT SHOULD NOT BE QUOT ED, CITED OR REPRODUCED 14 was available but no direct estimate of OP exposure was available. A comprehensive set of neuropsychological te sts was used (Annex4, Table 6.B.3). A significant lower measure of intelligenc e (WAIS Information) was reported in sprayers. Reduced performances (P<0 .05) were observed in tests of attention/working memory (WAIS Arithmetic , Digit span forward/backward, and Trails A), executive function/mental flexibility (Trails B), psychomotor function (Digit symbol), visuo-spatial (WAIS Block Desi gn) and memory function (Benton Visual Retention Test) (full details in table 10). Analysis included age and education. Little weight can be attached to the results of this study with regard to potential neuropsychological effects in adults as the study focused on neuropsychological testing of children and adolescents (Annex 4, Table 7.B.3). Study undertaken in Spain Study of Greenhouse Workers 40. Rold\u00e1n-Tapia et al 2005, undertook a compr ehensive neuropsychological testing of 40 male Green house sprayers from Southeastern Spain (Rold\u00e1n-Tapia et al 2005). These subjects had used a mi xture of pesticides (predominantly OPs/carbamates) for between 6 months to 30 years (mean pesticide use 10.86 years (SD 7.49 years). A control group of 26 male workers (drawn from a variety of professions) who had never worked on farms or had contact with toxic substances were tested. Full details of the selecti on procedure for exposed and controls was not provided. Neuropsychology tests of attenti on, memory, perception, praxis (apraxia defined below), expressive language, motor performance and assessment of emotional condition were used (Annex 4, Tabl e 6.B.3). The majority of tests yielded negative results when exposed and controls were compared. Recent exposure was a significant predictor of qua lity of copy of Rey-Osterrei ch figure (p=0.019), but there were no significant differences between exposed and control groups with regard to BuChE levels. Cumulative exposure was a significant predictor of recall after delay in the Rey-auditory Verbal Learning test (a te st of memory), quality and time of copy of Rey-Osterreich Figure (a test of praxis ), Benton Visual Form Discrimination (a test of perception) and Taylor Anxiety Scale. The authors calculated Odds ratios (ORs) for cumulative exposure (years working with pesticides) and recent exposure (BuChE levels) for tests which had yielde d statistically significant differences between exposed and control. There was a significantly raised OR for poor performance (below cut off point) for the longest durati on working with pesticides (11-30 years) for the Rey-Osterreich Figure copy quality (O R 5.00 (95%CI 1.22- 20.40)) and time (OR 4.12 ((5%CI 1.18-14.39)), a test for vi suo-constructional praxis and for the Benton visual form discriminatio n (OR 6.93 (1.52-31.51)), a test for integrative perception. This study was lim ited in the small study size and in that testers were not blind to the exposure stat us of the subjects. In addition, the authors did not report details of subject selection for this study (Annex 4, Table 7.B.3). (Apraxia defined as total or partial lo ss of the ability to perform coordinated movements or manipulate objects in t he absence of motor or sensory impairment .) THIS IS A DRAFT PAPER FOR DISCUSSION. IT SHOULD NOT BE QUOT ED, CITED OR REPRODUCED 15 Study undertaken in Poland Study of Green House Workers 41. Bazylewicz-Walczak et al 1999, under took neuropsychological testing of 26 women exposed to OP while performing gardening/green house jobs (Bazylewcz- Walczak et al 1999). A control group of 25 women matched with exposed for age, education, place of habitation, smoking, alcohol and drug use, who worked in canteens, kitchens and administrative jobs at garden centres, was studied. The authors did not describe how the exposed or control groups were selected. The psychological tests administered were the Polish adaptation of the WHO Core Test battery and the Finnish Subject Symptom Questionnaire. Psychology tests were undertaken in January-February (preceeding intensive OP use) and in June (following pesticide applic ations). Air sampling and dermal exposure to OPs (predominant OPs used were dichlorv os, methamidophos, methidathion, and pirimiphos-methyl) was undertaken (Annex 4, Table 6.B.3). It was noted workers were also exposed to carbamates, synthet ic pyrethroids and dithiocarbamates. Exposure was seasonal for approximatel y 7-46 days with cycles of 4-7 days of spraying with an interval of approximatel y 3 days between spray applications. The daily cumulative exposure (combined inha lation/dermal) on 6 consecutive days after the restriction period was between 0.001-0.009 % of the toxic dose (based on dermal LD50s). The duration of spraying varied be tween 1-24 years (mean 11.9y SD 6.8y). The OP exposed group (assessed prior to sp ray season, i.e. measuring cumulative exposure) when compared with controls show ed a significant (P<0.04) slowing down of perceptual motor function functions (Simple reaction time) and lower hand movement efficiency (Aiming) (see table 10 for full details). Exposed women also reported a higher degree of anxiety, anger, depression and fa tigue-inertia. Apart from errors in the Aiming test, there was no deterioration in cognitive and psychomotor function or in emotional st ates or subjective symptoms over one season. There was a significant improv ement in some neur opsychological tests (e.g. digit symbol, digit span and Santa Ana Dexterity) and in m ood scales over the season, which was most likely a seas onal effect (Annex 4, Table 7.B.3). Study undertaken in Israel Study of Agricultural Community 42. Browne et al 2006, report neuropsyc hological test data for 23 exposed individuals (a mixture of residents living near to sprayed fields and agricultural workers) (Browne et al 2006). These partici pants were selected fr om a group of 291 residents living 25m-150m near to sprayed fi elds. Control test data were obtained for 23 controls (living in urban environm ents) taken from a group of 91 control subjects who were matched for age, sex a nd education (Annex 4, Table 6.B.3). Exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors was confirmed by static monitoring and reduced serum AChE in exposed residents/agric ultural workers. Neuropsychological tests of attention, reaction time and me mory were undertaken. A significant reduction in the performance (P<0.05) of t he delayed memory task (Weschler visual reproduction) was reported. There were no effects on Continuous performance, Digit span (backward) or the Hebrew versi on of the Rey auditory learning scale. This THIS IS A DRAFT PAPER FOR DISCUSSION. IT SHOULD NOT BE QUOT ED, CITED OR REPRODUCED 16 study was limited by the small group size of investigated participants and possible selection bias (Annex 4, Table 7.B.3). Study undertaken in Iran Study of Horticulture Farmers 43. Bayrami et al 2012 app lied the Mini mental Stat e Examination (MMSE) to a group of 40 horticulture worker s from Iran who were exposed to OPs. (Bayrami et al 2012) A control group of villagers, not exposed to OPs was used (Annex 4, Table 6.B.3). No differences in performance of MMSE and its subscales (orientation, registration, attention/calcul ation, recall, and language) were reported. Significantly lower plasma AChE was reported in exposed farmers. The study was limited by its small size and lack of assessment of OP exposure and limited assessment of neuropsychological functions (Annex 4, Table 7.B.3). Study undertaken in India Study of Manufacture of Quinalphos 44. Srivastava et al 2000, undertook neurop sychological testing of all 59 workers engaged in the manufacture of Quinalphos (Srivastava et al 2000). These subjects would possibly have been exposed to a range of chemical intermediates as well as quinalphos. Control subjects (17) were engaged as tea vendors or roadside hawkers and were not expos ed to OPs. The selection procedure and response rate for the controls were not reported (Annex 4, Table 6.B.3). Whole blood AChE was not statistically different between exposed and controls. Four exposed subjects had whole blood AChE lower than the contro l range and one subject with a low blood AChE was shifted to a job with no OP expos ure. Subjects were tested in a limited number of psychological tests (digit span, digit symbol and Bourdon Weirsma vigilance test). Statistically significant poorer performance (P<0.05) was reported in all three tests in the exposed group. It is noted that the study di d not control for the effects of education (a higher proporti on of controls were graduates (47.1%) compared to 25.5% in expos ed) (Annex 4, Table 7.B.3). Discussion on Chronic Exposure wi th Chronic Neuropsychological Abnormalities 45. It is extremely difficult to draw conc lusions as to whether chronic low-level exposure to OPs can result in chronic neuropsychological effects. The studies identified have used a wide r ange of neuropsychological tests (data from over 100 different tests were retrieved) examini ng a full range of potential abnormalities. The data from separate tests have been collated into functional domains (Attention, Executive functions/mental fl exibility, Psycho-visuomotor , Visuo-spatial, Memory and Language and Verbal/visual reasoning). Functional domains have been reviewed in the Handbook of Psychological Assessment, 5 th edition, Groth-Marnat G,published 2009 John Wiley and Sons Inc. The grouping of tests into functional domains in this discussion paper has been based on the grouping (s) suggested by the authors of the THIS IS A DRAFT PAPER FOR DISCUSSION. IT SHOULD NOT BE QUOT ED, CITED OR REPRODUCED 17 studies considered which occasionally l eads to some differences between studies regarding the allocation of a te st to a particular domain. 46. Additionally a wide range of expo sure scenarios have been included (e.g. sheep dippers, orchard sprayers/thinners, cott on field sprayers, agricultural workers, termiticide applicators and tobacco workers) where exposure to a range of OPs and other pesticides would have occurred. Ther e is no evidence to suggest that these studies investigated subjects who were acut ely intoxicated by OPs, although there is evidence that current exposures in some of these studies were sufficient to reduce AChE levels (predominantly serum AChE measured) (Farahat et al 2003, Abdel Rasoul et al 2008, Browne et al 2006, Keifer et al 2000). Many of these studies also report more subjective symptoms in OP exposed subjects including difficulty in concentration, feeling depressed/irrit able (Abdel Rasoul et al 2008), anxiety/depression (Bazylewicz-Walczak et al 1999), dizziness (Farahat et al 2003) and weakness (Srivastava et al 2000), but over all there is no evidence of overt acute intoxication to OPs in the subjects inve stigated (with the po ssible exception of Farahat et al 2003. Thus, the magnitude of OP exposure in these studies is likely to be similar to the studies reviewed by COT in 1999. 47. No formal scoring assessment of study quality has been undertaken in this review. There is no guidance available on the selection, undertaking and assessment of the neuropsychology tests ci ted in this draft discussion paper. However, overall, the cohort study by Star k et al 2012 was the largest study and had good assessment of exposure, and was consi dered the best study in this review. These authors also considered a range of potential confoundi ng factors. The findings of this study were largel y negative which included the following neuropsychological tests (see table below). (Less weig ht of evidence has been attached to the other cohort study by Alber s 2004b in view of the limited nature of neuropsychological testing under taken by this group).

The results of the study by Starks et al 2012 have to be weighed against the fourteen cross-sectional studies which used a large number of tests, but when taken together reported both positive and negative results for all of the functional domains reviewed in this discussion paper (see below).

The advantages and disadvantages of cohort design compared to cross- sectional design have been briefly summa rised below (taken from Mann, 2003). Study Advantages Disadvantages Cohort Describes incidence, analyses risk factors. Studies measure events in temporal sequence. Retrospective cohorts are available which are cheaper and quicker Confounding factors are a major problem in analysing cohort studies Subject selection and loss to follow up is a major potential cause of bias Cross-sectional Best way to determine prevalence, relatively quick Can study multiple outcomes. Do not differentiate between cause and effect 50. Subject selection was identified by Starks et al 2012a as a major cause of bias in this cohort study. There was, however, evidence that study groups in the cross-sectional studies were also hi ghly selected. Assessment of these neuropsychological data would require the evaluation by a neuropsychologist.

Neuropsychological tests of attent ion/working memory have been undertaken for a variety of occupational exposure si tuations where exposure varied and included situations where exposure was predominantly to OPs (e.g. termiticide applicators), to mixtures of pesticides including OPs and in one study where exposure was to quinalphos and its manufacturing interm ediates. Measurem ent of absorbed OP dose was reported in one study (Rothlein et al 2006). The studies all controlled for the effects of age and education on neuropsyc hological tests, but results were inconsistent between studies. Thus, there were results for digit span tests in ten publications, of which four reported positive results (cohen's d effect size 0.2-0.8), one study a mixture of positive and negative results and five studies which reported negative results. Six cross-se ctional studies reported result s of Trails A test. Five documented reduced performance in OP expos ed groups (cohen's d effect size 0.3- 0.85) and one cross-sectional study was negat ive. However, a negative result for Trails A was also reported by Starks et al 2012 a, in t he large Agricultural Health cohort study which had good measur es of OP exposure. Trails A is a test frequently used to assess impairment in attention (Gor th-Marnet, 2009). Little weight is placed on the results reported by Abdel-Rasou l (tests undertaken in adolescents) and Kilburn (self- or attorney selected subj ects). Overall, though, the balance of evidence does not allow a clear conclusion to be reached. Members may consider that the results of the neur ophysiology testing, particula rly prolongation of the P300 wave of the Auditory Evoked Potential may support a more definite conclusion regarding attention/working memory.

IT SHOULD NOT BE QUOT ED, CITED OR REPRODUCED 20 Comment: Executive Function/Mental Flexibility 52. There are relatively few studies which have included investigations of executive function/mental flexib ility. Executive functions involve a person's ability to effectively regulate and direct self behavi our. Positive results were reported for Trails B which is a test of attention and mental flexibility in 4/6 studies. Caution should be placed on interpreting the result s reported by Abdel Rasoul since the subjects tested were adolescent. A positiv e result was reported by Kilburn who tested 22 self- or attorney-referred patients. Little weight is attached to this study since there was a high level of selection of subjects who may have had pre-existing neuropsychological impairments. The two re maining cross-sectional studies which reported positive results In Trails B investigated Sheep dippers in England (Mackenzie Ross 2010) and cotton field spraye rs in Egypt (Farahat 2003). However, the possibility of selection bias cannot be excluded from these studies. Negative results were reported by Star ks et al 2012a in the large Agricultural Health cohort study which also had good measures of OP exposure. Overall, though, there is no convincing evidence for an effect of chroni c low-level exposure to OPs and an effect on executive function/mental flexibility, but the available data are limited.

Measurement of absorbed OP dose was reported in one study.(Rothlein et al 2006) Positive results have been reported in 5/8 studies where the digit symbol te st was applied. Little weight can be placed on the results reported by Abdel-Rasoul (tests undertaken in adolescents) and Kilburn (self- or attorney sele cted subjects). It is also possible that some subjects in the Farahat study exper ienced acute OP intoxication. The three remaining positive results taken together s uggest an effect of low-level exposure to OPs. (Rothlein et al 2006, Srivastava 2000, Mackenzie Ross 2010) These studies have to be weighed against the negative resu lt for Digit symbol from the large Agricultural Health Study cohort which studied more than double the number of subjects than all three cross-sectional st udies added together. The Digit symbol test was described in the 1999 COT report as a test that depends on multiple cognitive functions, places individuals under time pr essure, and is known to be sensitive to cognitive impairment following n eurological insult such as traumatic brain injury. Gorth-Marnet G (Handbook of Psychological Assessment, Wiley, Fifth edition 2009, Chapter 5 Wechsler Intelligence Scales pp 119-181) lists a vari ety of functions investigated using this test of which t he most important are psychomotor speed, ability to follow directions, clerical speed and accuracy, visual short-term memory and paper-pencil skills. There is no consis tent evidence for a psycho-visuo motor effect from any of the other tests which have been used in subjects exposed to OPs (e.g. Santa ana dexterity). T hus although there are some data to support an effect of OP exposure on digit symbol test performanc e and this would be consistent with the evidence reviewed by COT in 1999, the bal ance of evidence does not allow a clear conclusion to be reached.

There are very limited neuropsychological studies of visuo-spatial effects in subjects chronically exposed to low-levels of OPs.

Comment: Memory Tests 55. Several cross-sectional studies (5 /7) found evidence for impaired visual memory. However most auditory memory te sts or tests of l anguage were negative. Little weight has been placed on the study by Abdel Rasoul et al 2008, which reported tests using adolescent s, and Kilburn which reported tests in a self-selected or attorney referred subjec t. The clearest evidence for an effect on memory comes from the study of sheep farmers by Mack enzie Ross and colleagues. A correlation between poorer performance of auditory and visual memory tests and duration of sheep dipping was reported. However the large cohort study of subjects in the Agricultural Health Study found no evidence for an effect of OP exposure on auditory learning. (Starks et al 2012a). Overall t here is no consistent evidence for an effect of long term low-level exposure to OPs and effects on memory functions, but the data do not allow a clear conclusion to be reached. Language/verbal, visual reasoning Comment: Language, Ver bal-Visual-reasoning 56. There are only a few studies which r eport investigations of language, verbal- and visual reasoning in subjects chronically exposed to low-levels of OPs. It is possible that some subjects in the study by Farahat et al 2003, experienced acute OP intoxication. Limited weight is plac ed on the results from Kilburn where patients testes were self- or attorney referred. The clearest evidence for an effect comes from the study by Mackenzie Ross et al 2010, where the effect on verbal ability showed an exposure duration response (unclear from paper which tests this result refers to).

Overall comment chronic exposure to OPs and chronic neuropsychological effects 57. It is difficult to interpret studies where isolated changes in one or a few neuropsychological tests have been reported. Thus, Stephens et al 2004, reported reduced performance in the Automated Cogni tive Test System (SCTS) Syntactic reasoning to negative statement s but no effects were found in a wide range of other neuropsychological tests performed (Stephens et al 2004). The approach taken has been to evaluate the results of neuropsychologica l tests in functional domains. It is proposed for this draft discussion paper that it is necessary to have consistency in the results for tests in each domain in order to reach a conclusion. An alternative approach to weighing the evidence from multiple tests has been suggested by Rohlman et al 2011 (see discussion of this re view paper below in paragraphs 60,61). However, the neuropsychological test dat a for all the domains considered are inconsistent. 58. An alternative is to weigh the evidence according to study quality. For this review, the recent Agricultural Heal th Study was the largest study with good assessment of OP exposure and was attri buted considerable weight in deriving conclusions, although further assessment of the quality of neuropsychological testing undertaken for this study is required. It is noted that the study authors deliberately oversampled high exposed subjects for the study. As a general observation, the 14 cross-sectional studies used report a mixt ure of positive and negative results for neuropsychological tests but are much smaller studies than the AHS study, and could have also potentially suffered from se lection bias. On this basis, no clear conclusions have been reached in this draft discussion paper. Other Functional Domains 59. One study reported ther e was evidence for poor performance (below cut off point) for the longest duration working with pesticides (11-30 years) for the Rey- Osterreich Figure copy quality an d time, a test for visuo-c onstructional praxis and for the Benton visual form 6.93 (1.52-31.51 )), a test for integrative perception (Rold\u00e1n-Tapia et al 2005). T here are no other studies available to confirm these results. Consideration of review by Rohlman et al 2011 (appended at end of Annex 4) 60. Rohlman and colleagues review published a review of neurobehavioural studies of OP exposure citing literature up to 2008 (Rohlman et al 2011). Apart from the more recent studies considered in this draft discussion paper, the literature considered by Rohlman in her review is different to that us ed in this discussion paper. A number of studies used by Rohlma n were excluded from this review as definite exposure to OPs was not stat ed in the paper (e.g. Kamel et al 2003, Eckerman et al 2007, Cole et al 2007 ). A number of other papers were identified for THIS IS A DRAFT PAPER FOR DISCUSSION. IT SHOULD NOT BE QUOT ED, CITED OR REPRODUCED 25 the COT review which were not considered by Rohlman et al (e.g. Keifer et al 2000, Salvi et al 2003, and Kilbur n et al1999,) in addition to papers post dating 2008 (e.g Mackenzie Ross et al 2010, Starks et al 2012a). 61. Rohlman considered the results of neuropsychological tests under functional domains, which are generally equivalent to those used in this draft discussion paper, but did not tabulate or list negative results. A review using study quality was not included in the Rohlman et al publication. Rohlman argues that inconsistent test results between publications could have resu lted from a number of factors including competence of subjects to undertake the tests, cross cultural effe cts, differences in the application of tests between studies, and lack of effects due to small sample sizes. Rohlman suggest ed that variations in me thod, procedure and population could explain the outcome of OP studies and concluded that a systematic review of the specific factors contributing to diffe rent outcomes is problematic because the impact of the variables can only be suspec ted, not documented. Overall, Rohlman comes to a conclusion that the findings of studies are consistent and compelling CONCLUSIONS ON NEUROPSYCHOLOGY Acute Exposure with Chroni c Neuropsychological Effects 62. The most consistent information fo r the assessment of acute OP exposure (leading to overt cholinergic poisoning) resulting in chronic neuropsychological effects comes from the cohort study by Delgado et al 2004 and the cross-sectional study of banana workers (Wesseling et al 2002) . The results of bot h of these studies support the conclusion reached by the CO T working group in 1999 that acute intoxication can lead to persistent deficits in psychomotor performance (particularly with respect to reduced performance in digi t symbol test). The study of acute OP/carbamate poisoning in Spain reported evidence for persistent effects 1 year after poisoning on a range of tests measur ing perception (Picture completion), memory (Logical memory and Rey-Osterrie th Figure test) and also on visuomotor skills (quality of copy of Rey-Osterrieth Figure and time of copy of Benton Visual Form test) (Roldan-Tapia et al 2006). T hese particular tests have not been used in other studies and additionally the functions assessed have not been investigated in detail in other studies. It is difficult to draw any definite conclusions based on this study. The study of Mittal et al 2011 was undertaken at only a co mparatively short 3- month period after OP poisoning. It is difficult to draw any conclusions as to whether OP exposure induced neuropsycholog ical deficit in Gulf War veterans exposed to sarin/cyclosarin at the K hamisiyah incident, particularly as neuropsychological deficits have been found in Gulf war veterans irrespective of exposure to sarin/cyclosarin. There is some limited evidence for a deficit in psychomotor function and in the digit span (backward) test (which was interpreted as an effect on short term memory) in indi viduals exposed to sarin from the Tokyo incident, but results between studies which covered different periods of follow-up are inconsistent (Nishiwaki et al 2001, Oh tani et al 2004, Miyaki et al 2005). THIS IS A DRAFT PAPER FOR DISCUSSION. IT SHOULD NOT BE QUOT ED, CITED OR REPRODUCED 26 Chronic Low-Level Exposure with Ch ronic Neuropsychological Effects 63. The approach used in this draft di scussion document involved grouping the results of neuropsychological tests conduc ted with subjects with low-level chronic exposure to OPs into func tional domains. It was c onsidered necessary to have consistency of results within a domain in order to reach a defin ite conclusion. The available data were inconsistent for test s of attention/working memory, executive functioning/mental flexibility, Psycho- visuomotor, visuo-spatial, memory and language/verbal, visual reasoning tests. Both positive and negative findings were reported. Assessment usi ng study quality suggested t hat the best study was a recent publication from the US Agricultur al Health Study which provided largely negative results. The remaining 14 cross- sectional studies yielded inconsistent results for each functional domain assessed. On this basis, it is suggested that no clear conclusion regarding evidence for an association between long-term low-level OP exposure and chronic neuropsychological deficit can be reached. Members may wish to consider the evidence for prolongation of P300 latency in the Auditory Event Potential test may provide supporting evidence for an e ffect on attention/working memory (see neurophysiology section (Annex 5) of this draft discussion paper).

The deficit in the high exposure group at the time of dischar ge was -1.7 (95% CI -3.7-0.3) after adjustment for age, education and alcohol consumption in comparison with unexposed group. There was no deficit at 7 weeks or 2 years in this group. A deficit in the adjusted digit symbol visuomot or performance was reported at 7 weeks in all groups (value for all exposed 7 weeks v discharge -5.07, 95%CI -9.00- -1.14). In the medium exposure group, the mean deficit was -7.89 units (95%CI -12.7- -3.0). This deficit had disappeared in this group after 2 years (-0.4 0,95% CI -8.16-7.37). The authors reported a considerable improvement in the unexposed gr oup was responsible for the change in this deficit. This was likely a test- retest effect. In the high exposure group visuomotor performance was depressed throughout the observation period, particularly after 2 years, but the CIs were wide and included positive values: -3.12 (95% CI -9.72-3.49) 7 weeks v discharge. -17.6-2.24) 2 years v discharge. -4.58 (95% CI -15.5-6.33) 2 years v 7 weeks The P-value for interaction between time and exposure was 0.04 (unadjusted and adjusted) for all exposed, 0.20/0.23 (unadjus ted/Adjusted) for low exposed, 0.001 (both unadjusted and adjusted) for medium exposed and 0.29/0.25 (Unadjusted/Adjusted) for high exposed.

The authors considered that reduced GM volume observed in sarin/cyclosarin exposed veterans was associated with deleterious effects in some neuropsychologic al tests. In addition the correlation between WM volume and performance on Block Design test led to the suggestion that OP exposure affected WM which in turn compromised cognitive function (more than a decade later).

OPs cited were terbufos (18), fenamipho s (6), ethoprophox (6), diazinon (2), carbofuran and chlorpyrifos (1 each). All of poisoned subjects reported poisoning not sufficient to require hospitalisat ion but needed to seek medical attention There were no differences between me an temperature adjusted red blood cell cholinesterase levels in poisoned and non-poisoned individuals. The mean value of plasma cholinesterase levels in workers with recent c ontact with cholinesterase inhibitors was lower than the mean for workers without recent cont act (2.11 U./ml versus 2.26 U/m,l p=0.01). HEALTH OUTCOMES There were no differences in age or education between the groups. More of the tests for the non-poisoned group were undertaken in the afternoon (73.1% compared to 46.9% in the poisoned group). More of the poisoned group had loss of consciousness for >1h (8.6% compared to 2.3% in the non-poisoned group). The authors reported and tabulated data for combined OP and carbamate poisoned individuals. These performed less well than cont rols in 13 out of the 14 tests administered, but differences were small. The largest defic its were tests of psychomotor and visuomotor functions, language and affect. Poisoned subjects performed less well on Digit symbol and in addition reported more neuropsychiatric symptoms than did non-poisoned workers using Questionnaire 16 and Brief symptom inventory. Deficits were more clearly seen in data for OP exposed subjects than carbamate exposed subjects.

On day 24 0.2 g/cm2 (hockey equipment in garage) to 1.1 g/cm2 (child's room toy in bedroom). Ai r samples on day 23 were up to 10 g/m3 in playroom. Samples from 2nd laboratory on day 24 reported up to 18.3 g/m3. Bulk samples reported detectable levels of diazinon at 6.5 months post spraying ( e.g. sofa material from family room near kitchen, near floor 4.72 mg/kg, and toy from floor of child's room near garage 1.55 mg/kg). HEALTH OUTCOMES Patients 1 and 6 returned 4h post application of diazinon. Patient 6 crawled on treated surfaces whilst they were wet. Patient 1 attempted to mop up excess, but splashed her legs and arms (felt a burning sensation). Patient 6 experienced rhinitis, lacrimation, severe headaches, muscle pain and erythema on face. Patients 3,4,5 returned home 5h after diazinon application. Patients 3 and 4 had acute headaches, patient 4 repeated vomiting. Patient 2 came home later that evening. The next evening patient 2 played hockey using contaminated uniform and experienced vomiting, nausea, coughing, dizziness and headache. The family evacuated the home and didn't return for 11 months. The family were assessed at the clinic in A ugust 1999. Patient 1 (mother aged 37 y) had persisting fatigue, insomnia, and decreased short-term memory. Patient 2 (father aged 39y) had continuing acute symptoms and also insomn ia, lack of concentration, decreased short- term memory, difficulty driving, mood swings and depression. Patient 3 (11y female) had persistent severe headaches, patient 4 (8y female) had intermittent erythema . Patient 5 (6 y male) had headaches, decreased concentration and memory. Patient 6 (1 y male) had erythema, skin rash and lacrimatory conjunctivitis. The family returned in August 2002 and underwent neuropsychological testing. Patient 1 reported decreased concentratio n and short-term memory. Testing revealed prolonged choice reaction time. Tests revealed cognitive disorder, psychomotor and Strengths Neurobehavioural deficits found in a number of individuals with acute exposure to apparently high concentrations of diazinon at 3 years after exposure. Limitations Although detailed surface and air sampling was undertaken it is not clear what levels of exposure were experienced or when the family actually left the house. The study relates to indoor application of a pesticide, where exposure might be considered to be more intense and prolonged than in outdoor applications because of the confined space, and the possibility that residues remain Acute exposure to apparently high levels of diazinon are associated with chronic neurobehavioural deficits THIS IS A DRAFT PAPER FOR DISCUSSION.

A clinical diagnos is of toxic encephalopathy was reported. Patient 2 had blurred vision, rhinitis, headac he, insomnia, lack of concentration, decreased short-term memory, driving confusion, mood swings. Testing revealed cognitive disorder, psychomotor dysfunction and functional impairment. Patient 3 (now 14 y) had experienced a complex partial seizure in March 2002. She had developmental delay (e.g delayed menarche and bone development). Neurological testing revealed abnormal colour vision, prolonged sway speed, prolonged Trails A and B. Tests revealed cognitive disorder, word-finding anomia , left-sided auditory imperception, proactive imperceptions in verbal learning, and relative weakness in visual discrimination of complex stimuli. Patient 4 had decreased memory, headaches, mood swings and skin rash. Testing revealed abnormal colour discrimination, prolonged simp le and choice reaction times, prolonged sway speed, prolonged pegboard, prolonged Trails A and B and abnormal perimetry. The results revealed cognitive disorder, oromotor-sequenc ing left-sided auditory imperception, and mild astereognosis.( astereognosis is the inability to identify an object or discriminate between objects by touch without visual input). Patient 5 has continuous symptoms of headaches. Testing revealed abnormal colour discrimination, prolonged simple and choice reaction times, prolonged sway speed, prolonged peg board time, prolonged Trails A and B times, and abnormal right eye perimetry. The tests revealed cognitive disorder, psychomotor and sensorimotor functioning impairment, and oromotor sequencing dysfunction. Patient 6 (now 4y old) had continuing symptoms of erythematory pinpoint macules on the skin around his left eye and white s pots on cheeks where the red rash of pesticide exposure occurred. He did not undergo neurological testing. Neuropsychological evaluation revealed cogn itive disorder, oromotor sequencing dysfunction, and attenti on/executive dysfunction. Patient 7 was exposed in-utero and was aged 2 at assessment. He had delays in sensory processing, mainly proprioception, and was slow to speak. At 23 months of age he was identified as having a severe expressive communication developmental disability.

Following exposure RBC-ChE was 39% of pre-deployment level. The unit returned to the USA after 3 months. He experienced progressively worsening short-term memory loss, dys-coordination, episodic imbalanc e. On clinical examination at 8 months, he complained of these symptoms. Short-term me mory loss consisted of mostly names and tasks. He had not experienced weakness, numbness or tingling. He also complained of post- exertional headaches. He denied alcohol, toba cco or illicit drug use. He admitted to some difficulty with sleep but denied mood changes, lability, irritability or personality changes. On physical examination he was well develo ped, well nourished and in no acute distress. Vitals were stable. On neurological examinat ion he was fully orientated and language was normal. He had difficulties with rapid alternative finger tapping and recall (e.g. digit sequences, words beginning with the letter F). There were no effects on biochemistry, haematology, toxicology, MRI of brain/spine, electr omyography/nerve conduction, or PET. Neuropsychological testing revealed a mild cluster of impairments Reduced speed of information processing (W AIS-III, Processing speed index score 86). Poor focused and divided attention (Auditory Consonant Triagrams ACT 18\" and 36\" (scores 38 and 34)) and Trial 1 of the Californian Verbal Learning test (CVLT) (score 4). Difficulty in speeded bilateral manual motor coordination (grooved pegboard test) (32 (R ), 29 (L). His problem-solving, mental flexibility, naming, new learning, recall, visuoperceptual integration were normal. He showed delays on timed ta sks that require rapid mental processing of information. Certain aspects of attention were affected, with greatest impairment on divided attention tasks. Minnesota Mulitphasic Personality Inventory did not reveal the presence of emotional distress or any significant mood, an xiety or thought disorder. Limitations Single case report poor focused and divided attention. Difficulty in speeded bilateral manual motor coordination. Patient did not have subjective complaints of PTSD.

T here was approximately one week between spray periods. The other pesticides used were Bacillus thuringiensis and pyrethrins (or other carboxylate). Spray cycle had been used for 10 years. Children did not mix pesticides. PPE was not commonly used. HEALTH OUTCOMES There were no significant differences between applicators and controls regarding smoking, age, years education. BM I of older control subjects (16-19y) was significantly higher than applic ators (26.9\u00b14.1 controls, compar ed to 23.2\u00b10.6 applicators). For the older group mean days worked in season was 21.4\u00b16.7, and year s worked 7.2\u00b11.5. A significantly lowered serum AChE was reported for applicators (combined age groups).

IT SHOULD NOT BE QUOTED, CITED OR REPRODUCED 87 First Author Date Published Major Findings Strengths / Limitations Conclusions EXPOSURE data reported as total OPs (combi ned dermal/respiratory exposure) on days 1-6 after the restriction period ,a period of 1-3 days after spraying of pesti cides when workers may not enter the sprayed area. Most fr equently used compounds were exposures to carbamates, synthetic pyrethroids and dithiocarbamates Exposure was seasonal, each worker being in contact with OPs for approximately 7-46 days. There were cycles of 4-7 days of spraying with aninterval of approximately 3 days between spray applications. The daily cumulative exposure (combined inhalation/dermal) on 6 consecutive da ys after the restriction period was between 0.001-0.009 % of the toxic dose (based on derma l LD50s). The duration of spraying varied between 1-24 years (mean 11.9y SD 6.8y). HEALTH OUTCOMES NCTB results were obtained pre- and post-season to assess the effect of one season. Apart from errors in the Aiming test, there was no deterioration in cognitive and psychomotor function or in emotional states or subjective symptoms over one season. Some tests showed improvement (Digit symbol, Digit Span, Santa Ana Dexterity) over one season Significant improvement in mood scales (tension, depression, confusion) was also reported over one season. The only increased subjective symptoms were fatigue and gastric symptoms but these were not statistically significant. There was a decre ase in other symptoms between pre- and post spray season assessments. The between group analyses (exposed compared to reference group (cumulative exposure) found a significant slow-down of perceptual-motor functions (simple reaction time- fastest p = 0.04 ) and lower hand movement efficiency (Aiming errors p=0.02). Exposed women had a higher degree of anxiety, anger, depression and fatigue-inertia. They also reported more complaints relating to 'absent-mindedness' Exposed women reported more neurological symptoms (central but not specified) than cont rols.

Spraying by knapsack or tractor. Applicators were seas onal workers. .Also present in fields were agricultural engineers, assistants, whose main route of exposure was inhalation, and mixers, whose main route was dermal and inhalation. Mechanics were exposed by inhalation, skin contact and occasionally though ingestion when they were repairing old machines. HEALTH OUTCOMES There were no statistical differences between exposed and referent groups regarding age, duration of working, degree of education, BMI, smoking or coffee/tea intake. Mean serum AChE was lower in exposed compared to control (exposed 87.34 U/ml, control 108.25 U/ml, p=0.0001). Multiple regression show ed that serum AChE was associated with duration of exposure ( = -21.34, SE 3.94, 95%CI -29.18 to - 13.50), but not with age, education or BMI.

The primary reason given for retirement (77%) was a constellation of non-specific sy mptoms including chronic fatigue, headaches, cognitive impairment, muscular and joint pain, numbness and chemical sensitivity. A quarter of these farmers attributed their symptoms to pest icide (sheep dip) poisoning. Remainder (23%) retired on other ill health grounds such as mu sculo-skeletal injury, breathing difficulties and prostate problems. Farmers (both working and retired) were significantly impaired on measures of memory, response speed, fine motor control, mental flex ibility and strategy. There were no impairments on verbal abilities, visuo-spatial abilities and vis ual and verbal reasoning. A significant effect of exposure was reported for Full Scale WAIS but was due to patchy under-functioning on certain WAIS subtests. General intellectual ab ility was reported to be well preserved.

The non-Agricultural group aver aged 1.1 y more educatio n (P=0. 04, 0. 026-2.2 y more education). EXPOSURE At least one OP was detected in eac h of the 26 homes studied. Phosmet was identified in 25/26 (mean 5.2 \u00b14.1 g/g) and azinphos-methyl in 18/25 (mean 5.9\u00b14.5 g/g). Other OPs were found in 62-92% of homes bu t mean concentrations ranged between 0.20- 0.38 g/g. There were 84 urine samples at the summer sampling (T1) and 68 in the fall (T2) where creatinine levels were considered to be in the normal range. Dimethylthio- phosphate was above the LOD in 99% of samples. The median concentration of combined thiomethyl phosphate metabolites (dimethylthi o- and dimethylditio-) was 0.43 mol/L at T1 and 0.48 mol/L (not statistically different).

A modest correlation was reported r s =0.47, p = 0.013. Metabolite levels tended to be higher in males. HEALTH OUTCOMES Neurobehavioural test data were available for 92 farmers (51% male) and 45 controls (60% male). After adjusting for age, sex and years of education poorer performance in 5/16 test indices was associated with higher levels of average combined thiomethyl- metabolites.

This would include o-phenylene-diamine, glyoxalic methyl hemi-acetal reacted to give 2-hydroxyquinoxaline (refluxed with sodium hydroxide to form sodium salt). Final step is reaction wi th diethyl thiaryl phopshorocyanide to prepare quinalphos. The exposed and referents were of similar age (30.0\u00b16.61 exposed, 28.9\u00b14.5 y) height, weight, income, cigarette and alcohol use. There was a hi gher proportion of graduates in the referent group (15 (25.5%) in exposed, 8 (47.1%) in control). HEALTH OUTCOMES There were no significant differences in whole blood AChE levels between exposed and referents. Whole blood AChE was not statistically different between exposed and controls. Three exposed subjects had whole blood AChE lower than the control range, and one had a higher value. The subject with a low blood AChE was shifted to a job with no OP exposure. Complaints of weakness significantly higher in exposed subjects, but no subject with acute symptoms of OP poisoning. Significantly reduced performance in neurobehavioural tests in exposed was reported. Strengths Neurobehavioural testing in subjects exposed to a single OP.

Stephens 2004 UK STUDY OF ORCHARD SPRAYERS EXPOSED TO OPs EXPOSURE Urine DEP/DEPT metabolites we re similar in each group creatinine in orchard sprayers, farm workers and 0-11.48 nmol/mmol creatinine in construction workers. Orchard sprayers regularly used Chlorpyrifos and had participated in an HSE survey. They were found to have used Chlorpyrifos for a m edian of 5d/year (range 0.5-13 d/yr) for a median of 14 years (range 2-25 yrs) at an intensity su fficient to produce median summed DEP and The predominant pesticide sprayed at the time of the study was Chlorpyrifos. The majority (73%) of orchard sprayers report ed previously using pesticides in applications outside of spraying top fruit in orchards: spra ying soft fruit 18, non- fruit crops 12, dipping sheep 7, treating other farm animals 9, spraying to control insects 6, spraying amenity land 2, commercially spraying in households 2. The majority (73%) of pig farmers reported previously using pesticides: spraying soft fruit 2, non- fruit crops 10, dipping sheep 4, treating ot her farm animals including pigs 17, spraying to control insects 3, spraying amenity land 4, commercially spraying in households 2. Two construction workers reported using pesticides (control of insects 1 and commercially spraying households 1) POPULATIONS There were no differences in age a nd educational level. However it is noted there were 16% of orchard sprayers educated to graduate level, 12% of pig farmers, and 0% of the construction workers. Weekly alcoho l consumption was substantially higher in construction workers (27.71\u00b121.22 un its (10m l alcohol), as compared to 12.35\u00b11.37 in Strengths Orchard workers were considered well matched except for sociocultural factors. Alcohol consumption by construction workers would tend to reduce the chances of detecting an OP related effect. Education level in orchard workers was slightly higher which would predict better performance. Selection was originally for occupational health study and authors considered selection bias unlikely to have occurred.

There was no difference between orchard sprayers and construction workers. On the ACTS Category Search Recognition accuracy orchard sprayers performed significantly better than construction workers (p=0.006), and pig farm workers performed significantly better than construction workers (p=0.021) (no difference between orchard sprayers and pig farm workers). There was no difference between groups regarding ACTS Syntactic Reasoning latency (after adjustment for type 1 error inflation) but t he uncorrected p value was 0.044. The authors undertook further analyses. Each item on AC TS Syntactic Reasoning has two properties which affect performance; voice (passive or active) and positivity (whether stimulus is positively or negatively phrased). For each of the ACTS Sy ntatic Reasoning latency and ACTS Syntatic Reasoning accuracy properties, a mixed factor ial 3x2x2 ANOVA was carried out. A significant study group interaction with negative statem ents was reported for orchard sprayers ( F(1,91)=7.507, MS Wcell=3.859, p=0.012 correct ed) and pig farm workers (F (1,91) =6.124, MS Wcell=3.859, p=0.024 corrected) compared to construction workers, which was still evident (in analysis of orchard workers (F(1,90)=5. 132, MS Wcell=4.265, p=0.042 corrected) after accounting for effects of differences in alcohol consumption. Group analysis of positivity for the ACTS Syntactic Reasoning accuracy was not significant. The authors calculated lifetime exposure to Chlorp yrifos as lifetime days used Chlorpyrifos x level of DEP/DETP in urine. There was no a ssociation between this estimate of cumulative Chlorpyrifos exposure and ACTS Syntactic Reasoning latency. Neuropsychological data: Orchard sprayers Mean SD Pig farm workers Mean SD Construction workers Mean SD Uncorrected P value Attention Simple reaction time 0.29 (0.04) 0.29 (0.04) 0.29 (0.03) (1.66) 5.23 (2.13) 0.116 Processing speed compared to orchard workers may reflect greater sociocultural similarity (authors suggest pig farm workers may also exhibit pesticide- related effects).

It is noted that many tests examine multiple functions, so the citation of a particular test might be relevan t to more than one domain. The information is summarised here to aid members in interpreting the neuropsychology studies Intelligence Test Description WAIS full scale WAIS-III comprises 14 subt ests. The overall result of these tests is the full scale IQ. Two composites of the subtests measure verbal IQ and performance IQ. WA IS can also give 4 indices based on verbal, comprehension, perceptual organisation and processing speed WAIS-III- Verbal IQ Comprised of 7 subtests; digit span, vocabulary, comprehension, information, arithm etic, similarities and letter number sequence WAIS-III-Performance IQ Comprised of 7 subtests: picture completion, picture arrangement, block design, object assembly, digit symbol, matrix reasoning and symbol search WAIS III-Processing speed index Comprise d of digit symbol and symbol search WAIS-III- Reading Reading ability is assesse d as part of the WAIS working memory index Wide Range Achievement Test- Word me mory test WRAT is an achievemen t test combining reading words, comprehending sentences, and spel ling coupled to mathematics problems Word memory test A computer-based test that is designed to measure both verbal memory and biased responding (i.e. malingering).

Auditory consonant trigrams This test is used to test levels of memory an d attention. The client listens to a string of three consonants (the consonant trigram) imm ediately followed by a mental task such as counting backwards. After that task, the client is asked to recall the trigram Bourden-Wiersma vigilance The Bourdon-Wiersma Test is a commonly used test of combined visual perception and vigilance. The Bourdon-Wi ersma Test in the Cognitive Function Scanner system is composed of 37 rows of 25 dot gr oups of either three, four, or five dots. The subject is asked to search the rows and mark all t he four-dot groups. The test is done on the drawing pad with a ballpoint pen with ink. The inkfilled pen is used in order to provide visual feedback and prevent confusion. As focu s is on the time spent, time is measured for each row so that the time variation ca n be used as a measure of vigilance. In THIS IS A DRAFT PAPER FOR DISCUSSION.

Tests may use numbers, symbols, or even sounds Se veral variables may be derived from the CPT including errors of omission and commission (omission errors measure inattention, commission errors me asure impulsivity) CVLT Trial 1 and 2 (see also California Verbal Learning under memory) The California Verbal Learning test: Scores for CVLT Trial 1 (immediate encoding of novel words) and recognition discriminability (recognition of familiar vs. novel words) Digit span Digit-span test is a task that is often used for measur ing working-memory and attention. Participants are read a series of digits (e.g., '8, 3, 4') and must immediately repeat them back. If they do this successfully , they are given a slightlly longer list (e.g., '9, 2, 4, 0'), and so forth. The length of the longest list a pe rson can remember in this fashion is that person's digit span. While the participant is a sked to enter the digits in the given order in the forward digit-span task, in the backwar d digit-span task the participant needs to reverse the order of the numbers Digit vigilance test (DVT) The DVT is a simple task desi gned to measure vigilance during rapid visual tracking and accurate selection of target stimuli. It is sensitive to subtle changes in neuropsychological status, but relatively inse nsitive to the effects of either repeated administrations or practice. The DVT appears to isolate alertness and vigilance while placing minimal demands on two other comp onents of attention: selectivity and capacity FTMS (Failure to Maintain set) FTMS is a subscore of the Wisconsin card sort test s. It measures the loss of the correct sorting rule during performance (see Wisconsin card sort test) Letter cancel The Letter cancellation test is a test of attention/concentration, visual-spatial scanning abilities, and visual-spatial dysfun ctions such as spatial neglect. A single letter test consists of one 8.5\"x11\" sheet of paper containing 6 lines with 52 letters per line. The stimulus letter H is presented 104 times. The page is placed at the patient's midline. The patient is told to put a line through each H that is found on the THIS IS A DRAFT PAPER FOR DISCUSSION. IT SHOULD NOT BE QUOTED, CITED OR REPRODUCED 138 Test Description page. The time taken to complete the test is recorded. The score is calculated by subtracting the number of omissions (H's that were not crossed out) from the possible perfect score of 104 (0 to 53 on the left and 0 to 51 on the right) Likert Scales (Staying focused) A five response type scale used in Albers et al 2004 to measure attention (also used for recall, reading performance) MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) The most commonly applied test of cognit ive function. It is a brief 30-point questionnaire test that is used to screen for cognitive impairment, divided into subscores for orientation, attention, recall (short term memory) and language. A score below 24 is used as a cut off for mild cogn itive impairment. The MMSE is composed of 11 major items: temporal orient ation (5 points), spatial orie ntation (5 points), immediate memory (3 points), attention/ concentration (5 points), dela yed recall (3 points), naming (2 points), verbal repetition (1 point), verbal comprehension (3 points), writing (1 point), reading a sentence (1 point), and constructi onal praxis (1 point). The MMSE has maximum score of 30, with five different domai ns of cognition analysed: (1) Orientation, contributing a maximum of 10 points, (2) Me mory, contributing a maximum of 6 points, (3) Attention and calculation, as a meas ure of working memory, contributing a maximum of 5 points, (4) Language, contribu ting a maximum of 8 points, and (5) Design copying, contributing a maximum of 1 point. Individuals scoring two points below the maximum in any independent doma in (except design copying) were considered to be impaired Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) The PASAT is a test of sustained attention. In PASAT, patients are trained to add 60 pairs of single digits so that each number is added to the one immediately preceding it. Patients report the sum orally . The digits are presented by audiotape, first at a rate of 3 seconds per digit (PASAT3), then, in a second trial, at a rate of 2 seconds per digit (PASAT2). Scores are the sums of correct re sponses for the 3- and 2- second forms of the task Seashore rhythm (Rhythm test) Rhythm te st: Thirty pairs of tape-recorded, non- verbal sounds are presented. For each pair, individuals decide if t he two sounds are the same or different, marking \"S\" or \"D\" THIS IS A DRAFT PAPER FOR DISCUSSION. IT SHOULD NOT BE QUOTED, CITED OR REPRODUCED 139 Test Description respectively on their answer sheets. The pai rs are grouped into three subtests. This test is also called the Seas hore Rhythm Test, and is based on the Seashore Tests of Musical Ability. It evaluates auditory a ttention and concentration, and the ability to discriminate between non-verbal sounds Selective attention SATs can be eit her auditory or visual. In the audi tory test, the instrument was constructed as a paper-and-pencil approach to evaluate sustained attention utilizing different distractor conditions in the study of voluntary or in tentional aspects of attention Sequence A and B Assumed to be the same as Trails A and B. Trailmaking A and B Both parts of the Trail Making Test consist of 25 circles distributed over a sheet of paper. In Part A, the circles are numbered 1 - 25, and the patient should draw lines to connect the numbers in ascending order. In Part B, the circles include both numbers (1 - 13) and letters (A - L); as in Part A, the patient draws lines to connect the circles in an ascending pattern, but with the added task of alternating between the numbers and letters (i.e., 1-A-2-B-3-C, etc.). The patient should be instructed to connect the circles as quickly as possible, without lifting the pen or pencil from the paper. Time the patient as he or she connects the \"trail.\" If the patient makes an error, point it out immediately and allow the patient to correct it. Errors affect the patient's score only in that the correction of errors is included in the completion time for the task. It is unnecessary to continue the test if the patient has not completed both parts after five minutes have elapsed . The TMT is a measure of attention (A), speed (A/B) and mental flexibility (B) Wisconsin card sort test The WCST was originally dev eloped to assess abstract reas oning and ability to shift cognitive strategies in response to enviro nmental changes. Over the years, it has gained popularity as a clinical neuropsychol ogical instrument. Unlike other tests of abstraction, the WCST provides objective meas ures not only of overa ll ability, but also of particular sources of difficulty--e.g., ineffi cient initial conceptualisation, perseveration, failure to maintain set, and inefficient learni ng across several stag es of the test. In addition, it is one of the very few tests that have shown specific sensitivity to brain lesions involving the frontal lobes. Accordingl y, it can be very helpful in discriminating frontal from nonfrontal lesions. The test uses stimulus and response cards th at show various forms in various colours and numbers. Individually administe red, it requires the client to sort the cards according to different principles (i.e., by color, form, or number). As the test progresses, there are THIS IS A DRAFT PAPER FOR DISCUSSION.

This procedure adds a simple element of memory to the reaction time task (See definition in Psych omotor section) Control Oral Word Association The Controlled Or al Word Association (COWA) Test is a brief and sensitive measure of exec utive cognitive dysfunction. In addition, the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (FAS test) is another executive functioning exercise in which the examinee is asked to generate as many words as they can in a one minute span of time for the letters F, A, and S. Individuals with learning and attentional impairments often sh ow a significant difficulty in terms of generating words starting with these letters, while also exhibiting strong vocabulary abilities Short Category Test The Shor t Category test is available from Western Psychological Services. Based on the HRB category test, the SCT is a complex nonverbal task assessing concept formation and abstract reasoning Stroop The Stroop test is a test of attention and mental flexibility.

Associated task analysis programs process the raw data and store the resulting summary data for later statistical analysis. The system utilizes a cognitive approach to assessments of marginal toxicity by employing multiple performance parameters to specify a profile of deficits that, on the basis of a task's intern al structure, can be related to functionally discrete cognitiv e systems. The tasks have been developed from a consid eration of current c ognitive theory and the areas of cognition include those of learning, memory, attention, reasoning, verbal, and spatial abilities Trailmaking B See description given above Wisconsin card sort S ee description given above Psycho-visuomotor Test Description CALCAP Simple reaction time An investigation of changes in reaction time and speed of information processing WAIS Digit symbol Digit symbol is a subt est of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale.

Individuals ar e instructed to tap their index finger as quickly as possible for ten seconds, keeping the hand and arm stationary. This trial is re peated five to ten times, until the examiner has collected counts for five consecutive trials that are within five taps of each othe r. Before starting the test, individuals are given a practice session. They are also given brief rests between each 10-second trial, and one to two-minute rests after every third trial. This entire procedure is repeated with the non-dominant hand. The test takes approximately ten minutes to complete. Interpreta tion (tapping interval measured in msec) should also consider education level, intelligence, fatigue, general weakness or lack of coordination, depression, and injuries to the shoulders, arms, or hands. This test should only be interpreted in combination with other tests in the battery Groove pegboard The Grooved Pegboard is a manipulative dexterity test consisting of 25 holes with random ly positioned slots. Pegs with a key along one side must be rotated to match the hole before they can be inserted. This test requires more complex visual- motor coordination than most pegboard tests. Some common uses are student labs, screening procedures in industry and evaluating lateralized brain damage Progressive ratio A schedule of reinforcement that is characterised by requiring the subject to make progressively more responses in order to obtain reinforcem ent. The subject is required to work for a reinforcement on a fixed-ratio (FR) schedule that consistently gets longer. The pattern of increment is determined in advance by the experimenter. For example, THIS IS A DRAFT PAPER FOR DISCUSSION. IT SHOULD NOT BE QUOTED, CITED OR REPRODUCED 143 Test Description the schedule may start at FR 2 (two responses must be made), then FR 4, FR 8, FR 16, and so on. At some point, the demand of the schedule will be too high, and the subject will quit responding. This point is called the breaking point, , which is defined as the last completed ratio. So, if the subject made 64 responses, go t the reinforcement, but then stopped responding, the breaking point would be 64. The progressive ratio schedule is a very useful measure of how motivated the subject is to obtain the reinforcement Purdue pegboard Tests dexterity. Measures two types of activities: one involving gross movement of hands, fi ngers and arms; and the other involving fingertip dexter ity. The Purdue Pegb oard is a dexterity test to aid in the selection of em ployees for industrial jobs such as assembly, packing, operation of certain machines, and other manual jobs. It measures dexterity for two types of activity: one involving gross movements of ha nds, fingers, and arms, and the other involving primarily what migh t be called \"fingertip\" dexterity Pursuit aiming Pursuit ai ming test: the pur suit aimin g test requires the subject to use a pencil to p lace o ne dot in side each circle following the pattern g iven on th e printed pursuit aiming t est sheet.

Choice Reaction Time can be improved by practice and training. Choice Reaction Time (CRT) is a 2-choice reaction time test which is similar to the Simple Reaction Time (SRT) test, except that stimulus and response uncertainty are introduced by having two possible stimuli and two possible responses.

Recently, the ROCF has been a useful tool for measuring executive function that is mediat ed by the prefrontal lobe. The ROCF consists of three test c onditions: Copy, Immediate Recall and Delayed Recall. At the first step, subjects are given the ROCF stimulus card, and then asked to draw the same figure. Subsequently, they are instructed to draw what they remembered. Then, after a delay of 30 min, they are required to draw the same figure once again. The anticipated results vary according to the scoring system used, but commonly include scores related to location, accuracy and organization. Each condition of the ROCF takes 10 min to complete and the overall time of completion is about 30 min. Rey complex memory (also referred to as Rey Complex Figure trial) RCFT is a measure of visuospatia l constructional ability (Copy trial) and visuospatial memory (Immediate Recall, Delayed Recall, and Recognition trials). Results of factor analysis suggest the RCFT captures five domains of neuropsychological functioning: visuospatial recall memory, visuospatial recognition memory, response bias, processing speed, and visuospatial THIS IS A DRAFT PAPER FOR DISCUSSION.

Be sides easy administration, the Benton Visual Retention Test also features updated normative data, expanded scoring examples , and a detailed review of research conducted with the test. Easy Administration Each of the 3 test forms consists of 10 designs presented one- by-one. The examinee reproduces the drawings in the Response Booklet-Record Form. The 3 alternate, equivalent forms of the Benton Visual Retention Test allow for retesting while minimizing practice effects. Interrater scoring is highly reliable ( r = .95 to .97).

IT SHOULD NOT BE QUOTED, CITED OR REPRODUCED 148 Test Description Reception Delayed, General Memory, and Working Memory Benton Visual retention test The Benton Revi sed Visual Retention Test is a widely used instrument that assesses visual perception, visual memory, and visuoconstructive abilities. Because it measures perception of spatial relations and memory for newly learned material, it is used in clinical diagnosis of brain damage and dysfunction in children and adults, as well as in research. The Benton, as it is usually called, has three alternat e forms, each of which consists of ten designs. In addition, t here are four possible modes of administration. The Benton Visual Retention Test is an individually administered test fo r ages 8-adult that measures visual perception and visual memory . It can also be used to help identify possible learning disab ilities. The subject is shown 10 designs, one at a time, and asked to reproduce each one as exactly as possible on plain pa per from memory. The test is untimed, and the results are pr ofessionally scored by form, shape, pattern, and arrangement on the paper. Number of correct/incorrect answers can be scored Brief visual memory test The Brief Visuospa tial Memory Test - Revised or BVMT-R can be used as a criterion measure of visuospatial memory, within a large battery of neuropsycholog ical tests; as a screening measure within a brief, neuropsychological battery; or as a repeat measure to document changes in neurocognitive skills over time. In this test, patients are presented with an 8 x 11 inch plate containing six ge ometric visual designs in a 2 x 3 matrix. The stimulus is presented for 10 seconds and patients are instructed to reproduce as many designs as possible after the stimulus is removed from view California verbal learning test The Cali fornia Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) is a neuropsychological test which can be used to assess an individual's verbal memory abilitie s. The tester reads aloud a list, THIS IS A DRAFT PAPER FOR DISCUSSION. IT SHOULD NOT BE QUOTED, CITED OR REPRODUCED 149 Test Description called \"Monday's shopping list\". The list contains sixteen common words, each of which bel ongs to one of four categories: thus, there are four fruits, four herbs and spices, etc. The subject is then asked to recall as many of these items as possible There are several components to this test. First, the tester records how many items the subject remembers over several repeated trials. Additionally, the tester records whether or not the subject is making use of cate gory information. For instance, suppose the four fruit items are Apples, Bananas, Oranges, Cherries, and suppose the subject can only remember Apples, Bananas and Oranges. If the subject cannot remember the fourth item, but guesses that it is another fruit (e.g., Grapes), the tester concludes that the subj ect understood the category information in the list. If the su bject guesses an unrelated word (e.g., Chicken), the tester conc ludes that the subject was not able to understand the category information in the list. Next, the tester may give a second list (\"Tuesday's shopping list\"), and see if the subject is able to keep the items from each list separate, or if the two lists become confused. Finally, there is a short delay of 20 minutes, during which the subject is given other tasks to perform, and then the tester again asks the subject to recall Monday's list. Because it contains so many di fferent components, the CVLT is fairly popular as a neuropsychological test of many aspects of verbal learning and memory Location recognition A different variety of memory test is recognition testing. In recognition testing, the subject views stimuli such as words or pictures or locations THIS IS A DRAFT PAPER FOR DISCUSSION.

Then say the names of three unrelated objects, clear ly and slowly, about one second for each. After you have said all three, ask the patient to repeat them. This first repetition determi nes the patient's score (out of 3) but keep saying them until the patient can repeat all three (up to six trials). If he/she does not eventually learn all three, it is unlikely that recall can be meaningfully tested. Recall is tested after the attention/calculation sect ions of MMSE. Ask the patient if he/she can recall the three words you previously asked him/her to remember. Scor e one for each correct answer Oregon Dual Task a forced-choice m easure of recognition memory Paired associates This challenging test assesses visual memory and new learning, and is a useful tool for assessing individuals with questionable dementia, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's Disease, and age-related memory loss. Boxes are displayed on the screen and are opened in a randomised order. One or more of them will contain a pattern. The patterns are then displayed in the middle of the screen, one at a time, and the participant must touch the box where the pattern was originally located. If the participant makes an error, the patterns are re-presented to remind the participant of their locations. The difficulty level incr eases through the test. In the clinical mode, the number of pa tterns increases from one to eight, which challenges even very able participants Rey complex figure recall See Rey complex figure above Rey auditory verbal learning The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) is an efficient neuropsychological instrument for evaluating episodic THIS IS A DRAFT PAPER FOR DISCUSSION.

Serial word learning is a key part of the Rey auditory verbal learning. The AVLT is a serial word learning task in which 15 words are presented over five learning trials, followed by a second learning list, and then free-recall of the original list of 15 words Story recall A and B The story recall test (SRT) is one of the most reliable neuropsychological assessments for evaluating verbal memory function in order to distinguish between individuals with normal aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The SRT is analogous to the logical memory test in Wechsler Memory Scale-III, The Story Recall Test used to be known as the Auditory Comprehension Test. It consists of 30 short stories, which were recor ded in a professional studio and which are now available in di gital form. The stories can be played via computer speakers or headphones. It is important to use more than one or two stories to get a reliable measure of immediate or delayed story recall. Five stories was found to be the minimum needed for reliability. Those with impaired immediate story recall tend to have unusually large fluctuations from one story to another and it is easy to miss deficits in story recall if only one or two stories are used Subjective memory questionnaire Questionnaire bas ed approach to self a ssessment.
