You may get similar symptoms after other infections, a minor head injury or during the menopause. Brain fog is also common if you have depression, anxiety or stress. While recovering from coronavirus (COVID-19), some people experience brain fog symptoms for a short time while others may experience brain fog for several months or longer. Speak to your GP if you're worried about your symptoms. Symptoms may vary and change over time. It's not just people who were hospitalised with coronavirus who can develop brain fog. It's a common part of long COVID. Anxiety, low mood and fatigue all play a role in affecting how your brain functions.
