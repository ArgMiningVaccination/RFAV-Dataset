While COVID-19 dominated health care headlines this year, our experts were profoundly aware that other health concerns persisted. More than ever before, Scripps physicians, nurses and staff joined together to reimagine care in unimaginable circumstances and were relentless in their pursuit to safely care for our community. In this report, you'll read about some of the innovative ways that Scripps dedicated health care heroes united to show our community that even during some of the most difficult times, we are stronger together. From organizing food drives to support Scripps employees in need to treating patients in our hospitals and providing COVID-19 vaccination clinics throughout San Diego, Scripps has mobilized in many ways to care for the community during the pandemic. LETTER FROM THE CEO The Scripps story began with a strong commitment to the San Diego community . -A commitment that continues today - Our founders, Ellen Browning Scripps and Mother Mary Michael Cummings, were both women ahead of their time. Their commitment to provide for the health care needs of a growing community resulted in the Scripps Health of today. Miss Ellen, as she was known, preferred the term \"investment\" over \"donation\", and her contributions were carefully considered as much for their future promise as for their immediate impact. Decades earlier, Mother Mary Michael's patient logs illustrated her fundamental mission to make quality health care available to all who needed it. Today, more than 16 ,000 employees, physicians and volunteers continue to build on our rich history and keep the spirit of community service alive. The pages that follow provide a comprehensive account of how we achieve that: our community benefit programs and services, and our plans for continued action in the future. In Fiscal Year 2020 Scripps community benefit contributions totaled $431,882,133 This includes $394,126,261 in uncompensated care, $27,934,884 in professional education and health research, $5,933,512 in community health services and $3,680,538 in subsidized healt h, and $206,937 in community building activities . This past year has been unlike any other I've seen in over 20 years at Scripps. With the onset of the COVID -19 pandemic in March 2020, our incredible team of physicians, nurses and staff mobilized to save thousands of lives and care for countless others throughout San Diego. And our community stood beside them, providing critical supplies, equipment and other resources. As we look ahead, we know that we will face new challenges. At Scripps we are continually changing to better meet our patients' needs, improve access in our community, reduce our costs, and simply bring more value to the patients we serve. When Ellen Browning Scripps and Mother Mary Michael Cummings brought qualit y health care to San Diego 100 years ago, they could never have imagined the care we provide today or the more than 700,000 lives we touch each year. As a private, tax -exempt heath care system, Scripps will continue our legacy of making a vital and measurable difference in our community. Chris Van Gorder, FACHE President and CEO MISSION, VISION, AND VALUES MISSION Scripps strives to provide superior health services in a caring environment and to make a positive, measurable difference in the health of individuals in the communities we serve.

Scripps cares for people throughout San Diego with four acute care hospitals on five campuses, 32 outpatient locations, and 16 Scripps HealthExpress sites. Three highly respected graduate medical education programs and two pharmacy resident programs train the next generation of caregivers. Operating revenue: $3.558 billion Operating expenses: Emergency visits: 199,3883 Deepening Our Understanding of COVID-19 with Education and Research From comprehensive patient education and prevention to participation in innovative research, Scripps is committed to keeping the community up to date on the battle against COVID-19. Virtual Town Halls Educate and Inform More than 300 community members registered for a series of three virtual town halls on COVID-19 updates in August, and more continue to view the recordings online. Hosted by Scripps Hub Academic Research Core in partnership with the Scripps Hub Community Advisory Team and the San Diego County COVID-19 Equity Task Force, the events featured local experts covering topics such as local vaccine trials, treatment updates, contact tracing and mental health care resources. These events reached attendees from across the county, including the most vulnerable communities, and provided an opportunity for live questions and answers. Offered in English, Spanish and Tagalog, the town halls were moderated by the San Diego Union-Tribune's biotech reporter. Spreading the Prevention Message in South Bay Scripps Well Being Center partnered with Chula Vista Community Collaborative to train promotoras to disseminate information on preventing the spread of COVID-19 in South Bay communities. The virtual training session was recorded live and available for later viewing. Participants shared information with friends and relatives and through their social media platforms; in total, the training reached more than 1,000 individuals. Following the training, Scripps Family Practice Residency Program offered five virtual Meet the Doc sessions to the community. Nearly 200 participants joined the virtual sessions to learn about COVID-19- related topics from Scripps residents. NIH CEAL Teams Promote Education and Inclusion The NIH launched the Community Engagement Alliance Against COVID-19 Disparities in several states to address communities that have been disproportionately impacted by the virus. The alliance also worked to combat misinformation and myths about COVID-19, treatments and vaccines. As part of the CEAL award to California, the Scripps Hub Academic Research Core team partnered with the San Diego County COVID-19 Equity Task Force to provide outreach events both virtually and at a safely redesigned community health and resource fair. During these events, experts offered resources and assessed COVID-19 knowledge and feelings about research participation. Michael Preziosi, MD, Scripps infectious disease physician, presented during a three-part COVID-19 town hall, made possible by the SHARC Community Advisory Team and members of the San Diego COVID-19 Equity Task Force. 4 Text Education for Hispanics with Diabetes Near the Border Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute received a grant from the National Institutes of Health to improve the health of Hispanics with diabetes in the US/ Mexico-border region \u2014 a group at higher risk of experiencing poor COVID-19 outcomes. The Dulce Digital-COVID Aware Discharge (DD-CA) program, which uses texting to improve communications and provide follow-up care recommendations for recently discharged patients with diabetes, aims to improve glucose control and reduce readmission rates and COVID-19 transmission after patients leave the hospital. DD-CA combines culturally and linguistically relevant diabetes and COVID-19 educational messaging with glucose management support in a low-cost, easily adoptable platform to address specific barriers in underrepresented Hispanic and Latino communities. Convalescent Plasma Therapy Studies During the early period of the pandemic, small studies suggested that patients with COVID-19 could benefit from convalescent plasma \u2014 blood plasma with protective antibodies obtained from patients who have recovered from the virus. The Mayo Clinic is conducting a nationwide convalescent plasma therapy study in which plasma donated by recovered patients was transfused into high-risk or severely ill patients with COVID-19. Another multicenter national study, PassItOn (Passive Immunity Trial for Our Nation), is a randomized study that tests convalescent plasma in hospitalized patients with COVID-19; one group receives the plasma, while a control group receives fluids with vitamins. Scripps Health is participating in both studies. To learn more about these studies, visit www.uscovidplasma.org and passitonstudy.org . The supplemental Dulce Digital-COVID Aware program helps to address barriers in diverse underserved Hispanic and Latino communities to improve glucose control and lower transmission of COVID-19 following hospital discharge. 5 Transportation Service Improves Health Care Access The total cost of missed health care appointments in the United States every year is an astronomical $150 billion. For millions of patients across the country, arranging transportation to a medical appointment presents a challenge. To help address this transportation barrier, in 2019, Scripps entered a partnership with Facilitating Access to Coordinated Transportation (FACT) Inc., a local non-profit organization. FACT provides transportation for San Diego residents in need by coordinating on-demand rides for patients. This collaborative service has quickly proven to be a reliable, convenient, and cost-effective solution to one of the most difficult and expensive challenges in accessing medical care: transportation. In 2019, Scripps and FACT conducted a pilot project, funded partly by a County of San Diego Community Enhancement grant, to offer medical transportation options through a single point of contact. The pilot provided rides for patients, including those who needed specialized vehicles or personal assistance to complete their trip. Scripps staff contacted FACT via telephone number; FACT staff then selected the appropriate vehicle, equipment and personnel to dispatch the ride. Along with providing riders with a more reliable and convenient transportation option, the pilot resulted in time and cost savings. Because of the pilot's success, Scripps and FACT have a new agreement that extends the service to multiple Scripps hospitals. FACT has expanded to help patients get to and from appointments and takes discharged patients home or to other facilities seven days a week, anywhere within San Diego and beyond. \"Our partnership with Scripps Health has created a template for dismantling one of the most challenging barriers to better health care \u2014 the lack of suitable transportation,\" says Arun Prem, FACT executive director. \"Our successful collaboration demonstrates that mobility is an integral part of wellbeing and needs to be incorporated into the continuum of health care services for optimum outcomes.\" FACT vehicles can accommodate riders using a walker, cane, wheelchair or scooter, as well as transport gurneys. Depending on riders' needs, drivers are available to assist patients with getting to and from the vehicle and their facility or residence safely. As of November 2020, the partnership had provided more than 400 rides, and the program is expanding in 2021. After a successful pilot program, Scripps and the FACT program have an agreement to provide patients in need with medical transportation to and from Scripps hospitals. FACT at a Glance: Total trips completed through November 30, 2020: 462 Total trips to Imperial County: 32 Longest trip: 150 miles one way to Bombay Beach Other counties transported to: Ventura, San Bernardino and Orange6 Expanding Graduate Medical Education Programs, Expanding Care Scripps offers a comprehensive range of graduate medical education (GME) programs at Scripps Green Hospital; Scripps Mercy Hospital, San Diego; and Scripps Mercy Hospital, Chula Vista. Well-known for excellence, our GME programs provide a hands-on curriculum focused on patient-centered care. Hospital- based training includes rotations in internal medicine, family medicine, podiatry, pharmacy and palliative care. Throughout their education, students provide much-needed care to underserved populations locally and internationally. In fiscal year 2020, Scripps GME enrolled 160 residents and 46 fellows. New Internal Medicine Residency Program at San Ysidro Health Center In July, six residents joined the new Teaching Health Centers Internal Medicine Residency in affiliation with San Ysidro Health Centers. The program offers broad- based medical education in a diverse community. San Ysidro Health Center has 27 free-standing clinic sites in Medically Underserved Areas (MUAs) that include immigrants and refugees, people who are poor, uninsured and elderly, and those living with HIV/AIDS. Residents will stay in the community and provide continuity of care. Residents also have public health research opportunities in the clinic setting as well as community, hospital or clinic quality improvement projects of their own. Graduate Medical Education Takes Proactive Approach to COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic required significant changes to GME resident education and patient care. Residents continued to care for patients both in-person and via telehealth, and supported the care of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, including in the ICU and labor and delivery. Virtual educational and training conferences, including presentations and town hall-style workshops, addressed coronavirus infection in adults, children and pregnant women, as well as health disparities in relation to the virus. San Diego Border Area Health Education Center, located within Scripps Well Being Center, partnered with the Scripps Family Medicine Residency Program to train residents on public health and community issues, personal protective equipment guidelines, testing options and more. The AHEC team also developed a webinar series shared across California to educate health professions students on COVID-19 long-haulers, mental health and vaccines. Scripps Family Medicine Residency Program continued to provide community-based education for high school students and binational partners using a virtual forum for topics, such as nutrition, reproductive health, substance use and mental health issues. Positive lessons have been learned about adaptation, resilience and finding innovative ways to remain patient-centered during this pandemic. Teaching Health Centers Internal Medicine Residency trainees will stay in the community and provide ongoing continuity of care for underserved patients. rPrIDE Spotlights Diversity To augment traditional medical training, resident leaders developed the \"rPrIDE\" (Residency: Promoting Inclusion, Diversity and Equity) curriculum to focus on health equity and racism in medicine. The workshop series explores historic and current disparities through expert presentations and personal reflection, and complements the established Spanish medical curriculum to improve cultural and linguistic competence.Nikki Hildebrand7 Raising Stroke Awareness and Prevention in the Community Widespread concerns about contracting COVID-19 caused many people to stay away from hospitals and doctors' offices \u2014 even if that meant foregoing potentially lifesaving stroke care. In the early months of the pandemic, as stroke hospitals across the nation reported a decline in admissions, Scripps Stroke Program spearheaded real-time data collection in collaboration with 18 stroke centers in San Diego County. When they found a 30% decline in stroke admissions compared to 2019, Scripps Stroke Program dedicated time and resources to create and disseminate a campaign urging county residents to seek emergency treatment when experiencing symptoms of a stroke, while reassuring them that it was safe to come in for care. Scripps Stroke Program led a collaborative group, including San Diego County EMS, San Diego regional American Heart Association/American Stroke Association, and the San Diego County Stroke Consortium, in creating a united marketing message: \"We are here for you. Every minute matters.\" The social media campaign ran on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn, with a total of 26,727 views. The community collaborative also was submitted for consideration at the 2021 International Stroke Conference. Stroke Team Holds Community Events The Scripps Stroke Team coordinated several stroke awareness and educational events in 2020 at schools, businesses and senior centers. The team shared information about the physiology of stroke, risk factors, prevention, BE-FAST (recognition of stroke and accessing 911), and conducted stroke risk and blood pressure screenings. In February, the team partnered with the American Heart Association for an AT&T Stroke Screening at the AT&T San Diego campus. Team members provided 70 stroke risk and blood pressure screenings to employees, many of whom have stressful jobs in call centers, along with BE-FAST education and tips to maintain healthy blood pressure. Events such as these can significantly impact stroke education and risk among participants. The team plans to hold additional events in 2021. (Top) In February 2020, the Scripps stroke team educated and screened employees at the AT&T stroke screening event. (Above) Scripps stroke team members performed blood pressure screenings for AT&T employees. 8 Helping Keep Seniors on Their Feet According to the National Council on Aging, falls are the leading cause of fatal and nonfatal injuries for older Americans. One in four Americans aged 65+ experience a fall each year; every 11 seconds, an older adult is treated in an emergency department for a fall. Understandably, many older adults have concerns about falling and restrict their activities. Scripps educates older adults countywide on preventing falls through exercise and taking proactive safety measures in the home. \"A Matter of Balance\" is an eight-week program on practical strategies to manage falls, improve safety awareness and utilize available resources to promote independence and overall safety. Scripps physical therapists and physical therapy student volunteers provide fall risk assessments and lead balance classes to help enhance stability, posture and coordination. While COVID-19 restricted access to the program for much of 2020, Scripps was chosen as a pilot site to test a virtual version of the program that will roll out in 2021. Scripps also held free interactive events on fall prevention in September 2019 and January 2020; participants learned about improving balance, flexibility and strength, and received balance and fall risk screening assessments from Scripps physical therapy specialists.Virtual Fall Prevention Events To kick off National Falls Prevention Awareness Week, September 21-25, Scripps hosted a two-hour fall prevention education webinar. \"Standing Strong\" featured a panel of Scripps experts who provided safety tips, exercises and education, as well as a question and answer session. Scripps also partnered with the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency and the San Diego Fall Prevention Task Force to moderate 20 Zoom sessions during National Falls Prevention Awareness Week. The free sessions were open to the public and featured titles including: Fall Prevention 101. Keeping Your Daily Balance. Medication Management in Older Adults. Kitchen Safety in a COVID-19 World. Fall Prevention Screening and Getting Up Safely After a Fall. As part of the National Falls Prevention Awareness Week Scripps Shiley Sports and Fitness Center staff also provided online exercise classes to help attendees improve balance. During a comprehensive fall prevention webinar, a Scripps exercise physiologist offered five exercises for participants to practice daily to improve balance.\u00a9 2021 Scripps Health, (3/21) MCOM-1605Donation Drives Help Brighten the Holidays The holidays inspire many with the spirit of giving, and in a year like no other, generosity was in full force at Scripps throughout the holiday season. One in six people in San Diego County face the threat of hunger every day, and COVID-19 exacerbated food insecurity (currently experiencing or at-risk of experiencing hunger) in San Diego. This year, Scripps employees donated a total of 3,164 pounds of food to the Jacobs & Cushman San Diego Food Bank, which provides emergency food to 370,000 children and families, active-duty military, and fixed income seniors living in poverty; and 510 pounds of food to Feeding San Diego, which collects and distributes donations to local food pantries or others in need. Scripps employees also donated clothing, household necessities and more, including: An estimated total of 100 pairs of shoes and socks to the Alpha Project. Hygiene and snack packs to StandUp For Kids. Toys to the Polinsky Children's Center. Gifts for foster children to PROMISES2KIDS.In addition, Scripps employees \"adopted\" several families in San Diego who are experiencing a tough year. One family, a single mother and her child, are living in a shelter and hiding from her abusive spouse. Another has three children, including a 5-year-old recently diagnosed with cancer. Employees also continued their annual tradition of creating goodie bags for children who come in through the emergency department. Donated items include pencils, stickers, notebooks, craft items and more; staff made more than 200 bags this year.

Scripps employees donated shoes and socks through Alpha Project. Improving the Health of Our Community At Scripps, we put our patients at the center of all that we do. We have joined with our partners throughout the San Diego community with the goal to ensure that everyone has access to lifesaving care. Whether it's a physician visit, a class or a prevention program, Scripps is committed to enhancing access to the care and improving our community's health.2021 COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN AND REPORT TABLE OF CONTENTS Section 1 FULFILLING THE SCRIPPS MISSION ............................... 1 Sec tion 2 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT (CHNA) ......... 6 S ection 3 UNCOMPENSATED HEALTHCARE ................................. 29 S ection 4 COMMUNITY HEALTH SERVICES .................................. 39 S ection 5 PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION & HEALTH RESEARCH ............ 134 S ection 6 SCRIPPS MEMORIAL HOSPITAL LA JOLLA ....................... 151 S ection 7 SCRIPPS MEMORIAL HOSPITAL ENCINITAS ..................... 161 S ection 8 SCRIPPS MERCY HOSPITAL ....................................... 169 S ection 9 SCRIPPS GREEN HOSPITAL ....................................... 198 S ection 10 SCRIPPS WHITTIER DIABETES INSTITUTE ....................... 206 S ection 11 SCRIPPS MEDICAL FOUNDATION ................................. 215 S ection 12 SCRIPPS SYSTEM WIDE PROGRAMS ............................. 221 S ection 13 APPENDICES ......................................................... 247 Fulfilling the Mission 2021 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Re port 1 FULFILLING THE SCRIPPS MISSION This report was developed in response to Senate Bill 697. Passed in 1994, the bill requires California's, not -for-profit hospitals to annually describe and document the full range of community benefits they provide. Scripps has taken this legislative requirement a step further. This report incorporates not only documentation of community benefits , but also a more detailed explanation of the specific community benefit activities provided by our five acute- care hospital campuses, wellness centers and ambulatory care clinics. The report details programs and services that provide community benefits above and beyond standard practices of care. Scripps divides community benefit services into three main categories, community health improvement services, professional education and health research and uncompensated health care. Uncompensated care includes charity care, bad debt, and Medi -Cal and Medicare shortfalls. Community Health Improvement Services Professional Education and Health Research Uncompensated Care The report covers the period of Fiscal Year 2 020 (October 1, 2019 through September 30, 20 20). During this fiscal year, Scripps devoted $431,882,13 3 to community benefit programs and services in the three areas listed above (see F igures 1 .1 and 1. 2). Our programs emphasize community -based prevention efforts and use innovative approaches to reach residents at greatest risk for health problems. Due to rounding, numbers presented throughout this report may not add up precisely to the totals indicated and percentages may not precisely reflect figures for the same reason. The documentation and activities described in this report are commitments we make to improve the health of both our patients and the diverse San Diego communities. As a longstanding member of these communities, and as a not -for-profit community resource, our goal and responsibility are to assist all who come to us for care, and to reach out especially to those who find themselves vulnerable and without support. This responsibility is an intrinsic part of our mission. Through our continued actions and communit y partnerships, we strive to raise the quality of life in the whole community . Definitions of terms used in this report can be found in Appendix A. 2021 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Re port 2 C ommunity benefit is defined as programs or activities that provide treatment of promote health and healing in response to an identified community need. Community benefit programs must meet at least one of the following criteria: Respond to a public health need Responds to needs of special populations Involves education or research that improves overall community health Relieves or reduces the burden of government or other community efforts SCHEDULE H (FORM 990) Hospitals with tax -exempt status are required to provide information specific to their organization on Schedule H, Form 990 (the annual information return filed by tax - exempt organizations.) Schedule H is used by tax -exempt hospitals to report community benefits and it became mandatory beginning with tax year 2009 .1 Scripps has aligned the 202 1 Community Benefit Plan and Report to the Federal Sche dule H categories. According to the IRS, community building activities, bad debt and Medicare shortfalls are reported, but not included in the community benefit totals.

Central, East, North Central, North Coastal, North Inland and South. The demographics of San Diego reflect a diverse population, with considerable variation between the different regions. When possible, data is presented at a regional level to provide more detailed understanding of the population. The geographical regions are represented in Figure 2.1 . FIGURE 2.1. SAN DIEGO COUNTY WITH HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY REGION S 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 7 DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY Current population demographics and changes in demographic composition over time play a defining role in the types of health and social services needed by communities. Population size change in race, ethnicity, and age distribution are all important factor s in understanding communities and their health needs . Further breakdowns in San Diego County demographics are displayed in Table 2.1. San Diego is the second most populous county in California and fifth most populous in the United States. San Diego has: Close to 3.3 million residents Majority minority population Busiest land border crossing in the world - 1 of every 13 people who enter the US come through San Ysidro. 70 miles of coastline 16 naval and military installations 18 federally qualified recognized Indian reservations A total of 4,526 square miles, larger than Rhode Island and Delaware combined P opulation: Over three million people (3,337,685) live in the 4,526 square mile area of San Diego County (SDC) according to the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 2009- 13, 5- year estimates. The population density for this area, estimated at 746 persons per square mile, is greater than the national average population density of approximately 88 persons per square mile. In 2017, the most populous municipality in San Diego was city of San Diego, with a population of 1,390,966. City of San Diego compromised 42.4% of the county's population. Approximately 96.7% of the population lives in an urban area compared to just 3.3% living in rural areas. Population Change: According to the U.S. Census Bureau Decennial Census, between 2000 and 2010 the population in San Diego County (SDC) grew by 281,480 persons, a change of 10.0%. This is similar ly to the percentage population change seen during the same time -period in California (10.0%) and the United States (9.7%). A significant shift in total population over time impacts the demand for health care providers and the utilization of community resources. Race/Ethnicity: In the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 2009- 2013, data for race and ethnicity are collected separately. Of those who identified as non- Hispanic (67.7%) in SDC, the majority identified their race as white (70.9%), followed by Asian (16.1%), black (7.1%), Multiple Races (4.5%), Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 8 (0.6%), and American Indian/Alaskan Native (0.5%). Of those who identified as Hispanic or Latino (32.4%) in SDC, the majority also identified their race as white (72.4%), followed by other (19.9%), Multiple Races (5.1%), American Indian/Alaskan Native (1.1%), (0.6%), and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (0.1%). Age: The median age for San Diego County is 35.4 years. The distribution of the population by age shows that 22.2% of the population is under the age of 18, 64.9% is between the ages of 18 and 64, and 12.9% is 65 years old or greater ( Figure 2.2).

Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) originated from California statewide legislation in the early 1990s. SB 697 took effect in 1995, which required private not -for-profit hospitals to submit detailed information to the Office of Statewide Health Planning and D evelopment (OSHPD) on their community benefit contributions. Annual hospital community benefit reports are summarized by OSHPD in a Report to the Legislature, which provides valuable information for government officials to assess the care and services provided to their constituents. The SB 697 requirement was supplemented in 2010 by requirements in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or ACA that not -for-profit hospitals conduct community health needs assessments with community stake holders to determine significant health needs of the community they serve and i mplementation strategies to help meet those needs. Additional information on the ACA requirements for not -for-profit hospitals can be found at http://www.irs.gov , keyword: \"Charitable Organizations.\" For more detailed information on the CHNA regulatory requirements and Implementation Strategy see Appendix E . As part of the federal reporting requirement for private, not -for-profit (tax exempt) hospitals, Scripps conducts a consolidated Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) and corresponding joint Implementations strategy for its licensed hospital facilities every three years. This comprehensive account of health needs in the community is designed for hospitals to plan their community benefit programs together with other local health care institutions, community -based organizations and consumer groups. The 2019 Scripps Health Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) is designed to provide a deeper understanding of barriers to health improvement in San Diego County. The report will help us understand our community's health needs and inform community benefit planning and the i mplementation strategy for Scripps Health. In addition, the assessment allows interested parties and members of the community a mechanism to access the full spectrum of information relative to the development of the Scripps Health 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment Report. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 14 Scripps st rives t o improve community he alth through collaboration.

Participating hos pitals use the findings to gui de their co mmunity pr ograms and m eet IRS r egulatory r equirements. Per legislation hospitals conduct a healt h needs a ssessment i n the community onc e every three years. The 2019 S cripps H ealth Community Health Needs Assessment ( CHNA) i s desi gned to provi de a deeper un derstanding of bar riers t o heal th improvement i n San Diego County and buil d on the results of t he 2016 CHNA . It includes three types o f community engagement efforts: focus groups with residents, community- based organizations, service providers, and health care leaders; key informant i nterviews with health care experts; and an onli ne survey f or residents and stakeholders. In addition, t he CHNA includes extensive quantitative an alysis of national a nd state- wide d ata sets, San Diego County emergency department an d inpatient hospital di scharge data, co unty mortality and morbidity d ata, an d data related t o social det erminants of h ealth. T hese two different a pproaches allowed the CHNA Committee to vi ew co mmunity heal th needs from m ultiple perspectives. Participating hospitals use this i nformation t o inform and gui de hospital pr ograms and strategies. The report includes an analysis of health outcomes and associated social determinants of health which cr eate health inequities\u2014\" the unfair and avoidable 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 15 differences in health status\" seen within and between countries6 and communities with the understanding that t he burde n of i llness, prematur e death, and disability disproportionally affects racial and minority population groups and other underserved populations7. Understanding regional and population-s pecific differences is an important st ep to understanding and ultimately strategizing ways to make collective impact. These new insights allow participating hospitals to identify effective strategies to address the most prevalent and challenging health needs in the community. 2019 CHNA OBJECT IVES The objective s of t he 2019 CHNA were: Ident ify and prioritize the most critical health- related needs in San Diego County based on feedback from community residents in high need neighborhoods who face inequities. Provide a deeper understanding of barriers to health improvement in San Diego County, as well as inform and guide local hospitals in the development of their programs and strategies that address identified community health needs. Build on and strengthen community partnerships established through the previous CHNA process. OVERVIEW AND BACKGROUND HASD&IC contracted with the Institute for Public Health (IPH) at San Diego State University (SDSU) to provide assistance with the collaborative health needs assessment that was officially called the HASD&IC 201 9 Community Health Needs Assessment (201 9 CHNA). The 2019 CHNA was implemented and managed by a standing CHNA Committee comprised of representatives from seven hospitals and health systems: Kaiser Foundation Hospital - San Diego Palomar Health Rady Children's Hospital - San Diego Scripps Health Sharp HealthCare Tri-C ity Medical Center 6 World Health Organization.

Throughout the process, the IPH met bi -weekly with the HASD&IC CHNA committee to analyze, refine, and interpret results as they were being collected. The results of the 201 9 CHNA are used to inform and adapt hospital programs and strategies to better meeting the health needs of San Diego County residents. COMMUNITY PRIORITY PROCESS (CHNA METHODOLOGY ) For the 2019 CHNA quantitative analyses of publicly available data provided an overview of critical health issues across San Diego County, while qualitative analyses of feedback from the community provided an appreciation for the experiences and needs of San Diegans. The CHNA Committee reviewed these analyses and applied a pre-determined set of criteria to them to prioritize the top health needs in San Diego County. This process is represented in F igure 2.5. For a complete description of the HASD&IC 2019 process and findings, see full report available at https://www.hasdic.org/2019- chna . 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 17 FIGURE 2.5. 2019 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS MAP 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 18 QUANTITATIVE Quantitative data were drawn from several public sources. Data from Dignity Health/Truven Health Community Needs Index (CNI) and the Public Health Alliance of Southern California's Healthy Places Index (HPI) were used to identify geographic communities in San Diego County that were more likely to be experiencing health inequities, which guided the selection of communities for the engagement and the development of engagement questions. Hospital discharge data exported from SpeedTrack 's California Universal Patient Information Discovery, or CUPID application were used to identify current and three- year trends in primary diagnosis discharge categories and were stratified by age and race. This allowed for the identification of health disparities and the conditions having the greatest impact on hospitals and health systems in San Diego County. Data from national and state- wide data sets were analyzed including San Diego County mortality and morbidity data, and data related to social determinants of health. In addition, Kaiser Permanente consolidated data from several national and state- wide data sets related to a variety of health conditions and social determinants of health in San Diego County and conducted a comprehensive statistical analysis to identify whic h social determinants of health were most predictive of negative health outcomes. Kaiser Permanente then created a, web- based data platform (chna.org/kp) to post these analyses for use in the CHNA. These analyses guided the design of the online survey, interview, and focus group questions. QUALITATIVE - COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT Community engagement activities included focus groups, key informant interviews, and an online survey which targeted stakeholders from every region of San Diego County, all age groups, and numerous racial and ethnic groups. Collaboration with the County of San Diego Health & Human Services Agency, Public Health Services was vital to this process. A total of 579 individuals participated in the 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment: 138 community residents and 441 leaders and experts. Please see F igure 2.6 below for details on the types of participants engaged. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 19 FIGURE 2.6. 2019 CHNA COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PARTICIPANTS 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 20 2019 CHNA PRIORITIZATION OF THE TOP HEALTH NEEDS The CHNA Committee collectively reviewed the quantitative and qualitative data and findings. Several criteria were applied to the data to determine which health conditions were of the highest priority in San Diego County. These criteria included: the severity of the need, the magnitude/scale of the need; disparities or inequities and change over time. Those health conditions and social determinants of health (SDOH) that met the largest number of criteria were then selected as top priority community health needs. 2019 FINDINGS : TOP 10 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS The CHNA Committee identified the following as the highest priority community health needs in San Diego County (in alphabetical order by SDOH or health condition). FIGURE 2.7. 2019 TOP 10 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS Figure 2.7 illustrates the interactive nature of SDOH and health conditions -each impacting the other. In addition, an underlying theme of stigma and the barriers it creates arose across community engagement. For instance, stigma impacts the way in which people acces s needed services that address SDOH, which consequentially impacts their ability to maintain and manage health conditions. Due to the complexity of this underlying theme, the CHNA Committee plans to explore and understand ways in which hospitals and health systems could better address stigma in patient care during Phase 2 of the CHNA process. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 21 Access to health care. Overcoming barriers to health care, such as lack of health insurance and insurance issues, economic insecurity, transportation, the shortage of culturally competent care, fears about immigration status, and the shortage of health care providers emerged as a high priority community need. In addition, specific services were identified as challenging to obtain, including behavioral health care, dental care, primary care, and specialty care. Aging concerns . Conditions that predominantly affect people who are 65 and older such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's, dementia, falls, and limited mobility were identified as a high priority health need. Community engagement participants m ost often described aging concerns in relation to the social determinants of health, including transportation, access to fresh food, social isolation and inadequate family support, and economic insecurity. Behavioral health. Greater access to behavioral health care was cited as a priority health need. Three types of behavioral health care were identified as challenging to access: urgent care services for crisis situations; inpatient psychiatric beds and subs tance abuse facilities; and transitional programs and services for post -acute care. In addition, several barriers to behavioral health care were named as priorities to address, including a lack of availability of needed services and appointments, insurance issues, logistical issues, such as transportation and time off work, and the inability to pay co -pays and deductibles. Cancer . Health needs related to cancer were described in relation to the effects on well-being beyond physical health. These include financial, practical, and emotional impacts on individuals and families; these effects are exacerbated by barriers to cancer care. Chronic conditions . Three chronic conditions were identified as priorities: cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. Key factors that individuals struggle with to prevent chronic diseases include access to fresh, health foods and safe places to exercise and play. In addition, economic issues, transportation to medical care, fears about immigration status, and a lack of knowledge about chronic conditions were named as particular challenges related to the management of chronic conditions. Community and social support. A high priority for the well -being of San Diego residents is ensuring that individuals have adequate resources and substantial support within their neighborhood. Valuable neighborhood resources include federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) and those that are culturally and linguistically competent. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 22 Without adequate support from others, community engagement and community spirit are affected. Economic security. Economic security was named as vitally important to the well - being of San Diego residents and was described as impacting every aspect of residents' daily life. The health of those who are economically insecure is negatively affected by food insecurity, chronic stress and anxiety, and the lack of time and money to take care of health needs. In San Diego County, 13.3% of residents have incomes below the federal poverty level and 15% experience food insecurity. Those who are economically insecure are at greater risk of poor mental health days, as well as, asthma, obesity, diabetes, stroke, cancer, smoking, pedestrian injury and visits to the emergency department for heart attacks. Factors identified as contr ibuting to economic insecurity include housing and childcare costs as well as low wages. Education . Receiving a high school diploma, having the opportunity to pursue higher or vocational education, being health literate, and having opportunities for non- academic continuing education were identified as important priorities for the health and well -being of San Diego residents. Family stress and a lack of school and community resources were identified as factors underlying low levels of educational attainment. Homelessness and housing instability . Homelessness and housing instability were named as important factors affecting the health of San Diego County residents. They were described as having serious health impacts, such as increasing exposure to infectious disease, creating substantial challenges in the management of chronic diseases and wound care, and increasing stress and anxiety. Poor housing conditions were also cited as impactful of physical and mental health; crowded housing leads to the spread of illness, and environmental hazards can exacerbate conditions like asthma. Unintentional injury and violence. Exposure to violence and neighborhood safety were cited as priority health needs for San Diegans. Neighborhood safety was discussed as influencing residents' ability to maintain good health, while exposure to violence was described as traumatic and impactful on mental health. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 23 COMMUNITY RESOURCES The 2019 CHNA identified many health resources in San Diego County, including those provided by community -based organizations, government departments and agencies, hospital and clinic partners, and other community members and organizations engaged in addressing many of the health needs identified by this assessment. In addition, 2-1- 1 San Diego is an important community resource and information hub that facilitates access to services. Through its 24/7 phone service and online database, 2-1- 1 San Diego helps connect individuals with community, health, and disaster services. In addition to community input on health conditions and social determinants of health, a wealth of ideas emerged from community engagement participants about how hospitals and health systems could support, expand, or create additional resources and partner with organizations to better meet San Diego's community health needs. Please see Figure 2. 8 for the types of resources that were identified by community engagement participants . NEXT STEPS The 2019 CHNA is utilized by Scripps Health and participating hospitals and health systems to e valuate opportunities for next steps to address the top identified health and social needs in their respective patient communities. In addition, the CHNA report is made available to the broader community and is intended to be a useful resource to both residents and health care providers to further communitywide heal th access and health improvement efforts. Scripps is currently working with the Hospital Association of San Diego and Imperial Counties (HASD&IC) and the Community Health Needs Assessment Committee to build a strategic framework to plan and implement the 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA). The CHNA Committee is re -envisioning how best to work collaboratively in a virtual environment and continuing to look at health and social needs from a health equity lens. The 2022 CHNA is expected to be finalized in the fall of 2022. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 24 FIGURE 2.8. RESOURCES & OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS PRIORITY HEALTH NEEDS 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 25 HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION OF SAN DIEGO AND IMPERIAL COUNTIES ; 2019 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT PHASE TWO BACKGROUND & INTRODUCTION In July 2019, the Hospital Association of San Diego and Imperial Counties (HASD&IC) completed the triennial collaborate community health needs assessment (CHNA) to identify and prioritize the health needs of San Diego County residents, particularly those who experience health inequities. The CHNA is managed by a standing CHNA Committee comprised of representatives from hospitals, and health systems and health districts. HASD&IC contracted with the Institute of Public Health (IPH) at San Diego State Universi ty (SDSU) to conduct the needs assessment. The CHNA Committee worked with IPH to distribute a follow- up survey to gather feedback on the 2019 CHNA findings through a Phase 2 Survey . The survey sought to further explore frequently recurring themes that emerged during community discussions in the 2019 CHNA , including: access to care, stigma, immigration, and public charge. Note: The Phase 2 Survey was developed and disseminated prior to the COVID -19 pandemic taking hold in the San Diego region. The CHNA Committee recognizes that communities facing inequities are dealing with unprecedented challenges and the devastating increase in needs is not captured in these findings. SURVEY PARTICIPANTS & RESULTS 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 26 Nearly 92% of respondents (114 out of 124 respondents) agreed or strongly agreed that the health needs identified in the 2019 CHNA represent the top health needs of communities facing inequities within San Diego County . Most survey respondents were from community -based organizations (39.5%), followed by hospitals/health systems (16.1%) and community residents (11.3%). A total of 105 survey participants responded to the question about where they live or work. Overall, 37.4% of survey respondents served all regions of San Diego County and 26.8% lived in or work at North Inland.

The Implementation Plan tr anslates the research and analysis presented in the Assessment into actual, measurable strategies and objectives that can be carried out to improve community health outcomes. Scripps Health anticipates the implementation strategies may evolve due to the fast pace at which community and health care industry change. Therefore, a flexible approach is best suited for the development of its response to the Scripps Health Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA). On an annual basis Scripps Health evaluates the implementation strategy and its resources and interventions; and makes adjustments as needed to achieve its stated goals and outcome measures as well as to adapt to changes and resources available. Scripps describes any challenges encountered to achieve the outcomes and makes modifications as needed. In addition, Scripps Health Implementation Plan is filed with the Internal Revenue Service using Form 990 Schedule H on an annual basis. Scripps Health is focusing on the strategies and initiatives, their measures of implementation and the metrics used to evaluate their effectiveness. Scripps will monitor and evaluate the strategies listed in the Implementation Plan for the purpose of tracking the implementation of those strategies as well as t o document the anticipated impact. Plans to monitor will be tailored to each strategy and will include the collection and documentation of tracking measures. The complete FY20-FY22 Implementation Plan Report is available online at Scripps.org. Uncompensated Care 2021 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 29UNCOMPENSATED HEALTH CARE Scripps contributes significant resources to provide low and no- cost health care for our patients in need. During Fiscal Year 20 20, Scripps contributed $ 394,126,261 in uncompensated health care, including $18,335,775 in charity care, $ 361,998,200 in Medi - Cal and Medicare shortfall, and $13,792,287 in bad debt . The health care safety net in San Diego County is highly dependent upon hospitals and community health clinics to care for uninsured and medically underserved communities. Finding more effective ways to coordinate and enhance the safety net is a critical policy challenge. While public subsidies help finance services for San Diego County's underinsured populations, these subsidies do not cover the full cost of care. Combined with Medi -Cal and Medicare funding shortfalls, Scripps and other local hospitals absorb the cost of caring for uninsured /underinsured patients in their operating budgets. This places a significant financial burden on hospitals and physicians. Scripps Mercy Hospital (including San Diego and Chula Vista campuses) provides 56 percent of the charity care within the Scripps system (refer to figure 3.3). Scripps Mercy's service area has a more economically disadvantaged population compared to the county as a whole, with the lowest numbers of insured adults in the county and a much higher percentage of ethnic minorities, primarily Hispanic and Asian. Scripps Mercy Hospital San Diego and Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista campuses are designated by the government as Disproportionate Share Hospitals, in reflection of the diversity of the population they serve. Both hospital campuses play important health care service roles in the Central/Southern San Diego County service area (ranging from Interstate 8 to the United States -Mexico border). More than half of Scripps Mercy San Diego and Chula Vista patients are government insured Medicare and Medi -Cal. SCRIPPS UNCOMPENSATED HEALTH CARE Bad Debt $13,792,287 Charity Care $18,335,775 Medi -Cal & Medicare Shortfall $361,998,200 Uncompensated Health Care Total $394,126,261 2021 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 30FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ASSISTING LOW-INCOME , UNINSURED PATIENTS The Scripps financial assistance policy is consistent with the language of both State (AB774) California Hospital Fair Pricing legislation and the Internal revenue Code (IRC) 501(r) Regulations. These practices reflect our commitment to assisting low -income and uninsured patients with discounted hospital charges, charity care and flexible billing and debt collection practices. These programs are available to everyone in need, regardless of their race, ethnicity, gender, religion or national origin. Scripps makes every effort to identify patients who may benefit from financial assistance as soon as possible and provide counseling and language interpretation. Additionally , Scripps does not apply wage garnishment or liens on primary residences as a way of collecting unpaid hospital bills. Eligibility for financial assistance is based on family income and expenses. For low - income, uninsured patients who earn less than twice the federal poverty level (FPL), Scripps forgives the entire bill. For those patients who earn between two and four times the FPL, a portion of the bill is forgiven. Patients who qualify for financial assistance are not charged more than Scripps discounted financial assistance amount. For 20 21, the Department of Health and Human Services defined a family of four at 200 percent federal poverty level as $53,000 . PUBLIC RESOURCE SPECIALIST TEAM The Public Resource Specialists (P RS) are experienced staff with strong knowledge of county programs. PRS screen all uninsured and underinsured patients who have received services at any of the five Scripps hospital facilities. They offer support to patients and provide guidance on available funding options for county, state, and federal programs. The PRS team is responsible for submitting and monitoring all applications and following up with appeals . In addition, they serve as a technical resource to case management, social work, and other hospital staff when patient funding impacts discharge planning and level of care transfers. The PRS team serve s hospital patients by offering immediate temporary coverage through the Presumpt ive Eligibility programs (PE), COVID -19 Uninsured Group and submitting Insurance A ffordability Applications to the county for processing of ongoing benefits. Other services offered are assistance with initiating applications with DMV, VA, EDD , Social Secur ity and Medi -Cal for Cal- Fresh enrollment. In Fiscal Y ear 2020, the PRS team successfully submitted and pursued 4, 076 applications with a 77% a pproval rating. 2021 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 31E stimated Economic Value of Community Benefits Provided by Scripps Health in Fiscal Year 2020 CA Senate Bill (SB) 697 Categories Community Benefit Programs & Services Net Benefit Medical Care Services Charity Care $ 18,335,775 Medi -Cal & Other Government Means Tested Programs (Shortfall) * $ 68,332,685 Medicare & Medicare HMO (Shortfall) ** $ 293,665,515 Bad Debt $ 13,792,287 Total Costs of Uncompensated Care $ 394,126,26 1 Benefits for Vulnerable Population Definition: Any population that is expose d to medical or financial risk, by virtue of being uninsured, underinsured, or eligible for Medi- Cal, Medicare, California Children's Service Program, or county indigent programs.

Through a prioritization process described in Section 2 , Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA), the following health conditions and social determinants of health (SDOH) were identified as the most critical health and social needs within San Diego County ( listed below in alphabetical order) : Access to Health Care Community and Social Support Aging Concerns Economic Security Behavioral Health Education Cancer Chronic ConditionsHomelessness and Housing Instability Unintentional Injury and Violence FIGURE 4.1. 2019 CHNA TOP HEALTH NEEDS T he figure above illustrate s the interactive nature of the SDOH and health conditions \u2014 each impacting the other. In addition, an underlying theme of stigma and the barriers it creates arose across community engagement. For instance, stigma impacts the way in which people access needed services that address SDOH (CalFresh, Medi -Cal, other economic support), which consequentially impacts their ability to maintain and manage health conditions. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 40 Stigma was also discussed in relation t o specific heal th conditions, i ncluding be havioral health, ca ncer, diabetes, obesity a nd others.

To access care, people need health insurance coverage and a consistent source of care that provides evidence -based, culturally competent preventive and emergency medical services in a timely manner. A lack of health insurance coverage represents a major barrier to health care services. In San Diego County, 1 2% of people are uninsured. Certain groups, including those who identify as 14 County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA), Public Health Services, Community Health Statistics Unit, 2018 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 42 County, 12% of people ar e uninsured.

Types of care that are difficult to access2. Barriers to accessing care & associated SDOH Behavioral Health Care Culturally competent care Dental Care Economic security Primary Care Fear related to immigration status Specialty Care Lack of health insurance & insurance issues Shortage of health care providers Transportation A l ack of health insurance is a predictor of many health conditions, including more poor mental health days, more visits to the ED for heart attacks, a higher prevalence of asthma, and obesity, more low birth weight babies, and higher prevalence of smoking. Reduced access to basic health care services increases illness, injury and mortality an d is a major burden on hospitals and health providers, who must provide uncompensated care for the uninsured. Access to health care emerged as a high priority health need in both the secondary data analyses and community engagement events in the 2019 Scripps Community Health Needs Assessment. Through the community engagement conducted we heard from the community that even when insurance is secured, lack of transportation (especially for seniors ) and lack of culturally and linguistically competent care are main barriers. In an effort to provide for people in need, Scripps sponsored a number of programs and activities in Fiscal Year 20 20. SCRIPPS RECUPERATIVE CARE PROGRAM S (RCU) The Scripps/City of Refuge Recuperative Care Shelter (RCS) Project provides a safe discharge for chronically homeless patients with ongoing medical needs. All patients are unfunded or underfunded. Most have substance abuse and/or mental health issues. 15 U.S. Census Bureau. American Community Survey, 2013 -2017, 1-Year Estimates. Includes civilian non- institutionalized population ages 18- year 2017 includes ages 19- 64 years . 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 43 Lack of funding, mental illness, as well as alcohol and/or substance abuse, makes post - acute placement of these homeless patients difficult. The Case Management and Social Work departments assist with a needed supply of medication, appointments, Durable Medical Equipment (DME), setting up Home Health Services if needed, and connects patients to psych as part of the hospital discharge plan to City of Refuge. City of Refuge further supports clients in meeting these goals using community resources to meet individual social service needs. Scripps pays the City of Refuge a daily rate for housing and services they provide to the patients. The City of Refuge provides a safe, secure environment, with 24 hour supervision, medication oversight, meals , clothing, case management, assistance with Medi -Cal, with transition to Managed Medi -Cal and disability applications, referrals to rehab and other programs, and help finding permanent or transitional housing using county resources. DME and other needed services are provided by Scripps when funding is not available. All patients are connected to a medical home, and primary care in the community. Patients with psych disorders are established with a psychiatrist in the community if they are willing. Patient transportation needs are coordinated by City of Refuge, but may include insurance funded transport services, and occasionally Scripps Shuttle, or use of taxi voucher. The City of Refuge began taking patients routinely in October of 2019. This year 44 patie nts so far have met the need for RCS admission. As a group, the RCS patients had a cumulative of 626 hospital days of stay, an average of 12.6 hospital days of stay, before going to RCS October 2019 to date. The RCS has taken medically complex patients, i ncluding those with: IV antibiotics, wound vacs, skin grafts, fractures, abscesses, osteomyelitis, amputation, dog bites, DKA, GI bleeds, pancreatitis, ESRD on dialysis, end stage liver disease, diabetes, mild encephalopathy, ostomies, MVA, pedestrian cancer), HIV/Aids, sepsis, respiratory failure, pneumonia, CHF. Patients were assault victims with gunshot and stab wounds, facial trauma, and surgical post op patients and m any are diabetic. Psych problems are common and occasionally the main issue for RCS clients. Over 85% of this group were either positive for alcohol, drugs or drug screen or had a drug history addressed by the physician in the H & P. More specifically, 30% of RCS clients had used opiates, heroin, or meth. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 44 The following are outcome metrics tracked by Scripps for the City of Refuge program. For FY20 total cost savings for Scripps was $795,491. Of Recuperative Care Shelter patients, 27% had standard Medi insurance, Medi- Cal, 41% Medi -Cal HMO' s and of the managed care plans, Molina Medi -Cal was the highest utilizer. Approximately 30% of patients sought to secure income from government programs, social security, and CA short term disability ; six total clients applied or received income benefits. Four have applied and received Medi -Cal HMO's while at the RCS with the assistance of their case management department. The program assist ed Scripps MD Anderson Cancer Center patients. RCS assisted two patients in maintaining their health and transitioned them into independent living homes for additional care. Eight percent of patients were connected to a primary care provider or had established care at one of the community clinics. Ten percent of the patients admitted to RCS were established with ongoing Oncology care and treatment. Ten percent did not complete the PCP appointment, yet several patients were introduced to FHC mental health services. Following the ir stay at City of Refuge : 50% did not return to the streets , 5% went back to the hospital as they needed further treatment . GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION STAFF SUPPORT , ST. LEO'S CLINIC The Graduate Medical Education (GME) program at Scripps Green Hospital and Scripps Clinic focuses on physician training and clinical research, 47 residents and 46 fellows. GME residents and many attending physicians maintain an evening c linic at St. Leo's Mission Community Clinic in North County (this initiative was put on hold in March due to the Pandemic) . Two residents volunteer every Wednesday to provide medical care to uninsured patients with a variety of conditions, including diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. They also identify many acute conditions, including viral infections, skin i nfections, eye problems and musculoskeletal issues, and educate patients about their health. Patients may get flu vaccinations and some basic lab tests. If needed, St. Leo's patients are referred to providers who provide care at a reduced cost. MIGRANT SHELTER CLINIC In response to the urgent need for physician volunteers to help screen migrants seeking asylum in the US, multiple GME residents volunteered for a refugee health assessment 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 45 program at a South Bay shelter. Medical interpreters on site helped residents communicate with migrants and facilitate the screenings. Scripps residents screened approximately 150+ patients from January -March of 2020. FIJI SOLOMON ISLANDS MEDICAL MISSION The medical mission consists of Scripps Health general medical specialists and residents setting up clinics on rural islands for the purpose of providing much needed medical care, medical supplies and surgical screening for an underserved population that have no access to basic medical care. The International Medical Missions provide an exceptional clinical education experience to our senior Internal Medicine residents at Scripps Clinic and Scripps Green Hospital. The 2020 mission brought our residents to the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific, where the ratio of doctors to population is 1:20,000. The Loloma Foundation provides medical care to these islanders in association with Scripps Health. Residents experienced the challenges of providing care in Third World conditions, without technology, and using only their excellent academic and practical training to diagnose and treat patients. Islanders with serious medical conditions are referred to the nearest hospital, which is several hours away by boat and car. Total of patients served in the January 2020 mission was 700. MERCY OUTREACH SURGICAL TEAM PROVIDES LIFE-CHANGING CARE TO CHILDREN IN MEXICO For three decades, the Mercy Outreach Surgical Team (M.O.S.T) has been crossing borders and changing lives. Working in Mexico, the Mercy Outreach Surgical Team provides reconstructive surgeries for children suffering from birth defects or accidents. In special circumstances, surgeries are also provided for adults. During F iscal Year 2020, the M.O.S.T team served in one outreach mission trip as the second one was cancelled due to the Pandemic. The team volunteered over 776 hours to provide reconstructive surgeries for more than 262 people and 40 pairs of eyeglasses were distributed. SCRIPPS -SPONSORED AMERICAN RED CROSS BLOOD DRIVES Scripps Health partnered with the American Red Cross in F iscal Year 2020 to host 13 blood drives ; 331 Scripps employees donated blood throughout the year. Scripps Health collected 353 pints of blood (for every pint donated 3 lives are saved), which saved approximately 1,062 lives. Scripps promoted the blood drives through our system wide communication channels and our Wellness All Around You C ampaign. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 46 SCRIPPS HEALTH COMMUNITY BENEFIT (CB) FUND In Fiscal Year 2020 , Scripps Health continued to deepen its commitment to philanthropy with its Community Benefit Fund. Over the course of the year, it awarded $ 141,000 in community grants to programs in San Diego (four grants ranging from $10,000 to $120,000). The funded projects address some of San Diego County's high priority health needs, seeking to improve access to vital health care services for at risk populations, including the homeless, economically disadvantaged, mentally ill and others. Since the Community Benefit Fund began, Scripps has awarded $ 4.1 million. Programs funded during F iscal Year 20 20 include d: CONSUMER CENTER FOR HEALTH EDUCATION AND ADVOCACY (CCHEA) Funding provides low income, uninsured and behavioral health patients help obtaining health care benefits, SSI and related services, while reducing uncompensated care expenses at Mercy. This Medical Legal Partnership p laces Consumer Center staff onsite at Scripps Mercy Hospital within the Behavioral Health Unit and provides accessible legal assistance, in addition to receiving direct referrals from other Scripps facilities. The project provides advocacy services for time intensive government benefit cases and the Consumer Center stresses the importance of accessing community - based services for routine health care instead of using the ED's and hospital departments as well as the importance of establishing medical homes. C ATHOLIC CHARITIES Funding provides short term emergency shelter for medically fragile homeless patients upon discharge from Scripps Mercy Hospital, San Diego and Chula Vista. Case Management and shelter are provided for homeless patients discharged from Sc ripps Mercy Hospital. While these patients no longer require hospital care, they do need a short -term recuperative environment. Patients who demonstrate a willingness to change receive one week in a hotel, along with food and bus fare to pursue a case plan. The focus of the case management is to stabilize the client by helping them connect to more permanent sources of income, housing and other self -reliance measures. The partnership seeks to reduce emergency room recidivism in this population and improve their quality of life. 2-1-1 COMMUNITY INFORMATION EXCHANGE 2-1-1 S an Diego serves all of San Diego County, including the population served by Scripps, as the region's trusted primary connection to more than 6,000 community,health and disaster services in more than 200 languages, 24 hours a day.2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 47 In addition, 2-1- 1 San Diego operates a 2-1- 1 information hotline (Call Center) in the San Diego and Imperial County. Call Center services are designed to help members of the public (\"Clients\") to connect with community resources to assist Clients obtain medical care, mental health services, housing, food, clothing, government benefits, among other things. 2-1- 1 San Diego has expanded its referral services to include direct referral to Clients to community resources and access to the Community Information Exchange (CIE) Database. The CIE is an ecosystem comprised of multidisciplinary network partners that use a shared language, a resource database, and an integrated technology platfor m to deliver enhanced community care planning. Care planning tools enable partners to integrate data from multiple sources and make bi -directional referrals to create a shared longitudinal record. By focusing on these core components, a CIE enables communities to shift away from a reactive approach to providing care toward proactive, holistic, person- centered care. The CIE database serves as a directory of participating professionals, agencies and businesses providing services that relate to the social determinants of health. The database also serves as a source of information about the Client's social determinants of health and current needs and is used to help the Client access community resources suitable to address those needs. 2-1-1 San Diego has partnered with Scripps since 2011 to provide care coordination services to clients in need of health navigation support. In F iscal Year 2020 funding was awarded to 2-1- 1 San Diego to pilot the C IE at the Scripps Mercy Hospital location. This project specifically served Scripps Mercy Hospital patients, focusing on homeless and housing insecure individuals and to assist in hospital discharge planning. C OMMUNITY INFORMATION EXCHANGE CIE 2020 SUMMIT Scripps also sponsored the Community Information Exchange (CIE) Summ it. The 2020 Summit was held virtually due to the impact of COVID -19. Core to the theme of the CIE Summit, this year's virtual event: Hosted open discussions on impact of inequity and how to lead with inclusion. Explored community -based approaches for building a CIE. Incorporated thoughtful strategies for activating community voice. Emphasized representation of diverse perspectives of inform CIE design, implementation and data collection.2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 48 CANCER/ONCOLOGY Cancer is a term used to describe a group of diseases that cause the uncontrolled growth, invasion, and spread (metastasis) of abnormal cells. Cancer is caused by external factors such as environmental conditions, radiation, infectious organisms, poor diet and lack of exercise, and tobacco use, as well as internal factors such as genetic mutations, and hormones. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States. Cancer causes one out of every four deaths in the United States. According to the American Cancer Society, cancer survival is more likely to be successful if the cancer is diagnosed at an early stage. Such diagnosis is an indication of screening and early detection. Regular screening that allow for the early detection and removal of precancerous growths are known to reduce mortality for cancers of the cervix, colon and rectum. Five -year relative survival rates for common cancers, such as breast, prostate, colon and rectum, cervix, and melanoma of the skin, are 93 percent to 100 perce nt if they are discovered before having spread beyond the organ where the cancer began. In 2021 there will be an estimated 187,140 new cancer cases and 61,860 cancer deaths, an incidence rate of 404.6 average annual rate per 100,000 and a death rate of 140.3 average annual rate per 100,000 in California. The United States has one of the highest rates of COVID -19 infection in the world, and as of mid- November 2020, 240,000 Americans had died from the disease. COVID -19 deaths account for two -thirds of the excess deaths in the US from March through July 2020. Increased deaths from other causes are partly due to misclassification of deaths from COVID -19, but also because of disruptions in care. Additional excess mortality from other illnesses will likely be pr otracted. For example, cancer deaths dipped during the early months of the pandemic but will likely rebound in higher numbers than expected in the months and years to come because of delays in diagnosis and treatment. The impact of COVID -19 on cancer diagn oses and outcomes at the population level will be unknown for several years because of the time necessary for data collection, compilation, quality control, and dissemination. A summary of the magnitude and prevalence of cancer is described below: The HASD&IC 2019 CHNA continued to identify Cancer disease as one of the t op priority health conditions among San Diego County hospitals. In 2018, cancer was the leading cause of death in San Diego County, responsibl e for 23.1 percent of all underlying causes of death.16 16County of San Diego HHSA, Public Health Services, Community Epidemiology Branch. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 49 In 2018, there were 4,988 deaths due to cancer (all s ites), and an age adjusted death rate of 132.18 deaths per 100,000 population.17 According to findings from the ACS 2021 Cancer Facts & Figur es re port, screening offers the ability for secondary prevention by detecting cancer ear ly. It is estimated that nearly 1.9 million new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in 2021. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among males (26%), followed by lung (12%) and colorec tal (8%) cancers. Am ong females, breast (30%), lung (13%), and colorectal ( 8%) cancers are the most common.18 According to findings from the ACS 2021 Cancer Facts & Figures report, cancer incidence rates are higher in males than in females for each racial/ethnic population, although rates are very similar in A sian/Pacific Islanders. The highest incidence rates are in blac ks among males and in whites among females. Asian/ Pacific Islanders have the lowest rates in both sex es. A recent study by the ACS found that 42 percent of newly diagnosed cancer cases in the U.S. ar e potentially avoidable. Many of the known causes of the cancer and other non-c ommunicable diseases are attributable to behav ioral factors including tobac co use and excess body weight due to poor dietary habits and lack of physical activity (ACS, 2018). The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) emphasizes the importance of patient navigators as part of a multidisciplinary oncology team with the goal of reducing mortality among underserved patients . A patient navigator may assist with various tasks, including psychosocial support; assistance with treatment decisions; assistance with insurance issues; arrangement of transpor tation; coordination of additional services (i.e., fertility preservation); and tracking of interventions and outc omes. The navigator works with the patient across the care continuum, ensuring coordination and efficiency of care, and removal of barriers to care (ASCO, 2016). According to the NIH, clinical trials, a part o f clinical research, are at the heart of all medical advanc es. Clinical trials look at new ways to prevent, detect or treat disease by determining the s afety and efficacy of a new test or treatment. Greater clinical trial enrollment benefits medic al research and increas es the 17 The County of San Diego HHSA's Community Health Statistics Unit Collects annual data on leading causes of death using methodology established by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).

SCRIPPS MD ANDERSON CANCER CENTER SUPPORT GROUP S The best cancer care includes more than medical treatment. Scripps MD Anderson Cancer Care Center offers support for people living with cancers, including breast, gynecologic and head and neck, as well as services to help with emotional, psychological, financial and lifestyle as aspects of cancer. Although due to COVID -19 meetings were suspended for most of the year as there was restricted access to the hospital patients had the ability to join online support groups offered by MD Anderson Cancer Center as part of our partnership. The sessions were facilitated by MD Anderson social work counselors and provided an opportunity for patients, family members and friends to meet others in similar circumstances, develop new relationships and find out how others cope during this time of increased distress. SCRIPPS MD ANDERSON CANCER CENTER SURVIVORSHIP PROGRAM Scripps MD Anderson patients and their families can take part in free survivorship programs though San Diego YMCA and LIVESTRONG Foundation. Focusing on physical activity and well -being, the program helps adult cancer survivors achieve their holistic health goals. SCRIPPS MD ANDERSON CANCER CENTER SURVIVORS DAY Survivors Day is a time to recognize the nation's 15.5 million cancer survivors, to focus attention on issues of survivorship, and to acknowledge medical professionals dedicated to cancer treatment, research and support services . National Cancer Survivors Day events are held in hundreds of communities nationwide throughout the month of June. Scripps holds a celebratory event at various Scripps hospital s each year to provide an opportunity for those that have battled cancer to come together and enjoy the company of friends, family and the camaraderie of fellow cancer survivors. Cancer survivors and other guests share inspirational stories learn about advances in cancer treatment and research and enjoy the opportunity to connect with caregivers and fellow survivors. Each year the cancer survivor event s helps celebrate life, inspire those recently diagnosed, offer support to family and loved ones and recognize all who provided support along the way. They also provide a forum for discussing the physical, financial and social issues that many cancer survivors face following completion of treatment. Events were held online this year to ensure safety and reduce the spread of COVID -19. In partnership with MD Anderson Cancer C enter the following were some of the topics presented ; building your own vision board at home, history of labyrinths , 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 52 music and mindful ness exercise, Anticancer Living: Transform Your Life and H ealth with the Mix of S ix, yoga breathing exercises and chair yoga. SCRIPPS MERCY HOSPITAL CHULA VISTA WELL BEING CENTER CANCER SUPPORT SERVICES : HEALTHY WOMEN , HEALTHY LIFESTYLES : BREAST HEALTH OUTREACH AND EDUCATIO N PROGRAM A Promotora led health and wellness program that aims to improve the lives of women in San Diego's South Bay with breast cancer education, prevention and treatment support. Promotoras teach breast health to women who have limited or no access to health care. Promotoras teach women in their native language w ith sensitivity to a woman's ethnic and cultural norms. The program model includes a Promotora, Cancer Survivor and a Nurse Navigator. The Promotora has knowledge of breast cancer, offers education and emotional support. She also provides referrals in culturally appropriate and language sensitive way. A breast cancer survivor and volunteer strengthen the benefits of breast cancer education and prevention by talking to someone who has been there and can provide insight and suggestions and is living proof that the disease is not fatal. Working together, the P romotora and Volunteer present a very strong front for breast cancer awareness and full support system for those already diagnosed. Moreover, the fact they are bi -lingual Latinas , lend an air of automatic trust among the Hispanic community as they can connect with the residents on a cultural level. Due to COVID -19 many of these outreach and education programs ceased mid- March 2020 due to large group and gathering restrictions; some services were able to tra nsition to a virtual platform.

In addition, 'cerebrovascular diseases' were the fourth leading cause of death, and essential hypertension and hypertensive renal disease' was the tenth. Coronary Heart Disease is the most common form of heart disease. High blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking are all risk factors that could lead to CVD and stroke. About half of Americans (49%) have at least one of these three risk factors. RISK FACTORS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE : Behaviors: Tobacco use, obesity, poor diet that is high in saturated fats, and excessive alcohol use. Conditions: High cholesterol levels, high blood pressure and diabetes. Heredity: Genetic factors likely play a role in heart disease and can increase risk. A summary of the magnitude and prevalence of cardiovascular disease is described below: The Scripps 2019 CHNA continued to identify cardiovascular disease (including cerebrovascular disease/stroke) as a priority health issue affectingmembers of the communities served by Scripps. According to data presented in the Scripps 2019 CHNA, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and smoking are all risk factors that could lead tocardiovascular disease and stroke. About half of all Americans (47 percent)have at le ast one of these three risk factors. Additional risk factors include alcohol use, obesity, physical inactivity, poor diet, diabetes and geneticfactors. In 2018 , cerebrovascular diseases including stroke were the fourth leading cause of death for San Diego County overall. The World Health Organization defines cardiovascular disease (CVD) as a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels that include: Coronary heart disease Cerebrovascular disease Peripheral arterial disease Rheumatic heart disease Congenital heart disease Deep vein thrombosis Pulmonary embolism Coronary Heart Disease is t he most common form of heart disease and the leading cause of death in the U.S. high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking are all risk factors that could lead to CVD and stroke. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 56 In 2018, there were 1,446 deaths due to stroke in San Diego County.19 The age-a djusted death rate due to stroke was 37.3 per 100,000 population, which was higher than the HP2020 target of 34.8 deaths per 100,000. In 2008, there were 4,655 deaths due to diseases of the heart in San Diego County. The age-a djusted death rate due to diseases of the heart was 120.51 per 100,000 population. 20 In 201 7, there were 6,078 hospitalizations for stroke in San Diego County, with an age-a djusted rate of 166.9 per 100,000 population, a 7.4% decline from 2016. In 2017, there were 2,603 stroke-r elated ED visits in San Diego County. The age adjusted rate of ED visits was 71.4 per 100,000. Heart disease is the leading c ause of death for people of most racial/ethnic groups in the United States, including African Americans, Hispanics and Whites. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) reports that 25 percent of people who recover from their first stroke will have another stroke within five years (NINDS, 2016). According to 2018 CHIS data, an estimated 26.3% of SDC adults were obese, 11.0% were current smokers, 9.8% reported that they were not physically active. The CDC estimates that up to 80 percent of strokes are preventable through the recognition of early signs/symptoms and the eliminati on of stroke risk factors. According to the CDC, healthy lifestyle choices can help prevent stroke. Behaviors that can mitigate the risk of stroke include c hoosing a healthy diet full of fruits and vegetables, maintaining a healthy weight, engaging in at least 2.5 hours of moderate-i ntensity aerobic physical activity each week, refraining from or quitting smoking, and limiting alcohol intake (CDC, 201 8). Not only is Scripps a nationally recognized heart care leader, consistently ranked by U.S. News & World Report as one of America's Best Hospitals for cardiology and heart surgery, but we treat more heart patients than any other health care provider in San 19 County of San Diego HHSA's Community Health Statistics Unit collects annual data on leading causes of death using methodology established by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Data is based on \"underlying cause of death\" information from all death certificates filed in SDC in 201 7. Causes are ranked according to the number of deaths assigned to all ranked causes, which are a subset of ICD -10's \"List of 113 Selected Causes of Death and Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile.\" (Pe\u00f1a, M., County of San Diego HHSA Public Health Services, Community Health Statistics Unit, 2018; Heron, M., \"Deaths: Leading Causes for 2016\".

Heart disease is the leading cause of death for women in the United States, killing more than 299,578 women in 2017 - or about 1 in every 5 female deaths according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Our female cardiologists focus on empowering their patients and the community to take care of their hearts through education, healthy lifestyles and expert medical care when needed. THE ERIC PAREDES SAVE A LIFE FOUNDATION Each year, 7,000 teens lose their lives due to sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). SCA is not a heart attack, it is caused by an abnormality in the heart's electrical system that can easily be detected with a simple Electrocardiogram ( EKG ). Unfortunately, heart screenings are not part of a regular, well -child exam or pre- participation sports physical. The first symptom of SCA could be death. San Diego alone loses three to five teens from SCA annually . Scripps efforts began when a registered nurse at Scripps created the foundation af ter her 15- year-old son, Eric passed away from sudden cardiac arrest in 2009. Turning tragedy into an opportunity, the Paredes ' established the organization to prevent sudden cardiac arrest in school -age children and adolescents. As a sponsor for the Eric Paredes Save A Life Foundation, Scripps has held more than 20,000 free cardiac screenings to local teens, including the homeless, uninsured and underinsured. In Fiscal Year 2020 , Scripps made an $8,500 contribution to help pay for screenings. In Fiscal Year 2020 , Scripps supported screening event s at area high schools and screened 1,951 teens , identifying 27 with abnormalities and 16 who were at risk. The overall goal was to host 6 screenings per year and to average 800 youth per screening event, however, the national health pandemic caused the postponing of the April, June and August screenings. The following were additional metrics tracked: Teens Uninured: 27% Teens Without a Pediatrician/Family Doc: 452 Teens Who Use Community Clinic: 446 Average percent of Moderate to Extremely Low Household Income: 69% Ethnicity: 53% represent diverse ethnicities Parents unaware of SCA in youth: 57% Parent s unaware of warning signs/risk factors 66%2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 60 Number of youths screened who participate in sports: 69% Scripps Volunteers: 40 Scripps Volunteer Hours: 200 THE ERIC PAREDES SAVE A LIFE FOUNDATION - PRESCRIPTION FOR PREVENTION In partnership with SDSU's Institute for Public Health and UC Irvine, The Eric Paredes Save A Life Foundation produced the first CME/CNE on incorporating Sudden Cardiac Arrest prevention into primary care practices. Studies show cardiac consideration is an often -overlooked area of assessment. The training module reviews SCA warning signs, risk factors and recommended diagnostic testing protocol. The CME development was directed and narrated by Dr. John Rogers, Scripps Cardiologist and EP Save A Life Medical Director, and Scripps Health was instrumental in facilitating engagement in both a front -end needs assessmen t and in participation in the training module through direct communication with PCPs. Funding supported development and promotion of the training module on a local, state and national level, in particular with the San Diego chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Given early data suggests COVID -19 can lead to heart damage and professional medical associations have released recommendations for cardiac assessment of student athletes who've been exposed before returning to play, this training supports a critical skill set for PCPs. The Scripps participation in live CME events/early Needs Assessment of total participants was 45%. SWEETWATER UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT - SPORTS SCREENINGS Every year, three to five student athletes in San Diego County die suddenly and unexpectedly from Sudden Cardiac Arrest/Death (SCA/D). SCA is an abnormality in the heart's electrical system that can happen without symptoms or warning signs. However, this life -threatening condition can be detected with a cardiac screening exam. Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista Family Medicine Residency, Southwest Sports Wellness Foundation, and the Sweetwater Union High School District partner to prevent sudden cardiac arrest and death among high school students by increasing awareness of the importance of healthy lifestyles and cardiovascular screenings among active students. Family Medicine residents offer yearly cardiac screening and sports physicals before students participate in organized sports and implement an injury clinic during football season to evaluate and treat possible concussions and other injuries. Due to COVID -19 the screening events were implemented on a much smaller scale and a total of 150 screenings were provided to student athletes this year. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 61 SU CORAZON , SU VIDA / YOUR HEART , YOUR LIFE COMMUNITY INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE EDUCATION AND AWARENESS OF HEART DISEASE The Your Heart, Your Life (Su Corazon, Su Vida) Program is designed to help prevent heart disease through education and provide support and outreach to those already living with heart disease and other related chronic diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure. Topics covered in the classes include heart disease risk factors, signs of a heart attack and stroke, lifestyle changes, diabetes, cholesterol and nutrition education. Height, weight, and blood pressures are recorded in the first and last class to measure a difference and impact of the lifestyle changes implemented from participating in the sessions . A total of 50 community members have participated in this educational series for those affected by hypertension, angina, cardiac heart failure or any other heart health concerns. Assessment survey showed weight (pre:157 lbs. and post:153 lbs.) and blood pressure (pre:145/74 and post:138/70) an overall improvement rate after participating in the Your Heart, Your Life series. Overall, participants have made a positive impact from the course based on the health assessments . Classes were cancelled mid-year due to COVID -19. STROKE CARE PROGRAMS On average, a stroke occurs every 40 seconds in the United States. More than 1,000 stoke deaths occurred in San Diego County in 2018, and about 15 people are hospitalized due to stroke every day. Scripps sponsors a wide variety of stroke related education and awareness programs. These include support groups and education for stroke and brain injury survivors and their loved one. Information and resources are provided, along with skills to help reinforce inner strengths and learn self -care strategies. Support groups offer the ability to develop encouraging peer relationships along with the goal of returning to and continuing a life of meaning and purpose. Due to COVID -19 these support groups were not held most of the year due to restricted access to the hospital SAN DIEGO COUNTY STROKE CONSORTIUM Scripps Stroke Program participates in the SD C ounty Stroke Consortium, a county - wide stroke group, consisting of SD County Stroke receiving center Stroke Program Coordinators, Stroke Champions and Stroke Leadership. Additionally, the meeting is attended by Stroke Program Medical Directors and SD County leadership. The Stroke Consortium serves as a point of contact for continuity of stroke care in San Diego County. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 62 In the early months of COVID -19 pandemic, a decline in stroke hospital admissions were reported across the nation. Scripps Stroke Program spearheaded a real -time data collection in collaboration with 18 stroke receiving centers in San Diego County. When the group calculated a decrease in stroke code activations by 30% as compared to 2019, Scripps Stroke Program dedicated time and resources to lead the efforts to create and disseminate a unified community message urging San Diego County residents to seek emergency treatment when suffering symptoms of a stroke. Scripps Stroke Program led a collaborative group including San Diego County EMS, San Diego regional American Heart Association/American Stroke Association, and the San Diego County Stroke Consortium in creating a united marketing campaign. The slogan \"We are here for you. Every minute matters\" accompanied by a graphic message was utilized to highlight the importance of seeking emergency treatment when experiencing stroke- like symptoms. The social media campaign was posted on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn, with a total of 26 ,727 views. The community collaborative was also submitted for consideration at the 2021 International Stroke Conference. COLLABORATIVE SAN DIEGO COUNTY STROKE CENTER COMMUNITY MESSAGING CAMPAIGN The San Diego County Stroke Consortium (of which all Scripps Health Stroke Programs participate) performed a collaborative SD County Stroke Center Community Messaging campaign in May/June during the pandemic. The general point of the Consortium project was to reassure/remind community members the importance of accessing 911 for stroke symptoms, to present for timely care, despite the ongoing pandemic. SCRIPPS HEALTH STROKE PROGRAM COMMUNITY EVENTS Ocean Knoll Elementary PTA Group The Scripps Health Stroke Team participated in an Educational Event at Ocean Knoll Elementary School in Encinitas, CA on January 23, 2020. Stroke Team members provided community outreach via an e ducational lecture to school parents, PTA members and t eachers about BE -FAST (how to recognize symptoms of stroke and calling 911 for someone exhibiting stroke symptoms). The event was held at Ocean Knoll Elementary School in Encinitas and 25 community members were served. The event was open to PTA members and staff of Ocean Knoll Elementary school. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 63 AT&T Stroke Screening Event with American Heart Association The Scripps Health Stroke Team coordinated and participated in a Stroke Screening Event in collaboration with the American Heart Association Team in San Diego on February 7, 2020. Stroke Team members provided community outreach via Stroke R isk Screening and Education, Stroke Risk assessments; blood pressure screening, and BE - FAST education (recognition of stroke and calling 911). The event was held on the AT&T San Diego campus and 70 community members were served. The event was open to AT&T employees. Rancho Santa Fe Senior Center Participation at the Rancho Santa Fe Senior Center where 20 community members were served. Stroke Team members provided community outreach via an educational lecture to members of the senior center and community members regarding physiology of stroke, stroke risk factors, stroke prevention, recognition of stroke and accessing 911. The event was open for all to attend, but primar ily served residents of Rancho Santa Fe, CA. Mesa College The Scripps Health Stroke Team participated in an Educational Event at Mesa College on March 7, 2020. Stroke Team members provided community outreach via an Educational lecture to college students and teachers about BE -FAST (how to recognize symptoms of stroke and calling 911 for someone exhibiting stroke symptoms). The event was held at Mesa College in San Diego CA and 30 community members were served. The event was open to Mesa college students and staff. STROKE AND BRAIN INJURY SUPPORT GROUP AT SCRIPPS MERCY HOSPITAL CHULA VISTA WELL BEING CENTER The stroke support group is for stroke and brain injury survivors, caregivers, and loved ones. The group's goal is to educate and empower survivors. Attendees receive information and resources, reinforce inner strengths, learn self -care strategies, and develop encouraging peer relationships. A total of 92 people participated in the supp ort group. Due to COVID -19 the group has transitioned to conference call group which has impacted the overall number of participants for the year. BRAINMASTERS : STROKE AND BRAIN INJURY SURVIVORS SUPPORT GROUP In 2017, Scripps Memorial Hospital Encinitas launched a program to address the communication challenges of stroke and brain injury survivors. Brain Masters is an improvisational speaking group for adults coping with acquired brain injury. This fun, 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 64 supportive and interactive group helps brain injury patients improve communication skills, think more quickly on their feet, and build self -confidence in a friendly, encouraging environment. Offered as a community benefit through Scripps Memorial Hospital Encinitas, Brain Masters is free and open to t he community. In Fiscal Year 2020, 52 people were served. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 65 DIABETES Diabetes is an important health need because of its prevalence, its impact on morbidity and mortality, and its preventability. An analysis of mortality data for San Diego County found that in 2018 'Diabetes mellitus' was the seventh leading cause of death. A summary of the magnitude and prevalence of diabetes is described below: The Scripps 2019 CHNA continued to identify diabetes as a priority health issue affecting members of the communitiesserved by Scripps. The Centers for Dis ease Control and Prevention (CDC) identify diabetes as theseventh leading cause of death in the U.S., as well as the leading cause of kidney failure, non- traumatic lower limb amputations and new cases of blindness among adults. The number of adults diagnosed with diabetes in the U.S. has more than tripled in the last 20 years (CDC, 2017). In 2018, there were 755 deaths due to diabetes in San Diego County overall.21 The age-a djusted death rate due to diabetes was 20.5 per 100,000 population. In 2017, there were 4,292 hospitalizations due to diabetes in San Diego County. The age -adjusted rate of hospitalization was 122.9 per 100,000 population in 2017, which was slightly lower than the age-a djusted rate in 2016 (120.9 per 100,000 population). In 2017, there were 5,717 diabetes-r elated ED discharges in San Di ego County, a 10.6% increase from 2016 (5 ,168 ED discharges). The age-a djusted rate of diabetes related ED disc harges were165.0 per 100,000 population in 2017, 21 County of San Diego HHSA's Community Health Statistics Unit collects annual data on leading causes of death using methodology established by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Data is based on \"underlying cause of death\" information from all death certificates filed in SDC in 2016. Causes are ranked according to the number of deaths assigned to all rank ed causes, which are a subset of ICD -10's \"List of 113 Selected Causes of Death and Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile.\" (Pe\u00f1a, M., County of San Diego HHSA Public Health Services, Community Health Statistics Unit, 2018; Heron, M., \"Deaths: Leading causes for 2016 \". National Vital Statistics Reports; vol. 67 no. 6. Hyattsville, Maryland: National Center for Health Statistics. 2018. ) Type 2 diabetes, once known as adult onset or noninsulin- dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition that affects the way the body metabolizes sugar (glucose), which is the body's main source of fuel. With Type 2 diabetes, the body either resists the effects of insulin a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into the cells or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain a normal glucose level. If left untreated, Type 2 diabetes can be life threatening. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 66 which was higher than the age- adjusted rate in 2016 ( 151.9 per 100,000 population). According to 2018 CHIS data, 9.8 percent of adults living in San Diego County indicated that they had ever been diagnosed with diabetes, which was lower than the state of California (9.9 percent). Diabetes rates among seniors were particularly high, with 20.5 percent of San Diego County adults over 65 reporting that they had ever been diagnosed with diabetes. According to 2018 CHIS data, 9.8 percent of San Diego County residents had been told by their doctor that they have pre or borderline diabetes. According to the CDC's 2017 National Diabetes Statistics Report, 87.5 percent of adults diagnosed with diabetes were overweight or obese. To prevent or delay the onset of diabetes, the CDC recommends lifestyle changes such as losing weight, eating healthier, and getting regular physical activity. The CDC estimates that 30.3 million people in the U.S. have diabetes. Of those individuals, 1 in 4 isnot aware they have the disease (CDC National Diabetes Statistics Report, 2017). The percentage of adults aged 20 and older who have ever been diagnosed with diabetes was 9.4% in 201 7 in San Diego County and has been steadily rising since 2005 according t o the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. Type 2 diabetes is an important target for intervention because hospitalizations due to diabetes related complications are potentially preventable with proper management and a healt hy lifestyle . There are three major types of diabetes: Type 1, Type 2 and gestational. All three types share similar characteristics, the body loses the ability to either make or use insulin. Without enough insulin, glucose stays in the blood, creating dangerous blood sugar levels. Over time, this accumulation damages kidneys, heart, nerves, eyes and other organs. Type 2 diabetes, once known as adult onset or noninsulin dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition that affects the way your body metabolizes sugar (glucose), which is your body's main source of fuel. With Type 2 diabetes, your body either resists the effects of insulin, a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into your cells or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain a normal glucose level. If left untreated, Type 2 diabetes can be life threatening. Clinical symptoms can include frequent urination, excessive thirst, extreme hunger, sudden vision changes, unexplained weight loss, extreme fatigue, sores that are slow to heal, and increased number of infections. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 67 Type 2 diabetes has reached epidemic proportions, and people of Hispanic origin have dramatically higher rates of the disease and the complications that go along with its poor management, including cardiovascular disease, eye disease and limb amputation. In fact, it is estimated that one out of every two Hispanic children born in 2000 will develop diabetes in adulthood. This is especially true in the South Bay communities in San Diego. Specifically, the city of Chula Vista is home to 26,000 Latinos with diagnosed diabetes and tens of thousands more who are undiagnosed, have pre- diabetes and are at high risk of developing diabetes. Some facts about Type 2 diabetes: Diabetes is a major cause of heart disease and stroke and is the 7 th leading cause of death in the United States and California. More than 1 out of 3 adults have prediabetes and 15 to 30% of those with prediabetes will develop Type 2 diabetes within 5 years. Nine out of 10 people with prediabetes don't know they have it. S ome risk factors for developing diabetes include: Being overweight or obese Having a parent, brother or sister with diabetes. Smoking Having blood pressure measuring 140/90 or higher. Being physically inactive, exercising fewer than three times a week. A history of gestational diabetes If you are 65 years of age or older A ccording to the CDC, nearly 10 percent of the overall population is now living with diabetes, and another 45 percent has pre- diabetes, a precursor to T ype 2 diabetes. The complications related to diabetes are serious and can be reduced with preventive practices. Diabetes is a serious community health problem, leading to school and work absenteeism, elevated hospitalization rates, frequent emergency room visits, permanent physical disabilities and sometimes death. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 68 Scripps i s making eve ry effort to hel p patients and our c ommunities with prediabetes reverse course and lead healthier l ives.

In Fiscal Ye ar 2020, Project Dulce provided 2,884 diabetes care, retinal screenings and education visits for l ow income a nd underserved individuals t hroughout S an Diego. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 69 RETINAL SCREENING PROGRAM It is estimated that every 24 hours, 55 people will lose their vision because of diabetic - related eye disease ( diabetic retinopathy) even though 95 percent of diabetic blindness could be prev ented with early diagnosis and treatment. For more than a decade, Scripps has been screening people in underserved communities for diabetic retinopathy using a mobile camera. Our free or low -cost eye exams diagnose individuals at high risk for retinal dama ge and help patients get treatment and referrals to specialists. In Fiscal Year 2020 , 917 people were screened, and 6.4 percent had some degree of diabetes -related eye disease. This program referred 38 people who had advanced disease, 2.4 percent of all screened or nearly 36.9 percent of positives, to specialists for further care. Due to CO VID-19 the screenings were not conducted for most of the year due to COVID -19. MEDICAL ASSISTANT HEALTH COACHING (MAC) FOR DIABETES IN DIVERSE PRIMARY CARE SETTINGS Diabetes affects nearly 30 million individuals in the U.S., and if current trends continue, 1 of 3 adults will have diabetes by 2050. Diabetes S elf-Management Education and Support (DSME) is a cornerstone of effective care that improves clinical control and health outcomes; however, DSME participation is low, particular ly among underserved populations, and ongoing support is often needed to maintain DSME gains. In 2015, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIH/NIDDK) granted Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute $2.1 million to fund the MAC Trial, which is studying an innovative team care approach that trains medical assistants (MAs) to provide health coaching in the primary care setting to patients with poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes, help them problem solve, and improve their diabetes -related health outcomes. The goals include improving diabetes self -management and clinical outcomes, such as blood glucose levels, cholesterol and blood pressure. The study is being conducted in two diverse settings: a Scripps Health primary care practice, and a community health center, Neighborhood Healthcare. The interventions for this study were completed in F iscal Year 2019 and the data is now being analyzed for publication. DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM The UCLA Center for Health Policy and Research recently published data that revealed nearly half of California adults have prediabetes or diabetes. While the Scripps Whit tier Diabetes Institute has been providing the best care for people with diabetes for decades, the Institute continued with the Scripps Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), which is a year -long intervention where people with prediabetes meet weekly for 16 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 70 weeks, t hen m onthly t hereafter.

In Fi scal Ye ar 2020, 1,550 patients attended 46 Scripps DPP orientation sessions. Much of the effort is focused in the South Bay for the Latino population, which is at higher risk of acquiring diabetes than their white counterparts. DIGITAL DIABETES-M E: AN ADAPTIVE M HEALTH I NTERVEN TION F OR UNDERSERVED HISPANICS W ITH D IABETES Diabetes is a fast-g rowing epidemic. In the US , nearly 11% of adults were living with diagnosed diabetes in 2017,22 whic h represented an annual economic burden of $327.2 billion, with an average annual cost of $13,240 per case.23 Hispanic s face a higher risk of developing the disease\u20141 3.9 percent compared with 7.6 percent for non- Hispanic whites.

Diabetes care. 2019. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 71 goal setting . This study was conducted in collaboration with Neighborhood Healthcare, San Diego State University and the University of California San Diego. The participants received health- related text messages every day for six months and they saw improvements in their blood sugar levels that equaled those resulting from some glucose- lowering medications. The Dulce Digital -Me clinical trial represents the first randomized controlled study to look at the use of text messages to help underserved Hispanics better self -manage their diabetes through glycemic control. The results were published by Diabetes Care in an online pre- print version of the study, which is scheduled to be published in a future issue of the journal. HEALTHY LIVING In 2015, Scripps began Healthy Living classes which are open to anyone interested in learning about the benefits of good nutrition, physical activity, and avoiding tobacco. These behaviors can help to prevent the four chronic diseases (lung disease, cancer, Type 2 diabetes and, cardiovascular disease) that contribute to 50 percent of all the deaths in the US. The three- class series is held at locations throughout the community. Thirty -six people attended Healthy Living classes that were provided throughout the County, again with special attention to the La tino community of the South Bay. Classes were cancelled mid-year d ue to COVID -19. SCRIPPS WHITTIER DIABETES DISTRESS STUDY The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases awarded a five- year, $3.3 million grant in 2020 to Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute to study the integration of mental health services in the care of patients with type 1 diabetes to better address the emotional distress than often accompanies the chronic disease. Researchers at Scripps Whittier will use the federal funding to launch a large-scale, randomized, controlled clinical trial that will evaluate whether the integration of diabetes distress care with routine medical care results in better management of diabetes and better health- related quali ty of life. The study is a collaborative effort that capitalizes on the complimentary expertise of a clinical psychologist/endocrinologist partnership. SCRIPPS WHITTIER DIABETES INSTITUTE PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute professional education teams provide state of the art education and training for people who wish to increase their diabetes management knowledge and skills. With the rise in diabetes related devices, there is a great need to equip clinicians with the latest information and clinical skills. The Whittier's professional education program is led by a team of experts, including endocri nologists, nurses, dieticians, psychologists and other diabetes specialist. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 72 These individuals train practicing professionals to deliver the best possible care for their diabetes patients. Courses are tailored to the needs of allied health professionals seeking to understand new and complex clinical treatment options for Type 1, Type 2 and gestational diabetes. Professional education was provided for 97 people on insulin management, incretin therapy, and diabetes diet and diabetes basics. Participants came from local health institutions and throughout the United States to learn from the Whittier Institute's most experienced diabetes experts. Over the last fiscal year, the Whittier Institute's professional education department provided four CME programs for physicians, nurses, pharmacists, dietitians, midlevel providers and social workers and made numerous academic and research pres entations at professional association meetings. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 73 HEALTH RELATED BEHAVIORS Health related behavior is one of the most important elements in people's health and well-being. Its importance has grown as sanitation has improved and medicine has advanced. Diseases that were once incurable can now be prevented or successfully treated. Health related behaviors, such as immunization, smoking cessation, improved nutrition, increased physical activity, oral health and injury prevention, have become important components of long-term life. The risk factors for many chronic diseases are well known. In particular, an unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and substance use have been cited by the World Health Organization ( http://www.who.int/chp ) as important health behaviors that contribute to illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, and others including mental disorders and oral diseases. The HASD&IC and Scripps 2019 CHNA identified ten top health and social needs in San Diego County. These ten social determinants are: access to care, community and social support, economic security, education, homelessness and housing instability, unintentional injury and violence, aging concerns, behavioral health, cancer and chronic conditions. Key informant interviews conducted as part of the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA suggested several health improvement strategies to address the health issuesidentified for San Diego County. These strategies include behavioral health prevention and stigma reduction; education on disease management and food insecurity; integrating physical and mental health care; better coordination of care; greater cultural competence and diversity; and engagement of patient navigators and case managers in the community. Fruit/Vegetable Consumption: According to data from California Health Intervi ew Survey, 48.3% of children age 2 and older reported consuming less than fiveservings of fruits and vegetables a day compared to 47.7% in California, overall. Adults age 18 and over reported even less fruit and vegetable consumption. Approximately 70.5% of adults reported eating the recommended amount each day. Unhealthy eating habits are a significant contributing factor to future health issues including obesity and diabetes. Physical Inactivity: According to the CDC's National Center for Chronic Diseas e Prevention and Health Promotion, 14.9% of adults age 20 and older self -reported that they perform no leisure time physical activity. Higher rates of limited leisure time activity were reported at the state and national level (16.6% and 22.6%respectively ). For youth results of the FITNESSGRAM physical fitness test show2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 74 that 29.35% of children in grades 5,7 and 9 ranked within the \"High Risk\" or \"Needs Improvement\" zones for aerobic capacity . The percentage of children that are not in the healthy fitness zone varies among ethnic groups with the lowest being non- Hispanic Asians at 20.6% and the highest being Hispanic or Latinos at 42.1%. Although this is smaller than the state average of 36.9%, it is still cause for concern and may lead to significant health issues, such as obesity, diabetes, and poor cardiovascular health. Alcohol Consumption: The percentage of adults age 18 and older who self -report heavy alcohol consumption (defined as more than two drinks per day on average for men and one drink per day on average for women) is 17.2% in San Diego County according to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).Behaviors such as excessive alcohol consumption are detrimental to futurehealth and may illustrate or preclude significant health issues , such as cirrhosis, cancer, and untreated mental and behavioral health needs. Tobacco Usage: The BFRSS also reports that 12.1% of adults age 18 and older self-reported currently smoking cigarettes some days or everyday compare to 18.1% in the United States, adjusted for age. Tobacco use is linked to leadingcauses of death including cancer and cardiovascular disease. The HHSA's Live Well San Diego (LWSD) 3 -4-50 initiative identified three behaviors (poor diet, physical inactivity and tobacco use) that contribute to four chronic conditions (cancer, heart disease/stroke, Type 2 diabetes and pulmonarydiseases), which result in more than 50 percent of deaths worldwide. In 2015, 54 percent of all deaths in SDC were attributed to 3-4- 50 conditions. Understa nding that personal behaviors play a significant role in an individual's overall health status, Scripps has developed a series of prevention and wellness programs that help people take charge of their own, and their families,' health. During Fiscal Year 2020 , Scripps sponsored several health behavior modification efforts: COMMUNITY BASED HEALTH IMPROVEMENT ACTIVITIES Community members participated in a variety of classes, prevention lectures and support groups. Approximately 1,469 attended these programs held at the Chula Vista Well Being Center. This year's numbers were impacted due to the COVID -19 Pandemic. In person support groups, classes, activities were ceased mid- March 2020. The m ajority of in-person activities have not been able to reconvene due to the large group restrictions and/or being a vulnerable population due to age and/or health condition. A few groups have been able to transition to a conference call or virtual platform to continue meeting. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 75 PATIENT COMMUNITY SERVICES Services are offered by Well Being Center (WBC) staff directly to patients and their family to decrease the risks of readmission, keeping patients on a healthy pathway and to increase patient continuity. Support services are referral based and generated through Scripps electronic health system, EPIC. Services and assistance are provided for 30 days post discharge and up to one year to patients with the following conditions : Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Chronic Heart Failure (CHF), Pneumonia, Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG), Total Knee or Hip Replacement , and COVID -19. WBC staff and Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista social workers collaborate to also provide ongoing follow- up and services to identified social work patients. These patients require more support and resources (housing/homelessness, senior issues , drug/alcohol and mental health, cancer ) as discharged patients do not continue to be followed by hospital social workers. This collaboration allows for high- risk patients to receive more assistance. The goal of patients participating in this service post -discharge is to reduce hospital and emergency department 30- day and 90- day readmissions. Community patient post- discharge services include: home visits, phone calls, providing community and social service resources, and application assistance (medical insurance, SDI, housing, SNAP , Mama's Kitchen), and a referral to a local community clinic or the Scripps Adva nced Care Clinic. These services are currently only available at Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista. A total of 907 patient referrals have been received and all patients are followed up to one year. 907 patient referrals were received (30 Day and Social W ork) 686 patients were contacted/reached (this includes 30- day follow up and Social Work referral patients) 154 patients - unable to reach, deceased, declined follow -up services, language barrier 66 patients were readmitted (source: caregiver, EPIC) In addition, staff work with Mama's Kitchen to provide free, Medi -Cal covered medically tailored meals and medical nutrition therapy for discharged CHF patients as part of the patient community services program. The Mama's Kitchen free meal program lasts twelve weeks, with meals being delivered to the home. Staff contact patients post - discharge or at bedside, based on the generated report i n EPIC. If patients qualify and are interested, a referral form is completed, signed by a Scripps clinician, and then securely emailed to Mama's Kitchen. Lastly, another vital component of the patient 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 76 community services program are those patients that are part of the CHF Emergency Department Pilot Program . This is done in collaboration with the Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista Emergency Department to follow up with CHF patients who were in the emergency room but did not get admitted. This is because CHF p atients are statistically more likely to readmit, therefore W ell Being Center staff and Emergency Department staff take measures to reduce that likelihood. The program ensures that these patients are follow up with their provider, tak e medications as presc ribed, and assess the need for additional resources or other services. COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PARTNERS (CHIP) AND RESIDENT LEADERSHIP ACADEMY MODEL Scripps is a partner with CHIP and collaboratively works on a resident leadership model that has empow ered 700+ citizens across the County (and beyond) to affect change in a wide range of community health areas such as public safety, access to healthy foods, and increased opportunities for physical activity. HEALTH EDUCATION AND SUPPORT GROUPS Scripps e ducation and support groups are provided to San Diego County residents for a wide variety of health concerns. Topics include, fall prevention, stroke awareness, bladder and pelvic floor wellness, postpartum issues, and gynecological cancer . Due to COVID -19 all education and support groups were not held most of the year due to restricted access to the hospital. OPIOID STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM (OSP) AND BRIDGE PROGRAM According to the CDC, anyone who takes prescription opioids can become addicted to them, and one in four on long- term opioid therapy struggles with addiction. In San Diego, the rate of discharge from emergency departments for chronic substance use increased by 559% from 2014 to 2016, and the rates of ED discharges for acute substance use rose as well. Heavy alcohol consumption is also a problem in San Diego, with nearly 20% of all adults ages 18 and older self -reporting excessive alcohol use. Cal Hospital Compare (CHC), a nonprofit organization that provides Californians with hospital performance ratings, named all four of Scripps Health's hospitals to its 2020 Opioid Care Honor Roll. Scripps is the only health care organization in San Diego County to be recognized on the inaugural statewide list. The 2020 Opioid Care Honor Roll recognizes 53 California hospitals for their progress and performance in promoting safe and effective opioid use, providing treatment for patients with opioid use disorder and providing access to naloxone to prevent opioid overdoses. According to state data, over 2,400 Californi ans died of an opioid- related overdose in 2018. CHC recognized 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 77 Scripps for taking a variety of approaches to address overuse of opioids among its patients. For patients being discharged from an emergency department visit or hospital stay, Scripps has creat ed educational videos that it makes available for viewing and has also set opioid prescription quantity limits at discharge. In addition, some Scripps hospital emergency departments have implemented medication- assisted therapy, in which specially licensed ER physicians can administer medications as a bridge for patients with opioid use disorder until they can receive further care. The Opioid Stewardship Program (OSP) at Scripps is combatting this national epidemic by working with physicians to decrease the number of opioids prescribed to patients and educating patients on pain management . The program has established prescribing standards for opioids, resulting in a reduction in the number of opioid pills per prescription at Scripps hospitals and outpatient centers . In addition, Scripps also has opened three drug take- back kiosks at its on -site pharmacies, offering patients year - round access to dispose of unused, unneeded or outdated medications . California Bridge Program Scripps has received state grants at each of its Scripps hospitals from the California Bridge Program and the Center at Sierra Health Foundation to remove barriers to identifying and treating patients with opioid use disorder and provide Medication- Assisted Treatment (MAT). Combined with other recent grants for Scripps O pioid Stewardship Program, Scripps has been awarded almost $1 million to help prevent and treat opioid addiction. Scripps actively promotes MAT access for patients in the form of buprenorphine. The Bridge Program aims to help hospitals and health centers expand patient access to treatment for opioid use disorder, including on- the-spot medical treatment and coordinated outpatient care, while MAT aims to reduce the stigma of opioid addiction and increase provider support for medication assistance in treating addiction. All together, these state programs have awarded Scripps $935,000. As part of the grant, Scripps now has Bridge counselors at to help patients with opioid addiction. Bridge counselors are certified through the California Consortium of Addiction P rograms and Professionals (CAPP) or the California Association for Drug/Alcohol Educators. They meet patients in the emergency department and other inpatient areas of both Scripps Mercy campuses to provide rapid evidence- based medication-assisted treatment. They also connect patients directly to continued treatment in the community. The California Bridge grant also enabled Scripps to hire Substance Use Disorder Service n urses (SUDS) to facilitate treatment and entry into a community -based MAT program. Scripps deploys specialized nurses certified in addiction to see patients at their bedside and work closely with the patient's entire health care team in facilitating a 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 78 safe detox treatment while hospitalized. They identify patients who are at risk or are currently experiencing withdrawal from alcohol and other addictive substances. SUDS nurses evaluate patients who meet certain criteria and work directly with the nurse and physician to ensure the patient is adequately medicated to control symptoms of withdrawal. SUDS nurses at Scripps functio n in a proactive and reactive role at all Scripps hospitals and collaborate with community resources, including Family Health Centers of San Diego to provide MAT, McAlister Institute for detox beds and the Betty Ford Center for outpatient care. SPONDYLITIS ASSOCIATION Scripps Health provides meeting space to the Spondylitis Association of America (SAA). This is a non- profit organization founded in 1983 to address the needs of people affected by spondyl arthritis . Since that time, SAA has been at the forefront of the fight to promote medical research, educate both the medical community and general public and advocate on behalf of the people they serve. Due to COVID -19 meetings were not held most of the year due to restricted access to the hospital. 2020 LIVE WELL SAN DIEGO VIRTUAL 5K AND FITNESS CHALLENGE Scripps Health joined Live Well San Diego as a recognized partner on December 13, 2016. Live Well San Diego is a vision for a region that is Building Better Health, Living Safely and Thriving . It aligns the efforts of individuals, organizations and government to help all 3.3 million San Diego County residents live well. This year's event brought thousands of San Diegans \"together\" to celebrate the 10th Anniversary of the Live Well San Diego vision . The e vent had 69 teams work together to complete nearly 10,000,000 steps. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 79 AGING CO NCERNS Across the United States an d locally i n San Diego County, the growth in t he number and proporti on of a ging adults ov er the age of 65 has hit n ew an d unprecedented l evels in out hi story.

Inadequate family support or support at home to recover, maintain one's health, or manage their medications including ordering refills, picking up prescriptions, and taking the right dose of medications at theright time, can be challenging for older adults who do not have adequatesupport ). Transportation (l ack of accessible or reliable transportation options to and from appointments, to go grocery shopping, or just socialize with others) In addition, Alzheimer's disease was the third leading cause of death and Parkinson's disease was the 12 th leading cause of death among San Diego County residents in 2018. Dementia is a clinical syndrome of decline in memory and other thinking abilities. 24 SpeedTrack Inc.; U.S. Census Bureau 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 80 It is caused by va rious diseases an d conditions t hat result i n damage t o brain cells a nd lead to distinct sy mptom patterns a nd distinguishi ng brai n abnormalities.

D eath - 60 ED Discharge - 4,695 Inpatient Discharge - 1,859 San Diego is now the ninth most expensive city in the U.S. (2019). The Elder Index , developed by UCLA's Center for Health Policy Research, reports 41% of San Diego's seniors do not have enough income to pay for basic housing, food, healthcare, and transportation. Meanwhile, government housing programs are experiencing extreme waiting lists and intake tools fail to prioritize the elderly. These factors, combined with San Diego's housing crisis, are intensifying senior homelessness, as evidenced by San Diego's most recent Point in Time Count . In 2020, 27% of San Diego's unsheltered residents were 55 years and older, equating to more than 2,000 seniors living on the streets. Within this group of older adults: 88% of seniors became homeless in San Diego 43% are experiencing homelessness for the first time 54% are sleeping on the street or sidewalk 50% are managing a chronic condition 25 The Alzheimer's Project San Diego Unites for a Cure and Care. County of San Diego HHSA, April 2019. SDHealthStatistics.com 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 81 A summary of the magnitude and prevalence of aging conditions are described below: The 2019 HASD&IC and Scripps CHNA identified aging c oncerns as one of the top health conditions among San Diego County hospitals . The 2019 HASD&IC and Scripps CHNA identified physical and non-physical barriers to care. Seniors accessing health care can be particularly difficult. When seniors can no longer drive, finding reliable, affordable transportation can bechallenging. Seniors most often have limited income and area constantly shifting their financial priorities between paying for housing, food, or costs associated with seeking health care. High cost of medications, co- pays and deductibles were cited as creating financial barriers to accessing health care. Physical barriers tocare, such as limited mobility, hearing or vision issues may also create challenges for seniors needing additional assistance. For those who do not speak English as a first language, language can also be a barrier to accessingcare. After discharge from a hospital stay, seniors may have inadequate support at home to recover well and follow -up care is hard for seniors to locate and secure. These needs identified by the community overall spoke to the overwhelming need to increase awareness of community and social support programs and services for this particularly vulnerable group. In 2018 , Alzheimer's disease was the 6 th leading cause of death in the United States and 3rd leading cause of death in San Diego County. In 2008, there were 1,461 deaths due to Alzheimer's disease in San Diego County overall. The age -adjusted death rate due to Alzheimer's disease was 37.42 per 100,000 population In 2018 , the top 10 leading causes of death among adults ages 65 and older in San Diego County were (in rank order): overall cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and other dementias (ADOD), coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, chronic obstr uctive pulmonary disease (COP D), chronic lower respiratory diseases, overall hypertensive diseases, diabetes, unintentional injuries, Parkinson'sdisease and falls. In 2018 , hospitalization rates among seniors were higher than the general population due to coronary heart disease, stro ke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , nonfatal unintentional injuries (including falls), overall cancer and arthritis. The top three causes of ED utilization among San Diego County residents ages65 and older in 2017 were unintentional injuries, falls and COPD/chronic lower respiratory diseases.2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 82 According to the CDC, 2.8 million older adults, or more than one in four, are treated in the ED for falls every year. One in five falls causes a serious injury, such as broken bones or a head injury, and with each fall, the chance of fallingagain doubles. These injuries may result in serious mobility issues and difficultywith everyday tasks or living independently. The direct medical costs for fall injuries are estimated at $31 billion annually (CDC, 2018). In 2017, 69.4% of the influenza hospitalizations and 75 of the 90 influenza deaths in SDC occurred among residents ages 65 and older. The age- adjusted rate of influenza death among this group was 16.2 per 100,000 population . Research shows that caregiving can have serious physical and mental healthconsequences. According to findings from the Stress in America survey described in a report titled \" Valuing the Invaluable\" , caregivers to older relatives report poorer health and higher stress levels than the ge neral population. Fifty - five percent of surveyed caregivers reported feeling overwhelmed by the amount of care their family member needs (AARP Public Policy Institute, updated July 2015). According to AARP, more than 40 million people in the U.S. act as unpaidcaregivers to people ages 65 and older. More than 10 million of these caregivers are Millennials with separate full or part -time jobs, and one in three employed Millennial caregivers earns less than $30,000 per year (AARP, 2018). During Fiscal Year 2020, Scripps engaged in the following programs and services to meet the needs of the aging population. SCRIPPS ADVANCED CARE CLINIC The program provides intensive , proactive, medical and social services to adults living with multiple chronic diseases. Understanding that diseases can impact all aspects of a person's life, the program treats not just medical issues, but also the psychosocial, economic and spiritual aspects of care. The Advanced Care Clinic interdisciplinary, patient centered team helps optimize patient health through an evidence- based extensivist clinic model that assist with care coordination and patient advocacy across health care and home settings. To date 149 patients have been served, 45% reduction in hospitalizations, 72% reduction in 30- day readmissions and 49% reduction in ED visit rate. In addition, the program coordinates non -clinical issues. Table 4.2 displays various types of psychosocial services referrals. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 83 TABLE 4.2 PSYCHOSOCIAL SERVICES FOR TIME PERIOD (AUGUST 2019 -NOVEMBER 2020) Services Number of patients Food Assistance 33 patients referred Shelter 15 patients (7 patients in progress) Outpatient Psychiatry/Psych Resources 10 patients Caregiver Assistance 34 patients Substance Use Rehab 1 patient PACE 3 patients Job Assistance 1 patient Assistance with Volunteer Opportunities 2 patients Welfare Check/APS Report/Ombudsman 16 patients Assistance with Funeral Planning 1 patient Connection with SDPD/PERT 1 patient Public Guardian 1 patient Assistance with Insurance/Funding/Bills 9 patients Transportations Services 37 patients THE ALZHEIMER 'S PROJECT - SAN DIEGO UNITES FOR A CURE AND CARE The Alzheimer's Project is a countywide initiative aimed at accelerating the search for a cure and helping the estimated 60,000 San Diegans with the disease, along with their caregivers. Participan ts began meeting in early 2016 to craft a regional roadmap to address the disease, focusing on cure, care, clinical, and public awareness and education initiatives. The Board of Supervisors approved the roadmap in December 2014 and later voted in support of an implementation timetable. Dr. Michael Lobatz from Scripps Health is a leading participant of this initiative as a co-chairperson of the Clinical Round Table and is a member of the Steering Committee. STANDING STRONG FOR FALL PREVENTION According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than one third of adults 65 and older fall each year in the United States and 20 to 30% of people who fall suffer moderate to severe injuries. Scripps held a free interactive event on fall prevention September 2019 and January 2020. Participants learned about improving balance and flexibility and strength. It also included balance and fall risk screening assessment by Scripps physical therapy department occupational therapy specialist . VIRTUAL STANDING STRONG FALL PREVENTION WEBINAR As part of National Fall Prevention Awareness week in September 2020, Scripps partnered with the County of San Diego Health and Human Services and the San Diego Fall Prevention Task Force on free, virtual ev ents to learn more about what individuals can do to prevent falls. Falls are the leading cause of injury related emergency 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 84 department visits for older adults. Scripps hosted a two-hour webinar with a panel of Scripps experts to provide safety tips, educati on, and exercises. The Scripps event served as the official kick -off event for Fall Prevention Awareness week with 20 presentations delivered virtually . http://www.sandiegofallprevention.org/ The following were some of the topics provided: Fall Prevention 101 Keeping Your Daily Balance Understanding and Preventing Falls from the perspective of first responders Kitchen Safety in a COVID -19 World Fall Prevention Screening and Getting Up Safely After a Fall FALL PREVENTION AND HOME SAFETY WORKSHOPS Many older adults experience concerns about falling and restrict their activities. Scripps Social Workers and nurses lecture on ways to reduce fall risk, improve safety awareness and utilize available resources to promote independence and overall safety. Balance classes are designed to help building balance, posture and coordination through strengthening and balance exercises. This importan t aspect to healthy living for seniors provides education on preventing falls through exercise and being proactive through safety measures in the home. Scripps P hysical T herapy department and Physical T herapy school volunteers provide fall risk assessments. Seniors may attend from all over the San Diego county region. Due to C OVID -19 meetings were not held most of the year due to restricted access to the hospital. A MATTER OF BALANCE : MANAGING CONCERNS ABOUT FALLS Scripps educates older adults on preventing falls through exercise and being proactive through safety measures in the home. An 8- week program and lecture series provide practical strategies to manage falls, improve safety awareness and utilize available resources to promote independence and overall safety. Scripps was chosen as a pilot site to test a new virtual edition of the A Matter of Balance program with results being used to launch the new virtual evidence- based version in January 2021. Due to COVID - 19 meetings were not held most of the year due to restricted access to the hospital. SENIOR HEALTH AND WELL-BEING PROGRAMS Each month a variety of senior programs are held in partnership with local senior centers, churches, and senior housing. The following programs are conducted as part of Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista San Diego Border Area Health Education Center and Scripps Family Medicine Residency Program. These senior health chats are 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 85 designed to provide health education to the older adult community. A total of 104 seniors have participated in these monthly sessions. These presentations include a variety of health and age- related topics that include : Heart Health, Understanding Osteoporosis, Parkinson's, Cold vs. Flu and a variety of prevention and healthy lifestyle topics. These presentations are facilitated by various health care professions and residents. Topics are all chosen by the seniors themselves to meet their local needs. Also, the health chats provide an interchange between the community members and our medical residents and other health care professionals to foster healthy lifestyles and health prevention. The program is conducted in collaboration with Norman Park Center, Congregational Towers Senior Living and St. Charles Nutrition Center. Family Medicine Residents rotate through these programs to learn more about geriatric medicine, health and wellness and overall public health and community training. No classes were held after March due to COVID -19. PARKINSON 'S LSVT (LEE SILVERMAN TRAINING ) BIG EXERCISE : Scripps provides a maintenance class for those who have completed the LSVT BIG Exercise protocol. This class is taught by a physical therapist and is designed for Parkinson's patients to improve strength and mobility for a healthier life. Due to COVID - 19 meetings were not held most of the year due to restricted access to the hospital. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 86 OBESITY, WEIGHT STATUS, NUTRITION, ACTIVITY & FITNESS Obesity is an important health need due to its high prevalence in the U.S. and San Diego. Although it is not a leading cause of death, it is a significant contributor to the development of other chronic conditions. A summary of the magnitude and prevalence of Obesity, Weight Status, Nutrition and Activity & Fitness is described below: The Scripps 2019 CHNA continued to identify obesity as a priority health issue affecting members of the communitiesserved by Scripps. According to 2017 CHIS data, the self - reported obesity rate for adults ages 18 andolder in S an Diego County was 22.5 percent. According to a new report released in 2019by the San Diego Childhood Obesity Initiative, 34%, or nearly 1 out of every 3 children in San Diego County's schools were overweight or obese. These rates vary by grade, with 5th graders having the highest rates of overweight and obese children (36%) compared to 7th graders (34%) and 9th graders (33%). I n examining trends across longer periods of time, overweight and obesity prevalence among children in San Diego County appears to be leveling off and even declining slightly. For example, a 2005 UCLA study estimated 36% of children in San Diego County were overweight or obese, with that number decreasing to 35% in 2010. Based on these data, childhood overweight and obesity prevalence in 2018 has decreased by two percentage points since 2005. This small decrease from 36% to 34%, however, would represent approximately 8,600 fewer students across public school districts who were overweight and obese in 2017- 2018. More information can be found at, www.sdcoi.org . Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have an adverse effect on health. Overweight and obesity ranges are determined using weight and height to calculate a number known as \"body mass index\" (BMI). For adults: BMI between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight. BMI of 30 or higher is consider ed obes e. For children and adolescents (ages 2 -19): BMI at or above the 85t h per centile and lower than the 95th percentile for children of the same age and sex is considered overweight BMI at or above the 95th percentile for children of the same age and sex is considered obese. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 87 In 2017, between 25 and 30 percent of adults in California self -reported being obese. Obesity levels decreased as education levels increased, indicating a need for health education as a tool for reducing obesity rates (CDC, 2017). Obesity has been linked to environmental factors, such as accessibility and affordability of fresh foods, park availability, social cohesion and neighborhood safety (UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, 2015). According to data from the 2016 National Study of Children's Health, nearly one- third of children in California are obese. California has one of the highest childhood obesity rates in Western states (The State of Obesity, 2018). According to the CDC, some of the leading causes of preventable death include obesity -related conditions, such as heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer. Obesity is largely categorized as a secondary diagnosis in hospital dischargedata. When examining inpatient hospital discharge data with obesity as a secondary diagnosis, it was found that the most common primary diagnosis of those patients was nonspecific chest pain in ages 25- 64, abnormal pain for those ages 15- 24, and those over 65 years their primary diagnosis was osteoarthritis, septi cemia followed by congestive heart failure. Research has shown that as weight increases to reach the levels of \"overweight\" and \"obesity\" the risks for the following conditions also increases: Coronary heart disease Type 2 diabetes Cancers (endometrial, breast and colon) Hypertension (high blood pressure) Stroke Liver and gallbladder disease Sleep apnea and respiratory problems Osteoarthritis Obesity is addressed through general nutrition and exercise education and resources provided at Scripps as well as programs that address a healthy lifestyle as part of care for heart disease, cancer, diabetes and other health issues influenced by healthy weight and exercise. During Fiscal Year 2020 , Scripps engaged in the following obesity prevention and treatment activities : 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 88 SAN DIEGO CHILDHOOD OBESITY INITIATIVE The San Diego County Childhood Obesity Initiative ( COI) was established in 2006 and is a private public partnership with the mission of reducing and preventing childhood obesity through policy, sys tems, and environment change. Core funding for The Initiative is provided by the County of San Diego, First 5 Commission of San Diego County, The California Endowment, and Kaiser -Permanente. Scripps is a strong partner with CHIP and the outcomes of the initiative have shown an overall reduction in childhood overweight and obesity, from 36% in 2005 to 34% in 2015 (many areas have seen increases). A State of Childhood Obesity Supplemental report released by the San Diego County Childhood Obesity Initiative released in 2019, www.sdcoi.org , finds that d espite the potential improvements in San Diego County, disparities among children who are overweight or obese persist, particularly among diverse racial, ethnic, and econom ic groups. For example, in 2018, 43% of Hispanic students were overweight or obese. Compared to White students with an overweight and obesity prevalence of 24%, Hispanic students were nearly twice as likely to be overweight or obese. These findings are relevant as nearly half o r 48% of all students tested in San Diego County identified as Hispanic or Latino, compared to 29% of students identifying as White for the 2017- 2018 school year . Students who identified as American Indian or Alaskan Native, or Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, had overweight and obesity rates of 44% and 49%, respectively. For students identifying as Black or African American, the story was similar with 37% being overweight or obese. Only students identifying as Asian have rates lower than White children\u201422% compared to 24%. During the 2017 -2018 school year, more than half, or 53% of San Diego County students in both public and charter schools, were identified as socioeconomically disadvantaged. Socioeconomically disadvantaged is defined as students who are: migrants, in foster care or homeless at any time during the academic year, eligible or had direct certification for the Free or Reduced- Priced Meal (FRPM) program or are in a family where both parents did not receive a high school diploma. Among these students, 42% were overweight or obese. Compared to their non- economically disadvantaged peers, socioeconomically disadvantaged students were almost twice as likely to be overweight or obese (42% vs 24%). Overweight and obesity preval ence among these students has held steady at 42% since 2014; however, alarming disparities continue to grow across racial and ethnic groups. American Indian or Alaskan Native students, for example, had a 10% increase in overweight and obesity prevalence between 2014 and 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 89 2018, and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander students had an even greater increase \u2014 12%\u2014during this period. DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM (DPP) A large clinical trial concluded that people with prediabetes could reduce their likelihood of developing diabetes by 58- 70 percent if they lost just 5 -7 percent of their body weight. The Diabetes Prevention Program is a scientifically validated lifestyle intervention- based model. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) promote widespread adoption of the DPP due to its demonstrated effectiveness. Scripps is recognized by the Centers for Disease Control as a national DPP provider and rolled out the program to patients and community members in 2016. Scripps aims to decrease the incidence of Type 2 diabetes by managing a major diabetes risk factor, obesity in the underserved, ethnically diverse populations by testing the effectiveness of lifestyle curriculum. The program uses trained lifestyle coaches and a standardized curriculum; participants meet in groups with a coach for 16 weekly sessions and six to eight bimonthly follow -up sessions. Participants must have prediabetes and be overweight to enroll. No physician referral is required, although many physicians do refer their patients to this valuable resource. Orientation sessions are held in Spanish and English throughout the county. HEALTHY LIVING PROGRAM Diabetes, heart disease, cancer and respiratory disease are the four most prevalent serious chronic diseases in California. These diseases cause 50 percent of all deaths in San Diego and throughout the U.S., and many people have more than one of these conditions. Because lifestyle can play a major role in preventing these chronic illnesses, Scripps introduced Healthy Living, a free, interactive education program to help the San Diego community learn about and adopt practical ways to improve three behaviors : smoking, poor diet and physical inactivity that contribute to these four diseases. Participants learn how to make healthy food choices using low costs options, make physical activity part of their daily life and learn how to stay motivated and maintain healthy habits. Scripps implements a series of three free sessions that encourage participants to identify and adopt practical ways to improve their health habits. Sessions are offered throughout San Diego County in English and Spanish, with special emphasis on the Latino and underserved communities. Sessions include health 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 90 screenings , healthy co oking tips, a nd mindful eating practice sessions. Participants also receive a prediabetes screening; t hose who score high ar e then referred to t he Scripps Diabetes P revention Program. Classes were ca ncelled i n quarter 3 and 4 due to COVID -19. PROMISE N EIGHBORHOOD INITIATIVE Scripps al so addresses ch ildho od obesity at the high school l evel i n San Diego's S outh Bay co mmunities t hrough its partnership wit h the Promise Neighborhood initiative, which implements activities r elated to t he national 5 210 ca mpaign.

There is tremendous focus on maternal illness and death, and infant health and survival, including infant mortality rates, perinatal and other infant deaths. According to a New York Times article, \"Hug e Racial Disparities Found in Deaths Linked to Pregnancy \", May 2019, African American, Native American and Alaska Native women are about three times more likely to die from causes related to pregnancy, compared to white women in the United States. Maternal and infant health issues include: Alcohol, tobacco and illegal substances during pregnancy, which are major risk factors for low birth weight and other poor outcomes. Very low birth weight associated with preterm birth, spontaneous abortion, lowpre-pregnancy weight and smoking. Infant death rates are highest among infants born to young teenagers andmothers 44 years and older. Being pregnant, or trying to become pregnant, is only a small portion of a woman's life. Unintended pregnancy, either mistimed or unwanted at the time of conception, accounts for an estimated 49 percent of pregnancies in the U.S. These pregnancies are associated with increased morbidity, as well as behaviors linked to adverse health. Women who can plan the number and timing of their children experience improved health, fewer unplanned pregnancies and births, and lower abortion rates. HIGH RISK PREGNANCY High Risk Pregnancy can be the result of a medical condition present before pregnancy or a medical condition that develops during pr egnancy for either mom or baby and causes the pregnancy to become high risk. A high- risk pregnancy can pose problems before, during or after delivery and might require special monitoring throughout the pregnancy. Risk factors: Advanced maternal age: increased risk for mother's 35 years and older. Lifestyle choices: smoking, alcohol consumption, use of illegal drugs. Medical history : prior high-risk pregnancies or deliveries, fetal genetic conditions, family history of genetic conditions. Underlying conditions: diabetes, high blood pressure and epilepsy. Multiple pregnancy. Obesity during pregnancy.2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 94 A summary of the magnitude and prevalence of Maternal and Child Health & High -Risk Pregnancies are described below: In 2017, there were 40,889 live births in San Di ego County (SDC) overall. Source: County of San Diego, Health and Human S ervices Agency (HHSA), Public Health Services, Maternal, Child, and Family Health. The 2017 infant mortality rate was 2.3 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in the north inland region, 3.0 in the north coastal region, 3.3 in the east region, 3.6 in SDC overall, 4.0 in the central region, 4.3 in the north central region, and 4.7 in the south region . In 2017, 149 infants in SDC died before their firs t birthday. Infant mortality was more common among male infants (84 deaths) than female infants (64 deaths). African American/black infants had the highest mortality rate (6.9 infant deaths per 1,000 live births) when compared to infants of all other races and ethnicities. Hispanic infants had the second highest mortality rate of 4.7 deaths per 1,000 live births.100 In addition, 3,423 preterm births oc curred in SDC 2017. to all other races and ethnicities, H ispanic mothers had the highest total number of births (16,593), of which 8.0% were preterm. Although black mothers had fewer total births (1,741), they experienced the highest rate of preterm births among all racial or ethnic gr oups (11.3%). Similarly, although women ages 25 to 39 had the highest total number of births among all age groups, mothers ages 40 and older were more likely to give birth preterm (15.2% preterm births among mothers ages 40 and older c ompared to 8.2% among mothers ages 25 to 39).26 In 2017, all SDC regions met the HP2020 national targets for prenatal care, preterm births, low birth weight (LBW) infants, very low birth weight (VLBW) infants and infant mortality.27 See Ta ble 4.3 for a summary of maternal and infant health indicators in San Diego County in 2017 and Ta ble 4.4 for a summary of maternal and infant health indicators by region. 26 County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency, Public Health Services, Community Health Statistics Unit (2019), Maternal, Child, and Family Health Services Statistics, 2011-2017. 27 The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' HP2020 initiative represents the nation's prevention agenda for the second decade of the 21st century. HP2020 has four overarching goals: to attain high quality, longer lives free of preventable disease, disability, injury, and premature death, to achieve health equity, eliminate disparities, and improve the health of all groups, to create social and physical environments that promote good health for all, and to promote quality of life, healthy development, and healthy behaviors across all life stages. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 95 TABLE 4.3.

The following are some examples: COMMUNITY BENEFIT SERVICES Offered more than 1,200 maternal child health classes throughout San Diego County to enhance parenting skills. Low income women in San Diego who were eligible attended classes at no charge or on a sliding fee schedule. Maintained existing prenatal education services in all regions of the county, ensuring that programs continued to demonstrate a satisfaction rating above 90 percent. P rovided and supported weekly breastfeeding support groups at six locations throughout San Diego County, including three with bilingual services. Offered maternal child health classes throughout the community, such as GettingReady for the Baby and Grand Parenting Today . Offered the Dogs and Babies programs quarterly, with more than 40 attendees. Offered classes in pelvic floor and postpartum changes for new mothers throughout the community. FIRST 5 PARENTING EDUCATION Parenting classes are offered at Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista Well -Being Center for parents with infants, toddlers and preschoolers. A wide variety of topics are covered including issues related to health, learning/development, family/safety, advocacy as well as parenting tips. Developmental assessments are conducted by Rady Children's Hospital. More than 300 services were received for first time mothers including: home visits, referrals received, data entry, follow up phone calls, parenting classes and other support services. Due to COVID - 19 these classes were offered virtually and via conference call. A total of 188 unduplicated parents participated in parenting education workshop series and 120 sessions were provided. This partnership with First Five and South Bay Community Services ended June 2020. FIRST FIVE HOME VISITS In collaboration with the medical residents, newborn home visits are provided to first - time moms who have delivered at Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista. The visit includes a comprehensive assessment covering social, health, and environmental issues. Further follow up is provided to assess critical health behaviors identified. Follow up and support services are provided for six months. Home visits ceased as of March 2020 due to COVID -19. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 97 BREAST FEEDING SUPPORT GROUP An experienced breastfeeding instructor leads the breastfeeding support group at t he Well Being Center with mothers who would like breastfeeding support. They interact with other mothers and are led by the instructor. Babies are weighed at the beginning and end of group to assess how much milk they are getting. Due to COVID -19 this group continued to meet by conference call since March 2020. CENTERING PREGNANCY , SCRIPPS FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENCY Raising healthy families and caring for the next generation of San Diegans before they're born help create a healthier community for years to come. The Scripps Family Medicine Program at Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista is providing access, education and clinical services to nearly 75 pregnant women in south San Diego County. The goal of the program, \"Improving Perinatal Care for Underserved Latina Women - Healthy Women, Healthy Babies\", is to provide access to perinatal care for underserved Latina women to improve birth outcomes. The program applies the principles of the Center Health Care Institute and focuses on changing the way patients experience their care through assessment, education and group support. Centering Pregnancy is the institute's model devoted specifically to improving maternal and child health and has been shown to result in increased prenatal visits, greater levels of breastfeeding and stronger relationships between mothers and their healthcare providers before, during and after pregnancy. Women who gave birth reported an enhanced prenatal experience, gained less weight throughout their pregnancy and showed improved healthcare knowledge. Services include home visits, referrals, data entry, follow up phone calls, and other support services. Home visiting is offered together with Family Medicine Residency and parenting education. Since COVID- 19, this program has been offered via telemedicine. MATERNAL CHILD HEALTH NURSING STUDENTS Scripps Perinatal Education program supports local nursing students with the opportunity to observe prenatal educational classes. This critical aspect of the nursing education allows the hours and information to meet their clinical rotation requirements in maternal child health. Due to COVID -19 the clinical rotati ons were not held most of the year due to restricted access to the hospital. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 98 SCRIPPS MERCY 'S SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION PROGRAM FOR WOMEN , INFANTS AND CHILDREN (WIC) The Special Supplement Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) was established as a permanent program in 1974 to safeguard the health of low -income women, infants and children up to age 5 who are at nutritional risk. Scripps Mercy Hospital is one of five regional organizations that administer the state funded WIC program. The program serves six locations conveniently situated near community clinics and/or hospitals in the central San Diego area. WIC targets low income pregnant and postpartum women, infants and children (ages 0 to 5 years). Scripps Mercy WIC serves approximately 6,500 women and children annually, 44 percent in the City Heights community. In City Heights clients are 91 percent Hispanic and include pregnant and postpartum women (24%), infants (20%) and children (56%). In F iscal Year 2020 , the program provided nutrition services, counseling and food vouchers for 65,655 women and children in South and C entral San Diego. The Scripps Mercy WIC program plays a key role in maternity care by reaching low income women to promote prenatal care, good nutrition and breastfeeding during pregnancy and offer lactation support (one on one and group), as well as breast pumps , pads, and other supplies during the postpartum period. MIRACLE BABIES Scripps Health partnered with Miracle Babies on their virtual 5 K Walk/Run. The mission of Miracle Babies is to uni fy families with their sic k newborns through financial assistance and supportive services to reduce pregnancy complications through prevention, education and research. MIRACLE BABIES DIAPER DISTRIBUTION The Miracle Babies program hosted several diaper distributions at Campus Point. Miracle Babies was started by Dr. Sean Daneshmand, Scripps Clinic medical director of maternal and fetal medicine, to provide financial and supportive services to parents with hospitalized newborns receiving treatment in neonatal intensive care units (NICU). The distribution served more than 700 families. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 99 UNINTENTIONAL INJURY AND VIOLENCE According to Healthy People 2020, \"unintentional injuries and violence- related injuries can be caused by a number of events, such as motor vehicle crashes and physical assault can occur virtually anywhere.\" Unintentional injury and violence were identified as a priority health need in the community engagement process of the 2019 CHNA . Exposure to violence and neighborhood safety were cited as priority health needs for San Diegans. Neighborhood safety was discussed as influencing residents' ability to maintain good health, while exposure to violence was described as traumatic and impactful on mental health. In 2018 , accidents (unintentional injuries) were the fifth leading cause of death for San Diego County overall. The deaths associated with unintentional injuries are significant ; yet represent only a small part of a much larger public health problem. Hospitalization data is a better measure of the injury problem than the death data alone. Unintentional injuries, motor vehicle accidents, falls, pedestrian related, firearms, fire/burns, drowning, explosion, poisoning (including drugs and alcohol, gas, cleaners and caustic substances) choking/suffocation, cut/pierce, exposure to electric current/radiation/fire/smoke, natural disasters and injuries at work, are one of the leading causes of death for San Diego County residents of all ages, regardless of gender, race or region. Most events resulting in injury, disability or death are predictable and preventable. There are many risk factors for unintentional injury and violence, including individual behaviors and choices, such as alcohol use or risk taking; the physical environment both at home and in the community; access to health services and systems created for injury related care; the social environment, including individual social experiences. A summary of the magnitude and prevalence of unintentional injury and violence is described below: Drugs, alcohol, vehicles, falls, guns and suicide continue to be leading causes of deaths investigated by the San Diego County Medical Examiner's Office. Under law, the County Medical Examiner's Office investigates all \"unnatural\" deaths that occur by accident, homicide, or suicide due to traumas or overdose, or undiagnosed or sudden unexpected natural causes. In 2018, there were 1,250 deaths due to accidents/unintentional injuries in San Diego County overall. The age- adjusted death rate due to diabetes was 35.20 per 100,000 population. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 100 San Diego County's Medical Examiner's Office release both mid-year statistics comparing the first six months of 2020 to 2019 in its 2019 annual report . Looking at mid - year figures, the department investigated 1,751 deaths through June this year compared to 1,674 in the same months last year, a 5% increase. The Medical Examiner's Office investigates deaths that occur by accident, homicide, or suicide due to trauma or overdose, or undiagnosed or sudden, unexpected natural causes. In cases where a person dies a natural death and is under a physician's care, that physician will certify the death and the person does not then go to the Medical Examiner for further investigation. Despite it being a pandemi c year, it should be noted that relatively few COVID -19 deaths are represented in the mid- year statistics. Deaths resulting from contagious diseases that pose a risk to the public such as COVID -19 are reportable to the medical examiner but are considered natural deaths and are therefore not always investigated further by the department if the person wasalready under the care of a physician. The deaths due to COVID -19 that the medical examiner sees are generally cases where the person had not sought any treatment for their illness, or the death was unexpected. Through June the department tested 104 decedents who had potential symptoms, signs, or riskfactors for COVID -19 and seven came back positive for the virus, a 6.7 positivity rate. In the mid -year snapshot, accidental deaths make up the largest cause of cases, with 857 of 1,751 deaths from January through June. This is an increase of 2% compared to 838 in the first six months of 2019. The category covers any kind of death from accidental injury or intoxication, including injuries from falls or carcrashes, accidental drug overdoses, injuries from fires or environmentalexposure such as hypothermia or hyperthermia, drowning, and other unintentional injuries. Within the accidental death category, unintentional overdose deaths due to illicit drugs, prescription medication and alcohol toxicity increased by 21% from 320 deaths in the first half of 2019 to 387 the first six months of this year. Of those accidental overdoses, fentanyl -caused deaths increased by 126% comparing those same six months where there were 69 deaths in 2019 and 156 cases for the first six months of this year. Most often, overdose deaths from fentanyl are traced to counterfeit pills that resemble oxycodone or alprazolam , 2020 San Diego County Prescription Drug Abuse Task Force.2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 101 There was also a decrease of 5% in number of suic ides, 198 this year compared to 209 in the s ame s ix months last year. Firearm s were the leading method of death in 76 of the 198 deaths by suicide this y ear. Hom icides increased by 14% for the first half of the year , 59 compared to last year's 52. In this categor y, firearms were again the leading method of deaths, 32 of the 59 deaths. For all of 2019, accidental deaths overall com prised 50% of all department investigations. Within that category, unintentional overdoses from drugs\u2014b oth prescription or illegal\u2014a nd alcohol were, at 39%, the leading cause of death. Accidental falls followed at 33% and then traffic-r elated fatalities at 19% were next as outlined in the depar tment's annual 2019 y ear-e nd report. Deaths from falls increas ed by 12% with 545 cas es in 2019 compared to 488 in 2018. Blunt head traum a and hip/femur fracture wer e the leading cause of death in falls. Traffic-r elated deaths decreased by 5% from 2018 which had 316 deaths while 2019 saw 301 deaths . The HA SD&IC 201 9 CHNA co ntinued t o identify uni ntentional i njury and violence as one of the top priority health conditions among S an Diego County hospitals. Scripps Health continued to address unintentional injury and violence. The following are so me examples: CAR SEAT P ROGRAM Scripps M emorial H ospital L a Joll a Emergency Department pr ovides ca r seats to patients w ho hav e been in an automobile accident an d their ch ild's c ar se at has been rendered unsafe to us e.

Due to COVID -19 classes were not held most of the year due to restricted access to the hospital. BEACH AREA COMMUNITY COURT PROGR AM The program is an educational program for first time offenders for quality of life crimes. This is a collaboration with the San Diego Police Department, Parks and Recreation, District Attorney's Office and Discover Pacific Beach. Education is provided to the participants regarding these quality of life crimes and their effects on the community, the effects of smoking and alcohol consumption and the rules and regulations for the beach community. Due to COVID -19 meetings were not held most of the year due to restricted access to the hospital . SAN DIEGO COUNTY LIFEGUARD EDUCATION CONFERENCE In Fiscal Year 2020 Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla Trauma department hosted a virtual San Diego County Lifeguard Education Conference. Scripps partnered with California State Parks to host and moderate the virtual webinar. More than 100 individuals signed in for the webinar. Information was shared on several topics critical for lifeguards, including downing resuscitation: snorkeler drowning and shallow water blackout , human factors in lifeguarding: reducing distractions and improving surveillance, marine mammal update: sharks and sting rays and skin cancer prevention. The virtual lifeguard education conference has now been viewed over 1, 000 times. The trauma department plans to continue this partnership with the county lifeguards to provide education and help them further identify opportunities for community outreach and injury prevention. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 103 SAN DIEGO HUMAN TRAFFICKING TASK FORCE AND PROJECT LIFE Scripps has partnered with the San Diego Human Trafficking Task Force and Project Life to offer \"soft rooms\" at all Scripps hospital facilities except Scripps Green Hospital. These soft rooms will be available to Project Life on a moment's notice to serve as a safe, confidential environment for law enforcement to interview victims of human trafficking and for service providers to connect with the victims with emergency shelter and community resources. The San Diego Human Trafficking Task Force receives 3,000 to 8,000 human trafficking victims every year in San Diego County. Approximately 80 percent are born in the United States. SAVING LIVES THROUGH STOP THE BLEED CAMPAIGN Whether from a bullet wound or other traumatic injury, severe blood loss can kill in just five minutes. However, one- fifth of trauma deaths, the leading cause of death for Americans under age 46, could be prevented by sta unching the bleeding. Scripps doctors are getting behind the national Stop the Bleed campaign. Supported by the American College of Surgeons, the Department of Homeland Security and numerous police departments . It aims to teach bystanders how to properly place pressure on a wound or apply a tourniquet in an emergency. Scripps providers participate in this program by teaching nonmedical audiences to control life- threatening bleeding until professional medical help arrives. The 90- minute course includes a presentation and practice on applying direct pressure, wound packing and using a tourniquet. Due to COVID -19 meetings were not held most of the year due to restricted access to the hospital. TRAUMA AWARENESS CONFERENCE Scripps participates annually with local agencies giving attendees the opportunity to learn more about Trauma Services. Education was provided on injury prevention and the latest trauma research. Participants had the opportunity to meet San Diego's first responders, explore equipment, and learn about careers from San Diego Fire, SWAT , SDPD canine unit, Cal Fire, a mbulance, and rescue helicopters. Interact ive booths educate families on important issues like the dangers of distracted/impaired driving, drowning prevention, fall prevention, and helmet safety. Due to COVID -19 this event was cancelled due to restricted access to the hospital. DISASTER PREPAREDNESS EXPO Scripps Mercy hospital holds an annual disaster preparedness expo. The event includes a sidewalk CPR, Stop the Bleed which include d learning basic techniques of bleeding control, learning the signs and symptoms of stroke and meeting the m embers of the 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 104 trauma team at Scripps Mercy hospital. Due to COVID- 19 this event was cancelled due to restricted access to the hospital. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 105 BEHAVIORAL HEALTH Behavioral health encompasses many different areas including mental health and substance abuse. Because of the broadness of this health issue, it is often difficult to capture the need for behavioral health services with a single measure. Mental health can be defined as \"a state of complete physical, mental and social well -being, and not merely the absence of disease\". Mental illness is defined as \"collectively all diagnosable mental disorders\" or \"health conditions that are characterized by alterations in thinking, mood, or behavior (or some combination thereof) associated with distress and/or impaired functioning\". Behavioral health is an important health need because it impacts an individual's overall healt h status and is a comorbidity often associated with multiple chronic conditions, such as diabetes, obesity and asthma. A summary of the magnitude and prevalence of behavioral health is described below: The Scripps 2019 CHNA continued to identify behavioral health as a priority health issue affecting members of the communities served by Scripps. The HASD&IC 201 9 CHNA identified behavioral health a top priority health issue both in the secondary data analyses and in the community engagement events. HASD&IC 2019 CHNA conducted a community engagement analysis and across all types of community engagement focus groups, key informant interviews, and the online survey . Behavioral health issues were identified as both prevalent and debilitating in the community. In the online survey, behavioral health was ranked as the health condition having the greatest impact on the health and well -being of San Diego County residents and as the second most impactful condition when health conditions and social determinants of health were combined (only accessto care ranked higher). In addition, 63% of survey respondents indicated that they believe behavioral health is worsening in San Diego County. Respondents were also asked to rank specific behavioral health conditions having the greatestimpact in San Diego. Mental Health can be defined as \"a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease\". Mental illness is defined as \"collectively all diagnosable mental disorders\" or \"health conditions that are characterized by alterations in thinking, mood, or behavior (or some combination thereof) associ ated with distress and/or impaired functioning\". 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 106 The top seven conditions identified were as follows: 5. Opioid Use 6. Suicide and Suicide Thoughts/Ideation 7. Self -Harm or Self -Injury1.Alcohol Use Disorder 2.Mood Disorders 3.Substance Use Disorder 4.Anxiety An analysis of mortality data in San Diego County found that in 2018, intentional self-harm (suicide) was the tenth leading cause of death. In 2018, the age- adjusted suicide rate in San Diego was 12.63 per 100,000. Rates were highest among whites (19.6), followed by blacks (4.06), Asian Pacific Islanders (7.39) and Hispanics (7.56). An analysis of 2018 mortality data for San Diego County revealed Alzheimer's disease and suicide as the third and tenth leading causes of death for San Diego County, respectively. The community engagement events conducted in the 2019 CHNA, identified that while San Diego has innovative programs to address mental health, residents face challenges in accessing timely, consistent mental health care. Care was described as especially difficult to obtain when the mental health issue was not considered an emergency. Mental health issues affect nearly 1 in 5 people, a nd when left untreated, are a leading cause of disability, are associated with chronic disease, and may lead to premature mortality. In San Diego County, 12.4 people per every 100,000 die from suicide annually, and approximately 10% of all adults seriously consider committing suicide.33 In 2017 there wer e 5,882 ED visits related to mood disorders in San Diego County, an 18.2% increase from 2013. This age-a djusted rat e of ED visits for mood disorders was 177.4 per 100,000 population.34 According to 2017 data fr om the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD), anxiety disorders were the top pr imary diagnosis for behavioral health -related ED discharges among those ages five to 44 and ages 65 and older. For those ages 45 to 64, the top ED discharge for behavioral health was alcohol-r elated disorders, followed by anxiety and mood disorders. 33 California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, OSHPD Patient Discharge Data:. SpeedTrack\u00a9 34 Ibid., 108 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 107 According to 2017 CHIS data, 11.8 percent of adults in SDC have ever seriously thought about committing suicide, a 40.5 percent increase since 2013 (8.4 percent) . In 2017, there were 998 hospitalizations due to overdose/poisoning in SDC. The age-adjusted rate of hospitalizations due to overdose/poisoning was 28.4 per 100,000 population. In 2017, the age- adjusted rate of overdose/poisoning- related ED visits in SDC was 172.1 per 100,000 population. Age- adjusted rates for overdose/poisoning- related ED visits were higher among males, individuals of other race and individuals ages 15 to 24 years in comparison among group. Heavy alcohol consumption is also problem in San Diego County. Nearly 20% of adults ages 18 and older self -report excessive alcohol use. Participants in the community engagement process discussed the link between mental health andsubstance misuse, arguing that the failure to provide preventive and acute mental health services often leads to self -medicating with drugs and alcohol. They also an insufficient supply of substance use disorder outpatient and in- patient drug treatment programs as a critical need in San Diego County . SUICIDE AND SUICIDE ATTEMPTS Suicide is a major complication of depression and a leading cause of non- natural death for all ages in San Diego County, second only to motor vehicle accidents. According to a San Diego County Suicide Prevention Council's 2020 report the number and rate of people who died by suicide in San Diego County dropped last year . In 2019, there were 429 deaths by suicide, 36 fewer than the 465 reported in 2018. The annual report provides a comprehensive look at suicide in the region and brings together data from multiple sources for the years 201 5 through 201 9. Among the report's findings: 1.Compared with 2018, the County suicide rate in 2019 decreased 7.9% from13.9 to 12.8 per 100,000 population, the lowest rate since 2011. 2.In contrast , the rate of regional Emergency Department disch arges due to non-fatal self -harm increased 1.7% between 2017 and 2018 (most recent data available). 3.Crisis calls to the local Access and Crisis hotline in 2019 increased 15.5% to an unprecedented 55% of all call volume.2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 108 In 2010, the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) launched a suicide prevention planning process, which was formed by the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention and the California Strategic Plan on Suicide Prevention. Scripps is a member of the Community Health Improvement Partners (CHIP), which collaborates with the county on this initiative. For more information on the status of suicide and suicide prevention in San Diego County: 20 20 Report Card. https://www.sdchip.org/initiatives/suicide -prevention- council/reports -resources/ The Report Card brings together the most recent data available from multiple sources (for the years 201 5 through 2019 ) to present a profile of suicides for all ages in San Diego County. Information from the County Medical Examiner, the Access & Crisis Line, hospital emergency departments, student self -reports, suicide prevention awareness campaigns and suicide prevention training pr ograms are presented to provide a more complete understanding of the status of suicide and efforts to prevent them in San Diego County.

BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INPATIENT PROGRAMS Individuals suffering from acute psychiatric disorders are sometimes unable to live independently or may even pose a danger to themselves or others. In such cases, hospitalization may be the most appropriate alternative. The Behavioral Health Inpatient Program at Scripps Mercy Hospital helps patients and their loved ones work t hrough short -term crises, manage mental illness and resume their daily lives. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 109 Behavioral Health Challenges Like many behavioral health programs across the country, funding is difficult, as payment rates have not kept pace with the cost to provide care. In Fiscal Year 2020 , the Scripps Mercy Behavioral Health Program experienced a $3.4 million loss in total operations, with 2.2 million of this loss being captured in Medi -Cal/CMS and Charity Care . In Fiscal Year 2020 , 1.2 percent of patients in the inpatient unit were uninsured. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OUTPATIENT PROGRAMS Scripps Behavioral Health entered into an agreement in May 2016 to transition the intensive behavioral health outpatient program to the Family Health Centers of San Diego (FHCSD) and expand outpatient behavioral health offerings to the population served. SCRIPPS MERCY AND FAMILY HEALTH CENTERS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PARTNERSHIP Scripps Mercy has established an initiative with Family Health Centers of San Diego (FHCSD) to create a more robust behavioral health care system for Medi -Cal patients that receive care at S cripps Mercy H ospital . The goal is to strengthen the continuum of integrated primary and mental health services for patients discharged from various hospital settings (medical and behavioral health inpatient and emergency care) through a variety of timely patient engagement strategies including the expansion of community - based behavioral health services adjacent to the hospital. It is important to involve patients in appropriate outpati ent care before their behavioral health issues become acute , preventing return s to the Emergency Department. MENTAL HEALTH OUTREACH SERVICES , A-VISIONS VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROGRAM Behavioral Health Services at Scripps Mercy Hospital, in partnership with the San Diego chapter of Mental Health of America established the A -Visons Vocational Training Program (social rehabilitation and prevocational services for people living with mental illness) to help decrease the stigma of mental illness and offer volunteer and employment opportunities to persons with mental illness. This supportive employment program provides vocational training for people receiving mental health treatment, potentially leading to greater independence. This year, Behavioral Health Services continued participating in the A -Visions program. Since its inception, 626 inquiries have come in, 165 of these resulted in qualified candidates with 101 volunteers and 54 employees thus far. Currently, there are a total of 24 active candi dates: 2 3 employees and one volunteer who participate in this 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 110 supportive employment program. The average length of employment for the 54 employees is 5. 4 years, with a range of 2 months to 14.7 years. The current paid employees have been employed between 1. 3 years to 13.4 years, with the average length of employment being 7 years. A -Visions participants have been employed on a casual/per diem basis by Scri pps Environmental Services, Food Services and clerical support for Health and Information Services, Emergency Services, Nursing Research, Human Resources, Access, Behavioral Health, Credentialing, Labor and Delivery, Laboratory, Medical Staffing, Performance Improvement, Spiritual Care and Palliative Care Services. Paid A -Visions candidates typically limit their work to eight hours per week, which allows them to maintain eligibility for the disability benefits, medications and ongoing behavioral healthcare that supports their work. INCREASING AWARENESS OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES In FY20, Scripps Behavioral Health Services improved awareness of mental health issues by providing information and supportive services for more than 300 people at community events . COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PARTNERS (CHIP) AND THE SUICIDE PREVENTION COUNCIL The San Diego County Suicide Prevention Council (SPC) is a collaborative community - wide effort focused on realizing a vision of zero suicides in San Diego County. Its goal is to prevent suicide and its devastating consequences in San Diego County. Since 2010, with support from the County of San Diego Behavioral Health Services, CHIP provides direct oversight and guidance toward the implementation of the Suicide Prevention Action P lan. The core strategies of the S uicide Prevention Council are: Enhancing collaborations to promote a suicide- free community Conducting needs assessments to identify gaps in suicide prevention services and supports Disseminating vital information on the signs of suicide and effective help-seeking Providing resources to those affected by suicide and suicidal behavior Advancing policies and practices that contribute to the prevention of suicide PSYCHIATRIC LIAISON TEAM (PLT) The Psychiatric Liaison Team is a mobile psychiatric assessment team. Clinicians provide mental health evaluation and triage services to accurately assess pati ents and provide them with the best and safest community resources to promote ongoing care. The team aims to help people adhere to treatment plans, reduce hospital readmission rates, relieve symptoms and ultimately ensure the long- term stabilization of the patient's 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 111 mental health. Scripps will continue to provide a dedicated Psychiatric Liaison Team at all Scripps Hospitals Emergency Departments and urgent care settings (Rancho Bernardo and Torrey Pines). MI PUENTE : \"MY BRIDGE \" TO BETTER CARDIOMETABOLIC HEALTH AND WELL-BEING Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute received a $2.4 million study grant from the NIH's National Institute of Nursing Research in 2015 to evaluate Mi Puente, a program at Scripps Mercy Chula Vista hospital that uses a \"nurse + volunteer\" team approach to help hospitalized Hispanic patients with multiple chronic diseases , reduce their hospitalizations and improve their day -to-day health and quality of life. Individuals of low socioeconomic s tatus (SES) and ethnic minority status, including Hispanics the largest U.S. ethnic minority group are disproportionately burdened by chronic cardiovascular and metabolic conditions (\"cardiometabolic\" e.g. obesity, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease). High levels of unmet behavioral health in this population contribute to striking disparities in disease prevalence and outcomes. A behavioral health nurse provides in- hospital coaching to patients, who are then followed post discharge by a volunteer community peer mentor to assist them in overcoming barriers that may interfere with achieving and maintaining good health. Mi Puente aims to improve continuity of care and address the (physical and behavioral) health needs of the at -risk Hispanic population. This program holds promise for impactful expansion to other conditions and underserved populations. Classes were cancelled in March due to COVID -19. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTEGRATION PROGRAM (BHIP) IN DIABETES Many people find that the day -to-day tasks associated with having diabetes testing one's blood sugar, planning meals, getting enough physical activity and remembering to take medications can be stressful. A common condition known as \"diabetes distress\" can be the result of feeling like it's all too much. Scripps Diabetes Care and Prevention has a Diabetes Behavioral Specialist on staff to help people manage their diabetes without being overwhelmed or unduly distressed. The Behavioral Health Integration Program (BHIP) in Diabetes is an integrated, interdisciplinary approach to managing the emotional and behavioral needs that often leads to burnout of individuals with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. The co- location of medical and behavioral health services in the same facility allow for a convenient, warm hand- off from physician to behavioral health specialist. It also affords opportunities for physicians, diabetes educators and others to receive consultation on behavioral health concerns, and in turn, more comprehensively address the multi -faceted needs of their patient s with diabetes. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 112 SCRIPPS WHITTIER DIABETES DISTRESS STUDY The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases awarded a five- year, $3.3 million grant in 2020 to Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute to study the integration of mental healt h services in the care of patients with T ype 1 diabetes to better address the emotional distress than often accompanies the chronic disease. Researchers at Scripps Whittier will use the federal funding to launch a large-scale, randomized, controlled clinic al trial tha t will evaluate whether the integration of diabetes distress care with routine medical care results in better management of diabetes and better health- related quality of life. The study is a collaborative effort that capitalizes on the complime ntary expertise of a clinical psychologist/endocrinologist partnership. MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT SERVICES AT LOCAL SCHOOL -BASED CLINICS Scripps Family Medicine Residency and Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista Well -Being Center have partnered to offer clinical training opportunities for Master Social Work students in training from San Diego State University at Southwest and Palomar High Schools. These students work with local providers that address the mental health needs of vulnerable adolescents. A variety of mental health issues are present for local high school students. Many of these issues include depression, anxiety and suicide related concerns. The program works to improve overall mental health care for local students through a school -based clinic. Approximately 150 hours were spent in the school -based clinics offering services for adolescents to an average of 12 students per week. Due to COVID -19 the schools were closed for several weeks and then transitioned to a virtual setting. PATIENT COMMUNITY SERVICES : BEHAVIORAL HEALTH Patients are referred from Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista, for assistance with a wide variety of behavioral health needs including addiction, loss, anxiety and other mental health issues. The Well -Being Center offers weekly counseling and/or refer patients to local mental health counseling services. These services were offered remotely as of March 2020 due to COVID -19. ALCOHOLIC ANONYMOUS Scripps H ealth provides meeting space for members of Alcoholic Anonymous. A fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength and support of each other. Due to COVID -19 meetings were not held most of the year due to restricted access to the hospital. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 113 GRIEF RECOVERY AFTER A SUBSTANCE PASSING (GRASP) Scripps Health provides meeting space for members of GRASP. GRASP was founded to help provide sources of help, compassion and most of all, understanding, for families or individuals who have had a loved one die because of substance use or addi ction. Due to COVID -19 meetings were not held most of the year due to restricted access to the hospital. NATIONAL ALLIANCE OF MENTAL ILLNESS (NAMI) SIBLINGS SUPPORT Scripps Health provides meeting space for members of NAMI Sibling Support. This is a confidential support group for siblings of person with mental il lness and adult children of parents with mental illness. Due to COVID- 19 the meetings were not held in the later part of the fiscal year due to restricted access to the hospital. SURVIVORS OF SUICIDE LOSS - SAN DIEGO CHAPTER Scripps Health provides meeting space for members of the Survivors of Suicide Loss - San Diego Chapter. The organization reaches out to and supports people who have lost a loved one to suicide. The goal is to give survivors a place where they can be comfortable expressing themselves, a place to find support, comfort, resources and hope in a judgment -free environment. These meetings were cancelled mid- year due to COVID -19 and restricted access to the hospital. SCRIPPS DRUG AND ALCOHOL RESOURCES There are more than 25 million illicit dr ug users in the US. There are an estimated 136.9 million current drinkers of alcoholic beverages and of those, approximately 23 percent binge drank in the last 30 days and 6.3 percent are considered heavy drinkers. It is estimated there are 8.7 million under -age drinkers. Substance use, particularly opioid misuse, is a health crisis that has reached epidemic proportions both nationally and locally. In San Diego, the rate of discharge from emergency departments for chronic substance use increased by 559% from 2014 -2016; rates for those 65 years and older increased the most by 714%. The rate of discharge for opioid misuse for this age group was even more startling\u2014it rose by 1.734% over this two -year period. Rates of discharge from emergency departments for acute substance use also rose. Rates increased for people of all racial and ethnic backgrounds; however, the most substantial increases (177%) was for b lacks. Heavy alcohol consumption is also a problem in San Diego. Nearly 20% of all adults ages 18 and older self -report excessive alcohol use. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 114 SCRIPPS SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICE (SUDS) NURSES Aware of the impact drugs and alcohol can have on our community, Scripps has developed innovative ways to treating this destructive disease. Scripps has deployed specialized nurses certified in addiction; they see patients at their bedside and work closely with the patient's entire health care team to help facilitate a safe detox while hospitalized. The Substance Use Disorder Service (SUDS) nurses act in a proactive and reactive role in all Scripps hospitals, helping to identify patients who are at risk, or are currently experiencing withdrawal from addictive substances. This mobile group of specially trained drug and alcohol resource nurses prov ide education, interventions and discharge placement assistance to patients in the Scripps hospitals. The resource nurses work directly with the nursing staff at each of the hospitals in search of patients who may be at risk for alcohol/drug withdrawal and assist with implementing a standardized protocol withdrawal process. Scripps has changed the way we deliver drug and alcohol treatment by collaborating with others to deliver a continuum of care that improves the health of our community. When patients ne ed additional care, Scripps has linked itself to t wo separate treatment programs designed to meet the community needs. B ETTY FORD CENTER In 2016, Scripps partnered with the Betty Ford Center, which expanded its drug and alcohol treatment programming into San Diego. This treatment center brings world-renowned alcohol and drug rehab to more people through weekday and weeknight outpatient services. F AMILY HEALTH CENTERS OF SAN DIEGO Family Health Centers of San Diego provides an array of services, including outpatient drug and alcohol treatment along with medication- assisted treatment and harm reduction programs. Their services also include individual counseling and one- on-one support, educational sessions, HIV resting, Hepatitis B & C testing and treatment. OPIOID STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM (OSP) Cal Hospital Compare (CHC), a nonprofit organization that provides Californians with hospital performance ratings, has named all four of Scripps Health's hospitals to its 2020 Opioid Care Honor Roll. Scripps is the only health care organization in San Diego County to be recognized on the inaugural statewide list . The 2020 Opioid Care Honor Roll recognize d 53 California hospitals for their progress and performance in promoting 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 115 safe and effective opioid use, providing treatment for patients with opioid use disorder and providing access to naloxone to prevent opioid overdoses. According to state data, over 2, 400 Californians died of an opioid- related overdose in 2018. CHC recognized Scripps for taking a variety of approaches to address overuse of opioids among its patients. For patients being discharged from an emergency department visit or hospital stay, Scri pps has created educational videos that it makes available for viewing and has also set opioid prescription quantity limits at discharge. In addition, some Scripps hospital emergency departments have implemented medication- assisted therapy, in which specially licensed ER physicians can administer medications as a bridge for patients with opioid use disorder until they can receive further care. The Opioid Stewardship Program has spearheaded multiple projects at Scripps to educate patients and providers about the risks of opioids and the benefits of alternative multi- modal pain management options to reduce opioid use. The program has established prescribing standards for opioids, resulting in a reduction in the number of opioid pills per prescription at Scripps hospitals and outpatient centers. Scripps has drug take-back kiosks at its on -site pharmacies, offering patients year -round access to dispose of unused, unneeded or outdated medications. Additionally, Scripps provides a range of non- pharmaceutical pain management therapies, including music and pet therapy, ice and heat treatment, spiritual care and more. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 116 SOCIAL DE TERMINANTS O F HEALTH Per Section 2, Community H ealth Needs A ssessment ( CHNA), i n addition to the he alth needs t hat w ere identified in the CHNA, s ocial det erminants o f health (SDOH ) wer e also identifie d in all the co mmunity en gagement ac tivities.

FOOD INSECURITY Food Insecurity is the inability to afford enough food for an active, healthy life. The HASD&IC 2019 CHNA identified food insecurity and access to healthy food as a social determinant impacting San Diego's priority health needs . According to the research from the San Diego Hunger Coalition, alm ost half a million San Diegans,1 in 7 residents, or 15 percent of the San Diego County population are considered food insecure, an economic and social condition characterized by limited or uncertain access to adequate food. Half of adults experiencing food insecurity are living with a disability. (San Diego Hunger Coalition, 2019). To put the total number of food insecure San Diegans into perspective, it is roughly equivalent to the entire populations of Chula Vista, Oceanside, Imperial Beach, Coronado, and Solana Beach combined. Rates in Imperial County are even higher, with 17% of the general population suffering food insecurity. Even more alarming is that the rate of food insecurity among children in Imperial County is the highest in California at over 33%. In San Diego County: 14% of people experience food insecurity, 1 in 7 people 22% of children are in food insecure households, more than 1 in 5 children 9% of seniors experience food insecurity, 1 in 11 seniors. 38 Gundersen C, Ziliak JP (2015) \"Food Insecurity Affairs. 2015. 34(11): 1830- 1839 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 118 In addition, s tudies demonstrate that hunger significantly impacts health. Lack of access to healthy food, often due to availability and cost, are stressors that contribute to diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and other behavioral health issues in a myriad of ways: Food insecure adults with diabetes have higher average blood sugars. Food i nsecure adults are more likely to be obese. Food insecurity is significantly more prevalent in adults with mood disorders. Food insecurity is associated with increased risk of suicidal thought s and substance use in adolescents. Food insecure seniors have a significantly higher likelihood of heart disease,depression and limited activities of daily living. Food insecure adults delay buying food in order to purchase medications. CAL-FRESH PROGRAM The CalFresh Program, federally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), issues monthly electronic benefits that can be used to buy food at participating markets and stores. In San Diego County, an estimated additional 185,000 people are \"food secure\" but rely on CalFresh and/or WIC to supplement their food budget. This represents 96,000 adults and 89,000 children who are at risk of food insecurity should they lose CalFresh or WIC benefits. The total population in San Diego County tha t is either food insecure or food secure with CalFresh or WIC assistance is 671,000 or 1 in 5 people. Federal Reduced- Price Meals program (FRPM) According to a report released in 2019 by the San Diego County Childhood Obesity Initiative , www.sdcoi.org , the effect of poverty and food insecurity on students' overweight and obesity rates can perhaps most profoundly be observed when looking at districts with high concentrations of students enrolled in the Federal Reduced- Price Meals program (FRPM). All students can participate in school nutrition programs; however, students with family incomes under 130% of the Federal Poverty Level are eligible for free meals, and those with incomes between 130% and 185% of the poverty level are eligible for low -cost (or \"reduced price\") meals. Students enrolled in this program not only come from lower income households but are also likely to be food insecure. Fifty percent, or half of all students in San Diego County are enrolled in the Federal Reduced- Price Meals Program . (California Department of Education. 2018- 2019 Student Poverty FRPM Data) 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 119 The programs highlighted below are ways that Scripps Health is addressing food insecurity, screenings and eligibility benefits . SCRIPPS HEALTH CALFRESH SCREENINGS As health care delivery systems moves towards a population health paradigm that incentivizes keeping patient's healthy, hospitals and clinics are recognizing the significance of addressing social determinants of health, such as Food Insecurity (FI). Hospitals have been more proactive in intervening at some level of care to aid the individuals suf fering from FI and their ability to gain control over their health. Accordingly, food assistance provided by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) \u2014known as CalFresh in California, significantly reduces the rate and severity of poverty throughout the state (California Budget & Policy Center, 2018). While SNAP and Women's, Infants, Children (WIC) have been successful in assisting low - income children and their families with additional funding for purchasing healthy foods, there is evidence that suggests screening for FI in healthcare settings is the best indicator for patients to access food- related assistance. As mentioned in section three of the report, the Public Resource S pecialist (PRS) Team screen all uninsured patients who have received services at any of the five Scripps hospital facilities. Scripps Health began screening for CalFresh in June 2017 through the support of the PRS team. The team has been successful in having the important conversation about food insecurity with patients and screened a total of 1,274 individuals in FY20. Refer to T able 4.6 for a breakdown of Scripps CalFresh screenings. TABLE 4.6. SCRIPPS CALFRESH SCREENINGS .

FOOD FINDERS - RESCUING FOOD, REDUCING HUNGER Scripps Corporate Food Service partnered with Food Finders, a multi -regional food bank and food rescue program that connects businesses to charitable institutions in need of donations. Food Finders connected Scripps with Interfaith Community Services in Escondido, which distributes food to people in need. All leftover food from Scripps Corporate facilities is packaged, picked up each day and transferred to the Scripps 4S Ranch Food and Nutrition Services freezer for storage. The cost is minimal, as Scripps uses the same amount of labor to package the food as it would to dispose of it, and unsold \"grab and go\" items are already packaged. Interfaith Community Services picks up the frozen food twice per week and transports it to one of their facilities to help feed the community. Between food donated by Scripps and others, Interfaith distributes an average of 126,000 hot meals and packed lunches and 23,000 emergency meals, feeding approximately 17,000 people every year. COOKING FOR HEALTH Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine and Bastyr University's Master of Science in Nutrition for Wellness Program collaborate on offering free classes that teach individuals how to make vegetarian and vegan meals that are delicious and easy to 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 121 prepare.

NORTH COUNTY LIFELINE Scripps made a sponsorship to the North County Lifeline to assist with pandemic community needs. North County Lifeline's mission is to build self -reliance among youths, adults, and families through high- quality, community -based services. North County Lifeline expands housing to victims of human trafficking, expands counseling and behavioral health programs for adults in the criminal justice system and provides support for foster youth and homeless youth and young adults. To meet the growing needs, Lifeline implemented video- based telehealth in March 2020 to continue providing clinical services, as well as in -person support. FATHER JOE'S VILLAGE Scripps made a sponsorship to Father Joe's Village to assist with pandemic community needs such as food insecurity and those experiencing homelessness and poverty. Father Joe's was established in 1950 to serve San Diegans experiencing homelessness and poverty, Father Joe's Villages has grown to include a comprehensive campus and scattered site programs that house over 2,000 people nightly. At least 7,600 people are experiencing homelessness every night in San Diego. People who are homeless are at greater risk of serious illness, mental health issues, substance abuse and violence. ALPHA PROJECT Scripps made a sponsorship to the Alpha Project to assist with pandemic community needs such as food insecurity and those experiencing homelessness and poverty. Alpha Project's mission is to empower individuals, families, and communities by providing work, recovery, housing and support services to people who are motivated to change their lives and achieve self -sufficiency. Founded in 1986 as a simple project offering work opportunities for homeless men, today Alpha Project operates numerous programs serving over 4,000 people daily. The agency has created over 600 units of affordable rental housing projects and has sponsored home ownership programs. FULL ACCESS AND COORDINATED TRANSPORTATION (FACT) INC. In 2019, Scripps entered a partnership with a local nonprofit \u2014 Facilitating Access to Coordinated Transportation ( FACT ) Inc., for on -demand rides for patients . Scripps staff 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 123 relies on FACT to arrange for patients get to appointments and for discharged patients to return home or get to other facilities. This collaborative service has quickly proved to be a reliable, convenient and cost -effective solution to one of the difficult and expensive challenges in accessing medical care transportation. In 2019 Scripps and FACT conducted a pilot project which streamlined a variety of medical transportation options through a single point of contact at FACT. The pilot provided rides for patients including those who needed specialized vehicles or personal assistance to complete the trip. Scripps staff used a single telephone number to contact staff at FACT, who then handled the selection of the appropriate vehicle, equipment and personnel, and dispatched the ride. The pilot resulted in savings in processing time, cost of transportation and it provided the rider with a more reliable and convenient transportation service. The pilot project was partly funded by a Community Enhancement grant awarded to FACT by the County of San Diego. Scripps realized a benefit using F ACT transport as a cost savings rather than using taxi vouchers, as well as trips that could take Scripps staff a great deal of time to find a vendor to do as other vendors may not be able to do trips to the b order or I mperial County as readily . FACT is a cle aringhouse of sorts with multiple vendors and therefore saves the staff time in finding the appropriate transport at the right time. Due to the success of the pilot, Scripps and FACT entered into a new agreement in 2020 that will phase this service to all Scripps hospitals and enable staff to schedule rides via FACT's call center. Transportation is available 7 days a week for Scripps discharged patients to any location within San Diego and beyond. Most rides begin and end at the curbside, however door through door rides, wheelchair accessible rides and gurney rides are available on demand. In Fiscal Year 2020 , FACT provided over 400 rides for Scripps patients throughout San Diego and as far away as Imperial County. The following are the different transportation modalities that FACT -SD provides: Ambulatory - the rider can walk alone to and from the vehicle Curb -to-Curb - the rider will be picked up and dropped off at the curb of the facility/residence Door -to-Door - the rider requires the driver to walk them from the door of the facility/residence to the vehicle and from the vehicle to the door of the facility/residence2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 124 Door -through- Door - the rider requires the driver to come inside the facility and transport them to the vehicle, the driver will drop them off at the door of the facility or residence Accessible vehicles and Mobility Devices - Walker, Cane, Folding Wheelchair, Wheelchair, Scooter, and vehicles equipped with Ramp or Lift Gurney Transportation SCRIPPS EMPLOYEE SPONSORED HOLIDAY DRIVES The holidays inspire many with the spirit of giving, and in a year like no other, generosity was in full force at Scripps throughout the holiday season. One in six people in San Diego County face the threat of hunger every day, and COVID -19 exacerbated foo d insecurity (currently experiencing or at -risk of experiencing hunger) in San Diego. This year, Scripps Health employees donated a total of 3,164 pounds of food to the Jacobs & Cushman San Diego Food Bank, which provides emergency food to 370,000 children and families, active- duty military, and fixed income seniors living in poverty, and 510 pounds of food for Feeding San Diego, which collects and distributes donations to local pantries or others in need. Scripps teams also donated clothing, household necessities and more, including: Alpha Project - an estimated total of 100 pairs of shoes and socks StandUp for Kids - hygiene and snack packs Polinsky Children's Center - toys PROMISES2KIDS - gifts for foster children In addition, Scripps employees \"adopted\" several families in San Diego who were experiencing a tough year. One family, a single mother and her child, were living in a shelter and hiding from her abusive spouse. Another has three children, including a five- year-old recently diagnosed with cancer. Employees also continued their annual tradition of creating goodie bags for children who come in through the emergency department. Donated items include d pencils, stickers, notebooks, craft items and more; staff made more than 200 bags this year . 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 125 FOSTERING VOLUNTEERISM Scripps believes that health improvement begins when people take an active role in making a positive impact on their community. For this reason, Scripps supports volunteer programs for Scripps employees and affiliated physicians who want to make an even larger impact on their community. Scripps matches the talents and interests of employees and physicians with community needs, such as mentoring partnerships with local schools and providing free medical and surgical care for patients in need. In addition to the financial community benefit contributions made during Fiscal Year 2020 , Scripps employees and affiliated physicians donated a significant portion of their personal time volunteering to support Scripps sponsored community benefit programs. With close to 9,554 hours, the estimated dollar value of this volunteer labor is $504,558*, which is not included in the Scripps F iscal Year 2020 community benefit programs and services totals.

Without the ability to train and inspire a new generation of health care providers, or to offer continuing education to existing health care professionals, the quality of health care will be greatly diminished. Medical research also plays an important role in improving the community's overall health by developing new and innovative treatments. Each year, Scripps allocates resources to advance health c are services through clinical research, medical educ ation and health profes sional education. During Fiscal Year 2020 (October 2019 to September 2020), S cripps invested $2 7,934,88440 in profes sional training programs and clinic al research to enhance service delivery and treatment practices in San Diego County. This section highlights some of our professional education and health research activ ities. Table 5.1 and Figure 5.1 in this sectio n hav e a more detailed over view of Fiscal Year 2020 S cripps Professional Education and Health Re search distribution.

Research primarily take place at Scripps Clinical Researc h Services, S cripps Whittier Diabetes Institute, Scripps Genomic Medicine and Scripps Translational Science Institute. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 135 HEALTH PROFESSIONS TRAINING SCRIPPS HEALTH GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION A key component of Scripps Mission is to advance the education of physicians and health care professionals and sponsor graduate medical education. By investing in these areas, we help secure quality care for our community. Scripps has been training future physicians longer than any other i nstitution in San Diego. For more than 70 years physicians in Scripps graduate medical education programs have helped care for underserved populations throughout the region. Scripps has a comprehensive range of graduate medical education programs at Scripps Mercy Hospital, Scripps Family Practice Residency Program and Scripps Green Hospital. Scripps graduate medical education programs are well -known for excellence, provide a hands -on curriculum that focuses on patient -centered care and offer residencies in a variety of practices, including internal medicine, family medicine, podiatry, pharmacy and palliative care. In Fiscal Year 2020, Scripps enrolled a total of 160 residents and 46 fellows throughout the Scripps health system. More details on these programs are included in section eight and nine of the community benefit report. In addition, Scripps has a pharmacy residency program which train residents with Doctor of Pharmacy degrees. UCSD/S CRIPPS HEALTH HOSPICE AND PALLIATIVE MEDICINE FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM The UCSD/Scripps Health Hospice and Palliative Medicine Fellowship Program is a one-year program designed for physicians who wish to become sub- specialists and have a long- term career in hospice and palliative medicine. This is a unique partnership in whic h UCSD and Scripps Health share responsibility for the fellows, with trainees spending equal time in both institutions with all the benefits of both institutions. The fellowship prepares trainees to work in a variety of roles, including leadership positions in the field. Graduates have successfully become hospice medical directors and palliative medicine consultants in outpatient and inpatient settings across the United States. Fellows who complete the UCSD/Scripps Health program are well equipped to practi ce in diverse settings, including acute palliative care units, inpatient consultation, outpatient consultation, patients' homes, and long- term care facilities. SCRIPPS CONFERENCE SERVICES AND CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION (CME) Scripps Conference Services and Continuing Medical Education (CME) is committed to improving the quality of health care and advancing the practice of medicine by providing evidence- based, up- to-date and clinically relevant continuing medical education courses. CME is required for medical credentialing and made available to practitioners on a community -wide basis. Scripps Health is accredited by the Accreditation Council 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 136 for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) to provide AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s) for physicians. Credits for other health professionals are also available.

PULMONARY HYPERTENSION (PH) This conference covered all forms of pulmonary hypertension. Expert faculty discuss ed the epidemiology of PH, how PH is diagnosed, and the poor outcomes associated with PH when left untreated . ANNUAL NATURAL SUPPLEMENTS CONFERENCE It is important for health care providers to receive timely, evidence- based information to address the risks a nd benefits of supplements with their patients. In this dynamic partnership with patients, providers also need information about regulatory issues, drug-nutrient interactions, dosing and product potency. To address these needs, faculty presented clinically relevant information on natural supplements in evidence- based practice, with an emphasis on disease states . PRIMARY CARE SUMMER CONFERENCE (VIRTUAL ) Scripps Health's Primary Care Summer Conference was designed by primary care physicians for primary care physicians and their care team and present ed content from their unique perspective. STUDENT EXPERIENCES WITHIN SCRIPPS Scripps commitment to ongoing learning and health care excellence extends beyond our organization. Our student programs help promote healt h care careers to a new generation, shape the future workforce and develop future leaders in our community. Interacting with health care professionals in the field expands education outside the classroom. Scripps employees play an important role as preceptors by investing their time to create a valuable experience for the community. In Fiscal Year 2020 , Scripps hosted 1,057 students within our system and provided 141,401 development hours spanning nursing and allied health settings.

COVID-19 RESEARCH The following are COVID -19 research efforts that generated generalizable knowledge and w ere made available to the public. From education and prevention to research news, Scripps is committed to keeping the community up to date on the battle against 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 144 COVID -19. Projects are being led by Scripps Health or co -led by Scripps Clinical and Translational Science Award ( CTSA ) supported investigators. SCRIPPS HUB ACADEMIC RESEARCH CORE (SHARC) The Scripps Hub Academic Research Core (SHARC) team is a partnership between the Scripps Research Translational Institute and Scripps Health (housed in the Scripps Whitter Diabetes Institute). The Scripps Hub is one of 60 sites around the country that are supported by the NIH's Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA), with a focus on improving the process of trans lating research from bench- side to practice. Within this hub, the SHARC team aims to support translational research at Scripps Health and the Scripps Research Translational Institute in the following ways: Research navigation - Provide assistance through the grant process (from pre- to post -award) and with research implementation, especially for junior or new investigators Statistical support - Provide statistical support for designing the study, from sample size and power calculations through data analysis and presentation Community engagement - Encourage bidirectional communication between communities and researchers to foster participation in research, sharing anddiscussion of research questions and findings, and improve community health VIRTUAL COMMUNITY TOWN HALLS ON COVID-19 RESEARCH The Scripps Hub Academic Research Core (SHARC) is supported by the Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) Program, which is funded by the National Institutes of Health. The CTSA seeks to speed up the development of new resources and treatments to help improve the health of individuals and the general public. The SHARC team is available to provide knowledge, skills, and resources in community and collaboration, statistics, and how to navigate a research grant. The team is a collaboration between the Scripps Research Translational Institute and Scripps Health. In August, 2020, Scripps Hub Academic Research Core, Scripps Research and the San Diego County COVID -19 Health Equity Task Force collaborated on a 3- part series of virtual community town halls to discuss topics such as the disproportionate impact of COVID -19 on diverse communities, the importance of being represented in COVID -19 research (such as the local vaccine trials and plasma study, how contact t racing works, and what county resources are available to stay safe and healthy during this time. Over 300 community members registered for the series. Each town hall (provided in English, 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 145 Spanish, and Tagalog) had time for Q&A moderated by the San Diego Union Tribune's biotech reporter. SCRIPPS WHITTIER INSTITUTE FOR DIABETES - DULCE DIGITAL -COVID AWARE (DD- CA) DISCHARGE TEXTING PLATFORM FOR US/M EXICO BORDER HISPANICS WITH DIABETES + COVID-19 The Scripps Whittier Institute for Diabetes received grant approval by the National Institutes for Health (NIH) for the \"Dulce Digital -COVID Aware Discharge (DD- CA)\" - a texting platform for US/Mexico border Hispanics with diabetes and COVID -19. \"The prima ry goal of DD -CA is to use a texting platform to improve communications to guide recently discharged patients with diabetes . The Dulce Digital- COVID Aware Discharge (DD-CA) program aims to improve glucose control and reduce readmission rates and COVID -19 transmission after patients leave the hospital. DD -CA combines culturally and linguistically relevant diabetes and COVID -19 educational messaging with glucose management support in a low -cost, easily adoptable platform to address specific barriers in underrepresented Hispanic and Latino communities. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH (NIH) COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT ALLIANCE (CEAL) The National Institutes of Health (NIH) launched the Community Engagement Alliance (CEAL) Against COVID -19 Disparities to provide COVID -19 outreach and engagement to racial/ethnic minority communities that have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic and are underrepresented in clinical trials. CEAL's mission is to provide trustworthy information through active community engagement and outreach to the people hardest -hit by the COVID -19 pandemic, including African Americans, Hispanic/Latinos and American Indians/Alaska Natives, with the goal of building long-lasting partnerships as well as improving diversity and inclusion in research response to COVID -19. CEAL awards were made to eleven different statewide teams, including California. Scripps Health, represented by the Scripps Hub Academic Research Core (SHARC) team, has partnered with the San Diego County COVID -19 Equity Task Force to reach San Diego communities as part of the California CEAL Team award. The SHARC team has previously partnered with the task force to deliver virtual community town halls on COVID -19 and will continue to provide outreach through virtual events and safely redesigned health and resource fairs to assess COVID -19 knowledge and perceptions about clinical trials. Supporting this NIH -wide effort are the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 146 CONVALESCENT PLASMA THERAPY STUDY During the early period of the pandemic, small studies suggested that COVID -19 patients could benefit from convalescent plasma, which is blood plasma obtained from patients who have recovered from the virus and has protective antibodies. The Mayo Clinic is conducting a nationwide convalescent plasma therapy study in which plasma donated by recovered patients is transfused into high- risk or severely ill COVID- 19 patients. Another multicenter national study, PassItOn (Passive Immunity Trial for Our Nation), is a randomized study that tests convalescent plasma in hospitalized COVID -19 patients; one group receives the plasma, while a control group receives fluids with vitamins. Scripps Health is participating in both studies. To learn more about these studies, visit https://www.uscovidplasma.org and https://passitonstudy.org .

Nevertheless, the service is provided because it meets an identified community need, which if no longer offered would either be unavailable in the area or fall to government or another not -for-profit organization. Subsidized services do not include ancillary services that support lines, such as lab and radiology (if these services are provided to low -income persons, they are reported as charity care/financial assistance). The total expense for subsidized health services for Scripps Mercy Fiscal Y ear 2020 was $ 3,680,538 See Figure 8 .1 for Scripps Subsidized Health Distribution. This includes Scripps I npatient Behavioral Health and Scripps Resident Clinic at Family Health Centers. Scripps offers inpatient adult behavioral health services at the Scripps Mercy Hospital, San Diego campus. The Scripps Mercy Behavioral Health Program also actively supports community programs to reduce the stigma of mental illness and help affected individuals live and work in the community. 340 B DRUG PRICING PROGRAM AND IN-LIEU OF FUNDS Scripps Mercy Hospital San Diego and Chula Vista participate in the 340B Drug Pricing Program administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration. Designated as a disproportionate share hospital (DSH), Scripps Mercy is eligible to purchase outpatient drugs at a reduced price, allowing it to stretch scarce federal resources as far as possible, reaching more eligible patients, and providing more compr ehensive services. Scripps Mercy provides care to a large number of patients who either lack health insurance or are covered through a government subsidy program. One-way Scripps Mercy provides care to some of our most needy patients is through in- lieu of funds. In- lieu of funds are used for unfunded or underfunded patients and their post-discharge needs. Funds are used for board and care, skilled nursing facilities, long- term acute care and home health. In addition, funds are also used for medications, equipment and transportation services. The total subsidized expense for in -lieu of funds for Mercy Hospital San Diego and Chula Vista during Fiscal Year 2020 was $ 1,036,031. 2021 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 172 SCRIPPS RESIDENT CLINIC AT THE HILLCREST FAMILY HEALTH CENTER In January 2019, the Scripps Mercy Hospital moved its Internal Medicine ambulatory teaching clinics from Scripps Mercy Hospital Mercy Clinic to Hillcrest Family Health Center . This is a facility within the network of Family Health Centers of San Diego (FHCSD); a Scripps Resident Clinic was incorporated into the operation of the FHCSD Hillcrest Family Health Center. This move expands the existing affiliation between Scripps Mercy Hospital and Family Health Centers of San Diego to include the GME outpatient clinical rotation for Internal Medicine. The GME affi liation with FHCSD is a significant opportunity for our patients to have access to much more comprehensive interdisciplinary care with multiple additional modalities available, including Behavioral Health, Dental, Social Work and Care Coordination, to name a few. It is also an opportunity for our Residents to learn more about functioning in an interdisciplinary setting and collaborating with other healthcare providers. The affiliation with FHCSD has improved the patient's transition of care from the Hospital's inpatient setting to outpatient / follow -up care with the support of FHCSD Care Coordination processes. Once the new, comprehensive cancer center is built on the Mercy Hospital Campus, there will be expand learning opportunities for our Residents, and future careers in Hematology/Oncology. The agreement to co -locate the GME program with Family Health Centers of San Diego (FHCSD) is an expansion of an ongoing, successful relationship with this federal ly qualified health center. Scripps and FHCSD already work together in a number of areas that benefit the medically underserved, including a pediatric residency training program, a collaborative prenatal care and delivery program, a coordinated behavioral health program, and emergency room referrals for patients without medical homes. This program has given its patients access to increased services, including case management, onsite psychiatric services, dental care, onsite phlebotomy, adjacent HIV/AIDS/Hepatitis C treatment, physical therapy, acupuncture, sports medicine and other services. From a GME perspective, this is an opportunity for our residents to practice within a broader interdisciplinary setting and regularly collaborate with other community health care providers. Subspecialty teaching is provided to the Family Medicine Residents by Scripps Mercy subspecialty faculty. In addition, since 2013, Scripps Mercy Medical Education has supported the Teaching Health Centers Family Medicine Residency at Family Health Centers, with all inpatient teaching except for Pediatrics occurring at Scripps Mercy Hospital San Diego. 2021 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 173 BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INPATIENT PROGRAMS Individuals suffering from acute psychiatric disorders are sometimes unable to live independently or may even pose a danger to themselves or others. In such cases, hospitalization may be the most appropriate alternative. Scripps Mercy Hospital's Behavioral Health Inpatient Program helps patients and their loved ones work through short -term crises, manage mental illness and resume their daily lives. Behavioral Health Challenges Like many behavioral health programs across the country, funding is difficult, as payment rates have not kept pace with the cost to provide care. In Fiscal Year 2020, the Scripps Mercy Behavioral Health Program experienced a $3.4 million loss in total operations with $2.2 million of this loss being captured in Medi -Cal/CMS and charity care. In Fiscal Year 2020, 1.2 percent of patients in the inpatient unit were uninsured. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COLLABORATION Scripps will be partnering w ith Acadia- Healthcare Company, Inc. to develop a new inpatient behavioral health facility in Chula Vista. The facility will provide treatment for three times as many patients as existing behavioral health unit at Scripps Mercy San Diego. Acadia provides behavioral health services through a network of 586 health care facilities with approximately 18,000 beds in 40 states, the United Kingdom and Puerto Rico. This new center which is planned to open in 2023 will serve as a regional resource to meet the needs of patients across San Diego County and will be operated through a joint venture between Scripps and Acadia. Scripps continues to offer behavioral health support at all hospital emergency departments and urgent care centers on an ongoing basis.

Developing unique and innovative clinical programs and community -based research is urgently needed to combat this epidemic. The diabetes and obesity epidemic have a disproportionate impact on low -income ethnic groups, yet there is little research demonstrating clinically and cost -effective care and treatment models for these populations. Diabetes leads to school and work absenteeism, elevated hospitalization rates, frequent emergency room visits, permanent physical disabilities and sometimes death. Diabetes is an important health issue because of its prevalence, its impact on morbidity and mortality, and its preventability. Diabetes is a major cause of heart disease and stroke and an analysis of mortality data for San Diego County found that in 2016 'Diabetes mellitus' was the seventh leading cau se of death. The percentage of adults aged 20 and older who have ever been diagnosed wit h diabetes was 9.4% in 2017. In San Diego County diabetes has been steadily rising since 2005 according to the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. Type 2 diabetes is an important target for intervention because hospitalizations due to diabetes related complications are potentially preventable with proper management and a healthy lifestyle More than 1 out of 3 adults have prediabetes and 15 -30% of those with prediabetes will develop Type 2 diabetes within 5 years. This is especially true in the South Bay 2021 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 212communities i n San D iego.

Scripps System wide Programs 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 221 SCRIPPS SYSTEM WIDE PROGRAMS ABOUT SCRIPPS SYSTEM WIDE PROGRAMS Scripps supports number of programs that meet the health care needs of patients and community members throughout San Diego County. These include programs operated by Seaport Scripps Home Health, Scripps MD Anderson Cancer C enter , the Scripps Clinical Resea rch Center and Scripps System wide Community Benefit Services. SCRIPPS MD ANDERSON CANCER CENTER In 2016, Scripps Health and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center announced a partnership agreement to create a comprehensive and clinically integr ated cancer center in San Diego, to be known as Scripps MD Anderson Cancer Center. This new center combined Scripps leading knowledge with MD Anderson's world- renowned expertise, best practices and guidelines to serve patients in San Diego and Southern California. Scripps MD Anderson is committed to fighting cancer through a collaborative, team approach that puts the patient at the center of care. Scripps and MD Anderson are both nationally recognized leaders in cancer therapy and are combining their strength to bring some of the most advanced cancer care available to San Diego. Scripps MD Anderson physicians and staff work collaboratively toward cancer prevention, early detection, coordinated treatment and community support services, and are actively involved in leading- edge clinical, translational and basic research. Additional resources include specialized breast care centers, infusion clinics, nurse navigators, rehabilitation services, support groups and Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine. SCRIPPS MD ANDERSON CANCER CENTER SUPPORT GROUP PROGRAMS Through generous community support , Scripps MD Anderson Cancer Center can provide a wide range of support services and patient assistance programs. Throughout the system, oncology social workers or oncology nurse navigators provide counseling services and guidance regarding transportation, housing, homecare, financial , benefits, emotional concerns and other issues. Free professionally facilitated support groups sponsored by the cancer center meet regularly at various locations to help patients and loved ones find support, guidance and encouragement. Free educational workshops are held at various sites. SCRIPPS MD ANDERSON CANCER REGISTRY Since 1975, the Scripps Cancer Registry has been collecting cancer data on Scripps patients for research, epidemiological studies, education and patient treatment. Analysis of this data gives Scripps physicians the ability to measure the quality and effect iveness 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 222 of the care cancer patients receive within the Scripps system. Data also aids in determining which Cancer Center programs should be developed or further expanded. SCRIPPS CLINICAL RESEARCH SERVICES (CRS) Research and clinical discovery have been p art of Scripps Health's mission since its founding in 1924. In partnership with the Scripps Clinical Medical Group (SCMG) via the Research Innovation Committee (RIC), Clinical Research Services consolidates and expands access to clinical research trials for SCMG physicians and patients across the Scripps system. The mission of the RIC is to provide comprehensive oversight, allocation of resources for research. CRS is a unit established to provide expert support for SCMG physicians, so that they may provide patients with access to new and emerging treatment opportunities when appropriate. In addition, there are several specialties with nationally accredited continuing and graduate medical education programs supported through the RIC and CRS . In 2018, the Research Innovation Committee was created to support clinical research throughout the Scripps Clinic practices and locations. Currently there are more than 25+ Scripps Clinic medical specialties under one operations team. As a result, we are able accelerate the access to new technologies for patients by consolidating the various components of clinical investigation into a seamless, streamlined regulatory, operational, and administrative process. Scripps continues building in its strong foundation for clinical and translational research through small pilot studies to large multicenter trials placed at various locations across the system, engaging both inpatient and outpatient settings. As ambulatory -based research increases across the system, RIC, Scripps Clinic and CRS support more than 92 principal investigators and about 450 active clinical research protocols crossing interdisciplinary disease categories.

SRTI is dedicated to accelerating the \"translation\" of basic laboratory discoveries into clinical trials and ultimately approved treatments. Under the direction of Scripps Research, SRTI is supported in part by the National Institutes of Health Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA). A five-year, $20 million grant to support translational clinical research, infrastructure and training first awarded in 2008 was renewed in 2013 and renewed again in 2018 for its 3 rd five-year NIH grant through 2023 for $31.5 million. The Community Engagement Program for this award is led by Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute which has provided the San Diego community with the most advanced diabetes care, education, research and support for more than 30 years at Scripps Health. In the last two years with grant support, the community engagement core has evolved and grown into the Scripps Hub Academic Research Core (SHARC), to broaden its research support beyond diabetes and cardiometabolic disease to include nearly all disease states (e.g. cancer, orthopedics, transplant, allergy/immunology, dermatology and many more) across the Scripps health system. The team now includes a research navigator, biostatistician, and community engagement program manager that provide consultations and guidance in ex panding the research platform within Scripps and the San Diego community. The SHARC team enhances the involvement of community and clinicians in all areas of translational and transformational research. Scripps supports community -engaged research that aim to bring researchers and community partners together to share their knowledge, skills and resources with a common goal of improving community health. Over the last two decades, health research and practice has increasingly employed community -engaged resear ch methods, defined as \"the process of working collaboratively with and through groups of people affiliated by 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 224 geo graphic proximity, special interests, or similar situations to address issues affecting the well -being of those people.\" The Scripps Whittier Diabetes Institute (SWDI), in partnership with the San Diego State University South Bay Latino Research Center have several recent examples of innovative community -engaged research projects. These include three, five- year awards from the National institutes of Health worth nearly $9M to develop culturally tailored interventions to improve outcomes for diverse, predominantly underserved individuals living with chronic cardiometabolic conditions. The first award trains medical assistants to provide health coaching to patients with T ype 2 diabetes as part of routine primary care in two diverse health systems i.e., Scripps Health and Neighborhood Healthcare, a federally qualified health system that provides care to a low income, predominantly Hispanic, patient population. The second study uses mobile health (mHealth) technology to deliver a personalized, diabetes self -management education and support program to Hispanic patients with poorly controlled T ype 2 diabetes. The final award evaluates Mi Puente, or \"My Bridge,\" which is a Behavioral Health Nurse + Community Mentor approach to prevent hospital readmissions and improve quality of life among Hispanics with multiple chronic conditions and behavioral health concern(s) admitted to a safety -net hospital near the US -Mexico border.

The projects that received funding address some of San Diego's County's high- priority health needs. The goal is to improve access to vital health care services for a variety of at -risk populations, including the homeless, economically disadvantaged, mentally ill and others. Since the Community Benefit Fund began, Scripps has awarded $4.1 million dollars. P rograms funded during Fiscal Year 2020 include: 2-1-1 COMMUNITY INFORMATION EXCHANGE 2-1-1 S an Diego serves all of San Diego County, including the population served by Scripps, as the region's trusted primary connection to more than 6,000 community,health and disaster services in more than 200 languages, 24 hours a day. In addition, 2-1- 1 San Diego operates a 2-1- 1 information hotline (Call Center) in the San Diego and Imperial County. Call C enter services are designed to help members of the general public (\"Clients\") to connect with community resources to assist Clients obtain medical care, mental health services, housing, food, clothing, government benefits, among other things. 2-1- 1 San Diego has expanded its referral services to include direct referral of Clients to community resources and access to the Community 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 232 I nformation Exchange (CIE) Database. The CIE is an ecosystem comprised of multidisciplinary network partners that use a shared language, a resource database, and an integrated technology platform to deliver enhanced community care planning. Care planning tools enable partners to integrate data from multiple sources and make bi-directional referrals to create a shared longitudinal record. By focusing on these core components, a CIE enables communities to shift away from a reactive approach to providing care toward proactive, holistic, person- centered care. The CIE database serves as a directory of participating professionals, agencies and businesses providing services that relate to the social determinants of health. The database also serves as a source of information about the client's social determinants of health and current needs and is used to help the client access community resources suitable to address those needs. 2-1-1 San Diego has partnered with Scripps since 2011 to provide care coordination services to clients in need of health navigation support. In Fiscal Year 2020 funding was awarded to 211 San Diego to pilot the CIE at the Scripps Mercy hospital location.

CATHOLIC CHARITIES The partnership continued to provide short -term emergency shelter for medically fragile, homeless patients being discharged fro m Scripps Mercy Hospital San Diego and Chula Vista campuses . Case management and shelter are provided for previously homeless patients discharged from Scripps Mercy Hospital who no longer require hospital care but still need a short -term, supportive environment. Patients demonstrating a readiness for change are assisted with one week in a hotel along with food and bus fare to pursue a case plan. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 233 T he focus of the case management is to stabilize the client by helping them connect to more permanent income sources, housing, and ongoing support for self -reliance. The goal of this partnership is to reduce the incidence of ER recidivism and improve quality of life for the patients. CONSUMER CENTER FOR HEALTH EDUCATION AND ADVOCACY (CCHEA) Funding provides low income, uninsured Mercy Clinic and behavioral health patients help obtaining health care benefits, SSI and related services, while reducing uncompensated care expenses at Mercy. This Medical Legal Partnership places Consumer Center staff onsite at Scripps Mercy Hospital within the Behavioral Health Unit and provides accessible legal assistance, in addition to receiving direct referrals from other Scripps facilities. The project provides advocacy services for time intensive government benefit cases and the Consumer Center stresses the importance of accessing community- based services for routine health care instead of using the ED's and hospital departments as well as the importance of establishing medical homes. E RIC PAREDES SAVE A LIFE FOUNDATION Each year, 7,000 teens lose their lives due to sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). SCA is not a heart attack, it is caused by an abnormality in the heart's electrical system that can easily be detected with a simple Electrocardiogram (EKG). Unfortunately, heart screenings are not part of a regular, well -child exam or pre- participation sports physical. The first symptom of SCA could be death. San Diego alone loses three to five teens from SCA annually. Scripps funding assists with screening for youth athletes countywide. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 234 CANCER/ONCOLOGY In 2018 cancer w as the leading cause of death in San Diego County, responsible for 23.1 percent of deaths.

Scripps MD Anderso n Cancer Care offers support for people living with cancers, including breast, gynecologic and head and neck, as well as services to help with emotional, psychological, financial and lifestyle as aspects of cancer. Although due to COVID -19 meetings were suspended temporarily for most of the year as there was restricted access to the hospital patients had the ability to join online support groups offered by MD Anderson Cancer Center as part of our partnership. The sessions were facilitated by MD Anderson social work counselors and provided an opportunity for patients, family members and friends to meet others in similar circumstances, develop new relationships and find out how others cope during this time of increased distress. SCRIPPS MD ANDERSON CANCER CENTER SURVIVORSHIP PROGRAM Scripps MD Anderson patients and their families can take part in free survivorship programs though San Diego YMCA and Livestrong Foundation. Focusing on physical activity and well- being, the program helps adult cancer survivors achieve their holistic health goals. SCRIPPS MD ANDERSON CANCER SURVIVORS DAY Survivors Day is a time to recognize the nation's 15.5 million cancer survivors, to focus attention on issues of survivorship, and to acknowledge medical professionals dedicated to cancer treatment, research and support services. National Cancer Survivors Day events are held in hundreds of communities nationwide throughout the mont h of June. Scripps holds a celebratory event at various Scripps hospitals each year to provide an opportunity for those that have battled cancer to come together and enjoy the company of friends, family and the camaraderie of fellow cancer survivors. Canc er survivors and other guests share inspirational stories learn about advances in cancer treatment and research and enjoy the opportunity to connect with caregivers and fellow survivors. Each year the cancer survivor event helps celebrate life, inspire those recently diagnosed, offer support to family and loved ones and recognize all who provided support along the way. They also provide a forum for discussing the physical, financial and social issues that many cancer survivors face following completion of treatment. Events were held online this year to ensure safety and reduce the spread of COVID -19. In partnership with MD Anderson Cancer C enter the following were some of the topics presented; building your own vision board at home, history of labyrinths, music and mindfulness exercise, Anticancer Living: Transform Your Life and H ealth with the Mix of S ix yoga breathing exercises and chair yoga. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 236 CARDIOVASCULA R DISEASE 'Diseases of the he art' were the se cond leading cause of death i n San Diego County i n 2018.

During Fiscal Year 20 20, Scripps en gaged in the following heart health and cardiovascular di sease pr eventi on and treatment activities. THE ERI C PAREDES SAVE A LIFE FOUNDATION Each year, 7,000 teens l ose their l ives d ue to su dden cardiac arrest (SCA). S CA is not a heart at tack, i t is cause d by an abnormality in the heart's el ectrical system t hat ca n easily be det ected with a simple e lectrocardiogram ( EKG).

Studies show cardiac consideration is an often- overlooked area of assessment. The training module reviews SCA warning signs, risk factors and recommended diagnostic testing protocol. The CME development was directed and narrated by Dr. John Rogers, Scripps Cardiologist and EP Save A Life Medical Direc tor, and Scripps Health was instrumental in facilitating engagement in both a front -end needs assessment and in participation in the training module through direct communication with PCPs. Funding supported development and promotion of the training module on a local, state and national level, with the San Diego chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Given early data suggests COVID -19 can lead to heart damage and professional medical associations have released recommendations for cardiac assessment of student athletes who've been exposed before returning to play, this training supports a critical skill set for PCPs. The Scripps participation in live CME events/early n eeds assessment of total participants was 45%. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 238 EMERGENCY AND DISASTER PREPAREDNESS SCRIPPS MOBILIZATION TO FIGHT THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC Across the Scripps Health system, doctors, nurses, caregivers and support staff rallied and worked together, some on the front lines and some behind the scenes, united in caring for our community during the fast -moving and rapidly changing COVID -19 national health crisis. As cases of the new coronavirus first appeared in the country, Scripps clinical and administrative leaders mobilized with both short - and long- term strategies to deal with the spread of COVID -19. In February 2020, Scripps began to build up supplies and equipment, and implement protocols for delivering care to infected patients. In early March, Scripps prepared for a surge of COVID -19 patients by cancelling non- essential surgeries, activating the 24- hour corporate command center, and launching enhanced protective precautions for staff above and beyond Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines. Also, at that time, an important collaboration was launched among the hospitals and health systems across the region, to monitor cases, discuss clinical care, assess resources, equipment and supplies, and work together for our community. Command Centers Scripps responded by setting up a corporate command center, and satellite commands at all its hospitals, to coordinate its response. The corporate command center was set up in two rooms to support social distancing and safety protocols included experts on infection control, logistics, communication, and other key areas. COVID -19 Nurse Line Scripps made hundreds of adjustments, large and small, to manage its response to the coronavirus pandemic. To support patients with symptoms, Scripps established the first COVID -19 Nurse Line in San Diego County with a staff of around 60. The dedicate d help line was staffed to answer questions and screen concerned callers to reduce the influx of potential COVID -19 patients at Scripps locations. The first day phones were operational, the team fielded 2,000 calls. Callers identified as having significant symptoms were connected with health care providers via phone or video for further evaluation, and some are directed to outdoor testing cabanas. Testing and Surge Tents as Testing Cabanas Testing for the presence of the COVID -19 virus is important in understanding and controlling the spread of the virus. Scripps was an early provider of COVID -19 testing in 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 239 our region. A Scripps testing \"turning point\" was its launch of the fastest available molecular point of care test for detecting COVID -19 for patients and those admitted to all five Scripps hospitals. Scripps set up surge tents outside hospital emergency departments and clinic urgent care centers for intake of patients with COVID -19 symptoms. This provided a safe health care environment for potential coronavirus patients, while offering distancing from patients receiving other types of health care. Testing cabanas were also set up to add capacity. This process was linked to the nurse call line so that patients could access Scripps via virtual visits and, if needed, then make an appointment, drive to a cabana, and staff with proper equipment would go to their car and take a sample. Community Support When the first cases of COVID -19 appeared in the region, Scripps took initiative to bolster its supplies and equipment in anticipation of the disease spreading, but still needed help. Once Scripps put out a call for community donations, individuals and local businesses were quick to provide. From personal protective equipment and N95 masks to cleaning materials, medical devices, individual meals and cash contributions. The following are estimated donations collected as of May 2020. Community Donations to Scripps COVID -19 Response Fund - $3,413,300 N95 Masks and Other Protective Masks - 116,103 Gloves, Gowns, Shoe Covers and Surgical Caps - 166,268 Cleaning Materials - 5,536 Eye Protection - 17,637 Cloth Face Coverings & Scrub Caps - 3,288 Medical Devices - 78 Snacks and Drinks - 200,000+ Meals - 33,15 3 Scripps Employee Food Sharing Program In late April 2020 employees from across the system began reaching out about food resources for colleagues at Scripps. As a result of these mutual concerns the Scripps Employee Food Sharing Program was established, and food distribution events were held on May 23, 2020, June 27, 2020 and July 18, 2020. The Scripps Employee Food Sharing Program successfully distributed food to 270 colleagues who found themselves in need of assistance during this COVID -19 crisis and 149 volunteers participated in the 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 240 distributions.55 Each of these staff m embers received milk, eggs, bread, fruit, vegetables , a box of non-p erishable food and a fres hly prepared meal fr om Colors Caf\u00e9. Many of the recipients shared words of thank s and gratitude to their Scripps family. One even noted how they were appreciative to work for \"such an awesome organization that is there for me when times are tough.\" M any departments wor ked collaboratively to mak e this initiative a success suc h as human resources, food and nutrition services, a nd security and facilities to name a few. The Scripps Leadership Academy alumni also volunteered to help package and dis tribute the food. Much appreciation to the employees, physicians and vendors who donated to the program as their generosity helped to make a difference for many during a difficult time. Collaboration Scripps continues to work collaboratively along with other health systems and government agencies to expand COV ID-19 testing as par t of our ability to contain and significantly reduce COV ID-19 in our region. COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND EDUCATION Having the ability to provide emergency services for thos e injured in a local disaster, while continuing to care for hospitalized patients, is a critical community need. Our employees' connection to our Mission is apparent every day\u2014in cluding during times of crisis. Following the terr orist attacks of September 11, 2001, Scripps developed a system wide disaster preparedness progr am. As part of this effort, Scripps created the volunteer Scripps Medic al Response Team (SMRT). SCRIPPS MEDICAL RESPONSE TEAM (SMRT) Scripps maintains active readiness for the Scripps Medical Response Team (SMRT). The SMRT is available to deploy when the State of California Emergency Medical System Authority (EMSA) activ ates the California Medic al Assistance Team (Cal-M at), and requests team augmentation to respond to an active event like a wildfire or earthquake where medical assistance is needed in the affected area(s ). Due to COVID-1 9, Scripps was not able to participate this year. SMRT includes clinical staff and others from across the organization ready to m obilize during times of crisis to provide care where it's needed. C urrently, the team has 76 active members, plus hundreds of other employees who have joined a reser ve list to volunteer their services. The team has responded to numerous local, national and 55 The expenses associated with the food distribution program were not included as a community benefit expense as the food distribution events were not open to the community and were solely for Scripps employees. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 241 i nternational emergencies. This genuine response in times of need sends a powerful message about the organization's dedication to be helping our community \u2014 and beyond. SAN DIEGO COUNTY NATIONAL COMMUNITY SUPPORT AND OUTREACH EDUCATION Having the ability to provide emergency services to those injured in a local disaster while continuing to care for hospitalized patients is a critical community need. Scripps Health maximizes awar eness and encourages participation in disaster preparedness activities to affect change at the community level. Scripps contributes to the health and safety of the San Diego community through essential emergency and disaster planning activities and service s. Scripps participates in San Diego County and State of California Advisory groups to plan, implement and evaluate key disaster preparedness response plans and exercises. In addition, Scripps is an advisor to San Diego County for federal and state grant d evelopment and planning. In Fiscal Year 2020, Scripps participated in the following: Scripps Health participated in San Diego County Healthcare Disaster Coalitionand State of California advisory groups to plan, implement and evaluate keydisaster preparedness response plans and exercises. Scripps participates in a standardized, on- scene federal emergency management training for hospital leaders titled National Incident Management System/IncidentCommand System/Hospital Incident Command System (HICS) as well as a training focused specifically on HICS, an incident management system that can be used by hospitals to manage threats, planned events or emergencies. Scripps Health is an active member in the Hospital Incident Command System (HICS) National Advisory Committee , and currently working on the review/revision of HICS. Scripps Health participated in the San Diego Regional Full -Scale Exercise on November 6, 2019. The San Diego Regional Full -Scale Exercise was a one- day exercise designed to increase the proficiency of the San Diego Operational Areato respond to mass casualty complex attacks that require a coordinated multi - agency and multi -disciplinary response. Scripps Health participates in the San Diego Healthcare Coalition Advisory Committee. This is a funding workgroup which provides leadership and funding throug h grants and cooperative agreements to states, territories, and eligible municipalities to improve surge capacity and enhance community and hospital preparedness for public health emergencies.2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 242 SCRIPPS DRUG TAKE BACK KIOSKS Scripps has become the first health care provider in the region to offer year -round access to safe, free disposal of unused and outdated prescription medications. Three drug take- back kiosks are available adjacent to on- site ambulatory pharmacies at Scripps Mercy San Diego, Scripps Green and Scripps Encinitas. These drug take-back kiosks are part of the Scripps Opioid Stewardship Program, which aims to reduce the use of opioids and to help prevent patients from becoming dependent on these useful but potent pain reducing medications. 2021 Scripps Health Community Benefit Plan & Report 243 PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION AND HEALTH RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS Quali ty health care is highly dependen t upon health education systems and medical resea rch program s. Withou t the ability to train and inspire a new generation o f health care providers, or offer continuing education to existing health care professionals, the quali ty of health care wou ld be greatly diminished. Medical resea rch a lso plays an importan t role in improving the commun ity's overall health by developing new and innovative treatments. Each year, resou rces are allocated by Scripp s System wide programs and services to advance health care services through professional health education programs and research.

Community Health Needs Assessment R eport (CHNA) - the written report adopted for the hospital facility by an authorized body of the hospital facility. Community H ealth Needs - those requisites for improvement or maintenance of health status in the community. Cost A ccounting - Cost accounting systems generally provide the most accurate portrayal of the true cost of community benefit activities. Measurement of the costs associated with specific activities and programs to provide information meaningful to management. For example, cost accounting is used to determine the amount of an organization's total expense that reasonably can be attributed to community benefit, to assign indirect (overhead) expense to the direct cost of a program, and to estimate the cost associated with serving a subset of patients, such as Medicaid recipients. 2021 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 249 Direct C osts - \"Direct costs\" means salaries and benefits, supplies, and other expenses directly related to the actual conduct of each activity or program.

Donations of supplies (e.g., pharmaceuticals), equipment, or staff time that benefits another organization are examples of in- kind contributions. In community benefit accounting, in- kind contributions are valued fairly. For example, the hospital donates a two- year old computer to a community clinic. The community benefit expense would be $1,000 i f the computer was purchased for $3,000 and after two years of use it has depreciated to a value on the books of the hospital of $1,000. In-Lieu of Funds - Funds used for unfunded or under -funded patients and their post - discharge needs. Funds are used for board and care, skilled nursing facilities, long- term acute care, and home health.

Professional Education and Health R esearch - includes clinical research as well as professional education of non-Scripps employees including graduate medical education (GME), nursing resource development, and other health care profes sional training. Costs for medical residents and interns may be included as health professions educations costs. Calculations based on total program expense. Restricted Contributions (Grants) - Donations, gifts, bequests and other transfers of money or property made by a donor or grantor that has stipulated a temporary or permanent use for the resources provided. Donors or grantors provide restricted contributions with the intent of supporting a particular activity or program. Restrictions generally are stated in writing by the donor or grantor when they make a gift or grant. Subsidized Health S ervices - Patient care services the organization provides despite a financial loss, (even) after removing the effects of charity care and Medi -Cal shortfalls (and bad debt). Clinical programs provided at a loss because they are needed by the community. The service meets an identified community need if it is reasonable to conclude that if the organization no longer offered the service, the service would be unavailable in the community, the community's capacity to provide the service would be below the community's need, or the service would become the responsibility of government or another tax -exempt organization. Example of such services are: inpatient psychiatric unit s, satellite clinics serving low- income communities and burn units. Total Community Benefit E xpense - Total gross expense of the activity incurred during the year. Uncompensated Health C are - Includes charity, under -reimbursed care and bad debt. Shortfalls are derived using the payer based cost allocation methodology. Bad 2021 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 251 debt and charity care are estimated by extracting the gross write offs of bad debt and charity care charges and applying the hospital RCC to estimate net uncompensated cost. Under -Reimbursed C are - Care that is reimbursed below cost by County Medical Services, Medi -Cal and Medi -Cal HMO, Medicare, Medicare PPO, Medicare HMO and SHPS Medicare. Unrestricted Contributions (Grants) - Donations, gifts, bequests and other transfers of money or property that are free from any external restrictions and are available for general use. Volunteer H ours - includes the labor hours contributed by Scripps employees and affiliated physicians i n support of Scripps -sponsored activities for which no compensation is received. The dollar value is not included in Scripps' \"community benefit contribution.\" 2021 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 252 APPENDIX B SCRIPPS UNCOMPENSATED CARE METHODOLOGY FISCAL YEAR 20 20 Scripps continues to contribute resources to provide low and no- cost health care services to populations in need. During fiscal year 2020, Scripps contributed $394,126,261 to uncompensated health care, $18,335,775 in charity care, $361,998,200 in Medi -Cal and Medicare shortfall, and $13,792,287 in bad debt. Schedule H Methodology \u2014 Schedule H requires the uncompensated care to be divided into four categories: Charity care, under -reimbursed Medi -Cal and Other Means - Tested Government Programs, Bad Debt, and under -reimbursed Medicare. Bad debt and Medicare shortfalls are reportable under the Schedule H guidelines but do not count towards the community benefit totals. Thus, the categories are reported in a specific order/hierarchy. Charity Care and under -reimbursed Medi -Cal and Other Means -Tested Government Programs are counted first. Charity Care Methodology \u2014 Uncompensated cost is estimated by applying ratio- cost- to-charge (RCC) percentages for the hospital to the gross charity adjustments. The following c osts are excluded: Community health services, professional education and research, and expenses excluded in the Medicare cost report. Traditional Charity Care is included in the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 990 Schedule H Part I Line 7a. Medi -Cal Sh ortfall \u2014 The shortfall is derived by computing operating margin at the patient level and summarizing the patients with Medicare, Medicare PPO, Medicare HMO, Medicare Capitated program at the hospitals, Medi -Cal, Medi- Cal HMO, and CMS primary insurance carriers. Operating margin is defined as net revenue less all variable, fixed, and overhead costs. Profitability is estimated as follows: Net revenue is equivalent to payments plus an estimation of the account balance for all open accounts, plus revenue from uncompensated care pools including Medi -Cal DSH. Cost is derived using the relative value allocation methodology per the McKesson HPM system. The following costs are excluded: Charity adjustments at cost for Medi -Cal patients, community health services, professional education and research, and expenses excluded in the Medicare cost report. These costs are included in the IRS Form 990 schedule H Part I Line 7b. In the State of California, the Medicaid program is called Medi -Cal. 2021 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 253 Medicare and Medicare HMO Hospitals \u2014 Shortfall is derived by computing operating margin at the patient level and summarizing the patients with Medicare and Medicare Senior primary insurance carriers. Operating margin is defined as net revenue less all var iable, fixed, and overhead costs. Profitability is estimated as follows: net revenue is equivalent to payments plus an estimation of the capitation account balance for all open accounts, plus other revenue including. Cost is derived using the relative value allocation methodology per the McKesson HPM cost accounting system. These costs are included in the IRS Form 990 Schedule H Part III Section B. Bad Debt Methodology \u2014 Uncompensated cost is estimated by applying ratio- cost- to-charge (RCC) percentages for the hospital to the gross bad debt adjustments less recoveries. The following costs are excluded: Bad debt adjustments at cost for Medi -Cal and CMS patients, community health services, professional education and research, and expenses excluded in the Medicare cost report. These costs are included in the IRS Form 990 Schedule H Part III Section A. Shortfall Methodology Clinics \u2014 Shortfall is derived by computing operating margin at the patient level and summarizing the patients with Medicare and Medicare Senior primary insurance carriers. Operating margin is defined as net revenue less all variable, fixed, and overhead costs. Profitability is estimated as follows: net revenue is equivalent to payments plus an estimation of the capitation account balance for all open accounts, plus other revenue including. Cost is derived using the relative value allocation methodology per the McKesson HPM cost accounting system. These costs are included in the IRS Form 990 Schedule H Part III Section B. Provider Relief Fund \u2014 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization designated COVID -19 as a global pandemic. Patient volumes and the related revenue for most services were significantly impacted beginning in mid- March 2020 as various policies were implemented by federal, state and local governments in response to the COVID -19 pandemic, including stay -at-home orders, business closures, social distancing and suspension of elective and nonemergent procedures. Scripps received funding from the CARES Act Provider Relief Fund. These distributions from the Provider Relief Fund are not subject to repayment, provided Scripps is able to attest to and comply with the terms and conditions of the funding, including demonstrating that the distributions received have been used for healthcare- related expenses or lost revenue attributable to COVID 19. The provider relief payments were accounted as a restricted grant and were used to direct offset revenue related to costs. 2021 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 254 Hospital Provider Fee Program The State of California enacted legislation for a provider fee program to fund certain Medi -Cal coverage expansions. The provider fee program charges hospitals a quality assurance fee that is used to obtain federal matching funds for Medi -Cal with the proceeds redistributed as supplemental payments to California hospitals that treat Medi - Cal patients. In February 2020, CMS approved the July 1, 2019 through December 31, 2021 provider fee program. The provider fee programs that had activity in 2019 and 2020 were the 30- month provider fee program covering the period from January 1, 2017, through June 30, 2019, and 30- month provider fee program covering the period from July 1, 2019, through December 31, 2021. The Organization's policy is to recognize program revenues and expenses on the accrual basis once the Federal waiver has been approved. Accordingly, all related supplemental payments have been recognized as revenue and related quality assurance fees have been recognized as expense as of September 30, 2020 and 2019. Federal and state payments received from these programs are included as provider fee revenue in total patient service revenue, and fees paid or payable to the state and California Health Foundation and Trust (CHFT) are included in provider fee expense in operating expenses. 2021 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 255 APPENDIX C 2021 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 256 APPENDIX D SAN DIEGO COUNTY HHSA GEOGRAPHIC SERVICES REGIONS57 Source: County of San Diego: https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/dam/sdc/live_well_san_diego/indicators/Map_and_Re gional_Data.pdf Central North Coastal East North Inland North Central South Central San Diego Mid-City SoutheastSan Diego Carlsbad Del North San Diego Palomar/Julian Pauma Poway Ramona San Marcos Valley Center Coastal Elliott Kearny Mesa Mira Mesa Miramar Peninsula UniversityChula Vista Coronado National City South Bay Sweetwater 57These regions have been designated by the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) for the purpose of service delivery.

In 1994, California legislators passed Senate Bill 697 (SB 697), which requires all private not -for-profit hospitals in the state to conduct a CHNA every three years. Since 1994, these programs have been created based on an assessment of needs identified through hospital data, community input, and major trends. Previous collaborations among not-for-profit hosp itals, healthcare systems, and other community partners have resulted in numerous well regarded Community Health Needs Assessments (CHNA) reports. Information is gathered through the CHNA for the purposes of reporting community benefit, developing strategi c plans, creating annual reports, providing input on legislative decisions, and informing the general community of health issues and trends. Federal Requirements In 2010, Congress added several new requirements for hospital organizations to maintain federal income tax exempt status under Section 501 (r) of the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Code\") as part of the Affordable Care Act. One of the requirements set forth in Section 501 (r) of the Code is for each hospital organization to conduct a Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) at least once every three tax years. The requirement to conduct a CHNA applies to Scripps Health, which is a health system that operates four hospital facilities. In addition, Scripps Health must adopt a triennial Implementation Plan which is a separate written document to address certain community health needs identified in the CHNA. Additional information on the ACA requirements for nonprofit hospitals can be found at www.irs.gov , keyword: \"Charitable Organizations\". 2021 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 258 Required Components of the Community Health Needs Assessment Per IRS requirements, (Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.501 (r) -3(b) (6) (i)) the following are components the CHNA must include: A description of the community served by the health system and how it was determined A description of the processes and methods used to conduct the assessment A description of how the hospital organization took into account input from persons who represent the broad interests of the community serv ed by the hospital facility Prioritized description of all of the community health needs identified through theCHNA, as well as a description of the process and criteria used in prioritizing such health needs. A description of the existing health care facilities and other resources with the community available to meet the community health needs identified in the CHNA. An evaluation of the impact of any actions that were taken since the hospital finished conducting its immediately preceding CHNA to address the significant health needs identified in the prior CHNA. Make the CHNA widely available to the public via the hospital's website. Required Components of the Implementation Strategy Provisions in the Affordable Care Act permit a hospital facility that adopts a joint CHNA report to also adopt a joint implementation strategy which, with respect to each significant health need identified through the joint CHNA, either describes how one or more collaborating facilities plan to address the health need or identifies the health need as one collaborating facilities do not intend to address. The join implementation strategy adopted for the hospital facility must: (Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.501 (r) -3(c) (4). Meet community health needs identified in the CHNA. Describe any needs identified in the CHNA that are not being addressed and the reasons for notaddressing them Be clearly identified as applying to the hospital facility Clearly identify the hospital facility's particular roles and responsibilities in taking the actions described in the implementation strategy, and the programs and resources the hospital facility plans to commit to such actions Include a summary or other tool that helps the reader easily locate those portions of the joint implementation strategy that relates to the hospital facility.2021 Scripps Community Benefit Plan & Report 259 APPENDIX F SCRIPPS HEALTHCARE PARTICIPATION IN COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS The list below highlights Scripps community partners and coalitions in Fiscal Year 2020.
