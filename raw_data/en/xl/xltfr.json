Its mission is to foster and promote research with the aim of improving human and animalhealth. Its work covers four areas: Knowledge - improving our understanding of human and animal biology in health anddisease, and of the past and present role of medicine in society. Resources - providing exceptional researchers with the infrastructural and careersupport they need to full their potential. Translation - ensuring maximum health benets are gained from biomedical research. Public engagement - raising awareness of the medical, ethical and social implicationsof biomedical science. www.wellcome.ac.uk2From the Director 6Making a difference 8Financial summaryContents 34A year at the Trust UK Funding Career Schemes and Clinical InitiativesInternational ProgrammesCentres and InitiativesResearch Partnerships and VenturesMedicine, Society and HistoryCatalyst BioMedica Ltd 49Advisory committees Annual Review 2003 10Knowledge Advancing knowledge and understanding in the biomedical sciences and their impact on society - past, present and future. 22Translation Advancing the translation of Trust- funded research into health benets.28Public engagement Engaging with the public through informed dialogue.16Resources Contributing to a long-term and vibrant research environment.

It remainsextremely difcult for medicallytrained researchers to combineresearch clinical practice,and many opt for 'basic' studiesrather than patient-orientedinvestigations.There may be a number of reasons for thissituation, but we need to workin partnership with others toget the environment right forclinical research. Only then willwe reap the full rewards frommajor investments in basicresearch, such as the HumanGenome Project. Research for people One of the delights of workingat the Wellcome Trust is theexposure one gets not just toground-breaking science butalso to other stimulating aspectsof biomedical culture.This yearwas the 150th anniversary ofthe birth of Henry Wellcome,and the most notablecommemoration of thisanniversary was the 'MedicineMan' exhibition we staged at Museum.The exhibitionbrought together a small selectionof Henry Wellcome's vastcollection of objects, pictures and literature.The result wastruly fascinating and a hugesuccess, and reminded us all that science and medicine arenot, as sometimes portrayed,somehow distinct or remote from everyday experience, but have been - and continue to be - intimately interwoven intopeople's lives. It is sad that science and the humanities have come tooccupy such different intellectualterritories, and I am pleased thatthe Wellcome Trust is doing itsbit to reunite them - or at leastto identify what it is they havein common and where theydiverge, so relationships can bebased on mutual understandingrather than confusion or mistrust.4 5 These researchers have proven that they can deliver high-qualityresearch, given the rightsupport, and that should be a signicant aspect in grantassessments. Another equallyhigh priority is to identify andsupport the new generation ofresearchers who are at the startof their careers.We will buildon our fellowship schemes tosupport young investigators. Scientic focus Scientically, I see us continuingto fund across wide areas ofscience, even if we begin tofocus on more discrete areas asour scientic strategy develops.I also rmly believe that we needto build upon our traditionalapproach in aiming to train andfund the most able scientists andclinicians. It is after all the personwho comes before the idea.Internationally, the WellcomeTrust has had a long and proudtradition of research in thedeveloping world, and today theinternational programmes inKenya (led by Professor KevinMarsh),Thailand (led by ProfessorNick White),Vietnam (led by Dr Jeremy Farrar) and SouthAfrica (led by Dr Mike Bennish)are centres of world renownthat represent models of howWestern agencies can conductresearch in resource-poorcountries - in long-termpartnership with local structuresand tackling regionally important medical problems.The programmes have had amajor impact on health, andsignal our commitment to fundresearch in areas where medicalneeds are huge and localresources are limited. The Wellcome Trust has also expressed a rm commitmentto clinical research.The mostconcrete signs of this are ourClinical Research Facilities inBirmingham, Cambridge,Edinburgh, Manchester andSouthampton, which are now allestablished, and hosting patient-oriented research. It is gratifyingto see a steady stream ofFollowing the prolonged sharp fall in world nancial markets,the Wellcome Trust has beenobliged to reassess its futurefunding plans, a processcompleted in the summer of2003.The Trust has endeavouredto preserve all funding centralto its key mission, and to fundall programmes at levels thatare viable over the longerterm.The result has been acarefully tailored exerciseinvolving some scaling back ofactivities, and the suspensionor discontinuation of a handfulof schemes. Nevertheless, theWellcome Trust expects tocontinue committing in theregion of \u00a3400 million a yearfor the foreseeable future. Among the key decisions were: Previous commitments: All commitments alreadymade - for example,to the UK Biobank Projectand the Structural GenomicsConsortium - will behonoured in full. UK funding: Some reduction in budgetsfor 2003/04, which will meangreater competition projectand programme grantsupport.

Funding for public engagement activities - the EngagingScience Programme - hasbeen maintained. Some costsavings have been identiedwithin internal projects,such as exhibitions and theWellcome Library, though it is not anticipated that the revised budgets willcompromise the overallobjectives of these important activities. At the same time as this review, the Trust has beenexamining its support costs,in order to ensure that it isoperating in a cost-effectiveand business-like fashion.This exercise has identiedsavings that will see ofcecosts lowered signicantly.The Trust has also carried outa review of its stafng levels,and will be streamlining staffnumbers in line with thereduction in external grantssupport and internal costs.It is not anticipated that thesechanges will affect the qualityof service offered to the Trust's many user communities.

FINANCIAL REVIEWWe have made great strides towards the implementation of the funding streams model.Most of the impact will initially befelt internally as we restructureourselves in order to deliver thenew approach. Applicants forgrants are unlikely to notice anysignicant changes in terms ofthe types of grants available,application procedures,mechanisms of peer review,or decision-making procedures.The new panels are due tobecome operational in autumn2004; development of strategywill be an ongoing process and I am committed to ensuringthat changes are communicatedeffectively to all our stakeholderaudiences. Evaluation For us to adopt a more strategicapproach to funding we need to consider the measures bywhich we will assess success.Only by rigorous evaluation ofour activities will we be able todemonstrate any achievements,or make meaningful decisionsabout where our funding shouldbe concentrated. Evaluation of scientic research is a notoriously difcult topic,and I do not expect us to developeffective approaches overnight.Bibliometric analyses have theirplace, but it is the quality of theoutput that matters, andbibliometric data are open todistortion and are often difcultto interpret. I rmly believe thatthere is no better mechanismthan human judgement - the reading of scientic papersand assessment of discoveriesby experts in the eld.We will also be paying attention to the mentoring and training of scientists employed as part of grants, and looking at howthe scientists we fund couldcontribute to public engagement. In funding decisions, we will be paying more attention tofactors such as an excellenttrack record of investigators.Our public engagement with science schemes - the EngagingScience Programme - have beenextremely successful, attractingapplicants from all walks of life.We have used all manner ofmeans - websites, publications,exhibitions and talks - to informand encourage debate onbiomedical science, while our\u00a325 million commitment to theScience Learning Centre initiativedemonstrates our desire toensure that young people receivea science education that meetstheir needs as well as those ofthe science research base. Funding stability Finally, a word on our nancialsituation. It is no secret that theWellcome Trust, like otherendowed foundations, has beenhit by the downturn in worldstock markets over the past fewyears.We have been fortunatethat our nancial planningsmoothes such falls, and that we have had the luxury of timeto conduct in-depth reviews ofour funding plans and internaloperations. More details can be found in the Box on theright. Although such exercisesare always difcult, I feel thatthis one has also been helpful in concentrating minds on our overall objectives and how they can best be achieved.We plan to commit more than \u00a3400 million each year for thenext few years and will use thisto make a real difference toresearch, medicine and health.

Each Aim is underpinned by a series of objectives which establish the practicalmeasures being taken to achieve the Aims and,ultimately, the mission of the Trust.MISSION AIMS VALUES Board of Governors Sir Dominic Cadbury Chairman Professor Sir Michael Rutter Deputy Chairman Professor Adrian BirdProfessor Martin BobrowProfessor Christopher Ross GoobeyProfessor Walker-Arnott Executive Board Dr Mark Walport Director of the Wellcome Trust Linda Arter Director of Finance and Information Management Dr T ed Bianco Director of Technology Transfer John Cooper Director of Human Resources and Services Clare Matterson Director of Medicine, Society and History Dr Sohaila Rastan Director of Science Funding Gary Steinberg Chief Investment Ofcer As at January 2004.The Wellcome Trust is an independent, privately endowed medical research charity, founded in 1936 by Sir Henry Wellcome. It has an ambitiously broadsphere of interest, reflected in its overarching mission statement. It focuses its work through four key Aims, and the following pages illustrate some of the ways in which Wellcome Trust funding is working to achieve these Aims. 8 9 Expenditure on the synchrotron being constructed by DiamondLight Source Limited amounted to \u00a33 million. The rst phase of the project is expected toincur a further \u00a329 million ofexpenditure over the next ve years. The total grants awarded gures exclude awards totallingapproximately \u00a39 million, whichare subject to various ethical andlegal conditions.These awardswill be accounted for in 2004 if the conditions are met. Onesuch award is the \u00a34.8 millionagreed in principle for the'Spartac' programme, which is amultinational study to investigateways of optimizing use of drugtherapies against HIV (see page 40) . Grants awarded for the benet of the history of medicine,biomedical ethics and publicengagement with to \u00a325.5 million.This included million forresponse-mode grants support,as well as expenditure of \u00a312.5 million on major capitalawards, principally the NationalScience Learning Centre (see page 30) . The number of grant awards made during the year was 1805(2002: 2172), a decrease of 16 per cent, although 4312applications (2002: 3884) were received, 11 per centmore than last year. As a consequence of reduced grant-giving activity and highercash payments, the level ofoutstanding grant commitmentsslightly decreased, although itremains more than \u00a31 billion. Figure 4 demonstrates the cashoutflow linked to the Trust's grant commitments. The amount of cash paid this year was lower than had beenanticipated; this is mainly due tounexpectedly long waits forclaims from JIF and SRIF buildingand refurbishment projects. Expenditure on the direct activities of the Trust in 2003 was\u00a378 million (2002: \u00a370 million),of which WellcomeTrust Genome Campus atHinxton, just outside Cambridge.The bulk of this expenditure isin respect of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.This level ofexpenditure by the SangerInstitute is expected to continueover the coming years, as itcontinues to develop itspostgenomic research and recruitnew researchers (see page 10) . The Trust's other direct activities include the Wellcome Libraryfor the History and Understandingof Medicine and, for example,public engagement with scienceinitiatives such as 'Imagine' (see page 31) . The decrease in administration and support costs to \u00a344 million(2002: \u00a348 million) reflected theconsiderable efforts made duringthe year to reduce internal costs,ensuring that support costswere reduced in line with thelower level of actual andforecast direct activities. Investments During the year, nancialmarkets continued to be highlyvolatile. Global equity marketsfell sharply as the build up tothe war with Iraq intensied,but then rebounded as the war drew to a close. In contrast,xed income markets, whichhad been performing strongly,reversed sharply as the globaleconomy recovered and thethreat of deflation receded. Overall, both global equities and xed income markets haveprovided positive returns forthe year under review which,together with continued positivereturns from commercialproperty, has helped lift theinvestment asset base of theTrust to \u00a310.1 billion (2002:\u00a39.3 billion). Costs of generating funds have fallen to \u00a335 million (2002:\u00a348 million), reflecting the one- off nature of costs in 2002, mainlyrelating to the disposal of sharesin GlaxoSmithKline plc, and areduction in property costs. Investment income for the year to 30 September 2003 was \u00a3262 million, compared withthe previous year's gure of\u00a3297 million. Additional nancial information can be found in the Wellcome Trust's Annual Report and Financial Statements 2003 , available from the Trust's Marketing Department (contactdetails on inside back cover).In the year to 30 September 2003, the total amount ofresources expended was \u00a3552 million (2002:\u00a3585 million). As an endowedcharity, the Wellcome Trust hasbeen adversely affected by thelarge and sustained fall in globalmarkets over the past threeyears.The Trust has developed a nancial framework thatsmoothes var iations in investment values, but the length and severityof the recent slump has led tosome adjustments to the Trust'sfuture spending plans (see page 5) . Nevertheless, markets began to recover in the second half of the year. Over the course of the year the return from theinvestment portfolio was \u00a31.3 billion net of costs. The Trust's expenditure falls into two categories:'charitable'expenditure, which coversgrants made to other bodies,the cost of activities carried outby the Trust itself, and supportand administration costs; andinvestment costs, the resourcesexpended managing the Trust'sasset base and generating itsincome. A breakdown of theTrust's expenditure is providedin Figure 1 .In the year to 30 September 2003, grants totalling \u00a3395 millionwere awarded (2002:\u00a3419 million), as shown in Figure 2 . As usual, the bulk of funding was awarded throughthe UK Subject Panels forresponse-mode, investigator-ledresearch proposals ( Figure 3 ). In addition, through its careersschemes the Trust continues to provide extensive careerdevelopment support, to basicand clinical scientists, and at allstages of a research career. Although the initiatives have nished, funding continues to be committed through the JointInfrastructure Fund (JIF) andScience Research InvestmentFund (SRIF) as approved.A total of \u00a3417 million has sofar been committed by the Trustto these programmes, with theremainder likely to be committedin the next nancial year.

It offers the prospectof converting undifferentiatedstem cells to new tissue grownspecically to replace damagedor diseased tissue. In February2003, the Wellcome Trust joinedforces with a US charity, theJuvenile Diabetes ResearchFoundation (JDRF), to promotethis important area of research. The JDRF has committed \u00a33 million over ve years tomatch Wellcome Trust fundingfor high-quality projects in this area. Proposals aimed at developing new humanembryonic or adult stem celllines or characterizing existinghuman stem cell lines areencouraged, as are applicationsfocusing on either maintaining stem cells in an undifferentiated state in culture or regulating their differentiation. The JDRF wishes to support research in its priority areas of type 1 diabetes and thecomplications of diabetes. It willalso fund proposals that mightlead to stem cell therapies, suchas glucose-responsive, insulin-producing cell lines that couldbe used in transplant therapyfor diabetics. The UK has a well-regulated environment for undertakingstem cell research.With this newpartnership, the Wellcome Trustand JDRF hope to enable stemcell research to flourish withinthe UK and ultimately improvethe health of hundreds ofthousands of people whose dailylives are affected by diabetes andother chronic illnesses.Clocking on Stem cell partnersLeftBrain activity in right and left temporallobes in subjects listening to Mandarin Chinese (left pair) and English(right pair).

A trans-Atlantic collaboration to further stem cell research could lead to new treatments fordiabetes and other chronic diseases. The mammalian eye has been studied for some 200 years, anduntil recently its function wasthought to be pretty wellunderstood. Light-sensitive cellsin the retina - rods and cones -register incoming light and signalthrough the optic nerve to thebrain. But in the past decade,Professor Russell Foster andcolleagues have discovered thatrods and cones are not the onlysensory cells in the eye:remarkably, there are otherphotoreceptors whose job it isto set our internal body clocks. Almost all organisms have some kind of body clock, which allowsbody physiology to be ne-tuned to the varying demandsof night and day.This body clockis, however, slightly erratic andhas to be synchronized eachday - which in mammals islinked to the disappearance oflight at twilight. Eyes were known to be essential for setting the clock,and received wisdom was thatrods and cones must beresponsible. But ProfessorFoster's group had noticed thata bizarre form of socialmammal, the blind mole-rat -which lives underground and isvirtually blind - still has itsinternal clock set by light signalsfalling on its rudimentary eyes.Research on internal body clocks has transformed our understanding of the eye. Over several years, working with strains of mice lacking anyrods or cones, Professor Fosterand colleagues in the USA have shown conclusively thatthe body clock is completelyindependent of these cells:another form of photoreceptormust exist. With continued Wellcome Trust funding, he is now aiming todiscover the identity of thiselusive photoreceptor and workout how it signals to clockmechanisms in the brain.The question is of much morethan academic interest: working'out of phase' leads to fatigue,insomnia, altered mood anddiminished performance. In theUSA, the cost of accidentsattributed to human fatigue is astaggering US$16 billion a year.A better understanding of howlight affects our internal rhythmswould be a major step towardsdrugs or new light regimes to reduce a signicant source of physical discomfort and social damage. Professor Russell Foster is in the Division of Neuroscience and Psychological Medicineat Imperial College, London. He wasawarded a Wellcome Trust programme grant in 2002/03. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, Dr SophieScott and colleagues atUniversity College Londondiscovered that MandarinChinese speakers use twosides of their brains tounderstand language, whereasEnglish speakers use just one.Unlike English, Mandarin usesintonation to give differentmeanings to words; the word'ma', for example, can mean'mother','scold','horse' or'hemp'. It may be thatMandarin speakers interpretintonation and melody in theright temporal lobe - an areaknown to be activated whenpeople listen to music. As well as providing an insight into how brains work,the research could help usunderstand what happenswhen people have to speech comprehensionskills - a example.Dr UniversityCollege London neurologicalbasis of force escalation.Whentwo subjects were asked totake it in turns to apply anequal force to one another,using a specially designeddevice, subjects always applieda greater response than wasapplied to them, suggesting thatthe brain is underestimatingactual forces being applied. This phenomenon may help the brain distinguish betweeninternal and externally generatedforces, but could mean weconsistently underestimate the strength of our physicalreactions.

It offers the prospectof converting undifferentiatedstem cells to new tissue grownspecically to replace damagedor diseased tissue. In February2003, the Wellcome Trust joinedforces with a US charity, theJuvenile Diabetes ResearchFoundation (JDRF), to promotethis important area of research. The JDRF has committed \u00a33 million over ve years tomatch Wellcome Trust fundingfor high-quality projects in this area. Proposals aimed at developing new humanembryonic or adult stem celllines or characterizing existinghuman stem cell lines areencouraged, as are applicationsfocusing on either maintaining stem cells in an undifferentiated state in culture or regulating their differentiation. The JDRF wishes to support research in its priority areas of type 1 diabetes and thecomplications of diabetes. It willalso fund proposals that mightlead to stem cell therapies, suchas glucose-responsive, insulin-producing cell lines that couldbe used in transplant therapyfor diabetics. The UK has a well-regulated environment for undertakingstem cell research.With this newpartnership, the Wellcome Trustand JDRF hope to enable stemcell research to flourish withinthe UK and ultimately improvethe health of hundreds ofthousands of people whose dailylives are affected by diabetes andother chronic illnesses.Clocking on Stem cell partnersLeftBrain activity in right and left temporallobes in subjects listening to Mandarin Chinese (left pair) and English(right pair).

A trans-Atlantic collaboration to further stem cell research could lead to new treatments fordiabetes and other chronic diseases. The mammalian eye has been studied for some 200 years, anduntil recently its function wasthought to be pretty wellunderstood. Light-sensitive cellsin the retina - rods and cones -register incoming light and signalthrough the optic nerve to thebrain. But in the past decade,Professor Russell Foster andcolleagues have discovered thatrods and cones are not the onlysensory cells in the eye:remarkably, there are otherphotoreceptors whose job it isto set our internal body clocks. Almost all organisms have some kind of body clock, which allowsbody physiology to be ne-tuned to the varying demandsof night and day.This body clockis, however, slightly erratic andhas to be synchronized eachday - which in mammals islinked to the disappearance oflight at twilight. Eyes were known to be essential for setting the clock,and received wisdom was thatrods and cones must beresponsible. But ProfessorFoster's group had noticed thata bizarre form of socialmammal, the blind mole-rat -which lives underground and isvirtually blind - still has itsinternal clock set by light signalsfalling on its rudimentary eyes.Research on internal body clocks has transformed our understanding of the eye. Over several years, working with strains of mice lacking anyrods or cones, Professor Fosterand colleagues in the USA have shown conclusively thatthe body clock is completelyindependent of these cells:another form of photoreceptormust exist. With continued Wellcome Trust funding, he is now aiming todiscover the identity of thiselusive photoreceptor and workout how it signals to clockmechanisms in the brain.The question is of much morethan academic interest: working'out of phase' leads to fatigue,insomnia, altered mood anddiminished performance. In theUSA, the cost of accidentsattributed to human fatigue is astaggering US$16 billion a year.A better understanding of howlight affects our internal rhythmswould be a major step towardsdrugs or new light regimes to reduce a signicant source of physical discomfort and social damage. Professor Russell Foster is in the Division of Neuroscience and Psychological Medicineat Imperial College, London. He wasawarded a Wellcome Trust programme grant in 2002/03. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, Dr SophieScott and colleagues atUniversity College Londondiscovered that MandarinChinese speakers use twosides of their brains tounderstand language, whereasEnglish speakers use just one.Unlike English, Mandarin usesintonation to give differentmeanings to words; the word'ma', for example, can mean'mother','scold','horse' or'hemp'. It may be thatMandarin speakers interpretintonation and melody in theright temporal lobe - an areaknown to be activated whenpeople listen to music. As well as providing an insight into how brains work,the research could help usunderstand what happenswhen people have to speech comprehensionskills - a example.Dr UniversityCollege London neurologicalbasis of force escalation.Whentwo subjects were asked totake it in turns to apply anequal force to one another,using a specially designeddevice, subjects always applieda greater response than wasapplied to them, suggesting thatthe brain is underestimatingactual forces being applied. This phenomenon may help the brain distinguish betweeninternal and externally generatedforces, but could mean weconsistently underestimate the strength of our physicalreactions. Brain imaging has also been used to explore the basis ofprodigious memory feats.Dr Eleanor Maguire at theInstitute of Neur ology has previously shown that Londontaxi drivers ha ve signicantly enlarged hippocampi,presumably related to theirmemorization of large tracts of London.

Researchers led by Professors John T odd and Linda Wicker inCambridge, and Dr StephenGough in Birmingham, identiedthe variants in a gene calledCTLA4 . CTLA-4 protein acts as a brake on the immune system,preventing it from reacting tooaggressively.With some geneticvariants, however, the brake is less effective, predisposingpeople to the threeautoimmune disorders. Autoimmune diseases - originally known as 'horror autoxicus' -occur when the immunesystem, as 'foreign' andattacks them. As with manycommon diseases, autoimmunediseases are caused by acombination of genetic andenvironmental factors. Thesecomplex origins present aconsiderable challenge toresearchers, and CTLA4 joins a modest list of around ten genesfor which genetic associations to common disease have beenconvincingly established.By studying hundreds of affected families, the researchers hadpreviously identied a region on chromosome 2 associatedwith all three diseases.The equivalent chromosomalregion in mice was also knownto confer susceptibility to type 1diabetes. CTLA4 and two other genes associated with theimmune response stood out as possible candidates for thesusceptibility gene. More detailed analysis of thousands of infected individualsrevealed that subtle geneticvariations (single nucleotidepolymorphisms, or SNPs)around CTLA4 were associated with susceptibility both to theautoimmune diseases and todiabetes in the mouse.The SNPsappear to alter the relativeproportions of the differentforms of CTLA-4 protein. Although other genes are undoubtedly also important,the discovery provides importantinsights into how autoimmunediseases arise. Moreover, as theCTLA4 gene variant is found in most people with these diseases,it also opens up the possibilitythat CTLA-4, or other moleculesregulating T -cell behaviour in a similar way, could be used as a target for new therapies.

According to a model developed by Professors Ehlersand Clark, people with PTSDhave processed the trauma in a way that gives them a senseof serious, current threat.This sense has two sources:excessively negative interpretationsof the trauma or its aftermath(for example,'flashbacks' in theweeks after); and a characteristic disturbance of autobiographicalmemory for the trauma, suchthat unwanted 'flashback'-likememories can be easily triggered.These negative interpretationsand disturbed trauma memoryare maintained by problematicbehavioural and cognitivestrategies (for example,suppression of thoughts aboutthe event and excessiveprecautions).Remarkably, in the work with the Omagh community, themodel's cognitive measurespredicted the likelihood ofPTSD even more strongly than'objective' measures, such asproximity to the site of thebombing. People with a strongtendency to ruminate, or with a markedly negative self-image,were particularly at risk. The model has also been used to develop a specialized cognitivetherapy programme for PTSD.It aims to help patients moveaway from their excessivelynegative interpretations of theirexperience and to correct thememory disturbanceresponsible for unwantedrecollections of the trauma.

See www.wellcome.ac.uk/techtransferTRANSLATION 24 25 A Wellcome Trust-funded team based in Thailand is conductingthe largest-ever clinical trial in severe falciparum malaria,which kills over a million peopleeach year. T o date there is no agreement about which is the best drug to treat this form of malaria.Although quinine is still the mostwidely used treatment, manypeople believe that artesunate,a drug derived from a Chineseherbal remedy, qinghaosu,is more effective. However,there is as yet no proof of this. Professor Nick White and team are therefore launching thelargest-ever randomized controltrial in severe falciparum malaria- more than twice the size ofany previous study - comparingartesunate and quinine. Over athree-year period, they will enrol2000 patients at hospitals inBangladesh, Myanmar (Burma),Indonesia and India. The trial will be coordinated by the Wellcome Trust-fundedresearch programme in Thailand(based in Mahidol University,Bangkok), which has pioneeredthe of artemisinin derivatives,artesunate or artemether,for the treatment of malaria.With a vaccine still some way off, drugs remain the mainstayof defence against malaria.Y et,throughout Africa, drugs arefailing alarmingly as the parasitegains resistance to our chemicalarmoury. In this worryingclimate, the launch of a new,cheap and effective antimalarialis a major step forward. Lapdap, a so-called short-half-life antifolate, was approved in July2003 Products RegulatoryAgency (MHRA) - the UK's keydrug regulatory body and hasalready been registered in severalAfrican countries, includingKenya, Malawi, Nigeria and Tanzania. Lapdap was the brainchild of Dr Bill Watkins at WellcomeTrust-supported laboratories inNairobi and Professor PeterWinstanley at the University ofLiverpool.Their aim was to ndan antifolate that was as effectiveas existing treatments but rapidlydisappeared from the body - to lessen the likelihood thatresistance might develop. After several years' laboratory testing, Lapdap went throughextensive clinical trials at sites inAfrica, including the WellcomeTrust Research Programmes inKili, Kenya, and Blantyre, Malawi, and has been brought to a World incollaboration with Liverpool'sUniversity and School of TropicalMedicine, the London School ofHygiene and Tropical Medicine,and African researchers.Governments can purchaseLapdap for just 10 pence for acourse of treatment for a child. Plans are under way to combine Lapdap with another drugknown to be effective in delayingthe development of resistance.A second public-privatepartnership is energeticallypursuing a combination known asCDA (Lapdap with artesunate),which is currently in phase IIclinical trials. Commercializationis being funded by the Medicinesfor Malaria Venture, a non-protfoundation to which the Trusthas contributed. If CDA comes through clinical trials successfully, it should be aseffective as Lapdap, be cheaperthan many other combinationtherapies and, importantly,have a longer useful lifespan. Treat ingmalariaLapdapon tap A drug developed from an ancient Chinese herbal remedy may be of benet in the mostsevere forms of this disease.A much-needed antimalarial, developed with Wellcome Trust support in Kenya and Malawi,has been licensed and is ready for use in Africa. A ten-strong team of researchers, including WellcomeTrust-funded researchersProfessor Stephen Ward andDr Patrick Bray at the LiverpoolSchool of Tropical Medicine,has found how artemisinins kill the malaria parasite. Artemisinins are becoming increasingly importantantimalarials, as resistance toother drugs spreads. Indeed,in some parts of South-EastAsia they are the only effectivetreatment for acute malaria.How they work, however,has been a mystery. The new research, led by MRC-funded Professor Sanjeev Krishna of St George's Hospital Medical School, London, has found thatartemisinins of thecell another. PfATP6 is verysimilar to a enzyme. falciparum .Nature 424: 957-61.THE MALARIA PARASITE The Wellcome-KEMRI Research Programme at Kilihas also been the focus of a highly successful projectaimed at ensuring preciousantimalarial drugs are usedcorrectly - misuse is not only dangerous for patients,it encourages the developmentof drug resistance. Dr Vicki Marsh has been running an education programme for local shopkeepers andcommunities around Kili -shops often being the rst point of call for parents with a feverish child. Shopkeepersare taught to ask the rightquestions about symptoms and offer the right doses ofantimalarials for children ofdifferent ages, and to encourageparents to go straight to clinics in serious cases. Following highly successful pilots, Dr Marsh has workedwith the Ministry of Health inKenya to develop a programmeof training for informal drugretailers that integrates with other forms of local healthcare delivery.And in 2003, theshopkeepers project wentnational, with educationprogrammes being rolled out to ve districts of Kenya,with Dr Marsh providingsupport and contributing to evaluations of the trials. The shopkeepers project is good evidence that, as well as the high-tech approaches of drug development, it is absolutely essential to look at how therapeutics are actually being used in the community. Funding for the shopkeepers project is also being provided by the Division ofMalaria Control, Kenya.The Departmentfor International Development providedinitial funding for the project.SHOPKEEPERS UNITE In many parts of the developing world, farm animals are not justa source of food - they are alsobank balances for families andcommunities.Through breeding,livestock holdings can be built up,leading to better health, betteropportunities and better life.Y et one of the main enemies to such sustainable solutions isdisease. It takes just one outbreakof a major infection to devastatethe livestock and the community. For many animal diseases, there is only a limited understanding of tr ansmission and natural reservoirs, and there are few vaccines, diagnostics or treatments available.In recognition of this need, the Wellcome Trust has launched a new \u00a325 million initiative,'Animal Health in the DevelopingWorld - Livestock for Life'.

TRANSLATION 24 25 A Wellcome Trust-funded team based in Thailand is conductingthe largest-ever clinical trial in severe falciparum malaria,which kills over a million peopleeach year. T o date there is no agreement about which is the best drug to treat this form of malaria.Although quinine is still the mostwidely used treatment, manypeople believe that artesunate,a drug derived from a Chineseherbal remedy, qinghaosu,is more effective. However,there is as yet no proof of this. Professor Nick White and team are therefore launching thelargest-ever randomized controltrial in severe falciparum malaria- more than twice the size ofany previous study - comparingartesunate and quinine. Over athree-year period, they will enrol2000 patients at hospitals inBangladesh, Myanmar (Burma),Indonesia and India. The trial will be coordinated by the Wellcome Trust-fundedresearch programme in Thailand(based in Mahidol University,Bangkok), which has pioneeredthe of artemisinin derivatives,artesunate or artemether,for the treatment of malaria.With a vaccine still some way off, drugs remain the mainstayof defence against malaria.Y et,throughout Africa, drugs arefailing alarmingly as the parasitegains resistance to our chemicalarmoury. In this worryingclimate, the launch of a new,cheap and effective antimalarialis a major step forward. Lapdap, a so-called short-half-life antifolate, was approved in July2003 Products RegulatoryAgency (MHRA) - the UK's keydrug regulatory body and hasalready been registered in severalAfrican countries, includingKenya, Malawi, Nigeria and Tanzania. Lapdap was the brainchild of Dr Bill Watkins at WellcomeTrust-supported laboratories inNairobi and Professor PeterWinstanley at the University ofLiverpool.Their aim was to ndan antifolate that was as effectiveas existing treatments but rapidlydisappeared from the body - to lessen the likelihood thatresistance might develop. After several years' laboratory testing, Lapdap went throughextensive clinical trials at sites inAfrica, including the WellcomeTrust Research Programmes inKili, Kenya, and Blantyre, Malawi, and has been brought to a World incollaboration with Liverpool'sUniversity and School of TropicalMedicine, the London School ofHygiene and Tropical Medicine,and African researchers.Governments can purchaseLapdap for just 10 pence for acourse of treatment for a child. Plans are under way to combine Lapdap with another drugknown to be effective in delayingthe development of resistance.A second public-privatepartnership is energeticallypursuing a combination known asCDA (Lapdap with artesunate),which is currently in phase IIclinical trials. Commercializationis being funded by the Medicinesfor Malaria Venture, a non-protfoundation to which the Trusthas contributed. If CDA comes through clinical trials successfully, it should be aseffective as Lapdap, be cheaperthan many other combinationtherapies and, importantly,have a longer useful lifespan. Treat ingmalariaLapdapon tap A drug developed from an ancient Chinese herbal remedy may be of benet in the mostsevere forms of this disease.A much-needed antimalarial, developed with Wellcome Trust support in Kenya and Malawi,has been licensed and is ready for use in Africa. A ten-strong team of researchers, including WellcomeTrust-funded researchersProfessor Stephen Ward andDr Patrick Bray at the LiverpoolSchool of Tropical Medicine,has found how artemisinins kill the malaria parasite. Artemisinins are becoming increasingly importantantimalarials, as resistance toother drugs spreads. Indeed,in some parts of South-EastAsia they are the only effectivetreatment for acute malaria.How they work, however,has been a mystery. The new research, led by MRC-funded Professor Sanjeev Krishna of St George's Hospital Medical School, London, has found thatartemisinins of thecell another. PfATP6 is verysimilar to a enzyme. falciparum .Nature 424: 957-61.THE MALARIA PARASITE The Wellcome-KEMRI Research Programme at Kilihas also been the focus of a highly successful projectaimed at ensuring preciousantimalarial drugs are usedcorrectly - misuse is not only dangerous for patients,it encourages the developmentof drug resistance. Dr Vicki Marsh has been running an education programme for local shopkeepers andcommunities around Kili -shops often being the rst point of call for parents with a feverish child. Shopkeepersare taught to ask the rightquestions about symptoms and offer the right doses ofantimalarials for children ofdifferent ages, and to encourageparents to go straight to clinics in serious cases. Following highly successful pilots, Dr Marsh has workedwith the Ministry of Health inKenya to develop a programmeof training for informal drugretailers that integrates with other forms of local healthcare delivery.And in 2003, theshopkeepers project wentnational, with educationprogrammes being rolled out to ve districts of Kenya,with Dr Marsh providingsupport and contributing to evaluations of the trials. The shopkeepers project is good evidence that, as well as the high-tech approaches of drug development, it is absolutely essential to look at how therapeutics are actually being used in the community. Funding for the shopkeepers project is also being provided by the Division ofMalaria Control, Kenya.The Departmentfor International Development providedinitial funding for the project.SHOPKEEPERS UNITE In many parts of the developing world, farm animals are not justa source of food - they are alsobank balances for families andcommunities.Through breeding,livestock holdings can be built up,leading to better health, betteropportunities and better life.Y et one of the main enemies to such sustainable solutions isdisease. It takes just one outbreakof a major infection to devastatethe livestock and the community. For many animal diseases, there is only a limited understanding of tr ansmission and natural reservoirs, and there are few vaccines, diagnostics or treatments available.In recognition of this need, the Wellcome Trust has launched a new \u00a325 million initiative,'Animal Health in the DevelopingWorld - Livestock for Life'. The initiative aims to encourage research into the distribution of diseases and how they arespread. It will also support thedevelopment of vaccines, drugsand diagnostics that can tacklethese diseases.T o complementsuch research, the initiative willfund activities that help scientistswork with livestock keepers,animal health practitioners andcommunity policy makers.

In the 'TranCell-S'method, a patient's own cellsare grown on a polymerizedbandage which is then appliedto the ulcerated area. In a trial involving the TranCell-S bandage six out of nine ulcers,which had been forbetween two and four years,were healed.The bandage hasalso helped a former prisoner of war who had been sufferingextensive leg ulcers for 60 years.

Regulation of both drugs has been influenced by many social,political and medical aspects.During the First World War, for example, alcohol was strictlycontrolled, to counter theeffects of drinking on munitionsproduction.The result was ahuge decrease in arrests fromdrinking offences and deaths fromcirrhosis during the war years.

See www.wellcome.ac.uk/medicinemanPUBLIC ENGAGEMENT Lessonsin life The growing impact of biomedical science is being feltin many parts of society, notleast the education sector.Considerable new challengesare emerging. Biomedicine life.Children are aboutreproductive technologies,genetically modied organisms,HIV/AIDS and a host of otherissues every day in the media. In addition, science has tended to be taught in terms ofincontrovertible facts, yet in muchof modern biology there aredegrees of uncertainty. And thepace of change is problem enoughfor the biomedical researcher,let alone a hard-pressed teacher. Moreover, the UK education system has been geared moretowards scientic specialiststhan the vast majority who willnot study science after school.A key challenge is to ensure thatthe stream of well-preparedbudding researchers is matchedby future citizens equipped with the scientic literacy theywill need in a technologicallyadvanced society. Fundamental to this new vision will be science teachers.T o this end, the Department forEducation and Skills (DfES) andthe Wellcome Trust committed\u00a326 million and \u00a325 millionrespectively to develop anationwide network of ScienceLearning Centres for scienceteachers, which will transformthe quality of teachers'professional development.A National Science Learning Centre based at the Universityof Y ork, funded by the WellcomeTrust and run by the WhiteRose Consortium (comprisingthe universities of Leeds,Shefeld,Y ork, and ShefeldHallam), will work with DfES-funded Regional Centres inLeicester and Nottingham,Y orkshire, Manchester, London,Hertfordshire and the Centres including newlyequipped laboratories andcutting-edge ICT (information andcommunications technology)equipment. Links with industrialorganizations will provideteachers with access to thelatest scientic thinking, and help to refresh, expand andupdate their subject knowledge. Complementing the national network is a second partnershipbetween the Wellcome Trustand the DfES, the CreativeScience 000initiative will see a range ofinnovative approaches beingtrialled for use in science teaching- from dance to businessstudies.The best projects willform the basis of new modulesto be used in the ScienceLearning Centres. DNA50 What does the public think of genetics? If the Imaginephotography competition,organized in conjunction withthe BBC, is anything to go by,there are as many perspectivesas people to express them. Imagine, launched in April 2003, invited amateur photographers ofall ages to submit work inspiredby DNA, genes and heredity,to capture perceptions of whatDNA meant to them - theirthoughts, feelings, hopes andfears about genetics and thefuture. Images flooded in, somebizarre, others of considerableartistic merit. First prize in the schools category went to Old PalaceSchool of John Whitgift, Croydon.The individual rst prize wasshared by Ben Roberts andAndy Milne (see left). The special TwoTen Gallery exhibition,'Four Plus:WritingDNA' (4 April - 29 August2003), featured commissionedwork from ten contemporaryartists. Exhibits focused on thefour key characters involved inthe DNA story - Francis Crick,James Watson, Rosalind Franklinand Maurice Wilkins. In Cambridge,Watson and Crick were single-minded intheir quest to understand thestructure DNA. In London,Wilkins and Rosalind Franklinwere using X-ray diffractiontechniques to gather insight intoits three-dimensional shape. In the crucial episode,Wilkins showed Franklin's X-ray resultsto Watson. Franklin never knewWatson had been privy to her results, and Watson and Crickwere reticent in acknowledgingher contributions.Watson, Crickand Wilkins were awarded theNobel Prize; by then Franklinwas dead - ironically, of cancerpossibly caused by exposure to X-rays. Fifty years has seen endless debate about the case - ignitedby Jim Watson's racy account in his book The Double Helix . 'Four Plus:Writing DNA'explored the drama behind theextraordinary achievements years ofmythologizing. As part of 'Four Plus:Writing DNA', items from the FrancisCrick archive - acquired for theWellcome Library in 2001 -were made available for publicviewing for the rst time. Material on display included documents relating to RosalindFranklin's role in the DNA story and a series of illuminatingletters from Crick,Wilkins and others to James Watson,objecting to the publication of The Double Helix . Crick considered the book nothingmore than unscientic gossip. All of the above (and much more) featured on a major newwebsite launched in April 2003.The Human Genome: Y ourgenes, your health, your future,is a constantly updated guide tothe human genome - the science,its role in health and medicine,and its broader social impact. See www.wellcome.ac.uk/dna50 www.wellcome.ac.uk/imaginewww.wellcome.ac.uk/genome30 31 Boosting science education has been a major focus for the Wellcome Trust in 2002/03.Fifty years after the discovery of the DNA double helix, a series of DNA50 activitiesassessed its impact on science and society. The Wellcome Trust's work in education focuses on enhancingteachers' continuing professionaldevelopment, providing anevidence base to supporteducational policy development,and curriculum development.In the latter area, piloting hasbegun of a new science GCSE,T wenty-rst Century Science,developed with funding fromthe Wellcome Trust and others. It comprises a 'core' science course in scientic literacy,equivalent to a single GCSEaward, aiming to provide arelevant and comprehensivescience education for theentire populace.

Biomedicine life.Children are aboutreproductive technologies,genetically modied organisms,HIV/AIDS and a host of otherissues every day in the media. In addition, science has tended to be taught in terms ofincontrovertible facts, yet in muchof modern biology there aredegrees of uncertainty. And thepace of change is problem enoughfor the biomedical researcher,let alone a hard-pressed teacher. Moreover, the UK education system has been geared moretowards scientic specialiststhan the vast majority who willnot study science after school.A key challenge is to ensure thatthe stream of well-preparedbudding researchers is matchedby future citizens equipped with the scientic literacy theywill need in a technologicallyadvanced society. Fundamental to this new vision will be science teachers.T o this end, the Department forEducation and Skills (DfES) andthe Wellcome Trust committed\u00a326 million and \u00a325 millionrespectively to develop anationwide network of ScienceLearning Centres for scienceteachers, which will transformthe quality of teachers'professional development.A National Science Learning Centre based at the Universityof Y ork, funded by the WellcomeTrust and run by the WhiteRose Consortium (comprisingthe universities of Leeds,Shefeld,Y ork, and ShefeldHallam), will work with DfES-funded Regional Centres inLeicester and Nottingham,Y orkshire, Manchester, London,Hertfordshire and the Centres including newlyequipped laboratories andcutting-edge ICT (information andcommunications technology)equipment. Links with industrialorganizations will provideteachers with access to thelatest scientic thinking, and help to refresh, expand andupdate their subject knowledge. Complementing the national network is a second partnershipbetween the Wellcome Trustand the DfES, the CreativeScience 000initiative will see a range ofinnovative approaches beingtrialled for use in science teaching- from dance to businessstudies.The best projects willform the basis of new modulesto be used in the ScienceLearning Centres. DNA50 What does the public think of genetics? If the Imaginephotography competition,organized in conjunction withthe BBC, is anything to go by,there are as many perspectivesas people to express them. Imagine, launched in April 2003, invited amateur photographers ofall ages to submit work inspiredby DNA, genes and heredity,to capture perceptions of whatDNA meant to them - theirthoughts, feelings, hopes andfears about genetics and thefuture. Images flooded in, somebizarre, others of considerableartistic merit. First prize in the schools category went to Old PalaceSchool of John Whitgift, Croydon.The individual rst prize wasshared by Ben Roberts andAndy Milne (see left). The special TwoTen Gallery exhibition,'Four Plus:WritingDNA' (4 April - 29 August2003), featured commissionedwork from ten contemporaryartists. Exhibits focused on thefour key characters involved inthe DNA story - Francis Crick,James Watson, Rosalind Franklinand Maurice Wilkins. In Cambridge,Watson and Crick were single-minded intheir quest to understand thestructure DNA. In London,Wilkins and Rosalind Franklinwere using X-ray diffractiontechniques to gather insight intoits three-dimensional shape. In the crucial episode,Wilkins showed Franklin's X-ray resultsto Watson. Franklin never knewWatson had been privy to her results, and Watson and Crickwere reticent in acknowledgingher contributions.Watson, Crickand Wilkins were awarded theNobel Prize; by then Franklinwas dead - ironically, of cancerpossibly caused by exposure to X-rays. Fifty years has seen endless debate about the case - ignitedby Jim Watson's racy account in his book The Double Helix . 'Four Plus:Writing DNA'explored the drama behind theextraordinary achievements years ofmythologizing. As part of 'Four Plus:Writing DNA', items from the FrancisCrick archive - acquired for theWellcome Library in 2001 -were made available for publicviewing for the rst time. Material on display included documents relating to RosalindFranklin's role in the DNA story and a series of illuminatingletters from Crick,Wilkins and others to James Watson,objecting to the publication of The Double Helix . Crick considered the book nothingmore than unscientic gossip. All of the above (and much more) featured on a major newwebsite launched in April 2003.The Human Genome: Y ourgenes, your health, your future,is a constantly updated guide tothe human genome - the science,its role in health and medicine,and its broader social impact. See www.wellcome.ac.uk/dna50 www.wellcome.ac.uk/imaginewww.wellcome.ac.uk/genome30 31 Boosting science education has been a major focus for the Wellcome Trust in 2002/03.Fifty years after the discovery of the DNA double helix, a series of DNA50 activitiesassessed its impact on science and society. The Wellcome Trust's work in education focuses on enhancingteachers' continuing professionaldevelopment, providing anevidence base to supporteducational policy development,and curriculum development.In the latter area, piloting hasbegun of a new science GCSE,T wenty-rst Century Science,developed with funding fromthe Wellcome Trust and others. It comprises a 'core' science course in scientic literacy,equivalent to a single GCSEaward, aiming to provide arelevant and comprehensivescience education for theentire populace. Students will learn about key areas ofscience but also how science is carried out. T wenty-rst Century Science also provides additionalmodules for studentscontinuing science studiesbeyond GCSE.

At the same time, the grounds of the Genome Campus are beingremodelled, and will eventuallyinclude a wetland area destinedto become a nature reserve.Scientic information The Wellcome Trust iscommitted to the principle of open access to scienticinformation, as timely sharing of information is central toscientic progress. In responseto requests from the large-genome sequencing community,the Wellcome Trust sponsoredan international meeting inJanuary 2003 to discuss pre-publication data release. Held in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the meeting brought togetherrepresentatives of the producersof large-genome sequence data,the users of such data, fundingagencies and scientic journals.The Wellcome Trust supportsthe recommendation made at themeeting that high-throughput,large-genome projects beconsidered community resourceprojects, with results released as quickly as practicable.Scientic publishing In October 2003, the WellcomeTrust published a comprehensiveanalysis of the nancial impact ofthe scientic publishing industry,Economic Analysis of ScienticResearch Publishing . The report concluded that, globally, journal subscriptions are a signicant nancial burdenon institutional libraries andindividual researchers, andpresent a major obstacle to the timely and comprehensivesharing and use of scienticinformation.The Trust publishedthe report to encourage furtherdialogue on the best way todisseminate scientic ndings. T o coincide with the report, the Wellcome Trust published a position statement afrming its commitment to open-accessscientic publishing.Funding in UK universities This year saw a number ofconsultations on the future of research funding in UKuniversities. Responding to theseconsultations, the WellcomeTrust maintained its fundamentalbelief that it funds research inpartnership with the governmentin the UK. It funds the full direct costs of research - reagents, equipment,and the salaries of many technicalstaff and principal investigators.However, maintaining the basicinfrastructure of UK universities- laboratory heating and lighting,libraries and so on - is theGovernment's responsibility.However, charities have madeenormous contributions toinfrastructure by funding key staff, trainingresearchers, and providingspecic items of equipment.Charities should be able to make their own decisions aboutthese contributions, matchingtheir missions with the needs of universities.Amended grant conditions In September 2003 theWellcome Trust publishedrevised grant conditions, forgrants held in the UK.The conditions update Trustpolicy on intellectual propertyand its exploitation.See www.wellcome.ac.uk/grantconditions Building progress Building work continuedthroughout Trust's newheadquarters building at inMay 2004.The Librarywill be temporarily housed in210 Euston Road summer2004, before returning to theoriginal Wellcome Building at183 Euston Road in 2006, after itis converted into a public space.Genome Campus open day In May 2003, the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus threwopen its doors for a three-daycelebration to mark the SangerInstitute's tenth birthday and the50th anniversary of the discoveryof the DNA double helix.

Awards made through the Neurosciences Panel spanned the full range of neurosciences,from molecular studies of neuronmigration to cognitive andpsychiatric neuroscience. At themore molecular and cellular endof the neurosciences researchspectrum, Professor Russell Fosterreceived a programme grant tocontinue his highly successfulstudies of non-rod, non-conephotoreceptor cells in themammalian eye (see page 12) . Programme grants were also awarded to Professor Alun Daviesfrom the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies in Edinburghto investigate the molecularmechanisms which determine the death or survival of individualnerve cells in the developingnervous system, and to Dr ChristineHolt to study the navigation ofnerve axons in the developing brain.In the area of psychiatry, project grants were awarded to ProfessorGlyn Harrison to study psychosis-like symptoms in children andadolescents, and to Dr JonnaKuntsi to examine psychological andgenetic aspects of hyperactivity inpairs of twins. Among the awards made by the Physiology and PharmacologyPanel were grants to Dr Colin Taylor (University of Cambridge)for his studies of calcium signallingin human cells and to ProfessorLucilla Poston (Guy's, King's and St Thomas' School of Medicine,London) for a trial of vitaminsupplements to prevent pre-eclampsia - potentially dangeroushigh blood pressure in pregnantwomen, which can lead to prematurebirth or harm to the mother. Another notable award was to the Museum of London, to set up a database of the remains ofnearly 5000 people who diedduring the Roman and Saxonperiods, as well as 600 plaguevictims of the 14th-century BlackDeath who were buried in a massgrave on the former Royal Mintsite in East Smitheld. The Wellcome Trust also has a special bioarchaeology initiative which provides personal supportfor research into studies of ancienthuman history that provide insightinto today's patterns of health and disease. Among the proposalssupported this year was aUniversity Award to Dr KeithDobney (University of Durham)to study the dispersal of humansand their accompanying pathogensin the Holocene period(10-12 000 years ago).Among the awards made through the Functional Genomics Development Initiative was support for a four-year PhD programme in bioinformatics.The programme,led by Professor Michael Sternberg,Director of the Imperial CollegeCentre for Bioinformatics, willrecruit 12 students over two years from a variety of scienticbackgrounds, including mathematics,biology and chemistry, for in-depthtraining in bioinformatics. The 'Value in People ' (VIP) initiative was launched in 2003.The Trust has committed \u00a330 million over ve years to thisscheme, which provides flexiblefunding to assist universities in therecruitment, career progressionand retention of key academic andresearch staff.

Special Initiatives In 2002/03 the Wellcome Trust launched a \u00a325 million initiativefocusing on the health andwellbeing of livestock animals in the developing world (see page 25) . A further new project was the Anglo-French Tropical MedicineInformation Service , a partnership with nine other funding agenciesinvolved international to encouragecollaboration between service website raiseawareness of the range of activitiesand funding opportunities offeredby the major medical researchagencies in France and the UK (see www.wellcome.ac.uk/aftmis ). The Wellcome Trust awarded \u00a34.8 million to an internationalcollaboration led by ProfessorJonathan Weber of ImperialCollege London and ProfessorRodney Phillips at the Universityof Oxford, which will assess theeffects of early administration ofantiretroviral drugs on HIV/AIDS.The multinational ' Spartac ' (short pulse anti-retroviral therapy atsero-conversion) trial will test thetheory that a strong, early attackon HIV will have major long-termbenets for those infected with thevirus, by protecting HIV-specicimmune cells at a stage when HIVis having a particularly detrimentaleffect on immune defences.International Biomedical In an innovative partnership withthe governments of Australia andNew Zealand, the Wellcome Trustmade 11 awards during the yearto international collaborationstackling some of the mostpressing health problems of theAsia-Pacic region (see page 9) . In 2002/03, two International Senior Research Fellowships(ISRFs) for Central Europe were awarded to Dr Maris Laan andDr Tanel Tenson, both at theInstitute University, Estonia.There are now six ISRFs inEstonia - a notably high densityof these prestigious awards for acountry of only 1.5 million residents. ISRFs support outstanding researchers who wish to establisha research career in Czech,Estonian, Hungarian or Polishacademic institutions. In addition tothe two ISRFs funded in Estonia,four were awarded to researchersin Hungary, two in Poland andone in the Czech Republic. FurtherISRFs were awarded in India(nine) and South Africa (two). Although the restructuring countries of Central and EasternEurope and the former SovietUnion continue to dominateapplications for, and awards of,collaborative grants , increasing numbers of high-quality proposalsfrom Latin America have beenreceived and funded. The Programme funded a number of workshops and symposia , including: a workshop on pathogen genomics andinfectious diseases at the Human Genome and Africa Conference,held in South Africa, in March2003; and 'Practical Bioinformaticsfor African Scientists' at theUniversity of the Western Cape,also held in March, which involvedscientists from the WellcomeTrust Sanger Institute. Tropical Medicine The Tropical Medicine Programmehas a particular focus on supportingmajor multidisciplinary researchprogrammes in developingcountries, and on research training and career developmentopportunities in the tropicalmedicine eld. Professor Nicholas White, Director of the Wellcome Trust's Major Research Programme inSouth-East Asia, was funded thisyear to carry out the largest-everclinical trial in severe falciparummalaria (see page 25) . Another trial funded in Thailand will explorethe use of combination therapiesagainst cryptococcal meningitis,a serious disease associated withHIV infection.Training Fellow Dr Brouwer will leadthis study. Funding was nalized in 2002/03 for a new building to house researchers of the Wellcome Trust-KEMRI Research Programme inKenya, led by Professor KevinMarsh.The new building, based atKili District Hospital, will providemuch-improved laboratory facilitiesfor the team of researcherscarrying out a variety of projectsfocused on paediatric infectiousdisease - particularly malaria andmicrobial infections - and its short- and long-term consequences.The programme has played amajor part in the design anddevelopment of Lapdap, a cheapand effective antimalarial licensedin 2003 (see page 24) . Dr Charles Newton's Career Post was renewed to allow himto continue his important work in Kenya on tropical neurology.Training fellowships were awardedto Dr Julie Makani of MuhimbiliUniversity,Tanzania, to study theepidemiology of sickle cell diseasesin East Africa, strengthening therole of the Kili programme intraining scientists from the region,and to Dr Frederica Verra(London School of Hygiene andTropical Medicine) to investigateimmunity to malaria and molecularevolution of the parasite in Kenya. Robert Wilkinson, an afliate of the Wellcome Trust's Centrefor Research in Clinical TropicalMedicine at Imperial College,was awarded a Career Post in Clinical Tropical Medicine(the most senior of the Trust'sfellowships in this area), to studytuberculosis in Cape T own, SouthAfrica.

Funding was nalized in 2002/03 for a new building to house researchers of the Wellcome Trust-KEMRI Research Programme inKenya, led by Professor KevinMarsh.The new building, based atKili District Hospital, will providemuch-improved laboratory facilitiesfor the team of researcherscarrying out a variety of projectsfocused on paediatric infectiousdisease - particularly malaria andmicrobial infections - and its short- and long-term consequences.The programme has played amajor part in the design anddevelopment of Lapdap, a cheapand effective antimalarial licensedin 2003 (see page 24) . Dr Charles Newton's Career Post was renewed to allow himto continue his important work in Kenya on tropical neurology.Training fellowships were awardedto Dr Julie Makani of MuhimbiliUniversity,Tanzania, to study theepidemiology of sickle cell diseasesin East Africa, strengthening therole of the Kili programme intraining scientists from the region,and to Dr Frederica Verra(London School of Hygiene andTropical Medicine) to investigateimmunity to malaria and molecularevolution of the parasite in Kenya. Robert Wilkinson, an afliate of the Wellcome Trust's Centrefor Research in Clinical TropicalMedicine at Imperial College,was awarded a Career Post in Clinical Tropical Medicine(the most senior of the Trust'sfellowships in this area), to studytuberculosis in Cape T own, SouthAfrica. Dr Wilkinson aims to studythe development of active TB fromlatent TB infection and adversereactions to anti-TB drugs. Dr MarkNichol (University of Cape T own)was awarded a training fellowshipto characterize strains ofMycobacterium tuberculosis causing diseases in South African children.These two fellowships willstrengthen further the tuberculosisresearch base in Cape T own.Advisory committee International Biomedical Interest Group Health Consequences of Population Tropical Medicine Interest Group Change Panel Remit Develops international research strengths Supports research into the health impact of Promotes research in tropical medicine through fellowship exchange and shifts in population structure and behaviour in developing countries through major collaboration.

As well as infectious diseases of the tropics, the Wellcome Trustalso supports research into noncommunicable disorders . Dr Charlotte Hanlon (Institute of Psychiatry), for example, wasawarded a Clinical EpidemiologyFellowship to look at the impactof postnatal depression in Ethiopia.In a similar vein, Dr Atif Rahman(University of Manchester) wasawarded a Career DevelopmentFellowship in Clinical TropicalMedicine to develop and evaluatean intervention to prevent theadverse effects of maternaldepression on infant growth in Pakistan. Health Consequences of Population Change A \u00a35 million initiative to support major awards in Latin America led to the shortlisting of ve applicationsduring the year. The initiative willsupport multidisciplinary researchon the impact on health ofdemographic and societal changes taking place in the region,to enhance collaboration betweeninstitutions and between socialand biomedical sciences, and tostrengthen research capacity. The Africa Centre for Health and Population Studies, led by Dr Michael Bennish, is leading the South African arm of theSpartac trial - a study to test theeffectiveness of early antiretroviraltreatment in HIV infection.The Africa Centre is based in theHlabisa District of KwaZulu-Nataland is carrying out community-based research on HIV/AIDS - a heavy burden of disease in this province. Dr Simon Gregson and colleagues at Imperial College of Science,Technology and Medicine wereawarded a \u00a31.9 million WellcomeTrust programme grant to studythe dynamics of HIV transmission in Zimbabwe , a country badly affected by HIV/AIDS.In South Asia two awards were made to address major diseasesrelated to urbanization and lifestyle changes : strategies for control of hypertension inPakistan (Dr Tazeen Jafar, AgaKhan University, in collaborationwith Professor Nishi Chaturvediet al. at Imperial College London) and the impact of rural-urbanmigration on obesity and diabetesin India (Professor Shah Ebrahimet al., University of Bristol, and Professor Srinath Reddy et al., All India Institute of MedicalSciences, New Delhi).

It is home to the Wellcome TrustSanger Institute, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory's EuropeanBioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) and the MRC Human Genome MappingProject Resource Centre (HGMP-RC), as well as the Wellcome Trust ConferenceCentre and Advanced Courses Programme. Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute The year at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute was notable forsignicant progress on both oldprojects and in new directions.In April 2003, the nished human genome sequence was announced, more than two years ahead of schedule. Of the2.9 billion letters of DNA codethat have been read, the SangerInstitute has contributed morethan 0.8 billion - 30 per cent,including all of chromosomes 1, 6, 9, 10, 13, 20, 22 and X. The Sanger Institute has been committed to producing a 'goldstandard' sequence as completeand accurate as possible. Sequenceproduced by the Sanger Instituteis now 99.999 per cent accurate- less than one error in every100 000 bases. Sequence isrechecked not only internally but also through reanalysis of data by external organizations. The human genome sequence was augmented this year by thatof the laboratory mouse (see page 10).The draft sequence of the mouse genome, produced by aninternational consortium includingthe Sanger Institute, was publishedin Nature .The mouse is the rst non-human mammal to be fully sequenced.The similarity between the two species is of enormous benet toresearchers investigating humanbiology. Careful aligning of thetwo sequences highlights regionsof similarity, which are likely to beconserved genes - an approachthat has helped identify 1200 newhuman genes.The close geneticrelationship between the twoanimals also reinforces theimportance of the mouse as a keymodel for understanding humanbiology and for exploring diseaseprocesses and possible treatments.All data can be obtained as Among the wasthat the potentially deadlybacterium Tropheryma whipplei (see page 10) . Researchers at the Sanger Institute also sequencedand compared the genomesequences of Bordetella pertussis (the bacterium responsible forwhooping cough) with those ofB. bronchiseptica , which causes minor respiratory tract ailmentsin a wide range of animals and is the presumed ancestor of B. pertussis , and B. parapertussis , a close relative that infects onlyhumans and sheep. The comparisons suggest that it is loss of genes by B. pertussis and B. parapertussis , rather than gain of genes by B. bronchiseptica ,that underlies the restricted host range of the human pathogens.Moreover, the particularlydetrimental effects of B. pertussis also appear to be due to geneloss rather than gain - thebacterium has not gained genesmaking it more virulent, butappears to have lost factors thatused to control its virulence. Two Sanger Institute papers topped their categories in the'fast-breaking papers' listing from the Institute for ScienticInformation.'The genomesequence of Schizosaccharomyces pombe ' (Wood et al.) headed the Molecular Biology and Geneticslist while 'The Pfam Protein FamiliesDatabase' (Bateman et al.) topped in the Biology and Biochemistrycategory.The citations of theseand other papers from theSanger Institute provide strongevidence that its work is ofwidespread benet throughoutthe research community. As well as raw sequence data, information about genetic variation between individuals is of critical importance - particularlyas we seek to understand thegenetic origins of commondiseases, which are likely to belinked to specic DNA variants.Building on the success of theSNP Consortium, the SangerInstitute will be making a majorcontribution to the International HapMap Project (see page 18) .The Sanger Institute, EMBL-EBI and the MRC HGMP-RC jointlyorganized open days in July 2003at the Wellcome Trust GenomeCampus.The days were a triplecelebration to mark the 50thanniversary of the description ofthe structure of DNA, the SangerInstitute's tenth anniversary andthe completion of the humangenome sequencing. More than a thousand people attended,including visitors from the generalpublic and schools. The whole of the Sanger Institute was delighted to hear of theaward of the Nobel Prize inPhysiology or Medicine to Sir John Sulston, for his ground-breaking work on the nematodeworm Caenorhabditis elegans . Sir John was the founding Directorof the Sanger Institute and hisleadership was instrumental inestablishing it as one of theworld's leading centres forgenome sequencing and analysis. Under new Director, Dr Allan Bradley, the Sanger Institute hasbeen building on this foundationto ask how genes and theirproducts are involved in healthand disease. Central to this newfocus has been a recruitmentdrive to attract top researcherswho can use genomic approachesto examine key biologicalquestions (see page 10) .GENOME CAMPUS DEVELOPMENT In 2002 ,, South Cambridgeshire District Council's PlanningCommittee granted planningpermission for a 27 000 squaremeter extension to the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus , and construction work began inNovember 2002. The developmentwill accommodate a greaternumber of academics and provide additional cutting-edgefacilities.The rst stage of thedevelopment will providehousing for a sophisticated data centre, laboratory space,a research support facility, ofcesand ancillary accommodation. A four-month investigation was also carried out by theCambridge Archaeological FieldUniton behalf of Cambridgeshire County includedevidence of an ancient roadwhich formerly connectedWessex with East Anglia and istoday known for its archaeologicalrichness, the skeletons of threehumans (one Neolithic, theothers Roman) and a dog, variousfragments of pottery, and postholes and drainage ditchesdemarcating the layout of anancient farmstead.Eventually, structural landscaping - including trees, shrubs andmounding - around the boundaryof the site will shield views of thedevelopment and car parks from the surrounding roads andvillages.The remodelled groundsof the Genome Campus willinclude a wetland area due tobecome a nature reserve. WELLCOME TRUST CONFERENCE CENTRE During the year, the decision was made to rename the HinxtonHall Conference Centre as theWellcome Trust ConferenceCentre at Hinxton. The Conference Centre continued to hostmeetings related to the mission of the institutions on the GenomeCampus, and others building onthe Trust's wider work inbiomedical science. On 17-20 November 2002, it hosted a conference jointlyorganized by as well asthose who are using these newtools, to help create standardizedways of capturing and describingsuch information.T o celebrate the award of the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physiologyor Medicine to Sydney Brenner,Robert Horvitz and John Sulston,the Conference Centre hosted a symposium, elegans Past, Present and Future: The not-so-humble worm' , 9-10 September 2003, part-sponsoredby Wellcome Trust and theMedical Research CouncilLaboratory of Molecular Biology.In addition to the three NobelLaureates, a group of distinguishedC. elegans scientists spoke at the symposium. The rst Joint Cold Spring Harbor- Wellcome Trust Conference on Pharmacogenomics was held on 24-28 September 2003.The meeting focused on theopportunities presented by thegrowing contribution of genomicinformation and technologies tostudies exploring the variableresponses of humans to drugsand toxic agents. The Conference Centre also hosted meetings organized inconjunction with the WellcomeTrust's funding panels, on topicssuch as multi-locus sequencetyping, Burkholderia genomes, and bone (see page 37) .ADVANCED COURSES The year saw four AdvancedCourses held: From Genotype to Protein (35th of multifactorialdiseases (38th Advanced Course; 23-29 July 2003). As usual, the courses were extremely popular andoversubscribed many times over.In light of their popularity, theWellcome Trust is aiming toincrease the number of AdvancedCourses held at Hinxton over thecoming years. The Wellcome Trust Genome Campus also hosted three 'Open Door' workshops, whereparticipants could gain hands-onexperience of working withhuman sequence as wellas an Open Door workshop onpathogen genomes.

UK Biobank Major progress was made on the UK Biobank project during 2002/03, with Chief Executive Dr John Newton appointed,the coordinating centre andregional branches announced,and an ethics and governanceframework published (see page 21) . Diamond Construction work began on thesite of the UK's new synchrotron,Diamond , on 12 March 2003. Dr John Taylor, Director-Generalof the Research Councils, had the honour of 'turning the rstsod' at the Rutherford AppletonLaboratory campus near Didcot,Oxfordshire. The ceremony marked the opening of the construction phaseof the Diamond project, which isdue to end in late 2005. First useof the facility is scheduled for2007. Diamond, a collaborationbetween the Wellcome Trust andthe UK Government, will create aninternationally competitive nationalresource for scientists across manydisciplines, including biomedicalresearchers exploring the structureof large biological molecules.Structural Genomics Consortium The Structural Genomics Consortium , a \u00a340 partnership between theWellcome Trust, GlaxoSmithKlineand four of Canada's leadingresearch-funding agencies, waslaunched in April 2003. Over thenext three years the Consortiumaims to determine the three-dimensional structure of morethan 350 human proteins ofpotential medical importance (see page 17) . Established as a charity, the Structural Genomics Consortium isthe only public-private partnershipworldwide to undertake such atargeted programme of research. The Consortium is led by Aled Edwards, an Associate Professorin the Banting and BestDepartment of Medical Researchat the University of T oronto, and a Senior Scientist at the OntarioCancer Institute. Since 1997 Dr Edwards has been jointlyleading a structural proteomicsprogamme at the University ofT oronto.This programme is linkedwith two of the NIH-fundedstructural genomics centres.Infrastructure During the year, several JointInfrastructure Fund and ScienceResearch Investment Fundprojects were completed. Amongthem was the Centre for ClinicalVaccinology and Tropical Medicineat the University of Oxford, whichopened in September 2003.Thehouses a number of key groupsand is associated with the Trust'sresearch programmes in Thailand,Vietnam and Kenya. A number of functional genomics facilities also opened, including onesat St George's Hospital, London,and the University of Glasgow.Integrated chemistry and biologyfacilities were opened at ImperialCollege, London, and theUniversities of Shefeld and Leeds. The Joint Infrastructure Fund (JIF) was a \u00a3750 million partnershipbetween the Wellcome Trust, theOfce of Science and Technologyand the Higher Education FundingCouncil for England, and wasestablished to upgrade the UK's research infrastructure tointernationally competitivestandards. It ran from 1998-2001.Its successor, the Science ResearchInvestment Fund (SRIF), was a \u00a31 billion initiative with similar aims,launched by the UK Governmentin SRIF,to support high-quality JIF proposalsthat were not originally funded. For information about major projects at Hinxton, see pages 10 and 42. The ultimate aim of the Wellcome Trust is to improve human and animal health. Its biomedicalresearch funding activitiesgenerate considerable amounts of knowledge about human andanimal biology in health anddisease, much of it of potentialvalue in the development of new therapies or diagnostics.However, there are many obstaclesbetween a promising nding inthe laboratory and the delivery of a new product or method to patients - from conrming the initial encouraging results totesting for side-effects, through toscale-up and commercialization. Many promising ideas have not been pursued, perhaps becauseresearchers or universities lackedthe incentive or expertise to take research to the next step,or because the idea was toopreliminary or high risk to attractinterest from commercial sources.It is at these initial stages oftranslation that the WellcomeTrust's Technology Transferactivities are directed. Technology Transfer at the Wellcome Trust was formallylaunched on 21 March 2003,with a presentation at theUniversity of Manchester incubatorfacility.The launch was theculmination of a reassessment of the Wellcome Trust's role intechnology transfer, leading to the integration of translationactivities into the main body of the organization. Previously, technology transfer had beenhandled by a subsidiary of theWellcome Trust, CatalystBioMedica Ltd. Technology transfer depends on productive partnerships thatcapture the strengths of academia,business developers, industry and investors. At the heart of the Wellcome Trust's approach isthe desire to work in partnershipwith others, playing acomplementary role to scientists,university technology transferofces, life-science industries andthe investment community. T o this end, the Trust has recongured its R&D funding,providing two additional forms of support. University Translation Awards support any aspect of technology development that canbe applied to the biomedicalsciences, providing the projectaddresses a dened need inhealthcare, is at an early stage,and has the potential to achieve a commercial follow-on at theconclusion of the project.Typically,they may be designed to establishproof-of-principle or reduction-to-practice of a technology.University Translation Awards arenormally up to \u00a3300 000 and aremanaged by the host institution. Strategic Translation Awards are similar in principle, but aretargeted at areas of strategicimportance to the WellcomeTrust, such as the various xed-term initiatives and ventures thatare supported through the Trust'sgeneral funding mechanisms.As with University Translation Awards, projects may be designedto establish proof-of-principle or reduction-to-practice of atechnology. Unlike UniversityTranslation Awards, staff at theWellcome Trust will be directlyinvolved in managing the project.Awards will normally be up to\u00a3500 000. During the year a number of leading gures from academicresearch and the technologytransfer sector were recruited to sit on the T echnology Transfer Challenge Committee , which assesses University TranslationAward applications, and theT echnology Transfer StrategyPanel, which decides upon Strategic Translation Award applicationsalong with wider matters ofstrategy.The recruitment of newstaff ensured that TechnologyTransfer could draw upon a rangeof expertise in biomedical science,commercial translation of research,law and business practice. The Development Fund, which was formerly administered byCatalyst BioMedica Ltd, had itsnal round of funding during theyear. As with the new translationawards, its purpose has been to facilitate the early-stagedevelopment of new technologiesfor healthcare. Overall, more than40 projects from 20 institutionsreceived nancial support fromthe \u00a320 million fund. Projectsthat received backing ranged fromcomputational drug design and drugdevelopment to technologies for point-of-care diagnosis, woundhealing and the development of a new generation of microbicides. While the majority of Development Fund projects have only beenawarded within the past 12-18 months, there is already evidence of some early successes fromearlier rounds. For example,Paradigm Therapeutics Ltd, whichis a University of Cambridge spin- out working in the area of orphanG-protein coupled receptors,raised \u00a312 million in venture capital (see page 23) . Oxxon Pharmaccines Ltd, from the University of Oxford,raised a further \u00a315 million ofventure capital in support of itswork on vaccine development.In total, \u00a330 million of third-partyfunding was raised by DevelopmentFund projects during the year.Given the state of nancialmarkets over this period, this is a signicant achievement. As well as funding,Technology Transfer continues to offer practicaladvice on intellectual propertyand its exploitation to other areasof the Trust and, on request,to Trust-funded researchers.

Strategic Translation Awards are similar in principle, but aretargeted at areas of strategicimportance to the WellcomeTrust, such as the various xed-term initiatives and ventures thatare supported through the Trust'sgeneral funding mechanisms.As with University Translation Awards, projects may be designedto establish proof-of-principle or reduction-to-practice of atechnology. Unlike UniversityTranslation Awards, staff at theWellcome Trust will be directlyinvolved in managing the project.Awards will normally be up to\u00a3500 000. During the year a number of leading gures from academicresearch and the technologytransfer sector were recruited to sit on the T echnology Transfer Challenge Committee , which assesses University TranslationAward applications, and theT echnology Transfer StrategyPanel, which decides upon Strategic Translation Award applicationsalong with wider matters ofstrategy.The recruitment of newstaff ensured that TechnologyTransfer could draw upon a rangeof expertise in biomedical science,commercial translation of research,law and business practice. The Development Fund, which was formerly administered byCatalyst BioMedica Ltd, had itsnal round of funding during theyear. As with the new translationawards, its purpose has been to facilitate the early-stagedevelopment of new technologiesfor healthcare. Overall, more than40 projects from 20 institutionsreceived nancial support fromthe \u00a320 million fund. Projectsthat received backing ranged fromcomputational drug design and drugdevelopment to technologies for point-of-care diagnosis, woundhealing and the development of a new generation of microbicides. While the majority of Development Fund projects have only beenawarded within the past 12-18 months, there is already evidence of some early successes fromearlier rounds. For example,Paradigm Therapeutics Ltd, whichis a University of Cambridge spin- out working in the area of orphanG-protein coupled receptors,raised \u00a312 million in venture capital (see page 23) . Oxxon Pharmaccines Ltd, from the University of Oxford,raised a further \u00a315 million ofventure capital in support of itswork on vaccine development.In total, \u00a330 million of third-partyfunding was raised by DevelopmentFund projects during the year.Given the state of nancialmarkets over this period, this is a signicant achievement. As well as funding,Technology Transfer continues to offer practicaladvice on intellectual propertyand its exploitation to other areasof the Trust and, on request,to Trust-funded researchers.

Biomedical ethics In 2002/03, the Wellcome Trust launched a \u00a34 million fundingscheme for the ethics of biomedical research in developing countries , to support research into thecomplex social, ethical, legal andpublic policy issues surroundingclinical or community-orientedresearch in the developing world. In June 2003, the rst project grant under this scheme was awardedto the University of Malawi,in collaboration with the WellcomeTrust Research Laboratories at Blantyre.The project aims tounderstand the cultural beliefs,perceptions and conceptssurrounding clinical research inMalawi, by focusing on communityand informed consent processes.Several small awards were alsomade to develop ethical reviewcapacity in Zimbabwe, SouthAfrica, Nigeria and Pakistan. Several awards were made through the UK Biomedical EthicsProgramme, including one to theUniversity of Newcastle exploringthe views of embryo donors and non-donors on embryoexperimentation for preimplantationgenetic diagnosis and stem celltherapies. On 17-18 September 2003, the Biomedical Ethics Programmeheld a meeting, 'Translating pharmacogenetics research intopractice: ethical and policy issues' , at the Wellcome Trust ConferenceCentre at Hinxton. A summaryfrom the meeting was producedand submitted as a response to the genetics White Paperpublished by the UK governmentin June 2003.History of Medicine During the year, the WellcomeTrust's History of MedicineProgramme made its rst Strategic and Enhancement Awards to groups at Exeter and Warwick(Strategic Awards) and OxfordBrookes University and theUniversities of Durham andNewcastle upon Tyne(Enhancement Awards) (see page 11) . The Research Resources in Medical History grants scheme was extended to run through2003 and 2004. An additional \u00a31 million was allocated to supportthe conservation, preservationand cataloguing of documentarycollections, and projects improving access to these and othermedically important collections.A total of 16 awards were madeduring the year.
