Mahatma Gandhi The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society 1 Dwayne Howell President and CEO David Frantze ChairThe Leukemia & Lymphoma Society's 2007 Annual Report focuses on affecting change through exemplary action.We chose this theme because 2007 saw our organization on the move and creating changes that willadvance our mission. This year, the efforts of our volunteers and staff resulted in a significant milestone: For the first time, Society revenue broke the $300 million mark.With gross revenue of more than $317 million, we are now the third - largest voluntary health agency* in the United States.Thanks to the generosity of individuals, foundations,corporations and organizations this year, the Society funded more than 400 researchers and made more than 5.1 million patient contacts. During the year, we also began to put into action changes that will lead to our North Star 2015 Vision, creating a world for patients that will allow them to experience the best possible outcomes for their specific blood cancer.For many, that will mean cures. This year, we implemented a Co-Pay Assistance Program to help eligible blood cancer patients meet the costs of insurance pr emiums and co-pa ys. The Society also launched a div ersity initiativ e in an eff or t to recognize and respond more effectively to the increasingly varied needs of the communities we serve. As a first step, we conducted a study to identify areas of gender, race, culture and ethnicity that are underrepresented within the Society.This information will guide us in f ormulating strategies to tak e us to ward a Society-wide , cultural transformation. It is an important change that will help us accomplish our g oal of pr oviding service to all blood cancer patients within 30 days of diagnosis. These are the first of many new ways of doing business for the Society that will alter the healthcare landscape for our patients and their caregivers. The 2007 Annual Repor t profiles three volunteers who, as activists in our advocacy program, work to impact public policy to help advance the Society' s mission.Their spirit and ideals represent those of all our constituents who,in their o wn wa ys,live the changes we all wish to see.President & Chairman's Message The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society 3* T otal private supportEach spring, the Society brings a strong and dedicated force of people to Capitol Hill to speak with members of Congress aboutissues of importance to blood cancer patients.These include the need f or incr eased government funding of biomedical research,collaborativ e pub lic-private sector r esearch efforts and patient protection legislationguaranteeing all healthcare consumersfundamental rights, such as the right to receive care in a clinical trial. 4Rich Beres first became involved with the Society in 1988 when he lost his wife Jane to leuk emia. Before her death, Jane was part of several research studies. She was committed to advancing science so other patients could benefit fromher experience. Ten years later, Rich heard about a new Society event, Light The Night \u00aeWalk, and he participated as a way of commemorating Jane and continuing to support her ideals.That led to his becoming a Society advocate, where he was instrumental in the passage of Wisconsin's CancerPatient Protection Act. \"I was never much of an advocate until I attended my first Society Mission Day. I was the only representative from Wisconsin and I felt my voice was heard throughout my day on the Hill. I have repeated the experience several times andam re-energized on each occasion.The feeling that I am makingan impact is very gratifying. And I'm now comfortable being able to go to my local legislators' offices to represent issues of importance to the cancer community . Personally , I feel passionate about the work I'm doing. Jane was my life, my wife, mother to our three daughters and my best friend. I have been fortunate to marry a second time,to Jerilynne, a wonderful woman and mother who understandsthat I still, and always will, miss Jane. In fact, the decision to walkin Light The Night was a joint one, and Jerilynne is completelysuppor tive of the Society's mission. To anyone who is thinking of becoming an advocate ,I'd say our legislator s are people just like you and me .They are also our employees.They have power, but they need to listen to us.And I have seen firsthand what the power of one can dothrough my role in getting the clinical trials legislation passed.Every American has a voice in what happens in our country\u2014use your voice!\" Rich Beres A husband who speaks on the Hill The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society 5The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society 6At one time, few if any children with acute lymphocytic leukemia survived. Fortunately,advances in treatment now make curespossible for 87 percent of children with thisdisease .But with this g ood ne ws come ne w challenges, such as the long-term effects oftreatment. Physical growth or a child's ability to learn may be impaired. It is important thatthese problems be identified early and thatparents seek professional advice about theneed to ha ve children's learning skills assessed. 6Liz Salguero is the mother of an 8-year-old son, Carlos, who was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). During his two-and-a-half years of treatment, she learned a great deal about pediatriccancer and the late effects of treatment. As a Societyadvocate, Liz was instrumental in getting legislation passed requiring insurance companies in her state to cover baseline neurocognitive testing for all pediatriccancer patients. \"I first became involved with the Society through a support group they offered to parents and sib lings of children with cancer. Later, I shared my experiences with families of newly diagnosed children through the Society's FirstConnection program. Serving as chair of the Connecticut Chapter's Patient Services Committee led to my role as an advocate. Our first project:Get a bill passed in the state legislature requiring insurancecoverage of baseline cognitive testing for all children who have undergone cancer treatment. Our family had to bearthe cost of this very expensive testing, so it was an issueclose to my heart. The most important ingredient for advocacy is passion; that drives most of what we do. Speaking before thelegislature is intimidating, but I was certain our position was right, and we didn't back down.We thought it would take years to accomplish our goal, and we were e xhilarated when it took only one legislative session! We are only beginning to understand the long-lasting cognitive effects of cancer treatment. It will be important to raise awareness of the ongoing needs of survivors for years to come; to obtain funding to educate families about the long-term effects of treatment; and to advocate for coverage of associated conditions.\" Liz Salguero A mother whose passion drives her advocacy The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society 78U.S. Rep. Doris Matsui (D-CA) met her husband, former U.S. Rep. Robert Matsui, while attending the University of California, Berkeley. She has had an enduring political career at a Washington law firm and as an official in the Clinton White House, where she also chaired a group appointed by the president to strengthenrelations between the federal government and the nonprofitcommunity. On January 2, 2005, just two months after celebrating their 38th wedding anniversary, Robert died of complications frommyelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a rare blood disorder originatingin the bone marrow. In the special election held later that year to fill her late husband's congressional district seat, Doris waselected to the position she still holds today. \"I believe that as a Member of Congress, I have a moral obligation to try and create a better , healthier America. I was elected to use the resources available through local, state and federal government to fulfill this responsibility. Cancer is one of the most difficult healthcare challenges of the 21st century, affecting nearly everyone in our country. I have been committed to this cause since my earliest days in public ser vice. But since my husband died of MDS, I met many blood cancer patients,and the more I learned, the more I wanted to advocate for this cause. The most important thing that government can do to support people battling cancer is to fund medical researchers developing cures and therapies. I have always supported robust funding levels for the National Institutes of Health and the National Cancer Institute,and will continue to do so .The more cancer research go vernment funds and f ollows through on, the more lives will be saved. At the end of the day ,I'm just like e very other American. I worry about the health and well being of my loved ones. When I look backon Bob's battle with MDS and think how much more he could haveaccomplished in his life, it motivates me to find ways to addressAmerica's key concerns. At the same time, I look at my grandchildrenand think about the kind of America we are going to pass down to future generations.These thoughts guide my priorities each day.\" Congresswoman Doris Matsui Advocate with a Special PerspectiveThe Leukemia & Lymphoma Society 9The need for advocacy has never been greater: Between 1998 and 2005, the National Cancer Institute experienced robust funding growth, widely correlated with an unprecedented decreasein cancer- related deaths in the United States for two straightyears, despite an aging and growing population. Many researchersbelieve the decline was due to increased prevention, earlydetection and new treatments that were tested in clinical trials. But in 2006, federal funding began to slow. By 2007, it was flat at $4 .79 billion, and pr ojections f or 2008 signal a downturn. There is justifiable concern in the medical and scientificcomm unities about the impact of these tr ends at a time when the oppor tunities to advance cancer cur es ha ve never been so promising. The expectation is that decreased levels of fundingwill result in a loss of momentum that will be costly to recover;and fewer clinical trial options, fewer new therapies and fewersurvivors.10...Through Research The Society's research programs support basic, translational and clinical research that focuses on the cause, treatment and prevention of bloodcancers. The Specialized Center of Research (SCOR) Program Four new SCOR grants were awarded in fiscal year 2007, and a total of 22outstanding, collabor ative, multi-disciplinary studies are running at full throttle. The following are examples of significant progress being contr ibuted through SCOR grantees: IJohn Byrd, M.D.,The Ohio State University, and his SCOR team have made several important breakthroughs in the past year in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leuk emia (CLL): In two clinical studies, Rituxan\u00ae, the antibody drug used successfully to treat many B-cell lymphoma patients, was found to be safe and eff ective as a CLL treatment when administered with the drug fludarabine. A new antibody drug proved effective against CLL cells in test tube and ear ly animal tests. A drug originally developed to prevent organ transplant rejection was also found to kill CLL cells.Fiscal Year 2007 Society Highlights Changing Patient Outcomes... IHelen Heslop, M.D., Baylor College of Medicine, and her SCOR team are developing immunotherapies to treat Hodgkin lymphoma. Their new research builds on previous, Society-funded work, whichshowed that specialized immune cells (cytotoxic T lymphocytes) can beengineered and used with vaccines to treat or even prevent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-related lymphomas in immunocompromised patients. Now, the team is using bioengineering techniques to develop a more universal anti-lymphoma therapy that is proving effective in the laboratory and is likely to help an even larger number oflymphoma patients. Similar strategies are likely to help patients with other blood cancers. Research breaking new ground The Society funds other research aimed at understanding cancer stem cells,increasingly appreciated as the root of some b lood cancers and the possible source of relapses.The Society also supports the discovery of cancer-causingmolecular abnor malities, including v ery large genetic abnormalities that were unrecognized until just this year, and \"epigenetic\" abnormalities that can cause cancer without changing the genetic code at all. These sea-change understandings may make possible the development of new \"targeted\" therapies that effectively kill cancer cells more specificallythan today's standard treatments and with fewer side-effects. Small chemicals and antibodies are in this new drug pipeline ,and targeted imm unotherapies are being developed to help patients' own immune systems better f ight their cancers.The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society 11An added focus on survivorship issues and late effects IStandard treatments for blood cancer and solid tumor cancer patients can cause adverse long-term side-effects, including a range of secondarycancers.Through a new initiative announced in 2007, the Society is seeking grant applications from researchers whose work addresses the health issues of cancer survivors. New awards in this area will extendexisting Society-funded research to understand which treatments will be most effective for each patient while carrying the lowest risk of late and long-term side-effects. effects. IElly Barry, M.D., Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, a Society Special Fellow in Clinical Research, is working to reduce potential heart abnormalities among children f ollowing leukemia treatment.These life-threatening side-effects can be caused by commonly used anthracyclinedrugs and the iron complexes that form once they are administered.Dr. Barry is studying whether common changes in genes that process ironmight increase the risk of heart complications. If so, genetic tests couldidentify at-risk patients so that alter native treatments could be emplo yed. ...Through Patient Services As more children sur vive childhood cancer ,there is a need to focus on the long-term cognitive effects of their treatment.These \"late effects\"can result in learning issues that affect academic performance and requirespecial resources. The Society is the leading organization providing resources of staff and educational programs to combat this growing problem. The Society's Welcome Back: Facilitating the Return to School for Children with Cancer program educates school nurses and other personnel about the needs of these children during and after their return to school. A grant from RegenceBlueCross BlueShield of Oregon this year ga ve the program extra clout over a four-state area. Financial support was also provided by the Lance Armstrong Foundation.Additional education on issues facing pediatric cancer patients and their families is provided through Focus on Childhood Cancer, an extensive series of Society telephone education progr ams that is archiv ed on our Web site, www.LLS.org. Two new programs were added to the series in fiscal year 2007: How Childhood Cancer Touches the Entire Family and Education Challenges After Treatment: Middle School Through College. ...Through Advocacy The Society's Patient Advocates Network, more than 16,000 volunteers strong and growing, has affected a range of public policies that will enhance the search for cures and improve the quality of education, access and treatment of blood cancer patients: IAs of fiscal year 2007, advocates have secured a total of $28 million in blood cancer research funding from the U.S. Department of Defense. IIn 2007, the f ive-year total that Society advocates have secured for blood cancer patient education from the federal Centers for Disease Controland Prevention reached nearly $25 million. As one of the organizationsthat has received grants from these funds, the Society has inauguratedoutreach programs to elderly and underserved blood cancer patients. ICampaigns to guarantee insurance coverage for patients enrolled in cancer clinical trials were launched in New Y ork and Pennsylvania,modeled on the passage of legislation in California and Wisconsin.12 ...Through Fundraising Campaigns T eam In Training\u00ae(TNT), the world's largest endurance spor ts training program, continued its amazing growth, raising more than $125 million in fiscal year 2007 - 10 percent higher than the previous year. Since it started in 1988, TNT has trained 340,000 people formarathons, half marathons, triathlons and 100-mile cyclingevents. The campaign has raised more than $800 millionto help find cures. Light The Night Walk,the nation's night to pa y trib ute and bring hope to people battling cancer, exceeded its goal this year, raising nearly $35 million to help advance the Society's mission. Thousands of participants in 240 communities walked and raisedfunds, lighting the night with hope. School & Youth SMPrograms also exceeded budget this year . Ten million students in 21,000 schools raised $18.5 million, demonstrating the power of young people to change the w orld! ...Thr ough Donor De velopment On behalf of patients and their families, the Societyexpresses its gratitude to the very special donors whose commitments totaled $31.4 million in fiscal year2007. This figure included $4.9 million in bequests from individuals who had the foresight to include the Society in their estate plan. We exceeded our goal and areinspired to seek increased participation in fiscal year 2008. We are proud that 100 percent of donor-restricted gifts for research, patient services and advocacy supportthe Society's mission.Fiscal Year 2007 Fundraising Highlights Changing Patient Outcomes...

(the Society) as of June 30, 2007, and the related consolidated statements of activities, cash flows, and functional expenses for the year then ended.These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Society's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on ouraudit. The prior year summarized comparative information has been derived from the Society's2006 consolidated financial statements and, in our report dated October 24, 2006, we expressedan unqualified opinion on those statements. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit pr ocedur es that ar eappropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Society's internal control over financialreporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a testbasis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing theaccounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements r eferred to above present fairly ,in all material respects, the financial position of The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Inc. as of June 30, 2007, and the changes in its net assets and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Organization and Significant Accounting Policies Organization The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Inc. (the \"Society\") is an international not-for -pr ofit health agency dedicated to seeking the cause and cure of leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease and myeloma and improving the quality of life of patients and their families. The Society's principal activities include: awardingresearch grants; facilitating psychosocial support groups; providing financial aid to patients; answering phone requests for blood cancer information made to theSociety's Information Resource Center; and disseminating educational informationabout blood cancers in the form of publications, internet sites, conference calls and symposia sponsorship for both the medical community and the general public. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Society , which encompasses the Home Office of the Society and its sixty four chapters, The Leukemia & L ymphoma Society of Canada, Inc. (\"LLSC\"), and the Society's not-for-profit affiliates, The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society ResearchPrograms, Inc. and The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society Research Foundation. All significant inter-company and intra-Society accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Tax-Exempt Status The Society qualifies as a charitable organization as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3) and, accor dingly , is exempt from federal income taxes under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(a). Additionally, since the Society is publicly-supported, contributions to the Society qualify for the maximum charitable contribution deduction under the Internal Revenue Code. LLSC is registered as a charitable organization under the Income Tax Act (Canada) and is therefore not subject to income taxes if certain disbursement requirements aremet. Net Asset ClassificationsTo ensure observance of limitations and restrictions placed on the use of resourcesavailable to the Society ,funds that have similar characteristics have been classified into three net asset categories as follows: Unrestricted net assets: Consist of funds that ar efully available, at the discr etion of the Boar dof Dir ectors, for the Society to utilize in any of its pr ograms or supporting services. Temporarily restricted net assets: Consist of funds that are restricted by donors for a specific time period or purpose, as well as amounts r elating to term endowment or deferred giving arrangements in which the funds must be maintained intact over the lifetimes of the donors.Permanently r estricted net assets: Consist of funds that contain donor-imposed restrictions r equiring that the principal be invested in perpetuity and that only the income be used. Income earned on these funds may be unrestricted or temporarily restricted, depending upon the donor-imposed restrictions.Contributions and Deferred RevenueContributions are recorded as revenue, at their fair value, when received or promisedunconditionally . Contributions r eceived with donor restrictions that limit their use are reported as either temporarily or permanently restricted revenue. When a donorrestriction is met through the passage of time or fulfillment of a purpose restriction,temporarily restricted net assets are reclassified to unrestricted net assets and reportedin the statement of activities as net assets released from restrictions. Conditional con-tributions are recognized as revenue when the conditions have been substantially met. Deferred revenue includes amounts received for special events that will be held subsequent to the fiscal year-end. Donated Services The Society has determined that certain of the donated services it receives meet the criteria for r ecognition in the financial statements. Specifically , the donated services of family support group facilitators and research grant reviewers have beenvalued and are reported as both revenue and expense. Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist of short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less fr om date of pur chase, except for amounts held for long-term purposes reported as investments. Fixed Assets and Depr eciation Fixed assets, which consist principally of equipment, software, and leasehold impr ovements, ar e recorded at cost, if purchased, or at fair value at date of donation, if contributed, and are depreciated or amortized using the straight-line method overthe estimated useful lives of the assets or the terms of the leases, if shorter. Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally acceptedaccounting principles r equir es the Society's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements andaccompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Summarized Financial Information The financial statements are presented with 2006 summarized or comparative information. W ith r espect to the statement of activities, such prior year information is not presented by net asset class and, in the statement of functional expenses, 2006 expenses by object ar epresented in total rather than by functional categor y. Accordingly, such information should be read in conjunction with the Society's 2006 consolidated financial statements from which the summarized infor mation was derived. Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2006 comparative infor mation to conform to the current year presentation.
