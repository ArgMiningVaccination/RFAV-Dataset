PANACEA uses networkanalysis to construct networks made of \"element nodes\"such as exposures (drugs and vaccines) and outcomes(adverse events), or networks made of nodesrepresenting cases (AE reports) PANACEA uses NLP and network analysis to facilitate the analysis of clinical data by deconstructing text intocomponents such as products, diagnoses, symptoms,and time stamps.PANACEA automates the translation of terms intostandard medical dictionaries such as MedDRA and ICD;and by visualizing data and aiding in pattern recognition When applied to AE report data, the tools allow reviewers to r apidly evaluate potential associations between products and AEs. CBER continues to use, evaluate, and iteratively improve tool functions and algorithms.PANACEA - Support Advanced Analysis Build and Analyze Report Networks Pattern-based and Advanced Network Analyzer for Clinical Evalua tion and Assessment (PANACEA) is used to create report networks : -Dots and lines represent the reports and their connections , respectively. - The connections are created when two reports contain the same information.PANACEA - Support Advanced Analysis Build and Analyze Report Networks *Find condition-related reportsIschemic Heart Disease* Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH)21NLP Applications at CDRH NLP helps with identifying cases and with the classification pr oblems where chain of event s and sequence matters.

Topic modeling could be advantageously applied to the large datasets of biological or medical research. Overview Approach Key Players NCTR 24Focus on the data mining and safety signal detection of FDA drug adverse events.New safety signals were identified when comparingwith the currently available information in varioussources.Drug groups derived from the drug associationswere generated which can be used to predictpotential adverse event. The NCTR team has collected about 10 years' reports from FAERS database, and a total of 63082 drug adverse event pairs were identified as the significant association between 936 drugs and 10316 adverse events. A random network algorithm was applied and 14 drug groups were obtained.
