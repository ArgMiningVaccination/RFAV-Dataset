Tribal doctors assist customer-owners of all ages using practices such as traditional physical, traditional counseling, and talking circles. In addition, there is an Alaska Native traditional healing garden. The majority of these plants are native to Alaska. For thousands of years, these plants have nourished and healed our people. We believe that everything was put on this earth for a purpose. Traditional Healing Services Offered: Traditional Counseling Traditional counseling meets customer-owners where they are in their wellness journey and provides a safe space to explore behavior change. During a traditional counseling session, both reflective listening and dialog are used. Traditional counseling encourages personal growth through self-discovery and self-acceptance. Counseling can be done in combination with healing touch. Traditional Physical Healing Hands Healing hands is a physical modality in which practitioners perform body work using varied hands-on pressure. This practice is used to relieve pain in the physical body, increase mobility, and address imbalances. Healing hands seeks to identify and treat the root cause of a problem while simultaneously addressing the symptoms. Healing Touch Healing touch is an energy therapy in which practitioners consciously use their hands in a heart-centered intentional way to support and facilitate physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health. This approach is a biofield (magnetic field around the body) therapy. Healing touch influences the human energy system that surrounds the body, and the centers that control the flow from the energy field to the physical body. These non-invasive techniques employ the hands to clear and balance the human energy fields, thus affecting health. The goal of healing touch is to restore balance and harmonies in the energy system, placing the client in a position to selfheal. Talking Circle A talking circle is an ancient cultural ceremony of sharing and responding to story and is confidential and without judgement. Participating in a talking circle encourages customer-owners to speak their truth, step into their gifts, and embrace areas of growth and acceptance of oneself and others. A talking circle is rooted in authenticity and love. Healing Garden SCF's healing garden includes edible and medicinal flora used for generations and combines traditional Alaska Native healing techniques with modern medicine. Alaska Native values, beliefs, and practices are incorporated for the ultimate benefit of customer-owners. You may view the healing garden from the Anchorage Native Primary Care Center lobby. Traditional Healing Cultural Classes Cultural classes are conducted in person. They are taught by Traditional Healing Clinic employees who share knowledge passed down from Alaska Native Elders. Cultural classes are opportunities for customer-owners and employees to connect with their Indigenous ways of living through practicing traditional skills.
