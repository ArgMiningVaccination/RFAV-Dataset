Instructions and examples for coding specialists, contractors, physicians, hospitals, and other health care providers to use in determining the use of ICD codes for coding diagnostic test results is found in chapter 23. 10.1 - Billing Part B Radiology Services and Other Diagnostic Procedures (Rev. 1, 10- 01-03) Acceptable HCPCS codes for radiology and other diagnostic services are taken primarily from the CPT -4 portion of HCPCS. Payment is the lower of the charge or the Medicare physician fee schedule amount. Deductible and coinsurance apply, and coinsur ance is based on the allowed amount. For claims to A/B MACs (A) or (HHH), revenue codes, HCPCS code, line item dates of service, units, and applicable HCPCS modifiers are required. Charges must be reported by HCPCS code. If the same revenue code applies to two or more HCPCS codes, providers should repeat the revenue code and show the line item date of service, units, and charge for each HCPCS code on a separate line. 20 - Payment Conditions for Radiology Services (Rev. 1, 10- 01-03) B3-15022 20.1 - Professional Component (PC) (Rev. 1, 10- 01-03) A/B MACs (B) must pay for the PC of radiology services furnished by a physician to an individual patient in all settings under the fee schedule for physician services regardless of the specialty of the physic ian who performs the service. For services furnished to hospital patients, A/B MACs (B) pay only if the services meet the conditions for fee schedule payment and are identifiable, direct, and discrete diagnostic or therapeutic services to an individual pa tient, such as an interpretation of diagnostic procedures and the PC of therapeutic procedures. The interpretation of a diagnostic procedure includes a written report. 20.2 - Technical Component (TC) (Rev. 1, 10- 01-03) 20.2.1 - Hospital and Skilled Nursing Facility 06-09) A/B MACs (B) may not pay for the technical component (TC) of radiology services furnished to hospital patients. Payment for physicians' r adiological services to the hospital, e.g., administrative or supervisory services, and for provider services needed to produce the radiology service, is made by the AB MAC (A) to the hospital as a provider service. AB MACs (A) include the TC of radiology services for hospital inpatients, except Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs), in the prospective payment system (PPS) payment to hospitals. Hospital bundling rules exclude payment to suppliers of the TC of a radiology service for beneficiaries in a hospital inpatient stay. CWF performs reject edits to incoming claims from suppliers of radiology services. Upon receipt of a hospital inpatient claim at the CWF, CWF searches paid claim history and compares the period between the hospital inpatient admission and discharge dates to the line item service date on a line item TC of a radiology service billed by a supplier. The CWF will generate an unsolicited response when the line item service date falls within the admission and discharge dates of the hospital inpatient claim. Upon receipt of an unsolicited response, the A/B MAC (B) will adjust the TC of the radiology service and recoup the payment. For CAHs, payment to the CAH for inpatients is made at 101 percent of reasonable cost. Radiology and other diagnostic services furnished to hospital outpatients are paid under the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) to the hospital. This applies to bill types 12X and 13X that are submitted to the AB MAC (A). Effective 4/1/06, type of bill 14X is for non- patient laboratory specimens and is no longer applicable for radiology services. As a result of SNF Consolidated Billing (Section 4432(b) of the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997), A/B MACs (B) may not pay for the TC of radiology se rvices furnished to Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) inpatients during a Part A covered stay. The SNF must bill radiology services furnished its inpatients in a Part A covered stay and payment is included in the SNF Prospective Payment System (PPS). Radiol ogy services furnished to outpatients of SNFs may be billed by the supplier performing the service or by the SNF under arrangements with the supplier. If billed by the SNF, Medicare pays according to the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. SNFs submit claims to the AB MAC (A) with type of bill 22X or 23X. 20.2.2 - Services Not Furnished in Hospitals (Rev. 1, 10- 01-03) A/B MACs (B) must pay under the fee schedule for the TC of radiology services furnished to beneficiaries who are not patients of any hospita l, and who receive services in a physician's office, a freestanding imaging or radiation oncology center, or other setting that is not part of a hospital. 20.2.3 - Services Furnished in Leased Departments (Rev. 1, 10- 01-03) In the case of procedures furn ished in a leased hospital radiology department to a beneficiary who is neither an inpatient nor an outpatient of any hospital, e.g., the patient is referred by an outside physician and is not registered as a hospital outpatient, both the PC and the TC of the services are payable under the fee schedule by the A/B MAC (B). 20.2.4 - Services That Do Not Meet the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) Standard Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (PAMA) is titled \"Quality Incentives To Promote Patient Safety and Public Health in Computed Tomography Diagnostic Imaging.\" It amends the Social Security Act (SSA) by reducing payment for the technical component (and the technical component of the global fee) of the Physician Fee Schedule service (5 percent in 2016 and 15 percent in 2017 and subsequent years) for computed tomography using equipment that does not meet each of the attributes of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) Standard XR -29-2013, entitl ed \"Standard Attributes on CT Equipment Related to Dose Optimization and Management.\" The statutory provision requires that information be provided and attested to by a supplier and a hospital outpatient department that indicates whether an applicable CT s ervice was furnished that was not consistent with the NEMA CT equipment standard, and that such information may be included on a claim and may be a modifier. The statutory provision also provides that such information shall be verified, as appropriate, as part of the periodic accreditation of suppliers under SSA section 1834(e) and hospitals under SSA section 1865(a). Any reduced expenditures resulting from this provision are not budget neutral. To implement this provision, CMS created modifier \"CT\" (Com puted tomography services furnished using equipment that does not meet each of the attributes of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) XR -29-2013 standard). Beginning in 2016, claims for CT scans described by above -listed CPT codes (and any successor codes) that are furnished on non- NEMA Standard XR -29-2013- compliant CT scans must include modifier \"CT\" that will result in the applicable payment reduction. A list of codes subject to the CT modifier will be maintained in the web supporting files for the annual rule. Beginning January 1, 2016, a payment reduction of 5 percent applies to the technical component (and the technical component of the global fee) for Computed Tomography (CT) services furnished using equipment that is inconsistent with the CT equipment standard and for which payment is made under the physician fee schedule. This payment reduction becomes 15 percent beginning January 1, 2017, and after. 20.2.5 - Special Rule to Incentivize Transition from Traditional X -Ray Imaging to Digital Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 is titled \"Medicare Payment Incentive for the Transition from Traditional X -Ray Imaging to Digital Radiography and Other Medicare Imaging Payment Provision.\" It amends the Social Security Act (SSA) by reducing the payment amounts under the Physician Fee Schedule by 20 percent for the technical component (and the technical component of the globa l fee) of imaging services that are X -rays taken using film, effective January 1, 2017, and after. Modifier FX (X ray taken using film) was created to implement this provision. Beginning January 1, 2017, claims for X-rays using film must include modifie r FX, which will result in the applicable payment reduction. 20.2.5.1 - Remittance Advice Remark Codes (RARCs), Claim Adjustment Reason Codes (CARCs), and Medicare Summary Notice following messages when adjusting x -ray radiograph claim lines that have been reported with the FX modifier: CARC 237 - Legislated/Regulatory Penalty. At least one Remark Code must be provided (may be comprised of either the NCPDP Reject Reason Code, or Remittance Advice Remark Code that is not an ALERT.) RARC N775 - Payment adjusted based on x -ray radiograph on film. MSN 30.1 - The approved amount is based on a special payment method. 20.2.6 - Special Rule to Incentivi ze Transition from X -rays taken using Computed of the Social Security Act provides that payments for imaging services that are X -rays taken using computed radiography (including the X -ray component of a packaged service) furnished during CY 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, that would otherwise be made under the PFS (without application of subparagraph (B)(i) and before application of any other adjustment), be reduced by 7 percent, and similarly, if such X - ray services are furnished during CY 2023 or a subsequent year, by 10 percent. Computed radiography technology is defined for purposes of this paragraph as cassette - based imaging which utilizes an imaging plate to create the image involved. Modifier FY was created to implement this provision. Beginning January 1, 2018, claims for computed radiography must include modifier FY, which will result in the applicable payment reduction. 20.3 - Anti -Markup Payment of the Social Security Act (the Act) establishes payment rules for certain diagnostic tests (other than clinical diagnostic laboratory tests) where the physician performing or supervising the test does not share a practice with the billing physician or other supplier. Examples of tests covered under this rule include, but are not limited to: x -rays, EKGs, EEGs, cardiac monitoring, and ultrasound services furnished on or after January 1, 1994. (Note that screening mammography services are covered under another provision of the Act and are not subject to the anti -markup payment limitation.) The anti -markup payment limitation applies to the technical component or \"TC\" of certain diagnostic tests that are payable on the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MP FS). Effective January 1, 2009, the anti -markup payment limitation also applies to the professional component or (\"PC\") of diagnostic tests (other than clinical diagnostic tests). The anti -markup payment limitation only applies when a physician (or other supplier) orders and bills for a diagnostic test in which the TC or PC is performed by a physician who does not \"share a practice\" with the ordering/billing physician (or other supplier). For more information on the anti -markup payment limitation, see cha pter 1, \u00a730.2.9. 20.3.1 - A/B MAC diagnostic test (other than a clinical diagnostic laboratory test) is personally performed or is supervised by a physici an, such physician may bill under the normal physician fee schedule rules. This includes situations in which the test is performed or supervised by another physician with whom the billing physician shares a practice (see Pub. 100- 04, chapter 1, \u00a730.2.9). Section 80, chapter 15, of Pub. 100- 02, Medicare Benefit Policy, sets forth the various levels of physician supervision required for diagnostic tests. The supervision requirement for physician billing is not met when the test is administered by supplier personnel regardless of whether the test is performed at the physician's office or at another location. If a physician bills for a diagnostic test that is subject to the anti- markup payment limitation, the fee schedule amount for the acquired service equa ls the lower of: The performing physician or other supplier's net charge to the billing physician or other supplier for performing the service; The billing physician or other supplier's actual charge; or The fee schedule amount allowed for the jurisdiction where the service was performed. The lowest figure is the fee schedule amount for purposes of the limiting charge. (See chapter 1, \u00a730.3.12.1 of this publication) The billing entity must identify the performing physician or other supplier ( including the performing provider's NPI) and the amount the performing physician or other supplier charged the billing entity (net of any discounts). A physician who accepts assignment is permitted to bill and collect from the beneficiary only the applica ble deductible and coinsurance for the acquired test. A physician who does not accept assignment is permitted to bill and collect from the beneficiary only the fee schedule amount (as defined above) for the acquired test. The limiting charge provision is not applicable. If the physician does not identify who performed the test and provide the other required information, no payment is allowed. The physician may not bill the beneficiary any amount for the test. 20.3.2 - Billing for Services (Rev. or other supplier may bill and receive Part B payment for the technical component (TC) or professional component (PC) of diagnostic tests which the physician or other supplier contracts a physician, medical group, or other supplier to perform. (This claim and payment procedure does not extend to clinical diagnostic laboratory tests.) The anti-markup rule will apply to the TC or PC of diagnostic tests that have been ordered by the billing physician or other supplier (or by a party financially related to the billing physician or other supplier through common ownership or control) if the performing physician or other supplier does not meet the criteria for \"sharing a practice\" with t he ordering/billing entity. An example is when the attending physician orders radiology tests from a radiologist and the radiologist purchases the tests from an imaging center with whom the radiologist does not meet the criteria for \"sharing a practice.\" Under the anti-markup payment limitation, the billing physician or other supplier may not mark up the charge for a test from the acquisition price and must accept as full payment for the test (even if assignment is not accepted) the lowest of: the fee sch edule amount as if the performing physician or other supplier had billed directly, the billing entity's actual charge, or the performing physician or other supplier's net charge to the billing entity. The billing physician or other supplier must be financi ally related to the physician or group that ordered the tests through common ownership or control. If the performing physician or other supplier meets the criteria for \"sharing a practice\" with the billing physician or other supplier, then the anti -markup payment limitation will not apply and the lower of the physician fee schedule amount or the billed amount will be paid. The physician or other supplier that performed the component that is subject to the anti - markup rule must be enrolled in the Medicare program. No formal reassignment is necessary; however, reassigned services are also subject to the anti -markup payment limitation. A. Radiology Services Contractors shall apply the anti -markup payment limitation to the TC and PC of radiology diagnostic testing services other than screening mammography procedures. See Publication 100- 04, chapter 1, \u00a730.2.9 for more information on the anti -markup payment limitation. B. Payment to a Physician or Other Supplier of Diagnostic Tests for Services Subject to the Anti -Markup Payment Limitation A physician or other supplier that provides diagnostic tests may bill and receive the Part B payment for the TC or PC of diagnostic tests which that physician or other supplier acquires from another physician, medical g roup, or other supplier. If the performing physician does not meet the requirements for sharing a practice with the ordering/billing physician or other supplier, then the anti -markup payment limitation rules will apply. (See section 30.2.9 of this chapter for more information.) If the performing physician is deemed to share a practice with the physician or other supplier that ordered the test, then the physician fee schedule amount may be billed and the anti -markup payment limitation will not apply. In e ither case, the performing physician or other supplier must be enrolled in the Medicare program. No formal reassignment is necessary; however, the anti - markup payment limitation will apply to reassigned services. If the anti -markup rules apply, payment m ay not exceed the lowest of the following amounts: The performing physician or other supplier's net charge to the billing physician or other supplier;* The billing physician or other supplier's actual charges; or The fee schedule amount allowed for the test if the performing physician or other supplier billed directly. *The net charge must be determined without regard to any charge that is intended to reflect the cost of equipment or space leased to the performing physician or supplier by or through the billing entity. For more information, see Pub. 100- 04, chapter 1, \u00a730.2.9. The billing physician or other supplier must keep on file the name, address, and NPI of the physician or other supplier who performed the anti -markup service. C. Sanctions Physicians who knowingly and willfully, in repeated cases, bill Medicare beneficiaries amounts beyond those outlined in this chapter are subject to the penalties contained under \u00a71842(j)(2) of the Act. P enalties are assigned after post -pay review depending on the severity. D. Questionable Business Arrangements No special charge or payment constraints are imposed on tests performed by a physician or a technician under the physician's supervision. There are two requirements for all diagnostic tests under \u00a71861(s)(3) of the Act, as implemented by 42 CFR \u00a7410.32 and section 10 of chapter13 of this publication and section 80, chapter 15 of Pub. 100- 02BP. Namely, the test must be ordered by the treating practitioner, and the test must be supervised by a physician. However, attempts may be made by the medical diagnostic community to adjust or establish arrangements which continue to allow physicians to profit from other's work or by creating the appearance t hat the physician has performed or supervised his/her technicians who are employed, contracted, or leased. Some of these arrangements may involve cardiac scanning services and mobile ultrasound companies leasing their equipment to physicians for the day t he equipment is used, and hiring out their staff to the physicians to meet the supervision requirement. The bona fides of such arrangements may be suspect and could be an attempt to circumvent the anti -markup payment limitation. If you have any doubt tha t a particular arrangement is a valid relationship where the physician is performing or supervising the services, this should be investigated. The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) has responsibility for investigating violations of \u00a71842(n) of the Act. Another arrangement to circumvent the anti -markup payment limitation is for the ordering physician to reassign his/her payment for the interpretation of the test to the supplier. The supplier, in turn, bills for both the test and the interpretation and pays the ordering physician a fee for the interpretation. This arrangement violates \u00a71842(b)(6) of the Act, which prohibits Medicare from paying benefits due the person that furnished the service to any other person, subject to limited exceptions discussed in Pub. 100- 04, chapter 1, \u00a730.2.2. Also, this arrangement could constitute a violation of \u00a71128 B (b) of the Act, which prohibits remuneration for referrals (i.e., kickbacks). Violations of \u00a71128B ( b) of the Act may subject the physician or supplier to criminal penalties or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Illegal remuneration for referrals can be found even when the ordering physician performs some service for the remuneration. 30 - Computerized Axial Tomography (CT) Procedures (Rev. 1, 10- 01-03) A/B MACs (B) do not reduce or deny payment for medically necessary multiple CT scans of different areas of the body that are performed on the same day. The TC RVUs for CT procedures th at specify \"with contrast\" include payment for high osmolar contrast media. When separate payment is made for low osmolar contrast media under the conditions set forth in \u00a730.1.1, reduce payment for the contrast media as set forth in \u00a730.1.2. 30.1 - Low Osmolar Contrast Media for LOCM (HCPCS codes Q9945 -Q9951) in the case of all medically necessary intrathecal radiologic procedures furnished to nonhospital patients. Effective January 1, 2005 in the case of intraarterial and intravenous radiologic procedures, the five restrictive criteria (a history of previous adverse reaction to contrast material, with the exception of a sensation of heat, flushing, or a single episode of nausea or vomiting; a history of asthma or allergy; significant cardia c dysfunction including recent or imminent cardiac decompensation, severe arrhythmia, unstable angina pectoris, recent myocardial infarction, and pulmonary hypertension; generalized severe debilitation; or sickle cell disease) for the payment of LOCM are e liminated. 30.1.2 payment in the same manner as for a drug furnished incident to a physician's service. The payment methodology for LOCM for the period of January 1, 2005 through March 31, 2005 is made in accordance with the established payment for calendar year 2004 using codes A4644- A4646. Effective April 1, 2005, the method of payment for LOCM is the average sales price (ASP) plus six percent in acco rdance with the standard methodology for drug pricing established by the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA0 for other than hospital outpatient claims. Payments for the new Q codes can be found in the respective quarterly Medicare Part B drug pricing files t hat are posted on the CMS Web site. 30.1.3 - SNF Billing and A/B MAC (A) Payment for Contrast Material Other Than Low Osmolar Contrast Material (LOCM) (Radiology) (Rev. 1, 10- 01-03) When a radiology procedure is provided with contrast material, a SNF should bill using the CPT -4 code that indicates \"with\" contrast material. If the coding does not distinguish between \"with\" and \"without\" contrast material, the SNF should use the available code. Contrast material other than LOCM may be billed separately in addition to the radiology procedure, or it may be billed as part of the amount for the radiology procedure. If the SNF bills separately for the contrast material and the charge for the procedure includes a charge for contrast material, the SNF must adjus t the charge for the procedure to exclude any amount for the contrast material. Regardless of the billing method used, charges are subject to the fee schedule. When billing separately for this contrast material, the SNF should use revenue code 0255 (drug s incident to radiology and subject to the payment limit) and report the charge on the same bill as the radiology procedure. The A/B MAC (A) will not accept late charge bills for this service. 30.1.3.1 - A/B MAC (A) Payment for Low Osmolar for Solid Tumors: June 10: Upon Implementation of Emission Tomography (PET) for Solid Tumors: May 19, 2014 - MAC Non -Shared System Edits; July 7, 2014 - CWF development/testing, development; October 6, Shared System Edits), ICD- 10: Upon Implementation of ICD -10) The LOCM is paid on a reasonable cost basis when rendered by a SNF to its Part B patients (in addition to payment for the radiology procedure) when it is used in one of the situations listed below. The following HCPCS are used when billing for LOCM. HCPCS Code Description (January 1. 1994, and later) A4644 Supply of low osmolar contrast material (100 -199 mgs of iodine); A4645 Supply low (200 -299 mgs of iodine); or A4646 Supply of low osmolar contrast material (300 -399 mgs of iodine). When billing for LOCM, SNFs use revenue code 0636. If the SNF charge for the radiology procedure includes a charge for contrast material, the SNF must adjust the charge for the radiology procedure t o exclude any amount for the contrast material. NOTE: LOCM is never billed with revenue code 0255 or as part of the radiology procedure. The A/B MAC (A) will edit for the intrathecal procedure codes and the following codes to determine if payment for LOC M is to be made. If an intrathecal procedure code is not present, or one of the ICD codes is not present to indicate that a required medical condition is met, the A/B MAC (A) will deny payment for LOCM. In these instances, LOCM is not covered and should not be billed to Medicare. When LOCM Is Separately Billable and Related Coding Requirements In all intrathecal injections. HCPCS codes be included on the claim; or In intravenous and intra -arterial injections only when certain medical conditions are present in an outpatient. The SNF must verify the existence of at least one of the following medical conditions, and report the applicable dia gnosis code(s) either as a principal diagnosis code or other diagnosis codes on the claim: o A history of previous adverse reaction to contrast material. The applicable ICD-9-CM codes are V14.8 and V14.9. The applicable ICD -10-CM codes are Z88.8 and Z88.9. The conditions which should not be considered adverse reactions are a sensation of heat, flushing, or a single episode of nausea or vomiting. If the adverse reaction occurs on that visit with the induction of contrast material, codes describing hives, urticaria, etc. should also be present, as well as a code describing the external cause of injury and poisoning, ICD - 9-CM code E947.8. The applicable ICD -10 CM codes are: T50.8X5A Adverse effect of diagnostic agents, initial encounter, T50.8X5S Adverse effect of diagnostic agents, sequela , T50.995A Adverse effect of other drugs, medicaments and biological substances, initial encounter, or T50.995S Adverse effect of other drugs, medicaments and biological substances, sequela; o A history or condition of a sthma or allergy. The applicable ICD or imminent cardiac decompensation, severe arrhythmia, unstable angina pectoris, recent myocardial infarction, 203.00, o Sickle are D57.811 through D57.819. 40 September 28, 2009 The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) finds that the non -coverage of magnetic res onance imaging (MRI) for blood flow determination is no longer supported by the available evidence. CMS is removing the phrase \"blood flow measurement\" and local Medicare contractors will have the discretion to cover (or not cover). Consult Publication ( Pub.) 100- 03, National Coverage Determinations (NCD) Manual , 1, s ection 220.2, for specific coverage and non- coverage indications associated with MRI and MRA (Magnetic Resonance Angiography). Prior to January 1, 2007 A/B MACs (B) do not make addi tional payments for three or more MRI sequences. The relative value units (RVUs) reflect payment levels for two sequences. The technical component (TC) RVUs for MRI procedures that specify \"with contrast\" include payment for paramagnetic contrast media. A/B MACs (B) do not make separate payment under code A4647. A diagnostic technique has been developed under which an MRI of the brain or spine is first performed without contrast material, then another MRI is performed with a standard (0.1mmol/kg) dose of contrast material and, based on the need to achieve a better image, a third MRI is performed with an additional double dosage (0.2mmol/kg) of contrast material. When the high -dose contrast technique is utilized, A/B MACs (B): Do not pay separately for the contrast material used in the second MRI procedure; Pay for the contrast material given for the third MRI procedure through supply code Q9952, the replacement code for A4643, when billed with Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes 70553, 72156, 72157, and 72158; Do not pay for the third MRI procedure. For example, in the case of an MRI of the brain, if CPT code 70553 (without contrast material, followed by with contrast material(s) and further sequences) is billed, make no payment for CPT code 70551 (without contrast material(s)), the additional procedure given for the purpose of administering the double dosage, furnished during the same session. Medicare does not pay for the third procedure (as distinguished from the contrast material) because t he CPT definition of code 70553 includes all further sequences; and Do not apply the payment criteria for low osmolar contrast media in \u00a730.1.2 to billings for code Q9952, the replacement code for A4643. Effective January 1, 2007 With the implementation for calendar year 2007 of a bottom -up methodology, which utilizes the direct inputs to determine the practice expense (PE) relative value units (RVUs), the cost of the contrast media is not included in the PE RVUs. Therefore, a separate payment for the contrast media used in various imaging procedures is paid. In addition to the CPT code representing the imaging procedure, separately bill the appropriate HCPCS \"Q\" code (Q9945 - Q9954; Q9958- Q9964) for the contrast medium utilized in performing the service. Effective February 24, 2011 Medicare will allow for coverage of MRI for beneficiaries with implanted PMs or cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) for use in an MRI environment in a Medicare -approved clinical study as described in section 220.C.1 of the NCD manual. Effective July 7, 2011 Medicare will allow for coverage of MRI for beneficiaries with implanted pacemakers (PMs) when the PMs are used according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) - approved labeling for use in an MRI environment as described in section 220.2.C.1 of the NCD Manual. 40.1 - Magnetic of the Social Security Act provides for coverage of diagnostic testing. Coverage of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the head and neck, and MRA of the per ipheral vessels of the lower extremities is limited as described in Publication (Pub.) 100- 03, the Medicare National Coverage Determinations (NCD) Manual. This instruction has been revised as of July 1, 2003, based on a determination that coverage is reaso nable and necessary in additional circumstances. Under that instruction, MRA is generally covered only to the extent that it is used as a substitute for contrast angiography, except to the extent that there are documented circumstances consistent with that instruction that demonstrates the medical necessity of both tests. Prior to June 3, 2010, there was no coverage of MRA outside of the indications and circumstances described in that instruction. Effective for claims with dates of service on or after June 3, 2010, contractors have the discretion to cover or not cover all indications of MRA (and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) that are not specifically nationally covered or nationally non -covered as stated in section 220.2 of the NCD Manual. Because the status codes 74185- 26 were changed in the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Database from 'N' to 'R' on April 1, 1998, any MRA claims with those HCPCS codes with dates of service between Apr il 1, 1998, and June 30, 1999, are to be processed according to the contractor's discretionary authority to determine payment in the absence of national policy. Effective for claims with dates of service on or after February 24, 201l, Medicare will provide coverage for MRIs for beneficiaries with implanted cardiac pacemakers or implantable cardioverter defibrillators if the beneficiary is enrolled in an approved clinical study under the Coverage with Study Participation form of Coverage with Evidence Devel opment that meets specific criteria per Pub. 100 -03, the NCD Manual, chapter 1, section 220.2.C.1. when subm itting claims for MRA of the chest, abdomen, head, neck or peripheral vessels of lower extremities. The following HCPCS codes should be used to report these services: MRA Code MRA of head 70544, 70544- 26, MRA of 72198- TC MRA of abdomen (dates of service on or after July 1, 2003) - see below. 74185, 74185- 26, 74185- TC MRA of peripheral vessels of lower extremities 73725, 73725- 26, 73725- TC Hospitals subject to OPPS should report the following C codes in place of the above HCPCS codes as follows: MRA of chest 71555: C8909 - C8911 MRA of abdomen 74185: C8900 - C8902 MRA of peripheral vessels of lower extremities 73725: C8912 - C8914 For claims with dates of service on or after July 1, 2003, coverage under this benefit has been expanded for the use of MRA for diagnosing pathology in the renal or aortoiliac arteries. The following HCPCS code should be used to report this expanded coverage of MRA: MRA, pelvis, with or without contrast material(s) 72198, 72198- 26, 72198- TC Hospitals subject to OPPS report the following C codes in place of HCPCS code 72198: MRA, pelvis, with or without contrast material(s) 72198: C8918 - C8920 NOTE: Information regarding the claim form locator that corresponds to the HCPCS code and a table to crossw alk its CMS -1450 form locator to the 837 transaction is found in Chapter 25. 40.1.3 - Special Billing Instructions for for Solid Upon Implementation of Emission Tomography (PET) for Solid Tumors: May 19, 2014 - MAC Non -Shared System Edits; July 7, 2014 - CWF development/testing, development; October 6, Shared System Edits), ICD -10: Upon ICD -10) Independent RHCs and free -standing FQHCs bill under bill type 71X and 73X for the professional component utilizing revenue codes 520 and 521 as appropriate. HCPCS coding is not required. The technical component is outside the scope of the RHC/FQHC benefit. The provider of the technical service bills using the ASC X12 837 professional claim format or on Fo rm CMS -1500. The technical component for a provider based RHC/FQHC is typically furnished by the provider. The provider of that service bills under bill type 13X or 85X as appropriate using its outpatient provider number (not the RHC/FQHC provider number since these services are not covered as RHC/FQHC services). Effective 4/1/06, type of bill 14X is for non- patient laboratory specimens and is no longer applicable for radiology services. 40.1.4 - Payment for Solid Tumors: June 10: Upon Implementation of hy (PET) for Solid Tumors: May 19, 2014 - MAC Non -Shared System Edits; July 7, 2014 - CWF development/testing, development; October 6, Shared System Edits), ICD -10: Upon Implementation of ICD -10) For claims with dates of service on and after February 24, 2011, the following diagnosis code and modifier shall be reported on MRI claims for beneficiaries with implanted PMs, that are outside FDA -approved labeling for use in an MRI environment (in a Medicare - approved clini cal study): Appropriate MRI code Q0 modifier Condition code 30 (for institutional claims) If ICD -9-CM is applicable o ICD-9 code V70.7- Examination of participant in clinical trial (for institutional claims) o ICD-9 code V45.02 (automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator) or o ICD-9 V45.01 (cardiac pacemaker) If ICD -10-CM is applicable Z00.6 - Encounter for examination for normal comparison and control in clinical research program Z95.810 - Presence of aut omatic (implantable) cardiac defibrillator or Z95.0 - Presence of cardiac pacemaker For claims with dates of services on and after July 7, 2011, the following codes shall be reported on MRI claims for beneficiaries with implanted PMs that have FDA -approv ed labeling for use in an MRI environment: Appropriate MRI code KX modifier If ICD -9-CM is o ICD-9 code (cardiac pacemaker) If ICD -10-CM is applicable o ICD-10 code Z95.0 (cardiac pacemaker) Payment is as follows: Professional claims (practitioners and suppliers) - based on the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) Inpatient (11x) - Prospective payment system (PPS), based on the diagnosis - related group Hospital outpatient departments (13x) - Outpatient PPS, based on the ambulatory payment classification Rural Health Clinics/Federally Qualified Health Centers (RHCs/FQHCs) (71x/77x) - All-inclusive rate, professional component only, based on the visit furnished to the RHC/FQHC beneficiary to receive the MRI. The technical component is outside the scope of the RHC/FQHC benefit. Therefore the provider of the technical service bills their A/B MAC (B) on the ASC X12 837 professional claim format or hardcopy Form CMS -1500 and payment is made under the MPFS. Critical access hospitals (CA Hs) (85x) - o For CAHs that elected the optional method of payment for outpatient services, the payment for technical services would be the same as the CAHs that did not elect the optional method - Reasonable cost. o The A/B MAC (A) pays the professional component at 115% of the MPFS.

A positron camera (tomograph) is used to produce cross -sectional tomographic images which are obtained by detecting radioactivity from a radioactive tracer substance (radiopharmaceutical) that emits a radioactive tracer substance -18] flouro- D-glucose FDG, that is administered intravenously to the patient. The Medicare National Coverage Determinations (NCD) Manual, chapter 1, \u00a7220.6, contains additional coverage instructions to indicate the conditions under which a PET scan is performed. A. Definitions For all uses of PET, excluding Rubidium 82 for perfusion of the heart, myocardial viability and refractory seizures, the following definitions apply: Diagnosis : PET is covered only in clinical situations in which the PET results may assist in avoiding an invasive diagnostic procedure, or in which the PET results may assist in determining the optimal anatomical location to perform an invasive diagnostic procedure. In general, for most solid tumors, a tissue diagnosis is made prior to the performance of PET scanning. PET scans following a tissue diagnosis are generally performed for the purpose of staging, rather than diagnosis. Therefore, the use of PET in the diagnosis of lymphoma, esophageal and colorectal cancers, as well as in melanoma, should be rare. PET is not covered for other diagnostic uses, and is not covered for screening (testing of patients without specific signs and symptoms of disease). Staging: PET is covered in clinical situations in which (1) (a) the stage of the cancer remains in doubt after completion of a standard diagnostic workup, including conventional imaging (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or ultrasound) or, (b) the use of PET would also be cons idered reasonable and necessary if it could potentially replace one or more conventional imaging studies when it is expected that conventional study information is insufficient for the clinical management of the patient and, (2) clinical management of the patient would differ depending on the stage of the cancer identified. NOTE: Effective for services on or after April 3, 2009, the terms \"diagnosis\" and \"staging\" will be replaced with \"Initial Treatment Strategy.\" For further information on this new ter m, refer to Pub. 100- 03, NCD Manual, section 220.6.17. Restaging: PET will be covered for restaging: (1) after the completion of treatment for the purpose of detecting residual disease, (2) for detecting suspected recurrence, or metastasis, (3) to dete rmine the extent of a known recurrence, or (4) if it could potentially replace one or more conventional imaging studies when it is expected that conventional study information is to determine the extent of a known recurrence, or if study information is ins ufficient for the clinical management of the patient. Restaging applies to testing after a course of treatment is completed and is covered subject to the conditions above. Monitoring : Use of PET to monitor tumor response to treatment during the planned course of therapy (i.e., when a change in therapy is anticipated). NOTE: Effective for services on or after April 3, 2009, the terms \"restaging\" and \"monitoring\" will be replaced with \"Subsequent Treatment Strategy.\" For further information on this new term, refer to Pub. 100- 03, NCD Manual, section 220.6.17. B. Limitations For staging and restaging: PET is covered in either/or both of the following circumstances: The stage of the cancer remains in doubt after completion of a standard diagnostic workup, including conventional imaging (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or ultrasound); and/or The clinical management of the patient would differ depending on the stage of the cancer identified. PET will be covered for restaging after the completion of treatment for the purpose of detecting residual disease, for detecting suspected recurrence, or to determine the extent of a known recurrence. Use of PET would also be considered reasonable and necessary if it could potentially replace one or more conventional imaging studies when it is expected that conventional study information is insufficient for the clinical management of the patient. The PET is not covered for other diagnostic uses, and is not covered for screening (testing of patients without specific symptoms). Use of PET to monitor tumor response during the planned course of therapy (i.e., when no change in therapy is being contemplated) is not covered. 60.1 - Billing Instructions (Rev. 3227, Issued: for Solid Tumors: June 10: Upon Implementation of 2014 Emission Tomography (P ET) for Solid Tumors: May 19, 2014 - MAC Non -Shared System Edits; July 7, 2014 - CWF development/testing, development; October 6, Shared System Edits), ICD -10: Upon Implementation of ICD -10) A. Billing and Payment Instructions or Responsibilities for A/B MACs (B) Claims for PET scan services must be billed using the ASC X12 837 professional claim format or on Form -CMS 1500 with the appropriate HCPCS or CPT code and diagnosis codes to the A/B MAC (B). Effective for claims received on or after July 1, 2001, PET modifiers were discontinued and are no longer a claims processing requirement for PET scan claims. Therefore, July 1, 2001, and after the MSN messages regarding the use of PET modifiers can be discontinued. The type of service (TOS) for the new PET scan procedure codes is TOS 4, Diagnostic Radiology. Payment is based on the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. B. Billing and Payment Instructions or Responsibilities for A/B MACs (A) Claims for PET scan procedures must be billed to the A/B MAC (A) on the ASC X12 837 institutional claim format or on Form CMS -1450 with the appropriate diagnosis and HCPCS \"G\" code or CPT code to indicate the conditions under which a PET scan was done. These codes represent the technical component costs associated with these procedures when furnished to hospital and SNF outpatients. They are paid as follows: under OPPS for hospitals subject to OPPS under current payment methodologies for hospitals not subject to OPPS on a re asonable cost basis for critical access hospitals. on a reasonable cost basis for skilled nursing facilities. Institutional providers bill these codes under Revenue Code 0404 (PET Scan). Medicare contractors shall pay claims submitted for services provided by a critical access hospital (CAH) as follows: Method I technical services are paid at 101% of reasonable cost; Method II technical services are paid at 101% of reasonable cost, and professional services are paid at 115% of the Medicare Physician Fee S chedule Data Base. C. Frequency In the absence of national frequency limitations, for all indications covered on and after July 1, 2001, contractors can, if necessary, develop frequency limitations on any or all covered PET scan services. D. Post -Paym ent Review for PET Scans As with any claim, but particularly in view of the limitations on this coverage, Medicare may decide to conduct post -payment reviews to determine that the use of PET scans is consistent with coverage instructions. Pet scanning fa cilities must keep patient record information on file for each Medicare patient for whom a PET scan claim is made. These medical records can be used in any post -payment reviews and must include the information necessary to substantiate the need for the PE T scan. These records must include standard information (e.g., age, sex, and height) along with sufficient patient histories to allow determination that the steps required in the coverage instructions were followed. Such information must include, but is not limited to, the date, place and results of previous diagnostic tests (e.g., cytopathology and surgical pathology reports, CT), as well as the results and reports of the PET scan(s) performed at the center. If available, such records should include the prognosis derived from the PET scan, together with information regarding the physician or institution to which the patient proceeded following the scan for treatment or evaluation. The ordering physician is responsible for forwarding appropriate clinical data to the PET scan facility. Effective for claims received on or after July 1, 2001, CMS no longer requires paper documentation to be submitted up front with PET scan claims. Contractors shall be aware and advise providers of the specific documentation requirements for PET scans for dementia and neurodegenerative diseases. This information is outlined in section 60.12. Documentation requirements such as physician referral and medical necessity determination are to be maintained by the provider as part of the beneficiary's medical record. This information must be made available to the A/B MAC (A or B) upon request of additional documentation to determine appropriate payment of an individual claim. 60.2 - Use of Gamma Cameras and Full Ring and Partial Ring PET Scanners for PET Scans (Rev. 2- [F-18] Fluoro- D-Glucose (FDG) PET scanners and details about coverage. On July 1, 2001, HCPCS codes G0210 - G0230 were added to allow billing for all currently covered indications for FDG PET. Although the codes do not indicate the type of PET scanner, these codes were used until January 1, 2002, by providers to bill for services in a manner consistent with the coverage policy. Effective January 1, 2002, HCPCS codes G0210 - G0230 were updated with new descriptors to properly reflect the type of PET scanner used. In addition, four new HCPCS codes became effective for dates of service on and after January 1, 2002, (G0231, G0232, G0233, G0234) for covered conditions that may be billed if a gamma camera is used for the PET scan. For services performed from January 1, 2002, through January 27, 2005, providers should bill using the revised HCPCS codes G0210 - G0234. Beginning January 28, 2005 providers should bill using the appropriate CPT code. 60.2.1 - Coverage for Myocardial Viability (Rev. 1, 10- 01-03) AB-02-065 The FDG PET is covered for the determination of myocardial viability following an inconclusive single photon computed tomography test (SPECT) from July 1, 2001, through September 30, 2002. Only full ring scanners are covered as the scanning medium for this service from July 1, 2001, through December 31, 2001. However, as of January 1, 2002, full and partial ring scanners are covered for myocardial viability following an inconclusive SPECT. Beginning October 1, 2002, Medicare will cover FDG PET for the determination of myocardial viability as a primary or initial diagnostic study pr ior to revascularization, and will continue to cover FDG PET when used as a follow -up to an inconclusive SPECT. However, if a patient received a FDG PET study with inconclusive results, a follow -up SPECT is not covered. FDA full and partial ring PET scanners are covered. In the event that a patient receives a SPECT with inconclusive results, a PET scan may be performed and covered by Medicare. However, a SPECT is not covered following a FDG PET with inconclusive results. See the Medicare National Coverage Determinations Manual for specific frequency limitations for Myocardial Viability following an inconclusive SPECT. In the absence of national frequency limitations, contractors can, if necessary develop reasonable frequency limitations for myocar dial viability. Documentation that these conditions are met should be maintained by the referring physician as part of the beneficiary's medical record. 60.3 - PET Scan Qualifying Conditions and HCPCS Code Chart a summary of all covered PET scan conditions, with effective dates. NOTE: The G codes below except those a # can be used to bill for PET Scan services through January 27, 2005. Effective for dates of service on or after January 28, 2005, providers must bill for PET Scan services using the appropriate CPT codes. See section 60.3.1. The G codes with a # can continue to be used for billing after January 28, 2005 and these remain non- covered by Medicare. ( NOTE: PET Scanners must be FDA - approved.)

While there are a number of PET tracers already billable for a diverse number of medical indications, there have been, and may be in the future, additional PET indications that might require a new PET tracer. Under those circumstances, the process to request/approve/implement a new code could be time - intensive. To help alleviate inordinate spans of time between when a nationa l coverage determination is made, or when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves a particular radiopharmaceutical for an oncologic indication already approved by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and when it can be fully implemen ted via valid claims processing, CMS has created two new PET radiopharmaceutical unclassified tracer codes that can be used temporarily. This time period would be pending the creation/approval/implementation of permanent CPT codes that would later specific ally define their function by CMS in official instructions. Effective with dates of service on or after January 1, 2018, the following Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes shall be used ONLY AS NECESSARY FOR AN INTERIM PERIOD OF TIME un der the circumstances explained here. Specifically, there are two circumstances that would warrant use of the below codes: (1) After FDA approval of a PET oncologic indication, or, (2) after CMS approves coverage of a new PET indication, and ONLY if either of those situations requires the use of a dedicated PET radiopharmaceutical/tracer that is currently non - existent. Once permanent replacement codes are officially implemented by CMS, use of the temporary code for that particular indication will simultaneo usly be discontinued. NOTE: The following two codes were effective as of January 1, 2017, with the January 2017 quarterly HCPCS update. A9597 - Positron emission tomography radiopharmaceutical, diagnostic, for tumor identification, otherwise classif ied A9598 - Positron emission tomography radiopharmaceutical, diagnostic, for non- tumor identification, not otherwise classified Effective for claims with dates of service on and after January 1, 2018, when PET tracer code A9597 or A9598 are present on a c laim, that claim must also include: -an - PI or - PS modifier as appropriate, -if clinical trial, registry, or study -related outside of NCD220.6.17, PET for Solid Tumors, clinical trial modifier -Q0, -if clinical trial, registry, or study -related, all claims require the 8 -digit clinical trial number, -if Part A OP and clinical tria l, registry, or study -related outside of NCD220.6.17, PET for Solid Tumors, also include condition code 30 and ICD -10 diagnosis Z00.6.

Usage of PET for pre -surgical evaluation for patients with refractory seizures. NOTE: Effective January 1, 2002, the definitions of HCPCS Codes G0210 through G0230 have been updated to properly reflect the type of PET scanner used. 60.8 - Expanded Coverage of PET Scans for Breast Cancer Effective for Dates of Service on or After October 1, 2002 (Rev. dates of service on or after October 1, 2002, Medicare will cover FDG PET as an adjunct to other imaging modalities for staging and restaging for locoregional, recurrence or metastasis of breast cancer. Monitoring treatment of a locally advanced breast cancer tumor and metastatic br east cancer when a change in therapy is contemplated is also covered as an adjunct to other imaging modalities. The baseline PET study for monitoring should be done under the code for staging or restaging. Medicare continues to have a national non- covera ge determination for initial diagnosis of breast cancer and initial staging of axillary lymph nodes. Medicare coverage now includes PET as an adjunct to standard imaging modalities for staging patients with distant metastasis or restaging patients with lo coregional recurrence or metastasis of breast cancer; as an adjunct to standard imaging modalities for monitoring for women with locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer when a change in therapy is contemplated. CPT Codes for PET Scans Performed on o r After October 1, 2002 for Breast Cancer Contractors shall advise providers to use the appropriate CPT code from section 60.3.1 for covered breast cancer indications for services performed on or after January 28, 2005. NOTE: The NCD Manual contains a de scription of coverage. FDG Positron Emission Tomography is a minimally invasive diagnostic procedure using positron camera [tomograph] to measure the decay of radioisotopes such as FDG. The CMS determined that the benefit category for the requested indic ations fell under \u00a71861(s)(3) of the Act diagnostic service. 60.9 - Coverage of PET Scans for Myocardial Viability (Rev. 223, Issued: 07- 02-04) (Effective/Implementation: Not Applicable) FDG PET is covered for the determination of myocardial viability following an inconclusive single photon computed tomography test (SPECT) from July 1, 2001, through September 30, 2002. Only full ring scanners are covered as the scanning medium for this service from July 1, 2001, through December 31, 2001. However, as of January 1, 2002, full and partial ring scanners are covered for myocardial viability following an inconclusive SPECT. Beginning October 1, 2002, Medicare will cover FDG PET for the determination of myocardial viability as a primary or initial diagnostic study prior to revascularization, and will continue to cover FDG PET when used as a follow -up to an inconclusive SPECT. However, if a patient received a FDG PET study with inconclusive results, a fol low-up SPECT is not covered. FDA full and partial ring PET scanners are covered. In the event that a patient receives a SPECT with inconclusive results, a PET scan may be performed and covered by Medicare. However, a SPECT is not covered following a FDG PET with inconclusive results. See the Medicare National Coverage Determinations Manual, Section 220.6 for specific frequency limitations for Myocardial Viability following an inconclusive SPECT.

Billing entities must indicate on each claim the number of fractions for which payment is sought. A weekly unit of treatment management is equal to five fractions or treatment sessions. A week for the purpose of making payments under these codes is comprised of five fractions regardless of the actual time period in which the services are furnished. It is not necessary that the radiation therapist personally examine the patient during each fraction for the weekly treatment management code to be payable. Multiple fractions representing two or more treatment sessions furnished on the same day may be counted as long as there has been a distinct break in therapy sessions, and the fractions are of the character usually furnished on different days. If, at the final billing of the treatment course, there are three or four fractions beyond a multiple of five, those three or four fractions are paid for as a week. If there are one or two fractions beyond a multiple of five, payment for these services is considered as having been made through prior paymen ts. EXAMPLE: 18 fractions = 4 weekly services 62 fractions = 12 weekly services 8 fractions = 2 weekly services 6 fractions = 1 weekly service If billings have occurred which indicate that the treatment course has ended (and, therefore, the number of residual fractions has been determined), but treatments resume, adjust A/B MAC (B) payments for the additional services consistent with the above policy. EXAMPLE: 8 fractions = payment for 2 weeks 2 additional fractions are furnished by the sam e physician. No additional Medicare payment is made for the 2 additional fractions. A. SNF Treatment Management Delivery Services A SNF may not bill weekly treatment management services for its outpatients (codes 77419, 77420, 77425, 77430, and 77431). Instead, the SNF should for radiation treatment delivery (codes 77401 - 77404, 77406 - 77409, 77411 bill for therapeutic radiology port film (code 77417), which was previously a part of the weekly services.

Bill ing with modifier 25 may be necessary if National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI) edits apply. 70.3 - Radiation Treatment Delivery (CPT 77401 - 77417) (Rev. 1, 10- 01-03) A/B MACs (B) pay for these TC services on a daily basis under CPT codes 77401- 77416 for radiation treatment delivery. They do not use local codes and RVUs in paying for the TC of radiation oncology services. Multiple treatment sessions on the same day are payable as long as there has been a distinct break in therapy services, and the i ndividual sessions are of the character usually furnished on different days. A/B MACs (B) pay for CPT code 77417 (Therapeutic radiology port film(s)) on a weekly (five fractions) basis. 70.4 - Clinical Brachytherapy (CPT Codes 77750 - 77799) (Rev. 1, 10- 01-03) A/B MACs (B) must apply the bundled services policy to procedures in this family of codes other than CPT code 77776. For procedures furnished in settings in which TC payments are made, A/B MACs (B) must pay separately for the expendable source associated with these procedures under CPT code 79900 except in the case of remote after-loading high intensity brachytherapy procedures (CPT codes 77781- 77784). In the four codes cited, the expendable source is included in the RVUs for the TC of the procedures. 70.5 - Radiation Physics Services (CPT Codes 77300 - 77399) (Rev. 1, 10- 01-03) A/B MACs (B) pay for the PC and TC of CPT codes 77300- 77334 and 77399 on the same basis as they pay for radiologic services generally. For professional component billing s in all settings, A/B MACs (B) presume that the radiologist participated in the provision of the service, e.g., reviewed/validated the physicist's calculation. CPT codes 77336 and 77370 are technical services only codes that are payable by A/B MACs (B) i n settings in which only technical component is are payable. 80 - Supervision and Interpretation (S&I) Codes and Interventional Radiology (Rev. 1, 10- 01-03) 80.1 - Physician Presence (Rev. 1, 10- 01-03) Radiologic supervision and interpretation (S&I) codes are used to describe the personal supervision of the performance of the radiologic portion of a procedure by one or more physicians and the interpretation of the findings. In order to bill for the supervision aspect of the procedure, the physician m ust be present during its performance. This kind of personal supervision of the performance of the procedure is a service to an individual beneficiary and differs from the type of general supervision of the radiologic procedures performed in a hospital for which A/B MACs (A) pay the costs as physician services to the hospital. The interpretation of the procedure may be performed later by another physician. In situations in which a cardiologist, for example, bills for the supervision (the \"S\") of the S&I code, and a radiologist bills for the interpretation (the \"I\") of the code, both physicians should use a \" -52\" modifier indicating a reduced service, e.g., only one of supervision and/or interpretation. Payment for the fragmented S&I code is no more than if a single physician furnished both aspects of the procedure. 80.2 - Multiple Procedure Reduction (Rev. 1, 10- 01-03) A/B MACs (B) make no multiple procedure reductions in the S&I or primary non - radiologic codes in these types of procedures, or in any pr ocedure codes for which the descriptor and RVUs reflect a multiple service reduction. For additional procedure codes that do not reflect such a reduction, A/B MACs (B) apply the multiple procedure reductions. 90 - Services of Portable X-Ray Suppliers (Rev. 1, 10- 01-03) Services furnished by portable x -ray suppliers may have as many as four components. A/B MACs (B) must follow the following rules. 90.1 - Professional Component (Rev. 1, 10- 01-03) Pay the PC of radiologic services furnished by portable x -ray suppliers on the same basis as other physician fee schedule services. 90.2 - Technical Component (Rev. 1, 10- 01-03) Pay the TC of radiology services furnished by portable x -ray suppliers under the fee schedule on the same basis as TC services general ly. 90.3 - Transportation Component (HCPCS component represents the transportation of the equipment to the patient. Establish local RVUs for the transportation R codes based on Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) knowledge of the nature of the service furnished. The MACs shall allow only a single transportation payment for each trip the portable x -ray supplier makes to a particular location. When more than one patient is x -rayed at the same location, e.g., a nursing home, prorate the single fee schedule transportation payment among all patients (Medicare Parts A and B, and non -Medicare) receiving the portable x -ray services during that trip, regardless of their insurance status. For example, for portable x -ray services furnished at a Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF), the transportation fee should be allocated among all patients receiving portable x -ray services at the same location in a single trip irrespective of whether the patient is in a Part A stay, a Part B patient, or not a Medicare beneficiary at all. If the patient is in a Part A SNF stay, the transportation and set up costs are subject to consolidated billing and not separately billable to Medicare Part B. For a privately insured patient, it would be the responsibility of that patient's insurer. For a Medicare Part B patient, payment would be made under Part B for the share of the transportation fee attributable to that patient. R0075 must be billed in conjunction with the radiology codes and only when the x -ray equipment used was actually transported to the location where the x -ray was taken. R0075 would not apply to the x -ray equipment stored in the location where the x -ray was done (e.g., a nursing home) for use as needed. Below are the definitions for each modifier that must be reported with R0075. Only one of these five modifiers shall be reported with R0075. NOTE : If only one patient is served, R0070 should be reported with no modifier since the descriptor for this code reflects only one patient seen. UN - Two patients served UP - Three patients served UQ - Four patients served UR - Five Patients served US - Six or more patients served Payment for the above modifiers must b e consistent with the definition of the modifiers. Therefore, for R0075 reported with modifiers, - UN, - UP, - UQ, and -UR, the total payment for the service shall be divided by 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively. For modifier -US, the total payment for the servic e shall be divided by 6 regardless of the number of patients served. For example, if 8 patients were served, R0075 would be reported with modifier -US and the total payment for this service would be divided by 6. The units field for R0075 shall always be reported as \"1\" except in extremely unusual cases. The number in the units field should be completed in accordance with the provisions of 100- 04, chapter 23, section 10.2 item 24 G which defines the units field as the number of times the patient has rece ived the itemized service during the dates listed in the from/to field. The units field must never be used to report the number of patients served during a single trip. Specifically, the units field must reflect the number of services that the specific b eneficiary received, not the number of services received by other beneficiaries. As a contractor priced service, MACs must initially determine a payment rate for portable x-ray transportation services that is associated with the cost of providing the service. In order to determine an appropriate cost, the MAC should, at a minimum, cost out the vehicle, vehicle modifications, gasoline and the staff time involved in only the transportation for a portable x -ray service. A review of the pricing of this service should be done every five years. Direct costs related to the vehicle carrying the x -ray machine are fully allocable to determining the payment rate. This includes the cost of the vehicle using a recognized depreciation method, the salary and fringe benef its associated with the staff who drive the vehicle, the communication equipment used between the vehicle and the home office, the salary and fringe benefits of the staff who determine the vehicles route (this could be proportional of office staff), repair s and maintenance of the vehicle(s), insurance for the vehicle(s), operating expenses for the vehicles and any other reasonable costs associated with this service as determined by the MAC. The MAC will have discretion for allocating indirect costs (those costs that cannot be directly attributed to portable x -ray transportation) between the transportation service and the technical component of the x - ray tests. Suppliers may send MACs unsolicited cost information. The MACs may use this cost data as a compar ison to its contractor priced determination. The data supplied should reflect a year's worth (either calendar or corporate fiscal) of information. Each provider who submits such data is to be informed that the data is subject to verification and will be used to supplement other information that is used to determine Medicare's payment rate. The MACs are required to update the rate on an annual basis using independently determined measures of the cost of providing the service. A number of readily available measures (e.g., ambulance inflation factor, the Medicare economic index) that are used by the Medicare program to adjust payment rates for other types of services may be appropriate to use to update the rate for years that the MAC does not recalibrate the payment. Each MAC has the flexibility to identify the index it will use to update the rate. In addition, the MAC can consider locally identified factors that are measured independently of CMS as an adjunct to the annual adjustment. NOTE: No transportation charge is payable unless the portable x -ray equipment used was actually transported to the location where the x -ray was taken. For example, MACs do not allow a transportation charge when the x -ray equipment is stored in a nursing home for use as needed. However, a set -up payment (see \u00a790.4, below) is payable in such situations. Further, for services furnished on or after January 1, 1997, MACs may not make separate payment under HCPCS code R0076 for the transportation of EKG equipment by portable x -ray su ppliers or any other entity. 90.4 - Set-Up Component (HCPCS Code Q0092) (Rev. 1, 10- 01-03) A/B MACs (B) must pay a set -up component for each radiologic procedure (other than retakes of the same procedure) during both single patient and multiple patient trips under Level II HCPCS code Q0092. A/B MACs (B) do not make the set -up payment for EKG services furnished by the portable x -ray supplier. 90.5 - Transportation of Equipment Billed by a SNF to MAC bills for portable x -ray equipment transported to a site by van or other vehicle, the SNF should bill for the transportation costs using one of the following HCPCS codes along with the appropriate revenue code: Code Description R0070 Transportation of Portable x -ray Equipment and Personnel to Home or Nursing Home, Per Trip to Facility or Location, One Patient Seen. R0075 Transportation of Portable x -ray Equipment and Personnel to Home or Nursing Home, Per Trip to Facility or Location, More than One Patient Seen, Per Patient. These HCPCS codes are subject to the fee schedule. Effective April 1, 2006, SNFs are required to report the appropriate modifiers to identify the number of patients served when billing for R 0075. See section 90.3, of this chapter for the list of modifiers used to identify on the claim the number of patients served. MACs shall ensure that payment for R0075 is consistent with the definition of the modifiers. NOTE: When a SNF resident receives a portable x -ray service during the course of a Medicare- covered stay in the SNF, only the service's professional component (representing the physician's interpretation of the test results) is a separately billable physician service under Part B ( see \u00a720.1 of this chapter and \u00a720.1.1 of Chapter 6). By contrast, the technical component representing the procedure itself, including any associated transportation and setup costs, would be subject to consolidated billing (the SNF \"bundling\" requirement for services furnished to the SNF's Part A residents), and must be included on the SNF's Part A bill for the resident's covered stay (Bill Type 21x) rather than being billed separately under Part B (see \u00a720.2.1of this chapter). 100 - Interpretation of Dia gnostic Tests (Rev. 1, 10- 01-03) 100.1 - X-rays and EKGs Furnished to Emergency Room Patients (Rev. 1, 10- 01-03) The professional component of a diagnostic procedure furnished to a beneficiary in a hospital includes an interpretation and written report f or inclusion in the beneficiary's medical record maintained by the hospital. (See 42 CFR 415.120(a) .) A/B MACs (B) generally distinguish between an \"interpretation and report\" of an x -ray or an EKG proc edure and a \"review\" of the procedure. A professional component billing based on a review of the findings of these procedures, without a complete, written report similar to that which would be prepared by a specialist in the field, does not meet the condi tions for separate payment of the service. This is because the review is already included in the emergency department evaluation and management (E/M) payment. For example, a notation in the medical records saying \"fx -tibia\" or EKG -normal would not suffice as a separately payable interpretation and report of the procedure and should be considered a review of the findings payable through the E/M code. An \"interpretation and report\" should address the findings, relevant clinical issues, and comparative data (when available). Generally, A/B MACs (B) must pay for only one interpretation of an EKG or x -ray procedure furnished to an emergency room patient. They pay for a second interpretation (which may be identified through the use of modifier \" -77\") only unde r unusual circumstances (for which documentation is provided) such as a questionable finding for which the physician performing the initial interpretation believes another physician's expertise is needed or a changed diagnosis resulting from a second inter pretation of the results of the procedure. When A/B MACs (B) receive only one claim for an interpretation, they must presume that the one service billed was a service to the individual beneficiary rather than a quality control measure and pay the claim if it otherwise meets any applicable reasonable and necessary test. When A/B MACs (B) receive multiple claims for the same interpretation, they must generally pay for the first bill received. A/B MACs (B) must pay for the interpretation and report that dire ctly contributed to the diagnosis and treatment of the individual patient. Consideration is not given to physician specialty as the primary factor in deciding which interpretation and report to pay regardless of when the service is performed. Consideratio n is not given to designation as the hospital's \"official interpretation\" as a factor in determining which claim to pay. A/B MACs (B) pay for the interpretation billed by the cardiologist or radiologist if the interpretation of the procedure is performed at the same time as the diagnosis and treatment of the beneficiary. (This interpretation may be an oral report to the treating physician that will be written at a later time.) If the first claim received is from a radiologist, A/B MACs (B) generally pay the claim because they would not know in advance that a second claim would be forthcoming. When A/B MACs (B) receive the claim from the emergency room (ER) physician and can identify that the two claims are for the same interpretation, they must determine whether the claim from the ER physician was the interpretation that contributed to the diagnosis and treatment of the patient and, if so, they pay that claim. In such cases, A/B MACs (B) must determine that the radiologist's claim was actually quality co ntrol and institute recovery action. The two parties should reach an accommodation about who should bill for these interpretations. The following examples apply to A/B MACs (B): EXAMPLE A: A physician sees a beneficiary in the ER on January 1 and orders a single view chest x - ray. The physician reviews the x -ray, treats, and discharges the beneficiary. An A/B MAC (B) receives a claim from a radiologist for CPT code 71010- 26 indicating an interpretation with written report with a date of service of January 3. The A/B MAC (B) will pay the radiologist's claim as the first bill received. A/B MACs (B) do not have to develop the claim to determine whether the interpretation was a quality control service. EXAMPLE B: Same circumstances as Example A, ex cept that the physician who sees the beneficiary in the ER also bills for CPT code 71010- 26 with a date of service of January 1. The A/B MAC (B) will pay the first claim received. If the first claim is from the treating physician in the ER, and there is no indication the claim should not be paid, e.g., no reason to think that a complete, written interpretation has not been performed, payment of the claim is appropriate. The A/B MAC (B) will deny a claim subsequently received from a radiologist for the sa me interpretation as a quality control service to the hospital rather than a service to the individual beneficiary. EXAMPLE C: Same as Example B except that the claim from the radiologist uses modifier \" -77\" and indicates that, while the ER physician's f inding that the patient did not have pneumonia was correct, there was also a suspicious area of the lung suggesting a tumor that required further testing. In such situations, the A/B MAC (B) pays for both claims under the fee schedule. EXAMPLE D: The A/ B MAC (B) receives separate claims for CPT code 71010 -26 from a radiologist and a physician who treated that patient in the ER, both with a date of service of January 1. The first claim processed in the system is paid and the second claims will be identif ied and denied as a duplicate. If the denied \"provider\" is the radiologist and he raises an issue the A/B MAC (B) will develop the claim to determine whether the findings of the radiologist's interpretation were conveyed to the treating physician (orally or in writing) in time to contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of the patient. If the radiologist's interpretation was furnished in time to serve this purpose, that claim should be paid, and the claim from the other physician should be denied as not r easonable and necessary. 110 - Special Billing Instructions for Claims Submitted to A/B MACs (A) (Rev. 1, 10- 01-03) Transmittal 368 (CR 1323 issued May 24 -01) which revised the following SNF sections of the manual but not incorporated in the instructions, see chapter 25. 110.1 - Aborted Procedure (Rev. 1, 10- 01-03) When a procedure is not completed, the SNF should bill an unlisted code (e.g., CPT code ending in 99) and show the actual charges for the procedure. The A/B MAC (A) will request additional data from the SNF to determine applicable payment. Deductible and coinsurance apply based on fee schedule rules. 110.2 - Combined Procedures (Radiology) (Rev. 1, 10- 01-03) There are no separate codes covering certain combined procedures, e.g., a hand and forearm included in a single x -ray. The code with the higher fe e schedule amount should be used. 110.2 - Combined Procedures (Radiology) (Rev. 1, 10- 01-03) There are no separate codes covering certain combined procedures, e.g., a hand and forearm included in a single x -ray. The code with the higher fee schedule amount should be used. 110.3 - Payment for Radiopharmaceuticals (Rev. 1, 10- 01-03) Radiopharmaceuticals are not subject to the fee schedule, but are paid based on reasonable cost when given in a SNF. SNFs 0333, 034X, or 0636. NOTE: The correct code to report A4641. It replaced HCPCS code 78990. HCPCS code 78990 should not be reported because this code is not valid for Medicare purposes. EXCEPTION: HCPCS codes 77781, 77782, 77783, and 77784 include payment for the radiopharmaceutical in the technical component. When these procedures are performed, SNFs do not report radiopharmaceutical A4641, A4642, A9500, A9503, and A9505 when they are billed for supplies used in conjunction with procedure codes 77781, 77782, 77783, and 77784. 120 - Radiology or Other Unlisted Service or Procedure Billing Instru ctions for A/B MAC (A) Claims (Rev. 1, 10- 01-03) Some radiology and other diagnostic services may not have a corresponding HCPCS code. This is because these are typically services that are rarely provided, unusual, or new. The provider should assign the appropriate \"unlisted procedure\" code to any such service. The following list contains the \"unlisted procedure\" codes along with the suggested revenue code for billing. These services are paid on a fee schedule if one exists or cost if a fee has not been established for SNFs. However, before billing any of these codes the provider needs to furnish a complete description of the radiology procedure to the A/B MAC (A) for review and analysis. The description should include a narrative definition of the proc edure and a description of the nature, extent and need for the procedure and the time, effort, and equipment necessary. The A/B MAC (A) will determine if the provider has correctly identified the procedure as \"unlisted.\" If the procedure is not identifie d correctly, the A/B MAC (A) will inform the provider of the correct HCPCS code to assign to the procedure. If there is no fee schedule amount established, these services are paid based on cost to SNFs.

This coverage is effective for claims with dates of service furnished on or after July 1, l998. Effective for dates of service on and after January 1, 2007, the CY 2007 Physician Fee Schedule final rule expanded the number of beneficiaries qualifying for BMM by reducing the dosage requirement for glucocorticoid (steroid) therapy from 7.5 mg of prednisone per day to 5.0 mg. It also changed the definition of BMM by removing coverage for a single- photon absorptiometry as it is not considered reasonable and necessary under s ection 1862 (a)(1)(A) of the Act. Finally, it required that in the case of monitoring and confirmatory baseline BMMs, they be performed with a dual -energy x - ray absorptiometry (axial) test. Conditions of Coverage for BMMs are located in Pub.100- 02, Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, chapter 15 140.1 - Payment Methodology and HCPCS for BMM procedures based on the Medicare physician fee schedule. Claims from physicians, other practitioners, or suppliers where assignment was not taken are subject to the Medicare limiting charge. The A/B MACs (A) pay for BMM procedures under the current payment methodologies for radiology services according to the type of provider. Do not pay BMM procedure claims for dual photon absorptiometry, CPT procedure code 78351. Deductible and coinsurance do not apply. Any of the following CPT procedure codes may be used when billing for BMMs through December 31, 2006. All of these codes are bone densitometry measurements except code 76977, which is bone sonometry measurements. CPT procedure codes are applicable to billing A/B 78350 G0130 Effective for dates of services on and after January 1, 2007, the following changes apply to BMM: New 2007 CPT bone mass procedure codes have been assigned for BMM. The following codes will replace current codes, however the CPT descriptors for the services remain the replaces 76078 Effective for dates of service on and after January 1, 2015, contractors shall pay for bone mass procedure code 77085 ( Dual -energy X -ray absorptiometry (DXA), bone density study, 1 or more sites, axial skeleton, (e.g., hips, pelvis, spine), including vertebral fracture assessment.) Certain BMM tests are covered when used to screen patients for osteoporosis subject to the frequency standards described in chapter 15, section 80.5.5 of the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual. Contractors will pay claims for screening tests when coded as follows: Contains CPT or G0130, and Contains a valid diagnosis code indicating the reason for the test is postmenopausal female, vertebral fracture, hyperparathyroidism, or steroid therapy. Contractors are to maintain local lists of valid codes for the benefit's screening categories. Contractors will deny claims for screening tests whe n coded as follows: Contains 77081, 77083, 76977 or G0130, but Does not contain a valid diagnosis code from the local lists of valid diagnosis codes maintained by the contractor for the benefit's screening categories indicating the reason for the test is postmenopausal female, vertebral fracture, hyperparathyroidism, or steroid therapy. Dual -energy x -ray absorptiometry (axial) tests are covered when used to monitor FDA - approved osteoporosis drug therapy subject to the 2- year frequency standards described in chapter 15, section 80.5.5 of the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual . Contractors will pay claims for monitoring tests when coded as follows: Contains CPT procedure code or M94.9 as the ICD -10-CM diagnosis code. Contractors will deny claims for monitoring tests when coded as follows: Contains CPT procedure code code, but Does not contain a valid ICD -9-CM diagnosis code from the local lists of valid ICD -9-CM diagnosis codes maintained by the contractor fo r the benefit's screening categories indicating the reason for the test is postmenopausal female, vertebral fracture, hyperparathyroidism, or steroid therapy. Does not contain a valid ICD -10-CM diagnosis code from the local lists of valid ICD -10-CM diagnosis codes maintained by the contractor for the benefit's screening categories indicating the reason for the test is postmenopausal female, vertebral fracture, hyperparathyroidism, or steroid therapy. Single photon absorptiometry tests are not covere d. Contractors will deny CPT procedure code 78350. The A/B MACs (A) are billed using the ASC X12 837 institutional claim format or hardcopy Form CMS -based and freestanding), 83X, and 85X. Effective April 1, 2006, type of bill 14X is for non- patient laboratory specimens and is no longer applicable for bone mass measurements. Information regarding the claim form locators that correspond to the HCPCS/CPT code or Type of Bill are found in chapter 25. Providers must report HCPCS codes for bone mass measurements under revenue code 320 with number of units and line item dates of service per revenue code line for each bone mass measurement rep orted. A/B MACs (B) are billed for bone mass measurement procedures using the ASC X12 837 professional claim format or hardcopy Form CMS -1500. 140.2 - Denial Messages for Noncovered contractor shall use the following remittance advice messages and associated codes when rejecting/denying claims under the conditions described in 140.1. This CARC/RARC combination is compliant with CAQH CORE Business Scenario Three. Group Code: PR (if claim is received with a GA modifier) otherwise CO CARC: 50 RARC: Alert M38 (if ABN was issued) or M27 (if ABN was not issued) MSN: 16.10 and 36.1 (if ABN was issued) or 36.2 (if ABN was not issued) NOTE: A/B MACs (A) are not to include MSN 16.10. 140.4 - Advance situations listed in Section 140.1, physicians, practitioners and hospitals are liable for payment unless they issue an appropriate ABN. Contractors will utilize the appropriate messages, see sections 140.2 and 140.3. 150 - Place of Service (POS) Instructions for the Professional Component (PC or Interpretation) and the Technical C omponent (TC) of Diagnostic services, including radiology services, provided by physicians/practitioners contain both a technical component (TC) and a professional component (PC). Often, the PC and TC of diagnostic services are furnished in different settings. As a general policy, the POS code assigned by the physician/practitioner for the PC of a diagnostic service shall be the setting in which the beneficiary received the TC service. A. Interpretation Provided Telephonically by Wireless Remote Teleradiology services (radiology services that do not require a face -to-face encounter with the patient furnished through the use of a telecommunications system) are discussed in Pub. 100- 02, Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, chapter 15, section 30. The interpretation of an x -ray, electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram and tissue samples are listed as examples of these services. In cases where the face -to-face requirement is obviated such as those when a physician/practitioner provides the PC/interpretation of a diagnostic test, from a distant site, the POS code assigned by the physician /practitioner shall be the setting in which the beneficiary received t he TC service. The POS code for a teleradiology interpretation is generally the place where the beneficiary received the TC, or face- to-face encounter. The POS code representing the setting where the beneficiary received the TC is entered in the ASC X12 837 professional claim format or in item 24B on the paper claim Form CMS 1500. In cases where it is unclear which POS code applies, the Medicare contractor can provide guidance. For example: A beneficiary receives an MRI on an outpatient hospital campus near his/her home. The outpatient hospital submits a claim that would correspond to the TC portion of the MRI. The physician furnishes the PC portion of the beneficiary's MRI from his/her office location - POS code 22 (On Campus -Outpatient Hospital) sha ll be used on the physician's claim to indicate that the beneficiary received the face- to-face portion of the MRI, the TC, on the campus of an outpatient hospital. B. Interpretation Provided Outside of the United States Generally, Medicare will not pa y for health care or supplies that are performed outside the United States (U.S.). The term \"outside the U.S.\" means anywhere other than the 50 states of the U.S., the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and t he Northern Mariana Islands. See Pub. 100- 02, chapter 16, section 60, for exceptions to the \"outside the U.S.\" exclusions. C. Interpretation Provided Under Arrangement - To A Hospital Separate TC and PC If a diagnostic test which has a separate TC and PC is provided under arrangement to a hospital, the physician who reads the test can bill and be paid for the professional component. Both the technical and professional components of the test are also subject to the physician self -referral prohibition. The appropriate POS code for the interpretation (or PC) is the setting where the beneficiary received the TC service. If the interpretation is performed in the physician's office and the patient received the TC service in the provider -based outpatient hospital setting, the physician assigns POS code 22, for On Campus -Outpatient Hospital, or POS 19, for Off Campus -Outpatient Hospital, on the claim for the interpretation or PC. Global Service When a physician performs a diagnostic test under arrangement t o a hospital and the test and the interpretation are not separately billable, the interpretation cannot be billed by the physician. In this scenario, the hospital is the only entity that can bill for the diagnostic test which encompasses the interpretatio n. There is no POS code for the interpretation since a physician claim is not generated. D. Global Billing Billing globally for services that are split into PC and TC components is only possible when the TC and the physician who provides the PC of the diagnostic service are furnished by the same physician or supplier entity and the PC and TC components are furnished within the same Medicare physician fee schedule payment locality. Merely applying the same POS code to the PC as that of the TC (as descri bed in \"A\" above) does not permit global billing for any diagnostic procedure. E. Determination of Payment Locality Under the Medicare physician fee schedule (MPFS), payment amounts are based on the relative resources required to provide services and va ry among payment localities as resource costs vary geographically as measured by the geographic practice cost indices (GPCIs). The payment locality is determined based on the location where a specific service code was furnished. For purposes of determini ng the appropriate payment locality, CMS requires that the address, including the ZIP code for each service code be included on the claim form in order to determine the appropriate payment locality. The location in which the service code was furnished is entered on the ASC X12 837 professional claim format or in Item 32 on the paper claim Form CMS 1500. Global Service Code If the global diagnostic service code is billed, the biller (either the entity that took the test, physician who interpreted the test , or separate billing agent) must report the address and ZIP code of where the test was furnished on the bill for the global diagnostic service code. In other words, when the global diagnostic service code is billed, for example, chest x -ray as described by HCPCS code 71010 (no modifier TC and no modifier - 26), the locality is determined by the ZIP code applicable to the testing facility, i.e. where the TC of the chest x -ray was furnished. The testing facility (or its billing agent) enters the address and ZIP code of the setting/location where the test took place. This practice location is entered using the ASC X12 837 professional claim format or in Item 32 on the paper claim Form CMS 1500. As explained in D above, in order to bill for a global diagnost ic service code, the same physician or supplier entity must furnish both the TC and the PC of the diagnostic service and the TC and PC must be furnished within the same MPFS payment locality. Separate Billing of Professional Interpretation If the same ph ysician or other supplier entity does not furnish both the TC and PC of the diagnostic service, or if the same physician or other supplier entity furnishes both the TC and PC but the professional interpretation was furnished in a different payment locality from where the TC was furnished, the professional interpretation of a diagnostic test must be separately billed with modifier - 26 by the interpreting physician. When the physician's interpretation of a diagnostic test is billed separately from the techni cal component, as identified by modifier - 26, the interpreting physician (or his or her billing agent) must report the address and ZIP code of the interpreting physician's location on the claim form. If the professional interpretation was furnished at an unusual and infrequent location for example, a hotel, the locality of the professional interpretation is determined based on the Medicare enrolled location where the interpreting physician most commonly practices. The address and ZIP code of this practice location is entered using the ASC X12 837 professional claim format or in Item 32 on the paper claim Form CMS 1500.
