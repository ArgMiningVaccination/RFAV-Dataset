The increasing reports and concerns relating the two can be traced to various factors, including the report published in 1998 on the correlation but was retracted afterward by the Lancet Journal that had published it (DeStefano & Shimabukuro, 2019). In particular, the 1998 study published by Lancet turned tens of thousands of parents from around the world against the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. In the paper, the authors, including Wakefield and 12 others, reported that 8 out of the 12 children studied showed a correlation between the MMR vaccine and autism (Motta & Stecula, 2021). However, the study was recalled by the Lancet, following crucial discoveries, including that the children studied were purposely selected to show the correlation and that the research was funded by lawyers working for parents involved in lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers. Unfortunately, despite that the study was recalled, the evidence it reported continued to fuel the concerns surrounding the correlation between the MMS vaccine and developing autism. "}
