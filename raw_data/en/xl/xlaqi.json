But can this herbal remedy actually help [anxiety](/health/travel-anxiety)? TBH, ashwagandha is no cure-all for mental health conditions, but its stress-busting effects might offer indirect benefits to ease [anxiety](/health/how-to-cope-with-anxiety). Here's everything you need to know before using ashwagandha for [anxiety](/discover/facts-anxiety). Plus additional health benefits you might get from this Ayurvedic favorite. Ashwagandha \u2014 aka, [Withania somnifera](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/953.html) \u2014 is an evergreen herb native to parts of Asia and Africa. An extract derived from the herb's roots has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for thousands of years. Some ashwagandha products are marketed under the herb's other names, including: Ayurveda fans tout ashwagandha as a remedy for everything from Alzheimer's to [insomnia](/health/chronic-insomnia). But [the National Library of Medicine](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/953.html) only lists possible effectiveness against one thing: [stress](/happiness/23-scientifically-backed-ways-reduce-stress-right-now). That's because ashwagandha is an [adaptogen](/eat/drink-recipes-that-use-adaptogens#1), meaning that it might help [adapt](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6979308/) (read: improve) the way your body handles [stress](/happiness/manage-workplace-office-stress). Still, stress is kind of a big deal when it comes to your wellness. Too much stress can unleash a horde of other health probs (including anxiety). A recent [review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34254920/) found that though ashwagandha helps relieve stress, there hasn't been enough research to recommend it as a treatment for [anxiety](/health/how-to-help-someone-with-anxiety). That said, you still *can* still take ashwagandha for anxiety symptoms, but its effectiveness likely depends on why you're experiencing [anxiety](/health/how-to-help-someone-with-anxiety). [Anxiety](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/anxiety-disorders/index.shtml) is more than just stress and comes in many forms, including: - generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) [social anxiety](/live/reality-tv-show-social-anxiety)disorder - separation anxiety disorder [panic disorder](/health/can-anxiety-kill-you) - phobia-related disorders (agoraphobia, claustrophobia, etc.) So, if you have anxiety related to PTSD, [genetics](/health/is-depression-genetic), or [depression](/health/depression-and-anxiety), it's unlikely ashwagandha will your anxiety-induced [nausea](/live/gut-health-and-anxiety-connection), [headache](/health/anxiety-headache), or regulating gamma-aminobutyric acid ( [GABA](/health/how-to-make-yourself-tired#gaba)), the neurotransmitter that tells your brain to chill the eff out Animal research from 2000 (remember \"Bennifer\"?!) also found that ashwagandha [has a calming effect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0944711300800306?via%3Dihub) similar to lorazepam, a common [anti-anxiety med](/grow/sleep-better-xanax#What-does-Xanax-do?). Of course, mice aren't people, so we obviously need more studies. tl;dr Results are promising, but more research is needed to recommend ashwagandha for [anxiety](/health/how-to-cope-with-anxiety). As we said, science shows that ashwagandha can be used to [dial down stress](/health/natural-remedies-for-anxiety). A [small 2019 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC6979308) found a 600-milligram (mg) daily dose of ashwagandha led to a \"statistically significant reduction\" in anxiety and stress. Ashwagandha was also linked to lower cortisol (the \"stress\" hormone) and better [sleep](/health/anxiety-with-insomnia) \u2014 both important factors for mental health. Another [2019 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC6750292/) also found that a daily dose of 240 mg led to lower stress levels. So again, there's more evidence supporting taking ashwagandha for stress than for an anxiety disorder. Most folks reach for ashwagandha in search of a mental health boost. But here are a few other potential benefits of the herb. - Improved sleep. One small, [12-week study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7096075/)found that older adults who took ashwagandha every day reported better sleep quality. And some [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC6827862/)suggests it could soothe insomnia in folks with [anxiety](/health/anxiety-with-insomnia). - Better athletic performance. In one [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC6266766/), ingesting 500 mg of ashwagandha extract boosted participants' upper- and lower-body [strength](/fitness/how-to-start-lifting-weights). Evidence is limited \u2014 but there's some promise! - Arthritis management. [Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC6541602/)including animals and [humans](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5052364/)suggests that ashwagandha could dial down inflammation and stiffness from [arthritis](/health/psoriatic-arthritis-life-hacks). - Prevent memory loss. While it's no magic bullet, ashwagandha showed promising results in a [2017 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28471731/)of older adults with mild [memory](/health/how-to-improve-memory)or cognitive function loss. The ashwagandha group scored better on both general and short-term memory tests than the placebo group. - Blood sugar regulation. A [2020 review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31975514/)revealed that ashwagandha helped folks with [diabetes](/diabetes/foods-to-avoid-with-diabetes)dial down Potential testosterone ashwagandha might help boost [male fertility](https://greatist.com/health/how-to-increase-sperm-count). But the study is super small and dated, so we need more research to confirm. Like [giloy](/health/benefits-of-giloy#verdict) or [moringa](-15-benefits-of-moringa), ashwagandha doesn't have a one-size-fits-all, expert-backed dose. Studies have found that you can take it at [any time of day](/health/do-i-take-ashwagandha-in-the-morning-or-night#when-to-take), and with or without [a meal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6750292/). Ashwagandha comes in several forms, including: - pills - powders - liquid extracts - tea Some [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC6979308/) suggests that 250 to 600 mg per day can help reduce stress. Other studies use higher doses, and some supplement companies suggest up to 1,500 mg. Regardless of the dose, it can take weeks or months to see results. Your best bet is to consult a doctor or registered dietician before dropping money on an ashwagandha supplement. A medical pro can help you find the best type and dose for you. Ashwagandha is generally considered safe in small doses \u2014 and for [up to 3 months](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/953.html). But there hasn't been enough research to determine the effects of long-term use. Going overboard on ashwagandha can mess with your GI system, triggering unpleasant [side effects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK548536/) like: [nausea](/health/anxiety-and-nausea) - vomiting - diarrhea Oh, and because research-backed info on ashwagandha is still pretty limited, some folks should avoid the herb altogether. Those groups include: - pregnant and breastfeeding peeps - folks with [autoimmune diseases](/health/is-psoriasis-an-autoimmune-disease)(multiple sclerosis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.) - anyone with a thyroid condition Like other medicinal herbs, ashwagandha can interact badly with some meds. Always, always check with your doctor before taking it alongside other medicines. Safety PSA The [National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/ayurvedic-medicine-in-depth) says toxic metals have been found in some Ayurvedic products. Big yikes. Be super vigilant about picking high quality products and well-reviewed brands before putting something in your body. Ashwagandha is an herbal supplement known to soothe stress, which is a common anxiety trigger. That means it *might* help your anxiety. Ashwagandha is not a quick fix for stress, anxiety, or [insomnia](/program/sleep). It works like a [supplement](/health/benefits-of-dietary-supplements), not a [prescription medication](/connect/prescription-painkiller-opioid-abuse-and-addiction). The herb can take several weeks to make a difference \u2014 and it might not work for everyone. And like any supplement, make sure you purchase a trusted ashwagandha product. Check with your doctor before using ashwagandha for anxiety. This Ayurvedic remedy can interfere with some prescription medications. "}
