institute appropriate treatment for prevention and management Can cause impairment of fertility, oligospermia, and menstrual dysfunction; unknown if infertility is reversible; discuss reproduction risks with female and male patients of reproductive potential Methotrexate can exit slowly from third space accumulations resulting in prolonged terminal plasma half-life and toxicity; evacuate significant third-space accumulations prior injection Concomitant radiation therapy increases risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis associated with methotrexate Serious adverse reactions, including death, have occurred due to medication errors; most commonly, these errors occurred in patients who were taking methotrexate daily when a weekly dosing regimen was prescribed; ensure that patients receive the recommended dosage Risk associated with benzyl alcohol preservative - Formulations with benzyl alcohol can cause severe CNS toxicity or metabolic acidosis, if used in neonates or low-birth weight infants, IT, or in high-dose regimens - Use only preservative-free injection for treatment of neonates or low-birth weight infants and for intrathecal use - Do not use benzyl alcohol-containing formulations for high-dose regimens unless immediate treatment is required, and preservative-free formulations are not available - Benzyl alcohol can cross the placenta;

withhold or discontinue in patients who develop serious infections Renal Toxicity - Can cause renal toxicity including irreversible acute renal failure - Monitor renal function and withhold or discontinue as needed for severe renal toxicity - For high-dose regimens, follow recommendations to decrease renal injury and mitigate renal toxicity (eg, hydration, alkalinize urine, leucovorin rescue) - Patients with impaired renal function have increased risk for toxicity - Consider administration of glucarpidase in patients with toxic plasma methotrexate concentrations (>1 micromole per liter) and delayed clearance due to impaired renal function Hepatotoxicity - Can cause severe and potentially irreversible hepatotoxicity including fibrosis, cirrhosis, and fatal liver - Avoid use in patients with chronic liver disease, unless benefits clearly outweigh risks; risk increased with heavy alcohol consumption - In patients with psoriasis, fibrosis or cirrhosis may occur in the absence of symptoms or abnormal liver function tests; risk of hepatotoxicity appears to increase with total cumulative dose 1.5 g - Assess liver function before initiating and monitor liver function tests during treatment;

avoid products containing folic acid or folinic acid unless clinically indicated - Non-neoplastic diseases: Folate deficiency may increase methotrexate adverse reactions; administer folic acid or folinic acid to patients with rheumatoid arthritis, pJIA, and psoriasis Drug interaction overview - Drugs that increase methotrexate systemic exposure or adverse effects - If unable to avoid coadministration, monitor closely for methotrexate adverse effects - Penicillin or sulfonamide antibiotics - Highly protein-bound drugs (eg, oral anticoagulants, phenytoin, sulfonamides, pyrimethamine, sulfonamides) - Aspirin and other NSAIDs; unexpectedly severe and fatal GI toxicity can occur with concomitant administration of methotrexate (primarily at high dose) - Mercaptopurine - Hepatotoxic products - Weak acids (eg, salicylates) - Nephrotoxic products - Nitrous oxide - Avoid nitrous oxide anesthesia; consider alternative therapies in patients who have received prior nitrous oxide anesthesia - Coadministration pathways, which may increase risk of severe methotrexate adverse reactions - Folic acid H5Avoid coadministration of folic/folinic acid supplements unless specifically prescribed (eg, for use with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, or pJIA) - Coadministration with folic acid or its derivatives decreases clinical effectiveness of methotrexate in patients with neoplastic diseases - Methotrexate competes with reduced folates for active transport across cell membranes - Theophylline - Monitor theophylline levels and adjust theophylline dosage accordingly - Methotrexate may increase theophylline plasma concentrations - Immunizations - Update immunization per guidelines before initiating methotrexate if possible - May be ineffective during therapy and live virus vaccines are not recommended due to risk of infection - Disseminated infections following administration of live vaccines reported Pregnancy & Lactation Pregnancy Based on published reports and mechanism of action, can cause embryo-fetal toxicity and fetal death when administered to pregnant women Advise pregnant women with neoplastic diseases of potential risk to fetus; preservative benzyl alcohol can cross placenta; when possible, use preservative-free formulation when methotrexate Injection needed during pregnancy to treat a neoplastic disease Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential before initiating Contraindicated in pregnant women with nonmalignant disease Contraception - Females - Can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women; - Use effective contraception during and for 6 months after final dose - Males - Can cause chromosomal damage to sperm cells - Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and for at least 3 months after final dose Infertility - Females: Can cause impairment of fertility and menstrual dysfunction during and after cessation of therapy; unknown if infertility may be reversed in all affected females - Males: Can cause oligospermia or infertility during and after cessation of therapy; unknown if infertility may be reversed in all affected males Lactation Limited published literature report the presence of methotrexate in human milk in low amounts; no information is available on the effects on breastfed infants or milk production Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including myelosuppression, from methotrexate in breastfed infants, advise women not to breastfeed during therapy and for 1 week after final dose Pregnancy Categories A: Generally acceptable. Controlled studies in pregnant women show no evidence of fetal risk.B: May be acceptable. Either animal studies show no risk but human studies not available or animal studies showed minor risks and human studies done and showed no risk. C: Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks. Animal studies show risk and human studies not available or neither animal nor human studies done. D: Use in LIFE-THREATENING emergencies when no safer drug available. Positive evidence of human fetal risk. X: Do not use in pregnancy. Risks involved outweigh potential benefits. Safer alternatives exist. NA: Information not available.
