Does this pain worsen after lying down? If yes, you might be suffering from GERD. And, you might be looking for effective and safe remedies to get rid of the discomfort and pain resulting due to GERD, aren't you? Fortunately, you have homeopathy to treat your condition. And, if you are wondering what GERD is, what its causes are, and how homeopathy can help, think no further. Read on to learn all about it. Many people experience gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) occasionally. GERD occurs as a consequence of acid reflux into the esophagus from the stomach, gastric motor dysfunction, or visceral afferent hypersensitivity. A wide variety of factors cause GERD, such as increased gastric contents (from a large meal, gastric stasis, or acid hypersecretion), physical factors (such as lying down or bending over), increased pressure on the stomach (tight clothes, obesity, ascites, or pregnancy), a loss (usually intermittent) of lower esophageal sphincter tone, diseases such as scleroderma, smoking, anticholinergics, and calcium antagonists. Hiatal hernia also promotes acid flow into the esophagus. However, if you happen to experience persistent acid reflux more than twice a week, you may be diagnosed with GERD. In other words, GERD can be described as a long-term or chronic, regular occurrence of GER. Fortunately, it can be managed with weight reduction; elevation of the head of the bed; and avoidance of large meals, smoking, caffeine, alcohol, chocolate, fatty food, citrus juices, and NSAIDs. Antacids are widely used to treat it. Clinical trials suggest that proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole) are more effective than histamine receptor blockers (ranitidine) in patients with or without esophageal erosions.
