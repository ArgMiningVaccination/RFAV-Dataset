A supportive, intimate group setting with tranquil surroundings will facilitate meaningful personal enrichment. Participants will explore how biochemistry can stall or propel, and learn about daily self-care techniques for balancing health and a sense of purposeful well-being. Through guided exercises, group discussions and visualization tools, participants will retreat into a space of gentle reflection. The facilitated retreat will reveal how listening to their own body can enable people to feel luminously alive, how changing their self-image can change their shape. Attendees will learn how to make nutrition choices best suited for personal growth, handle desires that warrant their full attention, and treat fear, anger, shame or sadness as cyclical patterns and find out how to navigate the cycles for best outcomes. Attendees will discover how their cycles decelerate, yet vitalize and empower them. Participants will embrace purposeful connections with like-minded seekers on the journey to reclaim vibrancy and heighten a sense of freedom and joy. The cost is $95 for the retreat and nutritious lunch. The downtown Rehoboth sanctuary location will be provided at the time of registration.
