Purpose : The purpose of the Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Prog ram is to ensure to identification and treatment of infants born to hepatitis B -positive women to prevent perinatally acquired infection. II. Maternal Perinatal Hepatitis B Screening : Pennsylvania requires all pregnant women to be screened for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) on the first prenatal visit, or within 15 days, but no later than the time of delivery, as stated in Pennsylvania Code \u00a727.99 (a ). Screening is based on recommendations published by Advisory Committee on Immunization Pr actices (ACIP) and CDC in 2018 in Prevention of Hepatitis B Virus Infection in the United States: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Note that some providers may screen pregnant women using lab tests other than HBsAg, such as nucleic acid or HBeAg. For this reason, any test indicative current Hepatitis B infection, whether acute or chronic, should be investigated . Serological markers of current Hepatitis B infection includ e, but not limited to : positive HBsAg or positi ve HBeAg or positive Hepatitis B nucleic acid test (HBV DNA) Providers are required to report cases of infection under Pennsylvania Code \u00a727.21a and laboratory results consistent with infection must be reported under to Pennsylvania Code \u00a727.22. If a pu blic health investigator determines that either: 1) a provider has not performed Hepatitis B screening of a pregnant woman, regardless of testing during prior pregnancies; or 2) that a laboratory has not reported a positive laboratory test, reach out to provider, and investigate what happened. If the provider did not perform a Hepatitis B screening of a pregnant woman, send the provider a copy of \"Guidelines for Medical Care Providers\" and notify the Perinatal Hepatitis B Coordinator. If the laboratory did not report a positive laboratory test, notify the Perinatal Hepatitis B Coordinator. If a laboratory has failed to report a positive lab test for hepatitis B, the Perinatal Hepatitis B Coordinator wi ll notify Bureau of Epidemiology to address with the cli nical laboratory. Updated 4/23 III. Procedure for Follow -up of Maternal Hepatitis B Screening : A. If the District/State Health Centers or County Municipal Health Departments are notified of any test indicative of current Hepatitis B infection , acute or chronic, (i.e., positive HBsAg , HBeAg , nucleic acid test for HBV DNA , total hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), or IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (IgM anti-HBc) result in a woman of child -bearing age (12 -50 years) via the Pennsylvania National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (PA -NEDSS), laboratory, physician's office, or any other means, these steps are to be followed: B. PA-NEDSS instructions for new positive hepatitis B labs: 1. Follow Epi Manual for investigation guidance and linkage of labs to new or existing investigation . a. Be sure to \"open\" the investigation and leave open until pregnancy status is determined . If pregnant , leave \"open\" until delivery. b. Notify assigned staff if other t han self because if new labs are linked to case older than 4 months it will not show in their PA-NEDSS inbox or any searches . 2. Document any contact via phone/letter with parent/guardian or provider in PA - NEDSS in notes section. This information may be reque sted by CDC. C. Contact the physician who ordered the laboratory test to determine if Hepatitis B testing was ordered due to current or recent pregnancy .

Put pregnancy and due date in Core Data section in PA -NEDSS. 4. Advise provider of the recommendation to order an HBV DNA test. This test will guide the use of maternal antiviral therapy during pregnancy for the prevention of perinatal HBV transmission. AASLD suggests maternal antiviral therapy when the maternal HPB DNA is >200,000 IU/mL. 5. Verify the woman has been notified of her laboratory findings . 6. Request that a copy of all cu rrent Hepatitis B test results be sent to delivery hospital. 7. ***Sent Physician OB letter. 8. If physician that ordered the laboratory test does not know if patient is pregnant, contact patient. Attempt contact with patient three times via combination of phone and letter (urgent health letter) . D. Contact the patient to: 1. Provide her with information and education about hepatitis B, including the importance of immunoprophylaxis for her infant, ways to prevent transmission, perinatal concerns (e.g., infants born to HBsAg positive mothers may be Updated 4/23 breastfed), substance abuse tr eatment (if appropriate), and the need for the mother to receive evaluation and medical management for chronic hepatitis B. Provide both verbal and written information , utilizing a translator if necessary. ***Send \"Congratulations Pregnant\" letter and Peri natal Hepatitis B education, See CDC website for most current Hepatitis B education .

After the infant has completed the hepatitis B vaccination series, c ontact parent/ guardian, and remind them of the need for post -vaccination testing when the infant has reached the age of 9 months and 1 month after last dose . Explain the importance of follow up testing and wha t the results will show. If immunity has not been obtained, a single dose of Hep B vaccine should be given as soon as possible. Serology testing should be obtained 1 -2 months after the completion of the repeated dose. ***Send parent/guardian \"Completion o f Hep B\" letter for ***Also, contact provider and send \"Pediatrician Serology Letter\" to inform them that HBsAg AND anti -HBs (quantitative) will need done 9 months with at least 1 month after last Hepatitis B vaccine. Updated 4/23 G. Verify anti -HBs and HBsAg test results of infants with the pediatric provider and discuss follow -up of the infant based on these results. To meet ACIP recommendations, HBsAg negative infants with ant i-HBs levels of >10mIU/mL are protected and need no further medical management. o If provider did \"qualitative \" ant-HBs, contact the lab to determine if the results are >10mIU/mL . If >10mIU/mL the infant is protected. If <10mIU/mL or lab doesn't know then repeat quantitative anti -HBs test. HBsAg negative infants with anti -HBs levels of <10mIU/mL or non -reactive results should be revaccinated with a single dose of Hep B vaccine and receive post-vaccination serologic testin g 1-2 months later. Infants who's anti-HBs remains <10mIU/mL following single dose revaccination should receive two additional doses of Hep B vaccine to complete the second series, followed by post-vaccination serologic testing 1 -2 months after the final dose. Based on clinical circumstances or family preference, HBsAg -negative infants with anti -HBs<10mIU/ml may instead be revaccinated with a second, complete 3 - dose series, followed by post -vaccination serologic testing performed 1 -2 months after the fin al dose of vaccine. Infants who are HBsAg positive should be referred for medical evaluation and management of chronic hepatitis B. H. Record vaccination dates and results of serologic/post -vaccination testing for the infant on the Data on Newborn section of \"Perinatal Hepatitis B Case and Contact Report for DOH ,\" Perinatal Hepatitis B Program , and in PA -NEDSS and provide updates to the Perinatal Hepatitis B Coor dinator.
