Circles are small, confidential, and free of charge. You may seek to find meaning in the challenge of cancer, bear witness to your own or others' suffering or loss, and explore your own individual choices and capacity for healing. Healing circles are a safe and supportive space to walk with each other through our experiences. Each circle is a blend of sharing and silence, compassion and curiosity. Agreements ensure acceptance and confidentiality. We honor our own unique paths to healing and respect the choices of others. Our sister program, Healing Circles Global, welcomes you to join online circles from anywhere in the globe. You can also join an online training to learn how to host a circle in your own community. Some programs such as those in Langley, Washington, and Houston, Texas, hold in-person circles.
