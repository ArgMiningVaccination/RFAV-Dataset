Product Details Product Description It is no surprise that Acupuncture has become a fad in Europe. The Italian law, states that acupuncture therapy must be performed only by medical doctors. This has also been the case in France, Belgium, Denmark, and the Scandinavian countries. The total number of Italian MDs trained in acupuncture is likely to be about 10,000. As in France, this represents one of the highest densities of Chinese medical practitioners outside East Asia. Holland, which does not restrict acupuncture to medical doctors, has the highest density, with an estimated one practitioner for every 3,200 people. The population of Italy is about 56 million, or less than one-fifth that of the U.S., which has a more liberal legal status for acupuncture yet has only about 15,000 licensed acupuncturists and about 5,000 medical acupuncturists.

There are more than 2000 doctors using acupuncture. Company Details About the Company It is rightly said that, \"All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them.\" Perhaps it was this courage that nurtured the small practice of Dr. Vinay Varma,the founder of Anand Pain Relief and Rehabilitation Institute, into the reality that has made it an epitome of success today. The Hospital began its journey in 1979 as a small one room clinic that provided only Out Patient services. Following the completion of Dr. Varma's training in acupuncture, the developing clinic turned into an unusual healing centre that combined the principles of modern medicine with acupuncture to provide the best of both to its patients. Acupuncture, the oldest form of Chinese medicine is still looked upon apprehensively by many and it is often practiced by improperly qualified or trained practitioners. A merger of modern medicine with acupuncture medicine, by a well qualified & trained professional forms an exceptionally useful treatment strategy that can provide outstanding results in numerous ailments. It is this amalgamation that has probably turned that one room clinic into the holistic healing centre that the institute is today.
