R. 10/10/2018 Article Accepted on 31/10/2018 INTRODUCTION Agad tantra is the science which deals with the study of poisons, their action, detection and treatment. Agad tantra i s one of the bra nch of Ashtanga Ayurveda , which deals with natural poison as well as artificial toxins, their harmful effects and treatment also. Natural toxins which are Sthavara, Jangama viha, and artificial Agad tantra . Gara visha is prepared artificially by mixture of various substances to produce various disease . Kritrim visha means the Dravya (substance) which causes Vishaad (sorrow or depression) is qualities of poisonous drugs.[2] Poison is a substance which when a dministerd, inhaled or ingested capable of acting deleteriously on humanbody and produce s ill health. Poison may be synthetic, mineral, vegetable or of animal origin ,[3] gara visha is one of them . Gara visha may be given by Anna (food), Pana (drinks), Anulepana (application), Ustadana (massage), Parieka (bath), Anjana (eye lid ap plication) etc several method mentioned in samhita .[4] Out of these methods , the first one is Anna (food). Anna is very easy to get adulterated with non-poisonous or poisonous sub stances and produce hazard effect. Ayurveda has mention ed that the various human waste like raj, artav , (menstrualblood), the powder of insects and virudha aushad bhash ma used to produce gara visha along with food. Since ancient time Anna is used as media . Todays scenario is also like that, but this etiological factor of gara visha are not being used now a days because of its weird odour and taste and chances to expose. Todays era, there are so many food additives such as colouring agents, preservatives, sweeteners, soft drinks, and additives milk adulterant has been used by continuously in the form of junk foods/ fast food since many years. T here are so many toxic substance has been taken by human being which act equally as gara visha along with foods and drinks as a additives or adulterants which causes chronic poisoning and this gara vish also induces food poisoning, if consume persistently for prolong period.[5] Most of the carbonated and soft drinks require additives and preservatives having chemical substances which are harmful to human body. Drinking water also having many types of microorganisms , pesticides , the Gara visha is considered to be as one of the form of Kritrim visha. It is formed by c ombination of two or more than two poisonous or non -poisonous drugs, which ultimately affects the whole body by vitiating all the doshas , dhatus and srotas in the body. Agad tantra which is a branch of Ashtang Ayurveda has given more emphasis over Garavish a (Artificial poisons) as well as natural poisons i.e. Sthavar and Jangam visha . Detailed explanation of the Garavish , its definition, sign and symptoms, mode of administration and treatment has been described in our samhitas. Food poisoning is the resulting from ingestion of contaminated bacterial and non - bacterial products, can be co -relate with Gara visha . It is caused due to bacterial infection of food or drink. The non-bacterial product includes poisons lik e plants, animal derivatives , chemically inter reaction of food from packing materials etc. Gara vish is nothing but samyogaj vish when two compounds react with each other and it may form toxin which lead to food poisoning. foods and drinks as a additives or adulterants w hich causes chronic poisoning and this gara vish also induces food poisoning, if consume persistently since prolong period. This article review base on the concept of Gara visha which has significant role in causing toxic symptoms and also it can called fo od poisoning in contemporary science due to its various uses in present society and Ayurveda offers effective management also. KEYWORDS: Garavish , Samyogajvish , Ayurveda , Food poisoning, etc. Kirti et al.

To st udy the concept of Gara visha according to Ayurveda. 2. To study the relation between Gara vish and food poisoning. Derivation/Nirukti The Gara word is derived from the root word \"gru\" with suffix \"ach\" which means to digluted or could be degluted which ge nerally indicates the liquid form. From one aspect this word ( Gara ) meaning also come as poison.[7,8] Definition been mentioned poison) which exerts t oxic effect after interval of sometime and as such does not kill the patient instantly. It produces many disease . Gara visha is Kalantara -avipaki ; it means Gara visha is not to digested early it takes long time to digest and its not fatal.[2] Shushrut Sa mhita : The pulverized bodies of insect poisoning, as they do, the characteristic features of Dushi visha (enfeebled poison ) which is laying inherent in human body; is turned into a Gara or chemical poison if administrated internally with anymedicine or ext ernally with any plaster/ lepa.[9] Vagbhatta Samhita : Combination of parts of the body and excreta of different animals, incompatible drugs, ashes and poisonous substance which having mild potency ; is known as Garvisha ,[1] Vagbhatta is classified the poiso n into two types. One is the Akritrim visha (natural poison ) which is subdivided into two i.e.sthavaram and jangam visha . The other one is the kritrim visha which is called as Garvisha (unnatural or chemically which is prepared by combination of two poisonous substances called dushi visha . Another one which is prepared by combination of two non-poisonous substances called as Garvisha .[10,11 visha is one of two types one which is prepared by non -poisonous substance called as Gara visha and another one which is prepared by poisonous substance called as kritrim visha.[13,7,14] Gara Visha Adhisthana[4] Describe in sushrut samhita as the method is given to poison may be considered as Gara visha Adhi sthana, these are Parisheka Anjana (eye lid application), Vastra (clothes), Sayya (beds), Paduka (foot -wears).

Nagdantyadi A MODERN REVIEW According to modern Gara visha can be co -relate with food poisoning , gara visha can be one of cause which produces food poisoning . Food Poisoning[16] Food poisoning is administration of toxic substance in body with food because of improper handling, cooking and packing of food articles. Food poisoning, also called food borne illness, which is caused by eating contaminated food. Food poisoning caused by infectious organisms including bacteria, viruses and parasites or their toxins are the most common causes and is restricted to poisoning by articles of food due to contaminated toxic principle, metallic contamination and foo d allergy . This poisoning is caused by salmonella group of organisms, enterotoxins formed by s taphylococcus. Another type of food poisoning is botulinism caused by chlostridium botulinum ; multiplies in food and produces exoto xin before it is consumed. This toxin are produc ed in stomach along with food it can be considered as Gara visha . Causes of Food of Pharmaceutical and Medical Research www.wjpmr.com 312 Nonmicrobial Contamination Vegetable origin Animal sources Chemicals -Lathyrus sativus -Mushrooms -Argemone Mexicana -Poisonous uring agents -Colo uring agents -Preservatives Commonly Symptoms - Commonly symptoms are seen in food poisoning as mention below, symptoms may be differ cause it depends on the causative factors.[18] Common cases of food poisoning will typically include at least three of the following symptoms: Commonly symptoms Life-threatening food poisoning symptoms abdominal cramps difficulty in seeing or speaking Diarrhoea diarrhoea persisting for more than three days Nausea, Vomiting symptoms of severe dehydration, which may include dry mouth, passing little to no urine, and difficulty keeping fluids down Loss of appetite bloody urine Mild fever a fever higher than 101.5\u00b0F Headache DISCUSSION The concept of Gara visha explained in Agada tantra and it has wide application . Todays life style is change d, prolonged uses of adulterated food or incompatible foo d and people who are following bad habits are effected by Gara visha . It is mainly classified two types, 1. Nirvi ha dravya samayogaja viha- which is combination of two non-poisonous substance, 2. Savi ha dravya samayogaja viha- it is combination of two or more than two poisonous substance. Hence Gara visha is mixture of various artificial substances which produces toxic effect on human body . Gara visha is prepared artificially by the mixture of various substances to produce various diseases. Garavisha is classified under kritrima or samyogaja (delayed absorption of digestive substance ) and produces chronic toxicity. The toxicogenesis of food, milk and drink additives is near about similar to that of gara visha which reduce s jatharangi (digest ion) and absorption in gastrointestinal tract . This study has illustrated the co - relation of Gara viha and food poisoning. Gara visha is a cause to produce food poisoning because gara visha is a samyogaj visha. When two or more things meet each other and after this reaction, toxin formation which can lead to food poisoning, and its various health hazard effects on body. CONCLUSION Ayurveda has explained Garaviha as artificial poison. Wonderful concept of Gara visha explained by Ayurveda . The possibilit y of exposure of toxins due to using various chemical agent, food preservatives and many more things in our changing lifestyle is nothing but gara visha. Gara visha is nothing but composition of two non-toxic elements that lead to form toxic element which deteriorate well -being of individual. Unknowingly in our routine life activities we are exposed to such type of toxic materials. Due to the changing life style people are exposed to one or other kind of poisons in their day to day life. This exposure is in the form of food, drinks, drugs etc. If this type of toxication in food it lead to food poisoing and it can cause serious health hazards such as allergy, asthma, carcinogenic changes, skin disorders, neurological changes, etc. This article aims t o underst anding concept of Gara visha and relation between food poisoning and gara visha and its health hazards and its Ayurvedic management by detoxification.
