I went for a week to teach 32 doctors, TCM diagnosis & Pattern differentiations! The kindness, generosity and eagerness to learn from each participant blew me away. Each participate gave 200% during the 5 day seminar. They processed the information with patience and an open mind & heart. I connected with each participant and loved everyone's energy! I feel blessed to have been invited! I'm humbled by this experience and I think I have left a little piece of my heart in India. In India, I researched Ayurveda. Alternatively known as Ayurvedic medicine (AM). I was fascinated by the similarities and differences with Chinese medicine! I wanted to share with you my humble understanding of AM comparing to TCM. Please, be kind if I make some mistakes, as I am just going by my basic readings. I hope to give it justice. Enjoy and let me know what you think! Clara TCM Geek The Basics of Ayurvedic Medicine In Sanskrit, Ayurveda means \"life knowledge\". Ayurveda is a comprehensive medical and spiritual system that merges the mind, body and spirit. In a nutshell, Ayurveda promotes life long wellness. It focuses on prevention and treatment of diseases. During most readings I came across, it is said that Ayurveda developed in India 5000 years ago, and all the world medicine derive from it (including TCM! Food for thought). Like Chinese medicine, it is based on observation, trial and errors. Evidently, AM recognizes the individuality of each patient. Determined by defining their unique constitution, according to aspects of their physical, physiological, psychological and emotional selves. Thus, Ayurveda modalities include lifestyle recommendations: dry skin brushing, self massage, oil pulling, diet, herbal medicine, aromatherapy, meditation, mantras (chanting), exercise (Yoga), and acupressure. As you can see, Ayurveda practitioners, just like TCM practitioners, are educators first. Their purpose is to help each patient achieve balance and reach optimum health. However, TCM focuses on the balance of mind and body. AM encompasses mind, body and spirit. Connecting to higher self, and achieving higher consciousness. The 5 Elements Ayurveda's 5 Elements are: Fire, Water, Earth, Air and Ether (Space). Each relates to one of the 5 senses. - Fire: eye/sight - up the 3 Doshas (Vata, Pitta and Kapha), which are primary life energies that govern all emotional and physical processes. Vata is composed of Air and Ether. In short, these control the nervous system and all movement in the body. A Vata type is creative, has a lean body, and can get anxiety or digestive issues. Pitta is comprised of fire and water. Undoubtedly, Pitta operates the stomach and all transformation in the body. A Pitta type is ambitious, has an athletic body, easily gets angry and heartburn. Kapha is comprised of earth and water. Importantly, Kapha regulates the structure and all stability in the body. A Kapha type is compassionate, has a curvy bigger body, and can get depression and gain weight easily. Like in TCM, balance between the 5 elements (and the 3 Doshas in AM) is considered optimal health. The elements and Doshas break are the ecosystem. This ecosystem breaks if there is sickness. They all depend on each other for balance. Air and Ether are divergent from Wood and Metal. TCM has 5 body types personalities, tissues, senses, colours, tastes, seasons. AM combines 2 of the 5 Elements. This is done by using the Doshas. It describes biological functions, mind, body, food, environment and more. The Substances Similarities Firstly, Prana (AM) and TCM Qi has the same concept of life force! Secondly, Prakriti (AM) and TCM Essence (and Pre natal Qi) share the same idea of individual constitution, roots, genes. These cannot be changed! Thirdly, Vikruti (AM) and TCM Post Natal Qi are affected by lifestyles, diet, trauma, environment and pathogens. Differences Firstly, Srotas (AM) are channels that transport substances (nutrients, blood, body fluids and wastes) into, through and out of the body. Secondly, Agni fire (AM) is in charge of digestion, absorption, metabolism and creation of body tissues. Thirdly, Dhatus (AM) are the bodily tissue groups where disease manifests. There are seven within the body: plasma, bones, muscles, fat, nervous system, and reproductive system.\\ Flavours Particularly, AM has 6 flavours: Sweet, Salty, Pungent, Bitter, Sour, Astringent. On the other hand, TCM shares 5 similar flavours. However, in Chinese medicine, astringent is not a flavour. Rather, it is function of the Sour food/herbs. Moreover, Ayurveda nature of foods and herbs are warm, cold, oily, dry, light & heavy. On the other hand, Traditional Chinese Medicine nature of foods are warm, hot, cool, cold, neutral, damp, dry, light, heavy. Energy Centres Similar to TCM, Ayurveda has 107 Marma points on which Prana (Qi) is concentrated. In contrast, TCM has over 365 points. AM uses acupressure much more and TCM uses acupuncture and Tui Na. Acupuncture points and meridians in TCM are to maintain balance between the body and mind. Chakras (AM) are energy centres that regulate the flow of consciousness into and from the body, and contain the spiritual information of the soul. Chakra health determine physical, emotional and spiritual development. The 7 main Chakras Root Chakra to the Solar Plexus Chakra Root Chakra is located at the base of the spine. Spiritual growth begins here. It connects to KD, BL, Spine, Blood, Rectum, immune systems, childhood, and heredity. It governs survival instinct, safety, stability, and trust.

Exercises & Meditation Firstly, Yoga is a much more popular form of exercise in the west than Tai Chi. They form of self healing using movements of the body. Secondly, Yoga, and Tai Chi use animal poses and connect with nature, balance the mind and body, and use energy (Qi/Prana) as their connection to the space around them. Thirdly, Ayurveda Meditation & TCM Qi Gong. Together, they focus on connecting the mind and body, and increasing self awareness, consciousness and mindfulness. In my opinion, TCM is much stronger in its diagnosis tools (including Tongue and Pulse), and Ayurveda is much stronger in its spirituality. If we were knowledgeable in both, we could be true TCM & "}
