Beaumont has provided about 300,000 [vaccinations](/covid-vaccine) to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Anyone age 16 and up is invited to get vaccinated at the [Beaumont Service Center](https://www.beaumont.org/locations/beaumont-service-center), 26901 Beaumont Blvd. in Southfield, during the following walk-in clinics: Wednesday, April 28: 10:30 a.m. - 2 p.m. Thursday, April 29: 4 - 7 p.m. Friday, April 30: 10:30 a.m. - 2 p.m. Clinic staff will only administer first doses of the vaccine during the walk-in clinic hours. No appointment is necessary. A myBeaumontChart account is not required. Teenagers under the age of 18 must be accompanied by a parent or guardian. \"We were so pleased with the community's response to our first walk-in clinic, so we decided to offer three additional dates. These clinics are helping us further our goal of vaccinating as many people as possible. We also remain committed to providing a safe and efficient experience for people who get vaccinated,\" Beaumont Health Chief Operating Officer Carolyn Wilson said. Patients who would like to schedule a vaccine at another date and time can [register online](/covid-vaccine) or call 800-592-4784. A myBeaumontChart account is not required if registering via phone. Beaumont is also collaborating with a coalition of 60 of America's top hospitals and health care institutions on a nationwide campaign to encourage adults to get vaccinated for COVID-19. Led by Cleveland Clinic and Mayo Clinic, the campaign \" [Get the Vaccine to Save Lives](https://ourshot2savelives.org/),\" is designed to reassure the public that vaccines are safe, effective and necessary to achieve herd immunity and return to normal activities. The health system continues to operate vaccine clinics at Beaumont hospitals in Dearborn and Troy, as well as the Beaumont Service Center in Southfield. However, the walk-in program is currently only available at the Southfield clinic. The clinics have the capability of administering up to 50,000 doses per week, dependent upon the amount of vaccine received and staff available given the stress of this third surge. All of Beaumont's hospitals are safe and remain open to all patients needing health care including emergency visits, testing and surgery. Patients should continue to go to any Beaumont Emergency Center for medical issues that need urgent attention. "}
