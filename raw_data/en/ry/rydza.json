people with stable HIV infection were included in clinical trials, though data remain limited -Ho wever, currently authorized COVID- 19 vaccines are not live vaccines and therefore can besafely administered to immunocompromised people -i.e. immunocompromised people can receive COVID- 19 vaccination -Da ta currently insufficient to inform optimal timing of COVID- 19 vaccination; however, based ongeneral best practices for vaccination of immunocompromised people , ideally vaccination should be completed at least 2 weeks before initiation of immunosuppressive therapies -W hen not possible to administer complete COVID- 19 vaccine series in advance, people on immunosuppressive therapy can still receive COVID- 19 vaccination -De cisions to delay immunosuppressive therapy to complete COVID- 19 vaccination should consider the person's risks related to their underlying condition An tibody testing not currently recommended following COVID-19 vaccination; clinical utility of post -vaccination testing has not been established www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid -19/info-by with contraindication to one of mRNA COVID- 19 vaccines should not receive doses of either of the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer - BioNTech or Moderna) H owever, people with contraindication to mRNA COVID- 19 vaccines may be able to receive Janssen COVID- 19 vaccine, and vice versa, provided certain measures are taken (see \"precautions\") K nown polysorbate allergy no longer contraindication to mRNA vaccination, but is a precaution to mRNA vaccines H owever, known polysorbate allergy is contraindication to J&J COVID -19 vaccine and thus, precaution to mRNA COVID- 19 vaccination P eople with contraindication to J&J COVID- 19 vaccine (e.g. known polysorbate allergy) may be considered for mRNA vaccines 19Updated Approach to Allergy Considerations www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid -19/info-by -product/clinical- considerations.htmlUpdated US Triage for Allergy Issues www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid -19/info-by -product/clinical- considerations.htmlState COVID Vaccine Updates C ontinue pending auth's P er fedl mandate, added school teachers & staff, child care W almart, Walgreens, & Hannaford pharmacies now offering ~100 vaccination sites across state BUT these slots are limited to school teachers & staff & child care providers only HR SA distributing doses directly to some FQHCs (currently 2 FQHCs)21Phase 1a Health Care Personnel Residents & staff of long -term care facilities Public safety State COVID response critical personnelAll Other Older adults 60 yo1 Then in & older July and beyond: 29yo and under, including children pending authorization of vaccine for younger ages NEW!
