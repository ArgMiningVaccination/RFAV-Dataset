As a mixed woman of color who grew up on free lunches at local community centers and food stamp collecting, Ursula has been witness to lower-quality health care and discrimination in her doctors' offices, and thus has been subjected to unnecessary pain and suffering in her childhood. She has seen and experiences how Black women and patients of color are not being provided with knowledge that increases their opportunities for health equity, and she believes that narrative must change. The unscientific belief that Black people can tolerate more pain is a modern-day misperception, and its historical roots work together to continually erode trust and damage the critical communication links that support strong community health. This lack of trust between black and brown communities and health professionals is deeply rooted and profound, however, with her continued education from NUNM, Ursula plans to work in the medical field as a naturopathic doctor and to play a role in creating a more diverse, equitable and inclusive healthcare system. Kendall Grannis is in her fourth and final year of the Master of Acupuncture with a Chinese Herbal Medicine Specialization degree program. She earned her bachelor's degree in Spanish from Grinnell College, with a concentration in environmental studies. Exposed to martial arts, acupuncture and alternative medicine at a young age, she was excited to learn about NUNM, where all these modalities are taught in one program. She hopes to help people find true health and healing, and seeks to make acupuncture and Chinese medicine accessible to those of diverse backgrounds and income levels. When she isn't studying, Kendall loves hiking, walking, biking Portland's \"neighborhood greenways\" and cross-country skiing.

In 2021, Jocelyn earned a bachelor's degree in biomedical sciences from Marist College, where she also played collegiate volleyball for four years. She was born and raised in Beaverton, Oregon, by her mother, who is originally from the Philippines, and her father, who passed away in 2010. The passing of her father is a driving motivator for Jocelyn's passion in pursuing neuroscience and mental health advocacy. In her free time, Jocelyn enjoys playing and coaching volleyball, singing, playing the piano, and spending time at the beach. [Percy and Adrienne Frazier Scholarship](https://nunm.edu/scholarships/frazier/) JaiKir Barlow (bio forthcoming) Avery Beckius began her journey into nutrition during her undergraduate days. She was earning her bachelor's degree in exercise science when she realized that, while she loves the body and human performance, her true interests were with food. With this in mind, she decided to pursue a master's degree in nutrition and try to combine her two degrees. While there is still a lot up in the air (and lots of room for change throughout life), she wants to work in a university setting with athletes. While she may start there, she would love to expand her passion into the classroom and provide educational courses for university students and athletes alike. She believes that education is one of the most important aspects of health and wants to provide tools to those who are interested. Lacy Campbell is in her third year as a naturopathic medical student at NUNM. Lacy earned her bachelor's degree in organismal biology at Portland State University and worked with animals as a wildlife rehabilitator and clinic manager for over 22 years.

During that time, she also became interested in herbal medicine and began wildcrafting medicines.

She is passionate about being able to obtain knowledge about ways she can help her community through nutrition and healthcare. Growing up she was an activist in helping her fellow migrant workers.

She then decided to pursue a degree in nutrition. She hopes to obtain an ND degree in the near future to provide better care for her community. Ana Alice Silva is a first-generation Brazilian-American woman of color who is passionate about improving access to naturopathic cardiology among marginalized communities. Her experience in education and health advocacy began in the poverty-stricken community of City of God, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. There she developed a non-profit organization that provided early education for over 50 children, job training for dozens of women, and coordinated their access to primary healthcare. She fell in love with their resilience, wisdom and reliance on nature. Through this work, she became convinced of the importance of natural medicine for the accessibility and equity of healthcare. She is dedicated to the application of naturopathic science and principles to primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. With the support of the Percy and Adrienne Frazier scholarship and the NUNM community, she aims to improve longevity and quality of life among those with the least access to cardiovascular health. For Jessica Watson the draw to ancient Chinese medicine was based solely on its theoretical framework, which was relieving to discover towards the end of her undergraduate studies, deeply in resonance with her perception of the natural living world. Through her studies at NUNM, she has developed an interest in practicing herbalism through the sophisticated lens of ancient Chinese medicine. She plans to move near the Appalachian Mountains, the most biodiverse region of the United States, to immerse herself in the plant kingdom when she graduates. Jessica recognizes that a supportive healthcare landscape involves less dogmatic authorities and more providers who return patients to the forefront of their own healing process, directing them to their inner resources as they engage with it. In practice, she hopes to adopt an approach of returning the seemingly complex entanglements of our being to the inherently simple, free-flowing essence that is present in all life.
