Decide On the Right Form And Concentration For You Supplements in the form of capsules, powders, gummies, and tinctures are the easiest ways to consume ashwagandha. You may also take ashwagandha alone or with other synergistic herbs to support a specific health concern.

Once you've settled on the best form and formula for your needs, you're ready to determine optimal dosing. How To Dose Ashwagandha Dosing ashwagandha isn't an exact science. However, traditional use and modern research have provided some helpful guidelines. - Traditional Ayurvedic practitioners used ashwagandha in various forms and dosages based on the individual. Although there are recipes for [traditional Ayurvedic](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/the-essential-guide-to-ashwagandha-everything-you-need-to-know)herbal formulas containing ashwagandha, there is not a traditional standardized dosage for every person. - Most modern studies on ashwagandha used ashwagandha root extract at a dose of 250-600 mg daily. - The most common dosage used in studies was to give 300 mg twice daily (once in the morning and once in the evening) for a total of 600 mg. That said, the optimal dosage depends on various factors, such as the type of ashwagandha, how it's prepared (extract or whole root), whether it's pure or combined with other synergistic herbs, the person's size, state of health, digestive health, and health goals. However, that 250 - 600 mg daily range used in human studies offers a good starting point for most people. How To Take Ashwagandha The following is general information on ashwagandha dosing for specific support based on scientific studies. This information is not meant to replace the advice of your healthcare practitioner. If you have a particular health concern or are unsure about taking ashwagandha, always check with your healthcare practitioner for individual recommendations. - [Ashwagandha Dosage For Sleep](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/amazing-benefits-of-ashwagandha): 500 to 600 mg daily for ten weeks. This dose is typically taken as 250 to 300 mg twice daily. However, some experts recommend taking a larger dose before bed to help support the sleep cycle.REF#121 - [Ashwagandha Dosage For Adrenal health](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/meet-your-adrenals): 125 mg to 600 mg taken for at least 1-3 months have been shown to support normal cortisol levels (your body's master stress hormone).REF#122 REF#123 - [Ashwagandha Dosage For Sleep](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/amazing-benefits-of-ashwagandha): 120 mg to 600 mg daily, typically broken up between two doses. The best time of day to take ashwagandha for sleep hasn't been officially determined. However, if you have trouble falling asleep, you may benefit from taking a higher dose before bed. We'll discuss this more in the next section. REF#124 REF#125 REF#126 When To Take Ashwagandha As previously mentioned, in most studies, participants took two doses of ashwagandha daily, one in the morning and one in the afternoon or evening. However, that's not a hard-and-fast rule. For example, since research shows ashwagandha supports your adrenals in the normal production of cortisol (your body's master stress hormone) via the HPA axis taking it at night may be helpful to promote relaxation before bed.* REF#127 REF#128 REF#129 REF#130 However, if you lack energy in the mornings, taking ashwagandha upon waking may support your cortisol awakening response.* Your cortisol awakening response refers to the naturally higher levels of cortisol a healthy body should produce after a sustained period of rest. REF#131 This relates to the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which controls cortisol secretion with the sleep cycle/circadian rhythm and your stress response. REF#132 Remember that herbs, like ashwagandha, typically take time to work. The studies mentioned above are proof of this, as most lasted at least eight weeks. So don't give up if you don't see results in a day, a week, or even a month. Remain consistent with your daily dosage and talk to your practitioner about adjusting your approach if you aren't getting results within a couple of months.
