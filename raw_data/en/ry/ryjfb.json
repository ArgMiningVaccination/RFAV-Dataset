Ryan Tipping presenting LD 798, An Act To Protect Maine Children and Students from Preventable Diseases by Repealing Certain Exemptions from the Laws Governing Immunization Requirements Before t/ie Joint Standing Committee on Education a11d Cultural Affairs Good afternoon, Senator Millett, Representative Kornfield, and esteemed members of the Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs. My name is Ryan Tipping and it is my honor to represent most of the wonderful residents of Orono in the House. I am here to present LD 798, An Act To Protect Maine Children and Students from Preventable Diseases by Repealing Certain Exemptions from the Laws Governing Immunization Requirements. Senators, Representatives, please imagine that we are in a boat. The boat is leaking and is almost filled with water. It would make sense that we would all want to grab our bail buckets and try to keep afloat. And if, after much hard work, the boat is nearly dry, you could forgive some of us for relaxing a bit Some might even set aside the bailing buckets. But, sure enough, the leak will eventually overtake us if we become complacent. There is a reason the Centers for Disease Control use this metaphor of a leaky boat to represent a community taldng on the struggle of fighting infectious disease. It is a reminder that when our foe is a dangerous, intangible entity capable of putting our children's lives at risk, we are in this together. The actions we take as individuals affect the lives of our neighbors. In this metaphor, the ultimate solution is to plug the hole. In reality, this can only happen when we work together as a society to raise our immunity threshold _to the point where a disease cannot take root, and then keep it at that level until there is no source of that disease left to defend against. We have been successful m the past at achieving this goal, most notably with smallpox. But what we are seeing now is a rising tide of diseases that previous generations worked tirelessly to defeat. In my work on this bill, I have come to realize that there is a generational District 123: Orono (part) i I I EXHIBIT 2Case 1:21-cv-00242-JDL Document 48-2 Filed 09/15/21 Page 1 of 3 PageID #: 286 R.A. 10divide. When I talk to my peers about whooping cough or measles, some stare blankly, some shrug, and I have even had others try to convince me that these diseases are harmless. When I discuss this same topic wth people who have earned the wisdom that only comes with experience, I get a very different reaction. You will very likely hear some of these stories today, like what it felt like to hold an infant unsuccessfully gasping for air while in the throes of pertussis or what it was like to care for a family member paralyzed by polio. I think it is safe to say that a growi ng number of people, despite the considerable education campaigns and widespread access to public health, may not see the value in continuing to bail out our little boat. I think it is also safe to say that the risk is much more dangerous than getting our feet wet. We have all seen the news reports from across the country over the last few months. From Clark County, Washington, to New York City, measles is returning in staggering numbers. Whether it's because of misinformation, fear, or indecision, people have withdrawn from the public effort to keep our communities floating high enough within acceptable immunity percentages to avoid catastrophe. Members of the committee, the bill before you is an attempt to reverse this trend and ensure that now and into the future our schools and daycares will be places where children can learn and grow without fear of serious, harmful, preventable diseases. The bill removes non-medical exemptions to the decades-old immunization requirements for the institutions where our children spend most of their waking hours. It also tightens the exemptions for health care workers, many of whom are here today, and daycare employees. As a matter of practicality, it grandfathers students who are both currently claiming a non-medical exemption and enrolled in an individualized education plan. The bill further calls on both the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Education to amend their rules to ensure full implementation of these changes. These changes are necessary if we want to prevent headlines from Washington and New York from appearing instead on the front page of the Bangor Daily News. Headlines like \"[Governor] Inslee Declares State of or \"Cost of to climb higher\" or \"Measles Outbreak: 1 student got 21 others sick.\" And, to be clear, Maine has felt the sting of infectious disease in recent years as well. In 2018, we saw 13 outbreaks of pertussis in schools. In 2017, we had our first case of measles since 1997. And there are more exam ples. These headlines and stories are particularly troubling to people who cannot be inununized, whether due to illness or age. You will hear from some of these people today, including parents of young children who, like my daughter, attend daycares where the only protection between toddlers who have established inununities and infants who do not is a half door or a few feet between tables in the lunchroom. You will also hear from parents of immunocompromised or District 123: Orono (pait) EXHIBIT 2Case 3 PageID #: 287 R.A. 11immunosuppressed children who will never achieve the immunities needed to protect them and rely on their neighbors' vaccinations in order to even be in school at all. You will also hear from people who cannot receive the immunizations for medical reasons. I want to take a moment here to say that in the case of medical exemptions, a physician should be able to sit down with their patient and their parents and look at the best medical science available to them in order to make a determination on whether or not a medical exemption is warranted. I do not believe any group of legislators should be limiting a doctor who is practicing within the scope of their field and using their best medical judgment from doing what is right for their patient. If this committee needs to clarify this point in rules, I would consider it a friendly amendment. Before I wrap.up, I want to make sure to emphasize one point. We are all in this together. We must confront this issue as a state, not as individuals. I believe everyone who is going to testify today is doing so in an attempt to protect their loved ones or generally make their state a better place. We are in this together and we must approach this subject with humility and civility. In working on this bill, I have had countless conversations with people all over the spectrum of opinion on this topic. I have tried to react to concerns where I hear them, respond to criticism constructively, and incorporate new ideas into the bill. I want t.o sincerely thank everyone who has attempted to reach out and engage on the issue. After today, the work of crafting good policy will be in the committee's hands. I will try to be a resource as you wrangle with the different aspects of this problem, but, as you can probably guess, there are people currently in the room far more qualified than me to answer questions. I encourage you to focus today on the people who have traveled great distances and save questions for your colleagues until the work session. We will all have the opportunity to engage with each other and debate the fine points, but today is a day for public testimony. That said, if you have any pressing questions, I would be happy to try to answer them. Thank you for your consideration of LD 798 and for allowing me the time to present it.

Immunizations are safe. Immunizations are effective. Immunizations protect public health and prevent the reintroduction of infectious diseases into our schools and communities. Immunizations protect our most vulnerable citizens my children are part of the vulnerable population that depends on herd immunity. Vulnerable populations should be able to depend on safe schools and safe communities. Maine has the seventh-highest non-medical exemption rate in the nation. To put this in perspective, as of March 12, 2019, Clark County, Washington has conrmed 71 cases of measles. Of those infected, in 62 cases the patient was unvaccinated, and in seven cases vaccination status could not be conrmed. In 2018, the average philosophical and religious exemption rate for kindergarten aged students in Clark County, WA was 6.7 percent. The average philosophical and religious exemption rate for kindergarten-aged students in Hancock County, ME was 8.7 percent. Please nd the attached data from both the Maine CDC and Washington State Department of Health. Included are the immunization exemption rates for individual schools in Hancock County. There are schools experiencing non- medical exemption rates as high as 33.3 percent. This is unacceptable. District 134 Cranbeny Isles, Deer Isle, Frenchboro, Isle au Haut, North Haven, Southwest Harbor, Stonington, Swans Island, Tremont and Vinalhaven, plus the unorganized territory of Marshall Island Townshipy I Q I 1 21 ti it 1 1 1; EXH IB IT 3Case 1:21-cv-00242-JDL #: 289 R.A. 13The World Health Organization made headlines this year for declaring vaccine hesitancy a threat to global health. With exemption rates this high in Maine, its not a question of will an outbreak occur, its a question of when. And it is already happening. Maine has the highest rate of pertussis in the nation, a vaccine-preventable infectious disease that can be fatal to infants and newborns. This morning I received an email from a constituent urging me to support this legislation. Her son contracted pertussis and has been ghting the illness for ve weeks. She is a Family Nurse Practitioner with both personal and professional experience witnessing the impacts of vaccine hesitancy. In 2000, the federal government declared measles eliminated in the United States - in 2018 there were 349 cases. As of March 7, 2019, there are already 228 conrmed cases, one of which is in New Hampshire. Maine is vulnerable, not only to measles, but to the reintroduction of a number of preventable infectious diseases. Rubella and polio have also been declared eliminated in the US but for how long? Oregon just confirmed its rst case of pediatric tetanus in 30 years, and that six-year-old little boy suffered greatly. This proposed legislation isnt forcing anything except a choice, a choice that parents who choose not to vaccinate already make. The choice is still theirs, only now they will have to face the consequences of their choices along with the rest of us. When someone chooses not to vaccinate, it does not impact only their child. I spent three weeks at home last year after an outbreak of varicella at my childrens daycare. That was not my choice. Why would we choose to allow a segment of the population to reintroduce preventable infectious diseases into our schools and communities? I support this legislation as a means of protecting public health and keeping our most vulnerable citizens safe. If someones philosophy does not align with that, they are welcome to choose an alternative education for their child. When SB 277, the legislation that eliminated philosophical and religious exemptions in California schools went into effect, immunization rates increased. I have spoken with parents who are willing to comply should this legislation move forward but are concerned about their children being able to either remain in or to start school. I encourage the Committee and the Department of Education to develop a reasonable time frame for compliance. I urge you to please support LD 798. Thank you for your consideration.

I am Nancy Beardsley and I am serving as Acting Director for the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention which is tasked with providing essential public health services that preserve, promote, and protect the health and safety of Maine people. The Maine CDC supports LD 798 because it will keep our children healthy and safe from unnecessary disease, ensure safe schools and child care centers, and protect vulnerable people against serious diseases. Currently, nursery school licensees, administrators, or other staff members are allowed religious or philosophical exemptions for immunizations. This bill removes these exemptions. This bill also directs the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services to amend their rules to remove any exemptions from immunization requirements because of their religious or philosophical beliefs. This includes students in elementary, secondary and postsecondary schools and employees in health care facilities. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports these changes. Protecting individuals and communities from communicable diseases such as measles, mumps and pertussis, is a fundamental purpose of Maine CDCs disease prevention mission. According to Vaccination Coverage for Selected Vaccines, Exemption Rates, and Provisional Enrollment Among Children in Kindergarten United States, 20] 7-18 School Year, Maine ranks 7th in the nation for the highest non-medical exemption rates among school age children. This survey represents 12,527 students resulting in a 5.3% overall exemption rate. Medical exemptions for Maine students account for 0.3% While nationally, medical exemptions are 0.2%. Non-medical exemptions, which include religious and philosophical reasons, were reported at 5.0% for Maine, compared to the national rate of 2.0%. Most of Maines school age exemptions are non-medical, with the highest rates of non-medical exemptions being reported in Page 1 of 2l -t it ,. It 4i I l l l l r EXH IB IT 4tCase 1:21-cv-00242-JDL Document 48-4 295 R.A. 19Hancock and Waldo counties. Hancock and Waldo counties also represent two of the four counties with the highest reported rates of pertussis cases in 2018, 56.7 and 158.3 per 100,000 respectively. Not only did high exemption rates likely contribute to higher rates of pertussis disease in these two counties, but also in the entire State, as Maine reported the highest rate of pertussis disease in the country for 2018. When someone chooses not to vaccinate, that decision can jeopardize the health and safety of entire communities, especially the weakest and most vulnerable among us. Those who are unable to be vaccinated, such as young infants, pregnant mothers or children with cancer, face the most risk from disease complications. Thirty-three states do not allow any personal belief exemptions. Maine is an outlier in this regard. Evidence shows that states that have tighter exemption laws have higher immunization rates, and less disease. The scientic evidence supporting immunization is overwhelming, sound, and supported by the professional medical community. Vaccinations are proven to_be safe and effective. We at the Maine CDC and Department of Health and Human Services strongly support the passage of LD 798 for all these reasons, and thank you for your time.

Exclusion by order of Public Health Official An employee not immunized or otherwise immune from a disease shall be excluded from the worksite, when in the opinion of a public health official, the employee's continued presence at work poses a clear danger to the health of others. The documented occurrence of a single case of rubeola (measles), mumps, rubella (German measles) or varicella (chickenpox) in a designated healthcare facility or amongst its employees may be interpreted as a clear danger to the health of others. The chief administrative officer shall exclude the employee during the period of danger or for one incubation period following immunization of the employee, when one or more cases of disease are present. B. The following periods are defined as the \"period of danger\": (1) Measles: 15 days from the onset of symptoms from the last identified case (2) Mumps: 18 days from the onset of symptoms from the last ide ntified case (3) Rubella: 23 days from the onset of symptoms from the last identified case (4) Varicella: 16 days from the onset of symptoms from the last identified case C.

Records and Record Keeping A. Designated Record Keeping The chief administrative officer in each designated healthcare facility shall be responsible for the maintenance of employee immunization recor ds. The chief EXHIBIT 1Case 1:21-cv-00242-JDL Document 49-2 Filed Page 5 of 7 PageID #: 479 R.A. 3110-144 Chapter 264 page 6 administrative officer may designate a person to be responsible for record keeping. B. Individual Health Records Each designated healthcare facility shall adopt a uniform, permanent health record for maintaining information regarding the health status of each employee. The immunization status of each employee with regard to each disease shall be noted on the employee's health record. The health record of each employee shall include at a minimum the month and year that each immunizing agent was administered. Where an exception has been granted for medical or religious reason, the written request for exemption must be on file with the employee health record. Where laboratory or other acceptable evidence of immunity has been submitted, a copy of the documentation must also be on file. C. List of Non -Immunized Employees The chief administrative officer or his/her designee in each designated healthcare facility shall keep a listing of the names of all employees within the facil ity who are not currently immunized or do not have documented serological immunity against each disease. This list shall include the names of all employees with authorized exemptions from immunization as well as any who are otherwise not known to be immune and shall state the reason that the employee is not immune. The purpose of the list is to provide an efficient means to rapidly contact non - immunized employees in the event of disease outbreaks and exclude them from the workplace as necessary. D. Requ ired Reports The chief administrative officer of each designated healthcare facility is responsible for submitting a summary report on the immunization status of all employees by December 15 of each calendar year, on a form prescribed by the Department, to the Director of the Bureau of Health of the Department of Human Services. The summary report will include the following information at a minimum: Specific information identifying the facility; the chief administrative officer; the total number of emp loyees; the number of employees born on or after January 1, 1957; and the number of employees identified by vaccine type as either immunized, serological proof of immunity, exempt, having declined hepatitis B vaccine, or out of compliance. The summary report may be constructed so as to reflect meaningful data by groupings within the facility (e.g., pediatric unit). Each report shall be signed by the hospital/facility's chief administrative officer as a certification that the information is accurate. The Bureau of Health will, from time to time, select a sample of employee health records for the purpose of comparing reported results against the criteria EXHIBIT 1Case 1:21-cv-00242-JDL Document 49-2 Filed 09/15/21 Page 6 of 7 #: 480 R.A. 3210-144 Chapter 264 page 7 delineated in these rules. The results of this sample survey will be shared with chief administrative officer of the designated healthcare facility for the purpose of identifying problem areas that may be occurring in the maintenance of their employee health records. Any published or unpublished reports of such sampling of employee health records shall not identify individual employees and/or designated healthcare facilities, directly or indirectly. 8. Effective Date Designated healthcare facilities under this section shall be allowed up to one year from the effective date of this rule to ensure that all employees are in compliance with the requirements herein.

As of September 14, 2021, based on daily reporting to CDC's Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) team, there are 192 people hospitalized with COVID -19 in Maine. Of those, 66 are in an intensive care unit, and 39 are on a ventilator. Of the 332 ICU beds available in the state, 61 are available. 16. As of September 9, 2021, 67% of individuals hospitalized with COIVD-19 in Maine were not fully vaccinated. That number has fluctuated and was, at one time, as high as 94% . At certain times in some hospitals in Maine, 100% of a ll patients in the ICU were not fully vaccinated. 17. COVID- 19 spreads when an infected person exhales droplets and/or very small aerosol particles that contain the virus. These droplets and/or aerosols can be inhaled by other people or land on their eyes, noses, or mouth. People who are closer than 6 feet from the infected person for more than 15 cumulative minutes are most likely to get infected. COVID-19 is spread in three main ways: a. Breathing in air when close to an infected person who is exhaling small droplets and particles that contain the virus. Case 1:21-cv-00242-JDL Document 49-4 Filed 09/15/21 Page 3 of 15 PageID #: 491 R.A. 36b. Having these small droplets and particles that contain virus land on the eyes, nose, or mouth, especially through splashes and sprays like a cough or sneeze. c. Touching eyes, nose, or mouth with hands that have the virus on them. 18. The COVID -19 virus variants that circulated at the beginning of the pandemic had an incubation period of up to 14 days. A person c ould be infected and spread the virus during that entire time period, sometimes without experiencing any symptoms during that time . 19. This phenomenon, known as \"asymptomatic transmission ,\" makes control of COVID -19 especially challenging because individuals can transmit the disease before knowing they may have it. An analysis by the USCDC concluded that approximately 40% of all COVID - 19 transmission of the early variants could occur while individuals were asymptomatic and approximately 35% of all COVID-19 patients did not have symptoms at all. 20. Given the length of the pandemic, several variants of SARS -CoV- 2 have emerged over time. 21. All variants of the COVID -19 virus spread easily between people at a rate faster than influenza spreads . 22. An even more contagious variant of the novel coronavirus, known as the Delta variant, emerged in 2021. According to the USCDC, the Delta variant is more than twice as contagious as previous variants and may cause more severe illness than previous variants in unvaccinated people. 23. According to recent nationwide data published by the USCDC, unvaccinated individuals are at least 10 times more likely to be hospitalized with COVID -19 than those who have been vaccinated. The same data showed that unvaccinated individuals are 11 times mor e likely to die of the virus as compared with vaccinated individuals. Case 1:21-cv-00242-JDL Document 49-4 Filed 09/15/21 Page 4 492 R.A. 3724. The higher contagiousness and potentially greater severity occur because i ndividuals infected with the Delta variant exhibit a much higher viral load. This higher viral load makes the virus far more contagious and allows it to spread and multiply in a shorter time period. 25. It is possible for an individual infected with the Delta variant to begin spreading it to others within 24 to 36 hours of exposure. 26. The Delta variant also exhibits asymptomatic transmission. 27. Population- level immunity, colloquially referred to as \"herd immunity,\" is an epidemiological phenomenon whereby even unvaccinated individuals are protected against an infectious disease by virtue of being in an environment with sufficiently high vaccination levels . When population- level immunity is achieved, an individual who is not able to be vaccinated can enjoy the benefits of being vaccinated because others around them are vaccinated and can block the virus from spreading from person to person. 28. The level of vaccination required to achieve population- level immunity varies with the contagiousness of the infectious disease at issue. The higher the contagiousness, the higher the vaccination rate required to achieve population -level immunity. 29. In light of the Delta variant, epidemiological models suggest that at least 90% of a population would need to be vaccinated against COVID -19 in order to achieve population- level immunity. Under models formulated based on earlier COVID -19 variants, only around 70% of the population would have needed to be vaccinated to achieve population- level immunity. 30. The treatment of patients with COVID -19 remains a clinical challenge. Though there are some medical treatments available to physicians, treatment of COVID -19 infection Case 1:21-cv-00242-JDL Document 49-4 Filed 09/15/21 Page 5 of 15 PageID #: 493 R.A. 38consists primarily of supportive care, including supplemental oxygen and ventilator support when needed. 31. One drug efficacious in the treatment of COVID -19, remdesivir, received full FDA approval on October 22, 2020. It is unclear whether or to what extent r emdesivir can reduce mortality in a statistically significant manner. It reduces the length of hospitalization for severely ill patients by approximately 4 days. Remdesivir does not prevent COVID-19. 32. Another category of pharmaceutical treatments, monoclonal antibodies, can reduce the likelihood that a patient infected with COVID -19 will require hospitalization. As with remdesivir, it is unclear whether or to what extent monoclonal antibodies may reduce mortality associated with COVID -19. In additi on, administration of monoclonal antibodies is a challenge, requiring either a multi-hour infusion or multiple injections. 33. There are also therapies like the drug dexamethasone, mainly used for patients who are hospitalized. While this drug does not treat the underlying virus itself, it can reduce lung inflammation that is thought to be caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 34. The gold standard to prevent and stop the spread of communicable diseases, including COVID-19, is vaccination. The elimination of communic able diseases through vaccination is one of the greatest achievements of public health in the 20th century. 35. Today, most people receive vaccinations against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chicken pox) in childhood. Childhood vaccinations ensure long- term population- level immunity from communicable diseases. For instance, the following population- level vaccination rates are necessary to protect against each of the following diseases: a. Measles: 95% b. Mumps: 92% Case the number of unvaccinated individuals in school settings as low as possible is necessary to achieve these population- level immunity thresholds and prevent outbreaks of these infectious diseases in school settings and in the general population . 37. The same is true for healthcare settings. The rationale for requiring immunization in healthcare settings is the same as that against vaccine- prevent able childhood diseases: high vaccination rates prevent the spread of disease through the populat ion and amongst vulnerable population, namely children and patients. Just as there is close contact amongst children in a classroom, healthcare settings require close contact between health care professionals and patients. 38. When vaccination rates fall below the population- level immunity rates above, the health and safety of both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals is at risk, especially the most vulnerable. In particular, the health of individuals with weakened immune systems, infants too young to be vaccinated, and persons unable to be vaccinated are put in jeopardy. 39. In general, there are also situations when certain vaccination s may not be advisable, such as women during pregnancy, individuals undergoing treatment for serious diseases, and individuals who have a demonstrated allergy to one of the vaccine components. In these circumstances, vaccination could have adverse health consequences for the patient. 40. There are three COVID -19 vaccines that are generally available to the public. a. On December 11, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the use of thePfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine (\"Pfizer vaccine\"). The Pfizer vaccine EUA authorized the administration of two doses of the Pfizer Case 1:21-cv-00242-JDL Document 49-4 Filed 09/15/21 Page 7 of 15 PageID #: 495 R.A. 40vaccine, spaced three weeks apart. On August 23, 2021, the FDA gave full approval to the Pfizer vaccine. b. On December 18, 2020, the FDA issued an EUA for the use of the Moderna COVID- 19 Vaccine (\"Moderna vaccine\"). The Moderna vaccine EUA authorized the administration of two doses of the Moderna vaccine, spaced four weeks apart. c. On February 27, 2021 the FDA issued an EUA for the use of the Janssen COVID - 19 Vaccine (\"J&J vaccine\"). The J&J vaccine EUA authorized administration of a single dose of the J&J vaccine. d. None of these vaccines is authorized or approved for administration to children under the age of 12. 41. After receiving the final dose of one the three COVID -19 vaccines, an individual is considered \"fully vaccinated\" two weeks later, when the vaccine has had time to take effect. 42. The Pfizer vaccine prevented 95% of individuals in clinical trials from becoming infected with COVID- 19. The Moderna vaccine prevented infection in 94.1% of cases. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine prevented 66.1% of infections globally; in the United States, it was 72% effective against infection and 86% effective in preventing severe disease. 43. Even in the face of the more -contagious Delta variant, the three available COVID -19 vaccines remain effective, particularly with respect to conferring protection against hospitalization and death. 44. The first vaccine doses in Maine were administered on December 14, 2020. 45. In Maine, as of September 9, 20201, 5,723 self-identified health care workers have contracted COVID -19. Of those, at least 1,900 (or more than one third) have occurred Case 1:21-cv-00242-JDL Document 49-4 Filed 09/15/21 Page 8 of 15 PageID #: 496 R.A. 41since January 18, 2021. The January 18, 2021, date is important because that is the first date that any person could be considered fully vaccinated against COVID-19. 46. As of September 3, 2021, of the thirty- three COVID -19 outbreaks under investigation by Maine CDC, nineteen were occurring in health care facilities that would be covered by the recent Emergency Rule. 47. On August 11, 2021, of the fourteen open COVID -19 outbreaks under investigation by Maine CDC, four were occurring in health care facilities that would have been covered by the recent Emergency Rule, had it been in effect. These outbreaks were occurring in facilities such as long -term care facilities and hospitals . The hospitals where these outbreaks were occurring have strong infection control programs. 48. Most health care facility outbreaks are the result of health care workers who bring COVID - 19 into the facility. 49. The Delta variant was first identified in Maine via genomic sequencing May 11, 2021. 50. As of August 27, 2021, the Delta variant accounted for 96.7% of all positive COVID -19 samples sequenced in Maine. According to the USCDC's variant tracker, the Delta variant is now the predominant variant within the United States . 51. In Maine, since Septem ber 1, 2021, the rate of infection in the population of individuals aged 12 and older is 8 times higher among the unvaccinated. 52. In Maine, the rate of COVID -19 hospitalization in the 12 and older population is 7.1 times higher among the unvaccinated, as compared with those who are fully vaccinated. The USCDC report ed on July 25, 2021, that COVID-19 infection and hospitalization rates among unvaccinated individuals were 4.9 and 29.2 times, respectively, those in fully vaccinated individuals. Case 1:21-cv-00242-JDL Document 49-4 Filed 09/15/21 Page 9 of 15 PageID #: 497 R.A. 4253. For the monthly reporting period ending July 31, 2021, the rate of COVID -19 vaccines among healthcare workers was as follows: a. Ambulatory Surgical Centers: 85.9% b. Assisted Housing Facilities: 74.7% c. Hospitals: 80.3% d. Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities: 68.2% e. Nursing Homes: 73.0% 54. All facilities fell significantly below the minimum 90% threshold needed to reduce the likelihood of facility -based outbreaks. 55. In light of all of the above , Maine CDC determined that requiring COVID -19 vaccinations for healthcare workers in certain high- risk settings was necessary to protect public health, healthcare workers, and Maine's health care system from the further spread of COVID -19. Accordingly, the Department and Maine CDC issued an emergency rule (Emergency CDC Rule) that required Designated Health Care Facilities, Dental Health Practices, and Emergency Services Organizations to ensure their employees were vaccinated against COVID- 19. Maine CDC determined that these types of facilities and se ttings posed a higher risk for transmission of COVID -19 because of the patient populations served and type of care provided. 56. There are at least four public health reasons for the issuance of the Emergency CDC Rule: a. Protection of individual patients. Many patients receiving care in the settings covered by the Emergency CDC Rule are particularly vulnerable to developing serious illness as a result of COVID -19, including the elderly and those with underlying health problems. Case 1:21-cv-00242-JDL Document 49-4 Filed 09/15/21 Page 10 of 15 PageID #: 498 R.A. 43b. Protection of individual work ers. Workers in these high- risk healthcare settings are likely to interact with many patients in any given day, increasing the risk that they will be exposed to an individual with COVID -19. Because employees interact with not just their patients, but each other, they are also at risk of transmitting disease amongst themselves. c. Protection of the State's healthcare infrastructure, including the workforce. In some areas of Maine, an outbreak among healthcare workers requiring them to quarantine, or to be absent for a longer period as a result of illness caused by COVID- 19, could cripple the facility's ability to provide care . Combined with increasing infection rates in the community, this could lead to an insufficient workforce to respond to the state's healthcare needs. Even before the onset of COVID- 19, Maine's healthcare system was fragile due to understaffing. An outbreak of COVID -19 amongst ICU nurses in a rural hospital could incapacitate the hospital 's entire ability to care for seriously ill patients . d. Reducing the likelihood of facility outbreaks. As noted above, most COVID -19 outbreaks in facilities are caused by an infected healthcare worker bringing the virus into the facility. Reducing the number of unvaccinated health care workers statewid e lowers the likelihood of health care facility outbreaks. Limiting the number of outbreaks in high- risk facilities is essential to slowing the spread of COVID-19 across the state. 57. In addition to the general reasons stated above, requiring vaccination for employees of Dental Health Practices is particularly important given the nature of the care they provide. A patient receiving dental services does not have the option to wear a mask or to physically Case 1:21-cv-00242-JDL Document 49-4 Filed 09/15/21 Page 11 of 15 PageID #: 499 R.A. 44distance; instead, they may spend an hour or more with their mouth open while in close contact with one or more providers. Under these conditions, it is essential that every available precaution be taken to prevent transmission of COVID -19, particularly against the highly transmissible Delta variant. 58. Requiring vaccination for employees of EMS organizations is essential for a number of reasons. In many cases, their patients do not have the option of controlling the environment in which they receive services . Also , their patients in many cases are in acute distress, increasing the likelihood that they will be unmasked when EMS personnel treat them. The provision of the emergency services they provide most often cannot be provided while maintaining the recommended distance; it is likely to require direct physical contact. EMS workers may spend extended periods of time riding in ambulances, putting them in close contact with both their colleagues and patients for extended periods. Transpor t services carry personnel and patients from one facility to another, and EMS clinicians may interact with staff at multiple nursing homes, long- term care facilities, and/or hospitals on any given day. For these reasons, taking every measure to reduce the likelihood of transmission of COVID-19, and the Delta variant in particular, is essential to protecting public health. 59. In reaching the decision to adopt this Emergency Rule, Maine CDC considered whether there were other, less restrictive measures that mig ht be appropriate. Ultimately, we concluded that there were none. 60. Prior to the widespread availability of testing, symptom monitoring for COVID -19 prior to the start of each shift was important for infection control . Symptom monitoring remains important, though is not the sole strategy to identify individuals who have CO VID-19 Case 1:21-cv-00242-JDL Document 49-4 Filed 09/15/21 Page 12 of 15 PageID #: 500 R.A. 45because of the large percentage of transmission that occurs while individuals are asymptomatic. 61. We considered the possibility of testing covered health care workers on a periodic basis. But regular testing for the presence of the virus in employees is insufficient to protect against the Delta variant. Given the speed with which the Delta variant is transmitted, weekly or twice weekly testing would be ineffective to prevent ing transmission. This is because the Delta variant can cause illness and sp read to another person as soon as 48 hours after exposure, rendering occasional testing ineffective. An employee who tests negative on a Monday morning could be exposed that afternoon, and, within 36 hours, could be spreading the virus to others over the course of the several days until the next test. 62. Daily testing was also considered and was rejected. The most effective test utilized for the detection of the virus that causes COVID -19 is a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. A PCR test requires a mi nimum of 24 hours before results are available. Because test results are not available for at least 24 hours, and sometimes up to 72 hours, daily PCR testing is insufficient for the same reasons that occasional PCR testing is insufficient. Daily testing likely would require the use of the less -effective rapid antigen test, which provides results in fifteen minutes, but is more likely to provide false negative results. This means that an individual could test negative but, in fact, truly be carrying the virus that causes COVID - 19. Moreover, the nation is currently experiencing a shortage of these rapid antigen tests, which is not expected to be alleviated in the next two months. Daily testing simply would not be effective at stopping the spread of COVID -19 in covered facilities, particularly in light of the Delta variant. Case 1:21-cv-00242-JDL Document 49-4 Filed 09/15/21 Page 13 of 15 PageID #: 501 R.A. 4663. There continues to be significant scientific uncertainty about whether and to what extent individuals who have previously been infected with COVID -19 develop sufficient immunity to prevent them from transmitting the virus. For that reason, Maine CDC did not include a provision within our Emergency Rule providing an exemption from the vaccination requirement for health care workers who previously had COVID-19. 64. Although the use of personal protective equipment ( PPE) is effective in reducing transmission, it does not eliminate the possibility of spreading COVID -19, especially in healthcare settings. As n oted, 19 of the 33 COVID-19 outbreaks under investigation as of September 3, 2021, were in health care facilities that are covered by the Emergency CDC Rule. Sole reliance on PPE, even when fitted and worn correctly, is insufficient to entirely stop the spread of COVID-19 in healthcare settings in Maine. 65. Health care facilities in Maine have continued to use a mixture of these practices \u2014 symptom monitoring, testing, PPE, etc.\u2014throughout the pandemic to reduce the likelihood of health care workers bringing COVID- 19 into a facility and causing an outbreak. But despite the use of these health and safety protocols, there have been numerous COVID-19 outbreaks at health care facilities in Maine during the past 18 months. 66. Further, c ompared with other states, the size of Maine's healthcare workforce is limited, such that the impact of any outbreaks among personnel is far greater than it would be in a state with more extensive healthcare delivery systems. Considering the unique circumstances of the state of Maine, it is necessary to take every available precaution to limit the spread of COVID -19 both in healthcare facilities and among their workers. 67. The three COVID -19 vaccines remain the most effective method to prevent COVID -19 infection and pr otect ing health care workers and the patients they serve.

Civil Action No. 1:21 -cv-00242 -JDL DECLARATION OF SARA GAGN \u00c9-HOLMES I, Sara Gagn \u00e9-Holmes, hereby declare as follows: 1. I am Sara Gagn \u00e9-Holmes, an attorney authorized to practice law in Maine since 2001 . I am currently a Deputy Commissioner of the Maine Department of Health and Human Services (Department). The Department includes several divisions, including the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Maine CDC). Since March of 2020, I have been involved in many aspects of the COVID -19 response including, the creation and implementation of social supports needed for those who must quarantine or isolate, policy development regarding testing, vaccine accessibility, vaccine incentives, and outreach to communities a nd providers . Case 1:21-cv-00242-JDL Document 49-5 Filed of 12 PageID #: 504 R.A. 492. The following declaration is based upon my personal knowledge and information and documents that are available to me. 3. The Maine CDC is the lead state agency guiding the State's public health -based responses to the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic. 4. The primary goal of Maine CDC's management of th e COVID -19 pandemic has been to a) prevent and stop the spread of the virus that causes COVID -19 (SARS -CoV -2) in order to protect the people of Maine from acute sickness and death, and b) protect Maine's health care delivery system from being overwhelmed by an unrestrained pandemic. 5. Prior to the availability of COVID -19 vaccinations, the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention (U SCDC) and Maine CDC advised that the most effective way to limit the spread of the virus was to wear face coverings and distance members of society from one another by limiting their in -person contact. 6. Although vaccines were not available until December of 2020, Maine began planning for vaccine distribution in the spring of 2020. The Department and Maine CDC worked with hospitals, health care providers, health centers, and many others to develop a plan to facilitate distribution and administration of any COVID -19 vaccine that received authorization or approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 7. In April of 2020, the Department and Maine CDC began holding weekly remot e (Zoom /telephonic ) information session regarding COVID -19. The 60 -minute sess ions were open to the medical directors , clinicians , and staff at long term care facilities. The sessions were held weekly until approximately Ma y of 2021 , when they went to bimonthly, and then monthly in July of 2021 . As of September , the sessions revert ed back to bimonthly . Case 1:21-cv-00242-JDL Document 49-5 Filed 09/15/21 Page 2 of 12 PageID #: 505 R.A. 508. Additionally, beginning in September 2020, Maine CDC staff held weekly Vaccine Planning Group webinars that provided clinical and administrative updates both clinicians and health care administrators enrolled in the Maine Immunization Prog ram on issues related to vaccine planning, distribution, administration, and monitoring. Those sessions were held weekly through June 2021, and were also recorded and posted to the ME CDC website. 9. Once vaccinations became available, the D epartment and Maine CDC undertook a series of steps to acquire and distribute those vaccines to Maine Immunization Program providers to administer to members of the public . 10. There are three COVID -19 vaccines that have been authorized for use by the FDA: a. On December 11, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the use of thePfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine (\"Pfizer vaccine\") . The Pfizer vaccine EUA authorized the administration of two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, spaced three weeks ap art. On August 23, 2021, the FDA gave final approval to the Pfizer vaccine. b. On December 18, 2020, the FDA issued an EUA for the use of the Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine (\"Moderna vaccine\") . The Moderna vaccine EUA authorized the administration of two doses of the Moderna vaccine, spaced four weeks apart. c. On February 27, 2021 the FDA issued an EUA for the use of the Janssen COVID - 19 Vaccine (\"J&J vaccine\") . The J&J vaccine EUA authorized administration of a single dose of the J&J vaccine. 11. After receiving the final dose of one the three COVID -19 vaccines, an individual is considered \"fully vaccinated\" two weeks later, when the vaccine has had time to take effect. Case 1:21-cv-00242-JDL Document 49-5 Filed 09/15/21 Page 3 of 12 PageID #: 506 R.A. 5112. Maine placed its first order for the COVID -19 vaccine from USCDC on December 4, 2020 . The first allocation was 12,675 doses of Pfizer , allowing 12,675 people to receive a first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. 13. Beginning i n December of 2020, the Department and Maine CDC started holding twice weekly telephonic information session regarding COVID -19 vaccines. The 30 -minute sessions were open to any clinician in the State and approximately 30 to 100 clinicians attended each session. During the sessions, the Department and Maine CDC provided information on the s cience of vaccines; vaccine development and approval process; the mechanism and make up of initial vaccines; vaccine distribution planning; methods for addressing vaccine hesitancy and patient conversations; vaccine storage, handling and administration; an d reporting and tracking adverse events . Beginning in April of 2021, the sessions were held biweekly, and then monthly starting in July of 2021. 14. In December of 2020, the Department and Maine CDC began convening on a monthly basis (30 minutes) a workgrou p consisting of 12 clinicians from across the state representing different provider types, focused on getting input on the best way to offer education to clinicians on the COVID -19 vaccine . 15. First doses of COVID -19 vaccines were Pfizer vaccines administered on December 14, 2020. The first date that any person could be fully vaccinated was January 18, 2020. 16. Maine CDC prioritized eligibility for the first allocation of Pfizer vaccine , as well as the subsequent weeks' allotments of Pfizer and Moderna, to frontline health care professionals and patient facing staff in the interest of preserving health system capacity. This included, but was not limited to, hospitals , long-term care facil ities, outpatient clinics, physician practices, home health care, pharmacies, emergency medical services, public health Case 1:21-cv-00242-JDL Document 49-5 Filed 09/15/21 Page 4 of 12 PageID #: 507 R.A. 52settings , dental practices, and school nurses and school health clinics throughout Maine. Residents of long -term care facilities were a lso prioritized for eligibility in that first month . This prioritization was consistent with guidelines issues by USCDC. 17. Given limited vaccine supply in the first several weeks of distribution, h ospitals received doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine and then administered them to their staff , as well as other health care providers not on their staff but eligible under Maine guidelines . As supply expanded, so did the types of health care providers receiving vaccine to provide to eligible health care wo rkers and long -term care residents . 18. By December 31, 2020, 27,122 healthcare workers and long -term care residents had received their first dose of the COVID -19 vaccine. 19. As Maine receive d further allocations of vaccines, additional members of the public became eligible for COVID -19 vaccination. a. The week of January 11, 2021, COVID -19 vaccines became available to firefighters, police, law enforcement personnel, and critical COVID -19 response personnel. b. On January 18, 2021 , Maine residents age 70 and older became eligible to receive a COVID -19 vaccine. c. On March 3, 2021, Maine residents age 60 and older became eligible to receive a COVID -19 vaccine. d. On April 1, 2021, Maine residents age 50 and older became eligible to receive a COVID -19 vaccine. e. On Apri l 7, 2021, all Maine residents age 16 and older became eligible to receive a COVID -19 vaccine. Case 1:21-cv-00242-JDL Document 49-5 Filed 09/15/21 Page 5 of 12 53f. On May 12 , 2021 , all Maine children ages 12 and older became eligible to receive a COVID -19 vaccine. 20. In order to facilitate the administration of COVID -19 vaccinations to members of the public, the Department and Maine CDC partnered with hospital systems to stand up and operate large throughput vaccination sites across the State. The Department and Maine CDC formed these partnerships with MaineHealth, Northern Light, Central Maine Medical Center, and MaineGeneral Health (collectively, \"Hospital Systems\"). 21. The Department and Maine CDC provided the COVID -19 vaccines and offered the use of its newly created call center s for scheduling of vaccinations. The State also allowed for Maine Responds volunteers to be utilized at the sites. 22. Maine Responds is a program is a partnership that integrates local, regional, and statewide volunteer resources to assist our public health and healthcare systems. It is part of a national initiative to train, coordinate, and mobilize volunteers during an emergency. Maine Responds coordinates verified, pre -credentialed public health, healthcare and emergency response volunteers into a singl e database that can coordinate the need for volunteers across county, regional, and state lines if needed. 23. The Hospital Systems managed and operated the large throughput vaccination sites and provided staff to administers vaccines to members of the public. Maine Responds volunteers filled in as necessary to assist in the operation of the sites and administration of vaccines. a. MaineHealth operated large throughput vaccination site s at 2 Scarborough Downs Rd, Scarbo rough and at 1364 Main St., Sanford . Case 1:21-cv-00242-JDL Document 49-5 Filed Page 6 of 12 PageID #: 509 R.A. 54b. North ern Light operated the large throughput vaccination site at Cross Insurance Center, 515 Main St, Bangor . c. MaineGeneral operated the large throughput vaccination site at the Augusta Civic Center, 76 Community Dr., Augusta . d. Central Maine Health Center operated the large throughput vaccination site at the Auburn Mall, 550 Center St ., Auburn . 24. There were also vaccination sites at numerous designated health care facilities , EMS organizations, and pharmacies across the State where health care workers and members of the public could be vaccinated. 25. On March 9, 2021, the Department began providing free transportation to COVID -19 appointments to Maine residents unable to drive or travel or otherwise without reliable transportation. 26.

A true and accurate copy of the Emergency CDC Rule is attached hereto as Exhibit 3. b. A true and accurate copy of th e basis statement for the Emergency CDC Rule is attached here as Exhibit 4. c. The Emergency CDC Rule is only effective through November 10, 2021. 35. On August 17, the Department and Maine CDC issued interpretive guidance on the Emergency CDC Rule through an swers to frequently asked questions (FAQs). The Emergency CDC Rule FAQs explained the definition of employees under the rule: \"Employees are defined as 'any person who performs any services for wages or other remuneration for a Designated Health Care Faci lity, EMS Organization and Dental Practice. ' For the purposes of this rule, DHHS interprets employee to mean those physically present at a Designated Health Care Facility EMS Organization or Dental Practice. \" 36. On August 27, 2021, the Department and Maine CDC updated the Emergency CDC Rule FAQs to include the following questions and answers: Case 1:21-cv-00242-JDL Document 49-5 Filed 09/15/21 Page 10 of 12 PageID #: 513 R.A. 58 Does this rule prohibit Designated Health Care Facilities , Dental Health Practices, or Emergency Medical Services Organizations from making accommodations for unvaccinated employees who object to receiving the COVID -19 vaccine because of sincerely held religious beliefs, as may be required by the Maine Human Rights Act and/or Title VII of the Civil Rights Act? This rule does not prohi bit employers from providing accommodations for employees' sincerely held religious beliefs or practices that may otherwise be required by law. For example, this rule does not prohibit employers from allowing employees to work remotely or reassigning empl oyees to positions outside of a Designated Health Care Facility , Dental Health Practice, or Emergency Medical Services Organization. However, if accommodations provided by a Designated Health Care Facility , Dental Health Practice, or Emergency Medical Ser vices Organization are not in compliance with this rule, then the Designated Health Care Facility , Dental Health Practice, or Emergency Medical Services Organization may be subject to enforcement action. If an employee of an organization is not vaccinated and doesn't plan on getting the vaccine, should they be dismissed from the organization covered by the rule on September 17 or can the employee continue to work until October 1? Organizations subject to this rule may make their own specific enforcement policies within the framework of the rule. 37. On September 2, 2021, the Department and Maine CDC announced that although the Emergency CDC Rule was not being amended, the Department and Maine CDC would not begin enforcing its provisions before October 29 , 2021, thereby allowing more time for entities covered by the rule to come into compliance. 38. On September 8, 2021, the Department and Maine CDC proposed further amendment to the CDC Rule (Proposed CDC Rule), which rule is subject to a notice and comment period. A true and accurate copy of the Proposed CDC Rule is attached hereto as Exhibit 5.

Exclusion by order of Public Health Official An employee not immunized or otherwise immune from a disease must be excluded from the worksite, when in the opinion of a public health official, the employee's continued presence at work poses a clear danger to the health of others. The documented occurrence of a single case of rubeola (measles), mumps, rubella (German measles) or varicella (chickenpox) in a Designated Healthcare Facility or amongst its employees may be interpreted as a clear danger to the he alth of others. The Chief Administrative Officer must exclude the employee during the period of danger or for one incubation period following immunization of the employee, when one or more cases of disease are present. B. The following periods are def ined as the \"period of danger :\" 1 Measles : 15 days from the onset of symptoms from the last identified case 2. Mumps : 18 days from the onset of symptoms from the last identified case EXHIBIT 1Case 1:21-cv-00242-JDL Document 49-6 Filed 09/15/21 #: 520 R.A. 6510-144 CMR C h. 264 6 3.

(207) 287 -3746 Fax (207) 287 -8127 2018 Healthcare Worker Immunization Assessment Report The Maine Immunization Program conducts an annual immunization assessment of State of Maine Healthcare Workers. Rules pursuant to 22 M.R.S. \u00a7 802 requires each designated healthcare facility in the State of Maine to require from all employees proof of immunization or documented immunity against Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Varicella, and also Hepatitis B for all at -risk employees. The healthcare facility should also adopt a uniform, permanent health record for maintaining information regarding the health status of each employee and submit a summary of the immunization status of all employees to the Maine CDC annually. The 2018 Healthcare Worker Immunization Survey was conducted online f rom October to December 31, 2018 . The vaccination data reported by all facility types was analyzed and a summary table was generated (Table 1). Hospital specific data was analyzed separately and graphical representations of these results by vaccine type can be found on the follo wing pages (Figures 1 -5). Immunization is the most effective and efficient way to ensure that healthcare workers, their family members, and patients, particularly those who are immunocompromised, are protected against these vaccine preventable diseases. This is perhaps one of the most important reasons why it would be advantageous for facilities to meet all requirements of the Maine Immunization Healthcare Workers law and to help reach the goal of the Maine Immunization Program to bring the State vaccine coverage rate average for each of these vaccines to 100%.

Genesis did not keep track of employee request s for religious exemptions before vaccines became available for COVID-19. 5. To incentivize employees to get vaccinated, Gene sis held free vaccinati on clinics on site and at all times treated time getting the vaccine as compensable. 6. It has been and continues to be Genesis polic y and practice to comply with all regulatory requirements pertaining to infection control, including in particular those from CMS and OSHA's Emergency Temporary Standard pe rtaining to COVID-19, as well as state requirements in each of the states in which Genesis operates. 7. On August 2, 2021, Genesis announced a company- wide vaccination mandate. Since that announcement, in Maine the Company has r eceived several reque sts for religious exemptions, some of which have been denied for failure to meet the company's criteria, some of which have been approved, and some of wh ich are pending further information from or action by the employee. Employees with approved exemptions are continuing to work until the effective date of the Immunization Requirements Rule.

At the time Genesis announced its company-wi de vaccine mandate, the seven-day rolling average employee vaccination rate in the State of Maine was 70.5%. 9. To comply with the Immunization Requireme nts Rule as amended by DHHS, Genesis has informed all employees at its Maine facilities th at they must be fully vaccinated by the date established for enforcement by the Governor of Maine, unless they are eligible for a valid exemption. Genesis intends to be in full compliance with the Rule when DHHS begins enforcement with respect to COVID-19 immunization on October 29, 2021. 10. In my capacity as Regional Vice President of Operations for Maine, I am aware of all pending employment claims including administrative claims filed with the EEOC and/or the Maine Human Rights Commission by any employees at any Genesis facility in Maine. Genesis has received one charge alleging failure to provide both reli gious and disability- related accommodations with respect to th e Company's, not the State's, COVID-19 vaccination mandate. The charge is by a male employee who provides his name and alleges he was terminated on August 24, 2021. These allegations differ in material respects from those of John Doe 2, who does not allege disabi lity discrimination or termination and who is challenging the State mandate, not the Company's. I theref ore do not believe that the complainant in the charge is a Plaintiff in this lawsuit. Genesis has not received any other administrative charges by Maine employees alleging religious discrimination against any Genesis entity in Maine relati ng to the COVID-19 vaccine. I declare under the penalties of perjury under the laws of the Unite d States of America that the foregoing is true and correct.
