The Fukushima nuclear plant begins releasing radioactive wastewater into the sea In a live video from a control room at the plant Thursday, Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings showed a staff member turn on a seawater pump, marking the beginning of the controversial project that is expected to last for decades. Fukushima nuclear plant will start releasing treated radioactive water to sea as early as Thursday A massive earthquake and tsunami destroyed the Fukushima Daiichi plant's cooling systems, causing three of its reactors to melt and contaminating their cooling water. The water, now amounted to 1.34 million tons, is collected, filtered and stored in about 1,000 tanks, which fill much of the plant's grounds and will reach their capacity in early 2024. The Fukushima water release plan Tanks on the site now hold about 1.3 million tonnes of radioactive water - enough to fill 500 Olympic-sized swimming pools. Here is how Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) plans to deal with it: Historic Apsara reactor transformed into public museum: Unveiling India's nuclear odyssey India's Apsara reactor at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) in Trombay is being transformed into a public museum in a project that could set a global precedent. Marking the genesis of the nuclear era for India and Asia when it was opened by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in 1956, the one-megawatt reactor is to become a historical and educational artifact that will provide an immersive experience, offering visitors a glimpse into India's nuclear journey. The museum is expected to be completed in around a year and will offer schoolchildren a firsthand encounter with the nation's nuclear journey. BRICS Nuclear medicine experts brainstorm in Moscow for future solutions The event was attended by the heads and leading scientists of the largest research medical centers, manufacturers of medical radioisotopes and radiopharmaceuticals from the BRICS countries, and representatives of state authorities in manufacturing radioisotope products for health care.

Among the partners of Isotope JSC are 170 foreign companies based in 50 countries worldwide and about 600 organizations in Russia, including medical centers, industrial enterprises, and scientific institutions. In 2023, Isotope JSC is celebrating the 65th anniversary since its foundation. Climate goals need clean energy surge in Global South: IEAInvestment for non-fossil fuel energy in developing and emerging economies will need to increase seven-fold within a decade if global warming is to be capped at tolerable levels, according to a report from the International Energy Agency. Financing clean energy in these nations is essential to reach international climate goals, said IEA executive director Fatih Birol. The $260bn annual investment figure must rise to almost $2tn. Two-thirds of investment must come from the private sector as international leaders gather for a two-day summit seeking a New Global Financing Pact in Paris. Ukrainian nuclear plant loses power supply again, is 'extremely vulnerable': IAEAZaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest atomic power station, has lost its external power supply for the seventh time since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, prompting concerns about the nuclear safety situation. Rafael Grossi, head of the IAEA, has urged the area to be spared from fighting between Ukrainian and Russian forces, as IAEA staff are deployed at the plant and it is occupied by Russian troops. Reducing embodied emissions in building design could save up to 6 gigatonnes of carbon by 2050Researchers from the University of Cambridge and Bath, UK, devised a computer model and used it to estimate that these recommendations could also save between 28 and 44 per cent of annual heating and cooling costs, using technology that is currently available. Their findings are reported in the journal Applied Energy. What's happening at Fukushima plant 12 years after meltdown?The plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, aims to have the facilities ready by spring. TEPCO needs a safety approval from the Nuclear Regulation Authority. The International Atomic Energy Agency, collaborating with Japan to ensure the project meets international standards, will send a mission to Japan and issue a report before the discharge begins. New nuclear power must pass the 'Chindia test' \u2014 this energy source should be built like modern aviation or shipping: Joseph B. Lassiter\"We should try to change radiophobia now \u2014 if we build new nuclear power plants at the scale required to fulfill global energy needs, there will be occasional failures, just as there are in aviation or construction. However, these need not become massive disasters. Radiation was not a disaster in Fukushima per se \u2014 obsolete policies and human reactions brought on much of the difficulties,\" Lassiter said. Ladakh's renewable energy to get a boost with new transmission project\"Approval of 13 GW of Ladakh renewable projects involving a capex of Rs 20,700 crore will lead to strong order inflows for transmission engineering, procurement and construction companies, transformers companies and other ancillary sector,\" ICICI direct said in a statement. Russia offers India new fuel technology & solutions for atomic reactorsThe presentation covered the key developments which may enhance efficiency of the functioning units of the Kudankulam NPP, powered by VVER-1000 reactors, as well as the ones under construction. In particular, it embraced new materials and models of nuclear fuel, solutions for higher uranium enrichment, technologies of closed nuclear fuel cycle and the new prospects they open for NPPs. Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant: Who controls it and why is it important?The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has six Soviet-designed VVER-1000 V-320 water-cooled and water-moderated reactors containing Uranium 235, which has a half-life of more than 700 million years. Construction began in 1980 and its sixth reactor was connected to the grid in 1995. All six reactors are now in cold shutdown after reactor No. 6 was shut down on Sept. 12. Lights out, ovens off: Europe preps for winter energy crisisEurope's dependence on Russian energy has turned the war into an energy and economic crisis, with prices rising to record highs in recent months and fluctuating wildly. For Russia's Putin, military and diplomatic pressures mountWestern officials and analysts said Russian forces were apparently setting up a new defensive line in Ukraine's northeast after the counteroffensive punched through the previous one, allowing Kyiv's soldiers to recapture large swaths of land in the northeastern Kharkiv region that borders Russia. For Russia's Putin, military and diplomatic pressures mountPutin, at a high-level summit in Uzbekistan this week, vowed to press his attack on Ukraine despite the recent military setbacks but also faced concerns by India and China over the drawn-out conflict. Last reactor at Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant stoppedThe six-reactor Zaporizhzhia plant was disconnected from the grid last week after all its power lines were disconnected as a result of fighting in the area, and was operating in \"island mode\" for several days, generating electricity for crucial cooling systems from its only remaining reactor in operation. Russia accuses Ukraine of shelling around nuclear plantRussia and Ukraine have in recent weeks traded blame for shelling around the Moscow-controlled Zaporizhzhia power plant in southern Ukraine, raising fears of a nuclear disaster. There were seven strikes on the territory of the plant on Tuesday, a Moscow-installed official in Zaporizhzhia, Vladimir Rogov, said on social media. UN agency to inspect Ukraine nuclear plant in urgent missionUkraine and Russia again accused each other of shelling the wider region around the nuclear power plant, Europe's largest, which was briefly knocked offline last week. IAEA mission heads to Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant near war frontlineCaptured by Russian troops in March but run by Ukrainian staff, Zaporizhzhia has been a hotspot in a conflict that has settled into a war of attrition fought mainly in Ukraine's east and south six months after Russia launched its invasion. Fresh shelling at Ukraine power plant as operator warns of radiation riskKyiv and Moscow have repeatedly swapped allegations over rocket attacks in the vicinity of the plant -- Europe's largest -- located in the city of Energodar. Climate change likely to hamper India's solar & wind energy potentialClimate change may slow down India's solar and wind potential in the coming years, a new study by the Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology shows. Regional analysis of wind potential indicates that the frequency of high energy producing wind speeds will decrease, whereas low energy producing wind speeds are likely to increase in the future. Why Europe faces climbing energy billsPrices started to rise above historically normal levels last September and have soared further following supply disruption linked to Russia's invasion of Ukraine that began on Feb. 24. Fighting in Ukraine endangers Zaporizhzhia plant; nations trade accusationsDuring the fighting in early March, Russian and Ukrainian forces exchanged fire near the plant. The skirmishes resulted in a fire at its training complex. The Russians have left the Ukrainian staff in place to keep the plant operating, and it has continued to supply electricity to government-controlled parts of Ukraine. Zelenskyy: Russia sowing a deep hatred among Ukrainians\"You are doing everything so that our people themselves leave the Russian language, because the Russian language will now be associated only with you, with your explosions and murders, your crimes,\" Zelenskyy said in an impassioned video address late Saturday. Russia's seizure of Ukraine nuclear plant adds to fears about radiation safetyRussian forces captured the Zaporizhzhia plant - Europe's largest - after attacking it in the early hours of Friday, setting an adjacent five-storey training facility on fire, Ukrainian authorities said. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a tweet Ukrainian authorities had informed the agency that the fire at the site had not affected \"essential\" equipment.Load More BACK TO TOP "}
