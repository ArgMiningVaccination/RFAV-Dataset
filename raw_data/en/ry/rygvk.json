Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome.-NIH is directed to submit the report on Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) that was requested in Senate Report 115-289, now overdue, no later than 30 days after enactment of this Act. NIH is strongly encouraged to include an estimate of annual NIH funding allocated to POTS research in its publicly available RCDC report. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DENTAL AND CRANIOFACIAL RESEARCH (NIDCR) Temporomandibular Disorders.-NIDCR is encouraged to continue collaboration with governmental agencies and other stakeholders in the project entitled Temporomandibular Disorders: From Research Discoveries to Clinical Treatment and to increase funding to expand the science base in this field. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES (NIDDK) Chronic Diseases and Health Disparities .-Kidney disease, type 2 diabetes, and obesity are among the most common, costly, and preventable of all health conditions. NIH needs to focus chronic disease efforts on those populations most affected, particularly vulnerable populations and underrepresented minorities. Therefore, the agreement provides sufficient funding for an initiative to address chronic diseases and health disparities in these areas. The program must focus on kidney disease, obesity, diabetes, exercise medicine, and health disparities. Programs should have a strong existing track record of NIH funding in all of these areas, such as an NIH-funded Nutrition Obesity Research Center, Diabetes 55 Research Center, Obesity Health Disparities Research Center, and O'Brien Kidney Center. Additionally, regional multi-institutional consortiums are strongly encouraged. Diabetes .-NIDDK is urged to support research to improve the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers and reduce amputations. Further, the agreement urges NIDDK to work with NIA to explore the relationship between diabetes and neurocognitive conditions, such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Finally, the agreement supports efforts to utilize adult-derived, non-embryonic pluripotent stem cells for developing and commercializing the use of the stem cell-derived islets for both drug discovery and testing platforms and therapeutic delivery to patients with diabetes. Liver Diseases.-NIDDK is encouraged to continue to feature liver diseases research considering recent progress and improvements for liver disease patients. Medical Foods.-The agreement encourages further incorporation of research topics associated with medical foods and patient care into emerging research activities.

POTS.-NIH is directed to submit the report on POTS requested in Senate Report 115-289, now overdue, no later than 30 days after enactment of this Act. NIH is strongly encouraged to include an estimate of annual NIH funding allocated to POTS research in its publicly available RCDC report. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES (NIAID) AIDS Conference.-The agreement includes $5,100,000 for the U.S. contribution to the AIDS2020 Conference. Antimicrobial Resistance.-The agreement includes $511,000,000 within NIAID for research related to combating antimicrobial resistance (AMR), an increase of $50,000,000. In April, the United Nations issued a report that, like the 2016 review sponsored by the government of the United Kingdom and Wellcome Trust, warned that rampant overuse of antibiotics and antifungal medicines in humans, livestock, and agriculture could erase much of the improvement in public 57 health achieved since the development of the first antimicrobials in the 1940s. The agreement includes $1,700,000 to fund a National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) study to examine and quantify the long-term medical and economic impacts of increasing AMR in the U.S. The review should examine progress made on the U.S. National Strategy and Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria, including domestic and international strategies employed by NIH, CDC, FDA, ASPR, USDA, and USAID. The NASEM report should make recommendations to address any gaps in research and development of therapeutics and diagnostics; efforts to move new products to market; animal and human surveillance, prevention efforts, international coordination and collaboration; and any other recommendations NASEM finds relevant to stopping the spread of AMR. The agreement directs NIAID to report on trends in AMR-related Research Project Grants, including the success rates for such grants, and requests an update on these activities in the fiscal year 2021 Congressional Justification, including an overall assessment of the progress to date of efforts to address AMR. Celiac Disease.-The agreement encourages NIH to devote sufficient, focused research to the study of celiac disease, including the autoimmune causation underpinning the affliction. The agreement urges NIAID to better coordinate existing research and focus new research efforts toward causation and, ultimately, a cure of this disease. NIAID is encouraged to coordinate with other Institutes and Centers as appropriate and to submit its plan for coordination and execution of this research to the Committees no later than 90 days after enactment of this Act. 58 Hepatitis B Virus.-The agreement urges additional targeted calls for Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) research to fund the many critical research opportunities identified by the scientific community in the Roadmap for a Cure. The agreement urges active participation and leadership by NIAID in the Director's newly established Trans-NIH Hepatitis B working group and requests that NIAID submit within 180 days of enactment of this Act, a research plan to pursue a cure for HBV in coordination with the other Institutes and Centers. HIVIAIDS.-The agreement provides an increase of no less than $25,000,000 over the fiscal year 2019 level for HIV/ AIDS research. Centers for AIDS Research.-As part of the domestic HIV initiative, the agreement includes no less than $51,000,000 for the Centers for AIDS Research. Lyme Disease and Other Tick-Borne Diseases.-The agreement encourages NIH to issue requests for grant applications for research to investigate causes of all forms and manifestations of Lyme disease and other high-consequence tick-borne diseases, including post-treatment symptoms, as well as research to develop diagnostics, preventions, and treatments for those conditions, including potential vaccine candidates. The agreement urges NIAID, in coordination with CDC, to study the long-term effects on patients suffering from post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or \"chronic Lyme disease\". Specifically, the agreement urges NIAID to evaluate the effectiveness of laboratory tests associated with the detection of Borrelia burgdorferi to diagnose the disease early, which can improve the treatment of patients suffering from Lyme disease. The agreement is also aware of promising vaccine innovations to combat Borrelia and requests a report within 90 days of enactment of this Act on agency activities to support Lyme vaccine development. The agreement also encourages NLM, in coordination with NIAID, to update its terminology in line with new research to more accurately reflect the long-term effects of Lyme disease. 59 Medical Countermeasures .-The agreement supports the continuation of NIAID's medical countermeasures program, but expects the Institute to make sure any future contractor selected for the program can refine its animal models, particularly small animal models, to support the establishment of adequate countermeasure efficacy to expedite approval by the FDA. This requires close coordination with NIAID and the adequate level of technical personnel to carry out the program's important mission. Universal Flu Vaccine.-The agreement provides not less than $200,000,000 to advance basic, translational, and clinical research to develop a universal influenza vaccine, an increase of $60,000,000. Valley Fever.-The agreement notes the recent increase in the number of Valley Fever infections in Western States and urges NIAID to prioritize research on this fungal disease. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES (NIGMS) Institutional Development Award-The agreement provides $386,573,000 for the Institutional Development Award (IDeA) program, an increase of $25,000,000. Maximizing Access to Research Careers .-The agreement recognizes the importance of the Maximizing Access to Research Careers (MARC) program and encourages the continuation and enhancement of efforts underway with our Nation's HBCUs. The agreement also encourages NIH to continue and strengthen its engagement of institutions located in rural parts of the U.S. 60 EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT (NICHD) Impact of Technology and Digital Media o_n Children and Teens.-The agreement recognizes that children's and teens' lives increasingly involve widespread technology use and consumption of digital media. The agreement encourages NIH to prioritize research into how these types of stimuli affect young people's cognitive, physical, and socio-emotional outcomes, including attention, sleeping routines, and anxiety. Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network.-The agreement fully supports the work of the Maternal Fetal Medicine Units network (MFMU) and encourages NICHD to continue to build on its success by ensuring its highly efficient structure of multi center collaborative research continues. There is particular concern that any change in the funding mechanism or structure for the MFMU could compromise the ability of the network to remain nimble and directly address the changing landscape of women's health, including to reduce health disparities . The agreement directs NICHD to submit a report to the Committees outlining any potential changes being considered to the funding mechanism or structure of the MFMU network within 90 days of enactment of this Act. Prenatal Opioid Use Disorders and Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome.-The agreement encourages NIH to coordinate with other agencies at HHS to support additional research on prevention, identification, and treatment of prenatal opioid exposure and neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), including the best methods for screening and treating pregnant women for opioid use disorder and the best methods for screening for NAS. Additionally, the agreement encourages NIH to build on the Advancing Clinical Trials in Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal study to enhance understanding of the impact of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment techniques on costs and outcomes in the short-term and longitudinally. 61 The agreement further encourages NIH to coordinate with other agencies at HHS to support research on innovative care models to optimize care and long-term outcomes for families. Research in Pregnant and Lactating Women.-The Task Force on Research Specific to Pregnant Women and Lactating Women issued a report to the Secretary of HHS outlining 15 recommendations to facilitate the inclusion of pregnant and lactating women in clinical research. The agreement commends the Secretary for extending the Task Force and believes this extension should be for at least an additional two years to continue to work towards healthcare professionals and consumers having accurate information on the safety and efficacy of drugs taken by these populations. NICHD should oversee its part of the implementation of the already released recommendations working with other relevant Institutes and Centers, CDC, and FDA. The agreement requests a progress report be provided in the fiscal year 2021 Congressional Justification. NATIONAL EYE INSTITUTE (NEI) Age-Related Macular Degeneration.-The agreement recognizes the tremendous strides in the treatment of patients with the \"dry\" form of age-related macular degeneration and commends NEI for its planned first-in-human clinical trial that would test a stem cell-based therapy from induced pluripotent stem cells. The agreement supports NEI's prospective international study of patients that uses the latest advances in retinal imaging to identify biomarkers of the disease and targets for early therapeutic interventions. 62 NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES (NIEHS) Hurricane Harvey Research.-The agreement includes $3,000,000 for the continued funding and expansion of research on the health effects of environmental exposures directly related to the consequences of Hurricane Harvey in 2017. The research should focus on the full Hurricane Harvey-affected region, conduct follow-up health research on affected populations on registrants, link to relevant government and non-profit intervention research programs, and provide critical information on disaster preparedness through data sharing and analysis. NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING (NIA) Alzheimer 's Disease and Related Dementias.-The agreement provides an increase of $350,000,000 for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias research, bringing the total funding level in fiscal year 2020 to no less than $2,818,000,000. Diversity of Clinical Trials.-The agreement remains concerned about underrepresented populations in research, particularly clinical trials for Alzheimer's. The agreement directs NIH to report to the Committees within 180 days of enactment of this Act on how it is implementing the actions outlined in the National Strategy for Recruitment and Participation in Alzheimer's and Related Dementias Clinical Research, including NIA resources that have been dedicated to these efforts. EUREKA Prize.-The agreement requests a report within 180 days of enactment of this Act on NIA's initial EUREKA prize competition, including the number of submissions received and any unexpected challenges or impediments encountered in executing the challenge, as well as lessons learned that could be applied to future Alzheimer's or other prize challenges. The agreement also requests that the report include any recommendations to enhance the model going forward. 63 NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISM (NIAAA) Mobile Assessment Technology Research for Addictive Behaviors .-The agreement encourages NIAAA to support meritorious research to improve the prevention and treatment of substance misuse, addiction, and related consequences through the use of mobile technologies. NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE (NIDA) Barriers to Research.-The agreement directs NIDA to provide a brief report on the barriers to research that result from the classification of drugs and compounds as Schedule I substances no later than 120 days after enactment of this Act. Cannabis Research.-The agreement encourages NIH to consider additional investment in studying the medicinal effects and toxicology of cannabidiol and cannabigerol.

Opioid Misuse and Addiction.-The agreement includes no less than $250,000,000 for targeted research related to opioid misuse and addiction, development of opioid alternatives, pain management, and addiction treatment. The agreement directs NIH to expand scientific activities related to research on medications used to treat and reduce chronic pain, and the transition from acute to chronic pain. Further, the agreement urges NIH to: (1) continue funding research on medication development to alleviate pain and to treat addiction, especially the development of medications with reduced misuse liability; (2) as appropriate, work with private companies to fund innovative research into such medications; (3) report on what is known regarding the transition from opioid analgesics to heroin 64 and synthetic opioid use and addiction within affected populations; ( 4) conduct pilot studies to create a comprehensive care model in communities nationwide to prevent opioid misuse, expand treatment capacity, enhance access to overdose reversal medications, and enhance prescriber practice; (5) test interventions in justice system settings to expand the uptake of medications for treating opioid use disorder (OUD) and methods to scale up these interventions for population-based impact; and (6) develop evidence-based strategies to integrate screening and treatment for OUD in emergency department and primary care settings. In addition, NIH should continue to sponsor research to better understand the effects of long-term prescription opioid use, especially as it relates to the prevention and treatment of opioid misuse and addiction. Further, the agreement notes NIDA has started to investigate the links among respiratory health, disease, and deaths from opioids to determine if addressing underlying respiratory physiology can prevent death due to respiratory failure during overdoses. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEAL TH (NlMH) Suicide Prevention and Risk Detection Algorithms.-The agreement continues to encourage NIMH to prioritize its suicide screening and prevention research efforts to produce risk detection models that are interpretable, scalable, and practical for clinical implementation, including mental and behavioral healthcare interventions, to combat suicide in the U.S. In assessing research opportunities, the agreement encourages NIMH to consider the recommendations included in the Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention's A Prioritized Research Agenda for Suicide Prevention. 65 NATIONAL HUMAN GENOME RESEARCH INSTITUTE (NHGRI) Computational Genomics and RNA Molecules.-The agreement urges NHGRI to continue to support research on RNA molecules and the mechanisms through which they affect biological processes that cause disease. Emerging Centers of Excellence in Genomic Sciences .-The agreement includes no less than $10,000,000 for a new competitively-awarded center-based grant program for Emerging Centers of Excellence. The purpose of these awards is to build capacity at institutions that are not prior or current grantees of the Centers of Excellence in Genomic Sciences program. The agreement urges NHGRI to include plans for sustainment of this capacity-building mechanism in its 2020 vision report. NATIONAL CENTER FOR COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRA TNE HEALTH (NCCIH) Pain Management.-The agreement urges NIH, along with DoD and VA, to continue to support research on non-pharmacological treatments for pain management to ensure the best quality of care for our Nation's veterans. NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON MINORITY HEALTH AND HEALTH DISPARITIES (NIMHD) Mental Health-To address the multiple causes of suicide, the agreement urges NIMHD to develop a behavioral health approach focusing on at-risk populations and building the mental health workforce at the community level. The proposed model should improve mental health care access to underserved populations, including those in rural areas, while simultaneously providing training to potential rural behavioral health providers. 66 Neuroscience Research in African-Americans.-The agreement urges the NIH Neurobiobank to work with NIMHD and relevant extramural partners to develop the infrastructure needed to accelerate the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for neuropsychiatric disorders utilizing post-mortem brain datasets from underrepresented ethnic minority groups, including African-Americans. Research Centers in Minority Jnstitutions.-The agreement includes $75,000,000 for the Research Centers in Minority Institutions (RCMI) program to support critical infrastructure development and scientific discovery in historically minority graduate and health professional schools. The agreement also recognizes the importance of the RCMI Coordinating Center in ensuring that collectively, institutions can engage in multi-site collaborative research. Research Endowment Program.-The agreement urges NIMHD to move forward with the recommendations made by the Advisory Council workgroup to restore endowment eligibility for the Research Endowment Program (REP) to the original Congressional intent, which includes both current and former centers of excellence. NIMHD is requested to report to the Committees on progress made to implement these recommendations prior to issuing its next FOA for REP. JOHN E. FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR ADV AN CED STUDY IN THE HEALTH SCIENCES (FIC) Global Infectious Diseases.-The agreement urges FIC to continue its important work of building relationships with scientists abroad to foster a stronger, more effective science workforce and health research capacity on the ground, helping to detect infectious diseases and building the capacity to confront those diseases while improving the image of the U.S. though health diplomacy in their countries. 67 NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCES (NCA TS) Clinical and Translational Science Awards.-The agreement provides $578,141,000 for Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSAs) and encourages NCATS to fund, through the existing CTSA hubs, programs to address disparities and the significant burden of diseases and other conditions that disproportionately affect minority and special populations. Accelerating this capacity will reduce the burden of disease and promote health equity. Applying the CTSA model to address long-standing regional health disparities can provide innovative, multi-disciplinary approaches to reducing the burden of disease among vulnerable populations. Cures Acceleration Network.-The agreement provides up to $60,000,000 for the Cures Acceleration Network. OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR (OD) 7ql 1.23 Duplication Syndrome.-Duplication 7 syndrome is a rare chromosomal abnormality and those affected by this chromosomal duplication are likely to experience severe behavioral and developmental disabilities requiring consistent medical treatments and therapies. NIH is strongly encouraged to expand research on rare genetic and chromosomal abnormalities such as 7 q 11.23 duplication syndrome. Adult Cellular Therapies .-The agreement encourages NIH, in coordination with FDA, to explore the feasibility and utility of an outcomes database for adult cellular therapies that are either FDA-approved or are being administered under FDA Investigational New Drug or Investigational Device Exemption protocols. All of Us Precision Medicine Initiative.-The agreement includes $500,000,000 for the All of Us precision medicine initiative. Funding provided in the 21st Century Cures Act is reduced by $37,000,000 in fiscal year 2020. Ensuring 68 sustained, consistent funding for this study is important. Therefore, the agreement has chosen to replace this reduction and increase base funding for the program. The agreement directs NIH to continue its efforts to recruit and retain participants from historically underrepresented populations in biomedical research so that the All of Us scientific resources reflect the rich diversity of our country. Further, the agreement encourages NIH to continue to work with a broad array of children's hospitals and networks to leverage their expertise and ensure greater diversity in pediatric recruitment and enrollment. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.-The agreement directs the NIH Director to facilitate further efforts involving, at a minimum, NINDS and NIA, to study Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) disease mechanisms and identify genes to facilitate the expeditious development of targeted therapies. These trans-NIH efforts shall bring together research results that will be available to academic researchers, non-profit organizations, and industry researchers, and will supplement, not supplant, existing NIH-supported activities for ALS research. The near-term research opportunity to find a cure is real for ALS. Any such breakthroughs will have significant benefits for related neurological conditions including TBI, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's. The agreement directs NIH to report to the Committees within 180 days of enactment of this Act on progress in furthering these research areas, specifically on key areas of focus for fiscal years 2020-2024. Autism.-The agreement encourages NIH to continue to aggressively invest in research on autism consistent with the objectives outlined in the Strategic Plan. The agreement also encourages NIH to support greater investment in research and collaborations focused on addressing the gaps outlined in the Strategic Plan, including studies to understand the intersection of biology, behavior, and the environment. 69 Autoimmune Conditions.-Autoimmune diseases are more common in women than in men, typically manifesting in their childbearing years. They include conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and type 1 diabetes and together affect an estimated five to seven percent of Americans. Many affected women live with a second autoimmune illness or other condition. Despite the impact of these diseases and conditions on a domestic population ranging between 15,000,000-25,000,000, there is no single office within NIH tasked with coordinating research across the agency, or examining the complex interplay among these diseases and conditions. The 2010 NASEM study on Women's Health Research identified autoimmune conditions as \"the leading cause of morbidity in women, greatly affecting quality of life.\" Despite their impact, the report found that \"little progress has been made in understanding the conditions better, in identifying the risk factors, or in developing diagnostic tools, better treatments, or cures.\" The agreement includes $1,500,000 for NIH to contract with NASEM to identify and review NIH's research efforts in this broad area of predominantly women's health. The review should explore NIH's research in autoimmune and coexisting disorders, including any barriers to such research, and the most promising areas for future research that would benefit the greatest number of patients. The review should also identify trends among the population suffering from these conditions, and any significant barriers to accurate diagnoses. Finally, the NASEM report should make recommendations for how NIH could improve and better coordinate research into these diseases and conditions, including the potential effects of establishing dedicated research entities within or external to NIH. 70 Big Data.-Despite launching its STRIDES and Data Commons initiatives, NIH has little yet to show in the area of working with data. NIH has struggled to recruit the talent to lead efforts to build an analysis platform. NIH leadership recognizes it needs additional focus on how to consolidate and deliver data to the research community in a more usable and computationally minable form, but is challenged in how to do so. Part of the problem appears to be the salary restrictions of a civil service structure that never contemplated the costs of recruiting highly sought after elite technology talent. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is directed to identify and assess the options available to NIH for securing the talent it needs to lead these efforts. GAO should consider how other agencies meet similar challenges, and whether statutory changes are necessary. The agreement also directs GAO to review how NIH funds computational talent in its grant awards and whether its funding models adequately reflect the cost of these skillsets to grantees. GAO should assess NIH's guidance for the resource-sharing plan it requires for the typical grantee, and whether these plans are sufficient and can be sustained for ongoing analysis. NIH is urged to engage industry, academic, and other Federal partners to take advantage of cross-enterprise artificial intelligence products, research, and tools. Artificial Intelligence could play a vital role toward advancing the goals of the strategic plan by organizing, managing, and making data usable to researchers, institutions, and the public to drive outcomes. Finally, the agreement includes $30,000,000 to support the Chief Data Strategist's work in fiscal year 2020, and expects NIH to provide a spending plan for these funds within 30 days of enactment of this Act. Biomedical Research Facilities.-The bill provides $50,000,000 for grants to public and/or not-for-profit entities to expand, remodel, renovate, or alter existing research facilities or construct new research facilities as authorized under 42 U.S.C. section 283k. The agreement also directs NIH to allocate no less than 25 71 percent of funding for this program to Institutions of Emerging Excellence to ensure geographic and institutional diversity. Finally, the agreement urges NIH to consider recommendations made by the NIH Working Group on Construction of Research Facilities, including making awards that are large enough to underwrite the cost of a significant portion of newly constructed or renovated facilities. Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies Initiative. \u00ad The agreement provides $500,000,000 for the BRAIN initiative, finally achieving the initial BRAIN 2025 report recommendation of $500,000,000 per year by fiscal year 2019. The agreement provides additional resources to significantly expand efforts to working with the BRAIN data. Neuroscience, and biosciences in general, need additional focus on how to consolidate and deliver data to the research community in a more usable and computationally minable form. The agreement expects to receive a report in the fiscal year 2021 Congressional Justification on the initiative's achievements in its first five years of operation and its objectives for the next five years, including NIH's plans to address the challenge of making large datasets usable. Clinical Research Professional Competency.-The agreement encourages NIH to continue considering the training needs of the clinical research workforce when determining best practices in conducting clinical trials. Clinical Trials Policy.-The agreement supports NIH's recent announcement to delay the implementation of certain registering and reporting requirements for basic experimental studies with humans. The agreement urges NIH to continue its efforts, including working with the basic research community, to achieve a \\ balanced registration and reporting strategy that meets the interests of study participants, investigators, and taxpayers. NIH is directed to report to the 72 Committees no less than 60 days prior to moving forward with any new proposals for registering basic experimental studies with humans as clinical trials. Ethnic and Racial Diversity in Cancer Development and Outcomes.-The agreement urges NIH, including NIMHD and NCI, to continue to support research on the cause, prevention, and treatment of cancer in populations with diverse cultural, racial, and ethnic composition. The agreement also encourages NCI to continue to consider an institution's research efforts that specifically address the cancer burden, risk factors, incidence, morbidity, mortality, and inequities in the geographic area it serves, when considering applications from cancer centers for NCI designation. Firearm Injury and Mortality Prevention Research.- The agreement includes $12,500,000 to conduct research on firearm injury and mortality prevention. Given violence and suicide have a number of causes, the agreement recommends the NIH take a comprehensive approach to studying these underlying causes and evidence\u00ad based methods of prevention of injury, including crime prevention. All grantees under this section will be required to fulfill requirements around open data, open code, pre-registration of research projects, and open access to research articles consistent with the National Science Foundation's open science principles. The Director of NIH is to report to the Committees within 30 days of enactment on implementation schedules and procedures for grant awards, which strive to ensure that such awards support ideologically and politically unbiased research projects. Foreign Threats to Research.-There remains concern about foreign threats to the research infrastructure in the U.S. In particular, the Chinese government has started a program to recruit NIH-funded researchers to steal intellectual property, cheat the peer-review system, establish shadow laboratories in China, and help the Chinese government obtain confidential information about NIH research grants. As the Federal Bureau of Investigation, HHS, and NIH continue to investigate the 73 impact the Thousand Talents and other foreign government programs have had on the NIH research community, the agreement directs NIH to notify the Committees quarterly on the progress of the investigation, as well as institutions, scientists, and research affected. Further, the agreement directs NIH to carefully consider the NIH Advisory Committee's recommendations, including to implement a broad education campaign about the requirement to disclose foreign sources of funding and develop enhanced cybersecurity protocols. As recommended, NIH should use this campaign to help institutions develop best practices for how to handle these challenges, including training, communications materials, and how to improve vetting, education, and security. Further, NIH shall evaluate the peer-review system and their internal controls through a lens that takes into account national security threats. This includes holding those accountable who inappropriately share information from the peer-review process or illegally share intellectual property. The agreement notes the partnership between NIH and HHS' Office of National Security (ONS) on this issue and ONS's implementation of a formal NIH CI/Insider Threat program on NIH' s behalf. The agreement believes this work should be expanded in fiscal year 2020 and directs NIH to allocate no less than $5,000,000 for this work that ONS does on behalf of NIH. Frontotemporal Degeneration Research-The agreement encourages NIH to continue to support a multi-site network of clinical centers to study genetic and sporadic cases of frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) and maintain progress toward biomarker discovery and drug development in clinical trials using these well\u00ad defined FTD cohorts. A key component of this network will be the development of a data biosphere that supports wide sharing of robust datasets, generated with powerful -omic platforms. Data sharing will enable the broader community of researchers outside of the clinical networks, particularly early career scientists, to take on the challenges currently confronting Alzheimer's disease and related 74 dementias disorders with a wider array of expertise. Research has revealed that all forms of dementia may have a variety of root causes and display multiple underlying pathologies. Research on the related dementias is critical for understanding basic disease mechanisms that may be common across multiple forms of dementia and therefore speed the translation of this information into much-needed therapeutics. While the continued support of biomedical research offers hope for the future, too many families and individuals living with dementia cannot find the help they need today. Therefore, the agreement also urges NIH to support research on the development of new and improved dementia care practices and long-term supports and services. By supporting both types of research, NIH may advance progress toward future therapies and treatments while also helping people get the appropriate and effective care and support they need today. Harassment Policies .-The NASEM report released last year found that sexual harassment is rampant in the labs and institutions supported by NIH. The Committees believe NIH must play a more active role in changing the culture that has long perpetuated the problem. The Committees direct NIH to require institutions to notify the agency when key personnel named on an NIH grant award are removed because of sexual harassment concerns and to submit to the Committees plans to implement measures that attend to harassment in extramural settings with the same level of attention and resources as those devoted to other research misconduct. The Committees also direct NIH to support research in the areas identified in the report, including the psychology underlying harassment and the experiences and outcomes of diverse groups when subjected to harassment. Additionally, the Committees direct NIH to collaborate with NASEM to develop best practices for developing more diverse and inclusive cultures in the grantee research environments, including training individuals in institutions that receive 75 NIH funds to recognize and address sexual harassment, and evaluating the efficacy of various sexual harassment training programs. Hepatitis C.-The agreement urges NIH to prioritize research aimed at supporting hepatitis C elimination.

Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC).-The agreement is concerned with the proposed elimination of key data elements from the 2019-20 CRDC that could impede efforts to identify and address inequities in educational resources and outcomes. Further, the agreement is concerned that the Department did not first review or evaluate the 2017-18 CRDC collection before proposing the elimination of these elements. As the CRDC is used to monitor and enforce equal opportunity in education, the agreement is concerned that the Department's rationale for elimination focused on reducing regulatory burden while not including a comprehensive analysis of whether eliminating certain data elements would negatively impact the ability to understand or address civil rights issues in our nation's schools. The agreement directs the Department to provide a briefing to the appropriations and authorizing Committees within 90 days of enactment of this Act on the proposed changes, how the changes reflect civil rights enforcement needs, information on the comments received on the proposal, an evaluation of the 2017-18 CRDC, and any impact on the mission and purpose of the CRDC and the Office for Civil Rights. 147 Competitions.-The agreement notes long-standing concern regarding the Department's failure to issue notices inviting applications for competitive grant competitions in a timely manner.

Disclosur es of Foreign Gifts and Contracts.-The agreement notes that section 11 7 of the HEA requires IHEs to disclose certain gifts from or contracts 148 with foreign entities and that the Department makes such information publicly available on its website. Such disclosures are critical to ensure adequate oversight and transparency. The agreement directs the Department to engage with IHEs to ensure requirements under section 117 are clear and to provide guidance to IHEs to ensure they are aware of their responsibilities. As the Department provides guidance on this issue or modifies reporting methods or requirements , IHEs should be given adequate time to ensure proper reporting. The Department should brief the Committees within 45 days of enactment of this Act on efforts to engage with the stakeholder community, efforts to provide greater guidance and clarity on reporting requirements, and any additional information on agency efforts to comply with such section. Diverse Geographical Distribution of Grants.-The Department is encouraged to continue efforts to ensure that competitive grants are distributed among eligible entities that serve geographically diverse areas, including urban, suburban, and rural areas. It is critical that support and solutions developed with Federal funding are relevant to and available in all areas consistent with authorizations of Federal programs.

Non-competitive formula grant funds have a range of evidence requirements and preferences which the Department is directed to support through enhancements to its technical assistance and support activities. Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking-Faithful execution of the Foundations for Evidence-based Policymaking Act will enhance the evidence\u00ad building capacity of Federal agencies, strengthen privacy protections, improve 149 secure access to data, and ultimately provide more and higher quality evidence to policymakers. The Department shall provide updates on its implementation of the law and plans for the coming year in its next and subsequent Congressional \\ Justifications. GAO Report on Teacher Shortages.-The agreement requests GAO provide a report to the Committees on trends and factors contributing to school districts' ' challenges with teacher recruitment and retention. The report should include a review and analysis of challenges recruiting and retaining special education teachers, paraprofessionals, and teacher aides; the extent to which licensure requirements are waived or modified to address shortages; and geographic and demographic characteristics of districts facing the greatest challenges or shortages, including rural and urban areas. The report shall examine ways to improve the effectiveness of current Federal policy in preventing and responding to teacher shortages as well as make recommendations on potential Federal interventions to improve teacher recruitment and retention. Human Resources.-The agreement is concerned about the full-time equivalent employment differences between the Department's Congressional Justifications and actual on-board staffing reports. The agreement notes an increase in the number of separations and hiring challenges at the Department. The agreement requests an update in the fiscal year 2021 Congressional Justification on the activities the Department has undertaken or will undertake to ensure adequate staffing levels are achieved for the Department to meet its obligations. The Committees request periodic updates on this effort. Seclusion and Restraint Data.-The agreement strongly urges the Assistant Secretary for the Office for Civil Rights to take immediate steps in the ongoing 2017-2018 CRDC to improve the accuracy of the data, to remind and clarify for all schools and school districts to only report zero incidents of seclusion and' restraint 150 when no incidents have occurred, to leave cells blank for missing or incomplete data, and to contact schools and school districts that already submitted data for the 2017-2018 CRDC and verify the accuracy of the data. Finally, the agreement strongly urges the Assistant Secretary to monitor compliance with action plan requirements for missing data, and ensure plans are submitted and address all missing data. The agreement requests an update on these efforts in the fiscal year 2021 Congressional Justification. GENERAL PROVISIONS The agreement continues authority for pooled evaluation authority. The agreement modifies a provision regarding endowment income. The agreement continues authority for the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity.

Commission Investment Fund.-The agreement includes no less than $8,500,000. Fixed Amount Grants .-CNCS is encouraged to expand opportunities for AmeriCorps programs to utilize fixed amount grants, which could reduce unnecessary administrative burdens on current and potential AmeriCorps programs. Further, CNCS is encouraged to increase the current maximum cost per member service year of fixed amount grants to make it more comparable to cost reimbursement grant levels and allow new AmeriCorps programs to be eligible to apply for full-time fixed amount grants, while also ensuring that fixed amount grantees provide a comparable amount of matching funds and that there is sufficient oversight and accountability of fixed amount grantees. Professional Corps .-CNCS is directed to include a determination of need by the local community among the factors that a professional corps program may use to demonstrate an inadequate number of professionals in a community. Further, 152 CNCS is strongly encouraged to increase the maximum amount of operating funds per member service year a professional corps program may request as part of their grant application. Finally, CNCS is directed to provide professional corps programs flexibility in justifying the need for operating funds to ensure that these programs are able to provide high-quality services in all communities. Transformation and Sustainability Plan.-There is concern with CNCS' transformation and sustainability plan (TSP), particularly related to moving from a State office to regional office structure. CNCS is directed to ensure that TSP does not create degradation in services, technical assistance, or support for local community service programs, particularly those operating in under-served and rural areas, and to provide periodic briefings to the Committees on steps taken to ensure that service is maintained. Further, the CNCS is directed to provide a report within 30 days of enactment of this Act to the Committees. Such report should contain information on the metrics used and factors considered in determining the new regions and the location of regional offices; a complete analysis of all costs and savings associated with the transition to regional offices, including any increased travel or training costs; a description of other field structures considered; and a detailed response to each of the risk factors identified by the OIG. Finally, CNCS is encouraged to evaluate and consider adding additional regional offices as appropriate if it is determined that offices would enhance support for local community service programs. 153 CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING (CPB) The bill removes unnecessary language related to the Television Future Fund as no such fund exists. All operation of the Television Future Fund ceased after a 2004 GAO report titled \"Issues Related to Federal Funding for Public Television by the Corporation/or Public Broadcasting\" (GA0-04-284) determined activities were done in an unauthorized manner. The agreement expects CPB to fully comply with all statutory requirements for the allocation and distribution of appropriated funds. INSTITUT E OF MUSEUM AND LIBRARY SERVICES Within the total for the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the agreement includes funds for the following activities: Budget Activity Library Services Technology Act: Grants to States ............................ ................... . Native ....................... . Century Librarian .................

The agreement directs HHS to take no regulatory action on availability of NEMT service until the study is completed. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD (NLRB) The agreement notes concern regarding NLRB personnel and obligation practices. Such practices have contributed to significant underspending on personnel costs. As a result of these practices, NLRB has had higher than historical funding lapses for the past two fiscal years. The October 2019 Inspector General \"Top Management and Pe,formance Challenges\" memorandum included in NLRB fiscal year 2019 Performance and Accountability Report identifies NLRB' s current 155 methodology for determining the workforce capacity needed to process cases as a key challenge to the Board's ability to ensure the quality of its investigative work product and maintain a highly motivated workforce. The agreement directs NLRB to address this challenge by posting position openings to restore critical field staff capacity and to more aggressively fill vacancies in fiscal year 2020, including the remaining open regional director positions. To ensure NLRB makes progress toward addressing this issue, the agreement directs the Board to expand the number of regional full-time equivalent staff beyond the amount on-board at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. Within 90 days of enactment of this Act, NLRB is directed to brief the Committees on its plans for addressing these critical hiring challenges. Further, NLRB is directed to submit a report to the Committees within 90 days of enactment of this Act detailing the resources dedicated to regional offices. Such report should include actual and planned data, as applicable, for fiscal years 2011 through 2021 : ( 1) the number of employees stationed in each regional office and (2) administrative expenses by object class for each regional office. In addition, the agreement directs the Board to provide monthly staffing reports to the Committees. Such staffing reports should include the total number of employees in each position for each regional office, attrition for each office, new hires for each office, and any information on plans to incentivize or encourage employee separations. 156 RAILROAD RETIREM ENT BOARD LIMITATION ON ADMINISTRATION The agreement includes $10,000,000 for the implementation of information technology systems modernization efforts. GAO Review.-The agreement requests GAO conduct a management review of the Railroad Retirement Board, including, financial management practices, regional office structure and workforce planning needs, oversight of programs, and any other matters GAO considers relevant. SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION (SSA) LfMITATION ON ADMINISTRATIV E EXPENSES The agreement includes an increase of $100,000,000 for SSA's base administrative expenses for additional hires and resources to improve public service at SSA field offices and direct service operations. Continuing Disability Reviews.-The agreement directs SSA to include in its next continuing disability review (CDR) report to Congress an evaluation of its CDR prioritization models and a cost-benefit analysis of how it uses estimated savings in determining which beneficiaries receive a full-medical CDR. Additionally, the agreement requests in the fiscal year 2021 Congressional Justification, the process by which SSA intends to pace its CDR workload to properly manage Limitation on Administrative Expenses funding. Disability Case Processing System (DCPS).-SSA is encouraged to engage with States to explore all possible options for modernization of the case processing system, to align with the needs of each State, so long as such options have similar or better functionality as DCPS, similar or lower costs to DCPS, and are consistent with Federal procurement and security standards. SSA should continue to provide regular updates on the effort to upgrade DCPS, including the cost and anticipated 157 timeline of the project, and efforts by SSA to engage stakeholders , including any barriers to implementation. Disability Hearings Backlog-The agreement encourages SSA to include comprehensive information in its existing reports to Congress on the specific policies SSA has implemented, or has considered, to streamline the disability determination and adjudication process. When considering or implementing changes, SSA should ensure due process, and that applicants have a full and adequate opportunity to present their claims. Field Office Closures.-While SSA's Inspector General reviews decisions to close field offices, the Commissioner is strongly encouraged to take every action possible to maintain operations at the offices under review. SSA is expected to support front line operations. As part of the fiscal year 2021 Congressional Justification, SSA should include a plan to identify opportunities for improved field office operations. Finally, SSA is strongly encouraged to ensure its policies and procedures for closing field offices include at least 120 days advance notice to the public, SSA employees, Congress, and other stakeholders . Such notice should include a rationale for the proposed closure and an evaluation of the effects on the public and SSA operations. Mail and Printing Systems.-SSA is encouraged to consider and evaluate modernization of its mail and printing systems and contracts that could result in budgetary savings while improving fraud prevention. The agreement requests a briefing for the Committees within 180 days of enactment of this Act on current mailing and printing systems and contracts, including systems or contracts relating to Social Security Cards, and any ongoing efforts to modernize or otherwise improve such systems. 158 Medical Vocational Guidelines.-The agreement directs SSA to provide a report to the Committees within 90 days of enactment of this Act on its plan and timetable for updating and modernizing medical vocational guidelines and to engage appropriate Committees of jurisdiction prior to making any changes to such guidelines. Telework.-SSA is urged to develop a telework plan for Operations employees as quickly as practicable and to brief the Committees on the status of efforts to reinstate telework within 60 days of enactment of this Act. Video Hearings.-The agreement reiterates the language included under this heading in House Report 116-62, and directs SSA to provide an update in the fiscal year 2021 Congressional Justification detailing the extent to which SSA meets best practices outlined by the Administrative Conference of the U.S., and the extent to which SSA video hearings, policies, and practices are accessible to individuals with disabilities. Work Incentives Planning and Assistance (WIPA) and Protection and Advocacy for Beneficiaries of Social Security (PABSS).-The agreement includes $23,000,000 for WIPA and $7,000,000 for PABSS. 159 TITLE V GENERAL PROVISIONS The agreement modifies a provision related to reports on non-competitive contracts, grants and cooperative agreements. The agreement modifies a provision related to Performance Partnerships. The agreement includes a new provision related to grant notifications. The agreement includes a new provision related to questions for the record.
