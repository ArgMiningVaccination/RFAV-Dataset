They will not need to serve a quarantine or stay-home-notice (SHN) as long as they test negative and will be free to travel around both countries. That said, all VTL travellers will still need to meet all the relevant eligibility criteria and must follow all border control measures and public health requirements that each country has imposed. Singapore and South Korea have also agreed to mutually recognise each other's Covid-19 vaccination certificates from November 15 to facilitate the VTL. This means that fully vaccinated travellers can enjoy the vaccination-differentiated safe management measures in both countries no matter if they received their vaccination in Singapore or South Korea. The VTL agreement was marked with a video conference on October 8 between Singapore's Minister for Transport, S Iswaran and the Minister of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of South Korea, Noh Hyeong Ouk. \"The jointly launched VTLs will be the first of its kind between two major aviation hubs in Asia and build on these longstanding relations to safely revive cross-border air travel and people-to-people flows,\" said MOT.
