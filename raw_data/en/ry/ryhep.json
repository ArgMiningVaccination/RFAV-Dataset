But I love Anthony William a.k.a. The Medical Medium's books, particularly The Liver Rescue (links at the bottom of this page) and I love that he is challenging mainstream beliefs about [healing chronic skin conditions](https://healrosaceanaturally.com/). So I wanted to try the so-called \"Medical Protocol\" (even though he's adamant on not calling it a protocol, it kind of is...) and to give celery juice a try in the hopes it would help clear rosacea. To read my story healing rosacea, [click here.](https://healrosaceanaturally.com/about-my-journey-healing-rosacea/) My intention with this post is to give you as many details as possible about my experience drinking celery juice for (almost) 30 days, share practical tips should you want to start juicing celery to clear acne or another skin condition, and what ultimately came out of my 30-day celery juice challenge. My goal My goal in doing the 30-day celery juice challenge was specifically to see if it would have an impact on my rosacea. I had read about the many benefits of celery juice and its healing powers for skin conditions such as acne, eczema, psoriasis, rosacea or perioral dermatitis and I wanted in on the miracle cure! If you're someone who struggles with one or several of these skin conditions, I'm hoping that this blog post will help you set your expectations, shed some light on the celery juice craze, and help you avoid the pitfalls.

Key points in this blog post Key points of this blog post: Why I did the challenge My goals My expectations What is a 30-day Medical Medium Celery Juice Challenge The unexpected skin crisis How to juice celery The juicer I'm currently using Juicers I recommend Tips for juicing celery Research on the benefits of celery juice Final takeaways Why I wanted to do a 30-day Medical Medium Celery Juice Challenge At the end of 2018, after making only a little progress with my skin \u2014 even though I'd been on my journey to glow to heal rosacea for almost 2 years \u2014 I decided it was time to try something new. For most of Fall 2018, I was also feeling very low in energy, frequently experienced brain fog and energy crashes midday. I felt like I was dragging my ass around, and I certainly didn't have enough energy to exercise. I felt out of shape and lethargic. My Yoga Jeans fit real tight. I'm usually a very upbeat and energetic person, so this lack of energy was getting to me. My schedule was busy and I knew that, if I was going to achieve my bigger goals faster, something had to change. I needed energy, clarity of mind and quality sleep. I wanted to regain optimal health, start exercising again and wanted to see improvement with my skin! To be clear, ever since starting my journey to glow in January 2017, I'd seen consistent progress with my rosacea. If I was to quantify it, I'd say that my skin had improved by 30% to 40%. Since there was still improvement to be made, I thought, why not start the year with a detox and a 30-day Medical Medium celery juice challenge! Physical symptoms before the 30-day Medical Medium celery juice challenge Here's a summary of the physical symptoms I was experiencing before the 30-day Medical Medium celery juice challenge: Low energy Not feeling rejuvenated at waking Waking up in the middle of the night and having a hard time going back to sleep Mid-afternoon brain fog Mid-afternoon energy crash Mild inflammation on my cheeks (this is where most of my rosacea is) Very few breakouts thanks to changing my skincare and adding my essential oil Weight: around 139 pounds Yoga Jeans (size 30) fit super tight I was still drinking alcohol regularly right up until January 1st (read about [why I stopped drinking alcohol for a whole year](https://journeytoglow.com/why-i-stopped-drinking-alcohol/)), so my sleep was not the best as I would often wake up in the middle of the night and wake up tired in the morning, even with only one glass of wine. (!!) Can celery juice really help clear your skin? (Setting the right expectations) The Medical Medium books had been on my radar thanks to a Goop article, but I'd never had any interest until [Liver Rescue](https://amzn.to/2LFcA8m) came out. I guess it was because of the subtitle of the book: \"Answers to Eczema, Psoriasis, Diabetes, Strep, Acne, Gout, Adrenal Stress, Fatigue, Fatty Liver, Weight Issues, SIBO & Autoimmune Disease.\" Those were topics I was eager to dive into. He doesn't cover rosacea in-depth in the book, but he points to the probable cause in the acne chapter: heavy metals and pathogens in the liver causing dermatoxins. I also suspected that learning about the liver-skin connection would help me piece more of the puzzle together about my overall health and rosacea. Plus, everyone seemed to be talking about the gut-skin connection, but what about the liver?! I was eager to learn more. With all the hype about celery juice, setting the right expectations was key for me. I'm not someone who buys into the hype, and I like to dig deep into new information and do my own research. If you follow the Medical Medium on social media, you'll see thousands of posts from people who claim miraculous results from drinking celery juice, but I suspect there were more than one factor that can be attributed to their healing, such as diet and lifestyle changes. I've interviewed 2 women who are currently following the Medical Medium \"protocol\" (Anthony William says that there are no protocols to follow, but he does make clear diet and supplemental recommendations in his book Liver Rescue) and what looks like a \"miracle\" is really months (sometimes years) sticking to a clean diet and consistent support of liver detoxification. You can listen to my conversation with [Janelle Cepero](https://journeytoglow.com/heal-cystic-acne-medical-medium-janelle-cepero/) and with [Jacqueline Gibbs](https://journeytoglow.com/healing-acne-medical-medium-protocol/). Both women healed acne following the Medical Medium principles, are avid celery juice drinkers, and are both on very different journeys healing acne and getting different results. Liver Rescue by Anthony William The Medical Medium In [Liver Rescue](https://amzn.to/2LFcA8m), the Medical Medium explains that one of the main causes for persistent skin conditions such as acne, rosacea, eczema or psoriasis can be found in the liver. Specifically, pathogens and viruses (often EBV) feed on heavy metals in the liver, which then release dermatoxins. Dermatoxins are toxic to our skin, hence the reaction in the form of acne, rosacea, eczema or psoriasis. This made sense to me since I had tested for heavy metals through a functional testing lab, and we found heavy metals in my blood. If you have heavy metals in your blood, you can be damn sure that you also have heavy metals in your liver. In this case, your liver is working really hard to get rid of them, but it has to do so safely to not overwhelm the system. So, I was definitely interested in learning how to detoxify the liver of heavy metals, and I was so excited to learn the cause of my skin conditions! Whether you believe in a Medical Medium or not \u2014 I was pretty skeptical myself\u2014 I just thought: \"Finally! Clues that point to something tangible!\" Getting my mercury fillings removed *Side note here, but I really wanted to share because this has been hugely impactful on my journey to glow and would not have come about without Liver Rescue... When I decided to jump head-on and do a 30-day Medical Medium celery juice challenge to possibly clear rosacea and learned about heavy metals creating dermatoxins, I was acutely aware that I had four very old amalgams that were way overdue to be removed. Amalgams are made mostly of mercury, and they leak into your mouth and body over time. In March 2019, even though going to the dentist is my least favorite thing in the world, I booked 4 different appointments to get all of my mercury fillings removed. I chose a local holistic dentist that came highly recommended, and, honestly, this is one of the best things I've done for my health and my skin. I can definitely say that getting rid of my mercury fillings is one of the most crucial things I've done so far to move the needle on my rosacea. Watch the video below to learn more about the 5 Changes I Made That Impacted My Rosacea. If you didn't know about the correlation between mercury fillings and skin conditions, I'm not surprised. Traditional dentistry and allopathic medicine don't acknowledge the link between amalgam fillings and skin conditions (or any disease connected to toxic heavy metals in the body). If you're interested, check out Nadine Artemis' book [Renegade Beauty](https://amzn.to/2MazFil) and [Holistic Dental Care](https://amzn.to/2SA5xyd), or talk to a functional medicine practitioner. It is well known in the field of functional medicine that heavy metals (and amalgams) can be detrimental to your health. The benefits of celery juice These claims are mostly from Anthony William, but I'm also linking other articles that claim similar benefits. There's no doubt that more research could be done on the benefits of celery juice. but. in the meantime, experiential evidence from thousands of celery juice drinkers will have to suffice. 1. Promotes hydrochloric acid production Hydrochloric acid is critical to digestion and keeps your digestive system alkaline. Hydrochloric acid helps your body break down, digest, and absorb nutrients such as protein. It also eliminates bacteria and viruses in the stomach, protecting your body from infection. If hydrochloric acid levels are out of balance or low, our food won't be sufficiently digested in the stomach, which means it won't break down enough for the cells to access the nutrients. Instead, it'll just sit there and rot, causing bad acids to develop. The mineral salts found in celery juice increase the production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach. These powerful mineral salts are actually poisonous to bacteria while restoring your hydrochloric acid. The mineral salts found in celery juice are said to be able to destroy SIBO, kill off any variety of strep, and enhance the immune system. In his book Liver Rescue, Anthony William dives deeper into the connection between SIBO and low hydrochloric acid. It's fascinating and worth a read. I've also heard mentioned in several podcasts that there's a link between rosacea and SIBO and between rosacea and low hydrochloric acid, which has to do with \u2014 again \u2014 getting rid of pathogens in the liver and an overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine. Holistic Nutritionist and Medicine Woman Muneeza Ahmed talks about the link between SIBO and rosacea in [episode #20](https://journeytoglow.com/medical-medium-protocol-acne-muneeza-ahmed/) of the Journey To Glow podcast. We also dive into this topic with Nimisha Gandhi in [episode #2](https://journeytoglow.com/gut-skin-connection-nimisha-gandhi/). 2. Kills the streptococcus bacteria that causes acne According to the Medical Medium, Anthony William, the undiscovered sodium cluster salts found in celery act as an antiseptic and expose and destroy strep bacteria. Strep bacteria, along with a slew of other pathogens feeding on heavy metals, can wreak havoc in the liver. Celery juice helps detoxify and strengthen the liver, so strep doesn't find it to be such a comfy place to hang out. Celery juice also strengthens the immune system, so it can help kill off the strep and help prevent it from becoming acne in the future. We talk in detail about this topic with my guest [Janelle Cepero in episode #8](https://journeytoglow.com/heal-cystic-acne-medical-medium-janelle-cepero/). I loved my conversation with Janelle because she details her entire journey healing acne and how the Medical Medium protocol and celery juice have helped heal her skin. This conversation is honest, and I want to say that, although celery juice can sound miraculous, it does take time. Janelle's journey to glow is ongoing, but she saw results after 6 months. If you're reading this and you're thinking, \"6 MONTHS!!!\", know that everyone's healing journey is different! Some heal faster, and others, like Jacqueline [(see episode #16)](https://journeytoglow.com/healing-acne-medical-medium-protocol/), take 2 years. 3. Fights autoimmune disease Pathogens are the true cause of the inflammation that \u2014 according to William \u2014 is mistakenly considered autoimmune. Celery juice's sodium cluster salts break down & flush out these pathogens. The fewer of these pathogens you have, the better your liver functions, and we know that, ultimately, a healthy liver (and gut) leads to clear skin. 4. Helps restore adrenals Celery juice contains a large amount of potassium, between 500 and 600mg per 8 oz depending on the size of stalks juiced. Individuals who have adrenal issues often have a mineral deficiency, so, by adding celery juice to your diet, you're adding a lot of good minerals that can support your adrenals. 5. Neutralizes & flushes toxins out of the liver Celery juice's sodium cluster salts bind onto neurotoxins, dermatoxins, & other viral waste and draw them out of the liver. But celery juice alone is not enough. You want to eliminate heavy metal contaminants and also include other powerful detoxifying herbs such as cilantro and incorporate the heavy metal detox smoothie in your diet. 6. Calms inflammation If you look up #celeryjuice on Instagram, you'll read many stories of drastic skin transformations. I'm talking about eczema, acne and psoriasis... GONE. Photos showing before and after of people having completely healed not only their skin but also life-threatening illnesses. As I mentioned before, there are several chapters diving into the culprits that cause these persistent skin conditions and why celery juice can help heal acne, eczema, psoriasis and other weird (and annoying) skin conditions. But one of the main factors is that celery juice has incredible anti-inflammatory properties thanks to its phytochemicals and antioxidants associated with reducing inflammation. Celery juice is also incredibly hydrating and rich in minerals, and it contains a substantial amount of flavonoids, which impact inflammation in the body. So, starting the day with celery juice instead of coffee is not a bad idea as it will help you hydrate, thanks to the sodium and cluster salts found in celery juice. 7. Detoxifies the liver From a Traditional Chinese Medicine perspective, when supporting the liver (which energetically has the tendency to run hot and produce symptoms of anger and frustration), you'll want to consume lots of green vegetables, which (for the most part) are cooling. Celery is both cooling and hydrating, a win win for often dry, sensitive, rosacea-prone skin. Preparing & starting the 30-day celery juice challenge After diving into Liver Rescue and reading about the benefits of celery juice, I was intrigued and willing to incorporate it in a cleanse. I started mentally preparing for the detox at the end of December 2018, cleaning my pantry of unhealthy foods and cutting down on wine and coffee. On January 1st, 2019, I was ready to start a 30-day cleanse incorporating celery juice every morning and some of the principles taught in the Liver Rescue book. Although this was not my first detox, it was my first time drinking celery juice every morning for 30 days straight. The cleanse (Foods I removed from my diet for 30 days) As I shared before, this was not my first cleanse, so I had a pretty good idea of what I was getting into. There can be severe withdrawal symptoms when we do a cleanse, so being prepared, understanding what is happening to the body and carving out time for self care are key. Food to cut out during a cleanse: Alcohol Dairy Gluten Most meats Eggs (according to Anthony William, eggs feed the streptococcus bacteria, so eliminating them is crucial) Most sugars All things white: white rice, white flour (even gluten-free), bread, crackers Some people choose to cut all grains; I like a little quinoa or brown rice once in a while. The rule is usually to have on your plate 70 to 80% raw organic veggies and 20 to 30% protein. A note on coffee: Usually, you should cut out coffee during a cleanse, but, because I had decided to do a 30-day alcohol-free challenge (which turned into a 365-day alcohol-free challenge!), I allowed myself one dairy-free latte in the morning. [(Read my article on why I decided to stop drinking alcohol for a whole year.)](https://journeytoglow.com/why-i-stopped-drinking-alcohol/) I ate mostly plant-based but not all raw since the cleanse was in January and I needed warm food to sustain me. Here's what a day on a cleanse looks like: Morning 8 oz of celery juice on an empty stomach Wait one hour Breakfast Coffee with non-dairy milk (I make my own almond-cashew milk) Orange smoothie (mangos, peaches, almond milk, coconut yogurt, dates) Chia bowl with organic berries Morning snack Apple sprinkled with cinnamon and almonds Lunch Colorful salad with chickpeas or chicken Afternoon snack Green juice or green smoothie Or coconut yogurt with berries and homemade granola Dinner Organic salmon with a tonne of organic vegetables, maybe a bit of quinoa or brown rice Evening snack Homemade granola bar *Everything organic, always.

The difference between eating celery & drinking celery juice First, let's talk about the difference between eating celery and drinking celery juice. Eating celery stalks, while very healthy and important, is not the same as drinking pure celery juice. When celery is juiced, the pulp (fiber) is removed, and its healing benefits become much more powerful, especially for someone with chronic illness. You'll also be able to consume far more celery as juice than you would by eating it. How to make celery juice If you're new to the celery juice craze, here's how it goes: First, you'll need a bunch of fresh organic celery. Why organic? Because you don't want to be juicing pesticides; that would be counterproductive, wouldn't it? One bunch makes about 16 oz, and you're supposed to work your way up to 32 oz a day. (I couldn't do it.) Depending on the season or where you live, finding organic celery can be tricky and pricey. Here in Quebec, Canada, in winter, an organic celery bunch costs anywhere between $2.50 and $4. I'd buy enough for the week (which literally filled \u00bc of my refrigerator!), so you're looking at $17.50 to $24 for your weekly dose of celery juice. Finding enough organic celery for the week can also be a challenge, so you may have to shop around. Ideally, you'd want fresh, organic, locally grown celery, but that just isn't possible in Quebec in the winter. Second, you want to juice your celery, not blend it. Sure, there are many people who'll tell you that you can blend it and strain it, but it just doesn't have the same benefit as a proper masticating juicer. Once you've juiced your celery, you'll want to strain it to remove the fibers, which will make it much easier to drink, quite frankly! Third, drink immediately on an empty stomach. (I personally didn't like the taste, so I'd drink it in one shot!) Tips to make celery juice: - Use organic celery only - Buy your celery for the week to save trips to the grocery store - Juice the morning of - Cut the leaves; it'll taste less bitter - One bunch makes about 16 oz, which is the quantity you need to start with - Strain to remove the fibers - Don't add water or ice for the greatest healing benefits; use only celery - Drink immediately on an empty stomach - Wait one hour before eating anything else (celery juice is very filling anyway!) What happened during the celery juice challenge Day 1 I didn't experience much of the usual detox symptoms \u2014 headaches, fatigue and extreme brain fog \u2014 probably because I'd slowly started cutting out sugar, gluten and alcohol a few weeks prior to starting the cleanse. I think the celery juice definitely helped banish these symptoms as well, since it's such a powerful detoxifier. Day 2 By day 3, I started to feel the benefits of celery juice and the cleanse by way of more energy, no crash mid-afternoon and less brain fog, which was awesome. Day 4 MY SKIN STARTED TO BREAK OUT LIKE NEVER BEFORE. And I mean SERIOUS breakout. It was insane. (Insert shocked emoji here!!!) My forehead broke out in a series of red acne-like pimples \u2014 I never break out on my forehead, and I've never had acne. Eczema or psoriasis? I couldn't tell the difference) started to appear on my cheeks, forehead and near my mouth. The last time I had psoriasis, I was 12 years old, so this was a bit of a shock, to say the least. People with skin conditions tend to break out during a cleanse because, well, they're cleansing the body of toxins, and they're coming out through the skin. But this was much worse than I had ever experienced before. But I was determined to see this celery juice cleanse through, and I thought the more I purged these toxins, the happier my liver will be. Day 5 to 20 At some point, the breakouts stopped, but the patches of eczema (psoriasis?) on my face were still extremely itchy and were not fading, they seemed constantly \"inflamed\" even though I was eating a non-inflammatory, alkaline diet . I now have a renewed sympathy for glowgetters who struggle with eczema and psoriasis on a daily basis. The itchiness can drive you crazy! Thank goodness for Calendula balms; they saved my life. I bought 4 different kinds of balms and left them all over my house so I could have them when an itching attack hit! Day 25 My skin wasn't healing at this point, and I just had to come to the conclusion that the celery juice was doing more harm than good. So I decided to stop the celery juice on day 25 of the challenge and give my skin a break even though the general advice from Medical Medium die-hard fans online is to \"KEEP GOING, don't stop!\" The eczema/psoriasis calmed immediately and my skin cleared up within a few days of stopping the celery juice. Celery juice side effects 1. On your digestion If it's your first time drinking celery juice, be prepared to RUN to the bathroom in the first few days. Celery juice will CLEANSE your intestines, my friend! Plan your juice consumption accordingly! 2. On your skin As you can see, it is possible to have a strong skin reaction to celery juice. From the comments I'm getting on my [celery juice post on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BzTHEWwnna4/) and from my research, I can see that many people have similar reactions to drinking celery juice. My skin's reaction to the celery juice cleanse *Side note here to put this skin crisis into a deeper context Prior to starting the 30-day Medical Medium celery juice challenge, my skin was pretty good. I had mild rosacea on my cheeks, but I didn't have the usual persistent breakouts I used to struggle with for years. (I attribute clearing those breakouts [to the specific essential oils I'm using in my serums](https://shop.journeytoglow.com/) and the heavy metal detoxification + supplements I had started taking on my naturopath's recommendation.) So, when my skin broke out into all-of-the-things, I thought this was part of the detox and that it would go away in a few days, max a week. It did not. I've done many cleanses before and never had such intense skin reactions, so I do attribute my skin freaking out to the detoxifying effects of celery juice on the liver and detoxing too fast. My extreme reaction doesn't mean you shouldn't drink celery juice or that you'll have a similar reaction to it. Everybody will react differently to a cleanse as there are so many factors that come into play such as your level of toxicity (heavy metals in your liver), and your body's capacity to detox and flush out toxins... Why I think my skin broke out so badly while drinking celery juice I talked about why our skin can react when drinking celery juice in [my interview with Muneeza Ahmed](https://journeytoglow.com/medical-medium-protocol-acne-muneeza-ahmed/). This is actually a question I get a lot from the Journey To Glow community [on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/lovemyjourneytoglow/), so it was important for me to address this with Muneeza who has been teaching the Medical Medium principles in her practice. To sum up Muneeza's answer on why our skin can react to celery juice: There are many factors influencing our capacity to detox: if our liver is in good shape, the amount of heavy metals are in the liver, if we're detoxifying too quickly... Personally, I think I shocked my body by doing this detox AND introducing celery juice on top of it. In Liver Rescue, William shares that a detox is actually hard on the liver and body. This was also mentioned by my guest [Maggie Berghoff in episode #3](https://journeytoglow.com/3) where she shares the proper steps to prepare our body for a detox. She always advises clients to nourish first (this can be over a period of 3 months) and then detox. I also think that I was detoxing on a much deeper level as I was about to make the decision to quit alcohol for a whole year and maybe even forever, breaking free of old patterns and stepping into a new phase of my life. FREE MASTERCLASS Get FREE access to a 30-minute masterclass where you'll explore 9 misconceptions about rosacea and how to create momentum on your healing journey. Self care to support detoxification Exercise Exercise helps with the detoxification process, so I made sure to sweat by way of movement every day. Exercise pushes the blood to circulate more efficiently through the body, allowing nutrients to easily reach our organs and muscles. At the same time, exercise helps lymph fluids circulate through the body, which helps remove toxins. One of the most well-documented reactions that take place during and after a workout is the production of endorphins. These non-addictive, feel-good molecules are polypeptides that bind with neurotransmitters in the brain to reduce pain symptoms. The human body produces at least 20 types of endorphins, which benefit the body in myriad ways. Besides relieving pain, endorphins help reduce stress, boost immunity, slow the aging process and create a sense of euphoria. So many women DM me saying that they won't exercise anymore because it makes their rosacea worse. Exercise is so important to clear stuck energy in the body and mind! Don't stop moving, sweating, and living your life because you have rosacea! Moving the energy in your body and clearing your mind will sustain you on your journey to glow! Saunas I know that a lot of experts say to avoid saunas when you have rosacea, but I tend to disagree with that. Saunas are detoxifying and relaxing. Since stress is one of the major culprits behind hormonal imbalance and poor health in general, I find that a sauna's benefits far outweigh the temporary redness on my cheeks. Plus, the detoxifying effects of saunas help clear out toxins, and my skin looks much clearer and brighter the next day. So personally, yeah, huge fan of saunas, and I'm grateful to have one in my home. Relaxing baths A relaxing bath with a few drops of essential oils mixed with a cup of Epsom salts will do wonders for your mind, body and soul. And yes, it'll help support the detoxification process. I like my baths really hot, but again, I'm ok with my skin being a little more red from the heat for a few hours. The benefits of a hot bath, feeling relaxed and a deep regenerative sleep does wonders for my skin and well-being in the long run. *I'm writing a full blog post on [busting the myths about the dos and don'ts when you have rosacea](https://healrosaceanaturally.com/9-misconceptions-free-masterclass/) as I'm so sick of the generic advice thrown around on the internet.

Recommended books Physical symptoms after the 30-day celery juice challenge Changes I saw after drinking celery juice: - The mid-afternoon brain fog was gone - I had more sustained energy throughout the day (no more mid-afternoon energy crash with my bed calling me to take a nap) - Better digestion - Feeling less bloated in general, but that's not just the celery juice; cutting all the \"whites\", most grains, and gluten will make you feel immediately less bloated - Lost 5 pounds (I fit into my yoga jeans again!) - My skin was overall clearer, especially once I stopped the celery juice, which seemed to be really aggravating the eczema/psoriasis - My skin seemed more hydrated, and I had fewer breakouts in my cheeks which is where rosacea is for me What didn't change or improve - My rosacea did not improve enough for me to really say celery juice helped, but my skin was overall more bright and luminous - The reaction from the celery juice was so bad for the whole month that now, I had acne scars on my forehead and dark patches caused by the eczema/psoriasis which is annoying as scars can take a long time to heal :/ My skin now (June 2019) Conclusion Although the benefits of the celery juice were in large part positive, I just couldn't reconcile the fact that my skin had reacted so badly. After speaking to so many Journey To Glow [Skin Healing Experts](https://healrosaceanaturally.com/), I'm coming to the conclusion that it would have been much smarter to start more slowly rather than jumping in, to start by nourishing the body, then slowly moving into the detox phase and then incorporating celery juice when my body was ready.
