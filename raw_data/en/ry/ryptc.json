Kimberly S. Coyner, DVM, Diplomate ACVD This is the second article in a 3-part series discussing the latest information available regarding canine pyoderma. The first article, Challenges & New Developments in Canine Pyoderma: Disease Overview & Diagnosis, can be found [here](https://todaysveterinarypractice.com/challenges-new-developments-in-canine-pyoderma-disease-overview-diagnosis/). As discussed in Part 1 of this series (Disease Overview & Diagnosis), canine pyoderma can be classified by depth of infection as: - Superficial or surface pyoderma - Deep pyoderma. Treatment decisions for canine recurrent pyoderma include consideration of the: - Distribution of lesions (localized versus generalized) - Underlying cause of recurrent infections. TREATMENT OPTIONS The classifications above help determine the treatment regimen for each case of pyoderma: - Very superficial or localized cases of canine pyoderma may be treated with topical antibacterial medications alone (Table 1). - Generalized or deep cases are usually best treated with a combination of oral antibiotics and topical antibacterial therapies (Table 2). - In very pruritic patients, a short (1\u20142 week) course of oral anti-inflammatory doses of prednisone may be helpful; however, antibiotics should always be continued beyond steroid discontinuation. Long-acting, injectable steroids should never be used in cases of canine pyoderma, as they will make healing difficult to assess, impair immune response to infection, and potentially have a harmful effect on the hypothalamic\u2014pituitary\u2014adrenal (HPA) axis. - In recurrent cases of canine pyoderma it is essential to identify and treat the underlying cause. Depending on clinical presentation, age of onset, seasonality, and other clinical signs, this may include: - Stringent flea control - Deep scrapings for Demodex - Trial treatment for scabies - Hypoallergenic diet trial - Intradermal allergy testing and desensitization - Laboratory analysis to identify endocrinopathies - Skin biopsy for keratinization disorders. TOPICAL THERAPY Localized or Superficial Infection For localized areas of infection, topical antimicrobial ointments or creams containing 2% mupirocin or silver sulfadiazine applied twice daily can be very helpful. - Although helpful in some cases for short-term therapy, sprays and ointments that contain combinations of steroids and antibiotics are NOT recommended for long-term use due to potential for cutaneous atrophy (Figures 1 and 2). - Neomycin has more potential for allergic sensitization compared to other topical antibiotics, and susceptibility is variable for gram-negative organisms. - Polymyxin B and bacitracin in combination may be effective for both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms; however, they are rapidly inactivated by organic debris, including pus, and do not penetrate well.1 Generalized or Deep Infection Unless skin infection is very mild or shampoo therapy is done every 1 to 2 days, topical therapy alone is unlikely to resolve a more generalized or severe pyoderma, but it can be very helpful in abbreviating infection when used in combination with systemic antibiotics. - Most clinicians prefer chlorhexidine products as first-line therapy. - Antibacterial shampoos need contact with the skin for 5 to 15 minutes to provide the desired therapeutic effect (label recommendations should be followed and clients should receive specific instructions on use). - In dogs with deep pyoderma or heavily crusted lesions, clipping of lesions or whirlpool therapy may be beneficial. Shampoo Therapy Shampoo frequency depends on severity of infection: - In severe cases or in cases of methicillin-resistant pyoderma, shampoo therapy every 1 to 2 days is recommended. - In milder pyoderma cases, twice weekly shampoo therapy may be sufficient. - For maintenance prophylactic therapy, minimum once weekly antibacterial shampoo therapy is recommended; leave-on antibacterial conditioners are also very helpful. |Table 1: Canine Superficial or Surface Pyoderma: | || | Dermatitis Overgrowth Syndrome | (Figure 11) | || | | | Note: All oral antibiotic treatment should be continued 1 to 2 weeks past clinical resolution; a recheck visit is needed prior to discontinuation of therapy.

SYSTEMIC ANTIMICROBIAL THERAPY Systemic antibiotics are used for bacterial skin infections that may not be treatable with topical therapies alone. Antibiotic choice for a particular case is dependent on multiple factors, including: - Depth of infection - Culture and sensitivity results (if applicable) - Potential drug side effects (ie, avoiding cephalexin-induced gastrointestinal adverse effects in a dog with a historically sensitive stomach or sulfa drugs in a dog with pre-existing dry eye or keratoconjunctivitis sicca) - Age- or breed-related predisposition for side effects - Drug cost - Frequency of administration, which affects client compliance.2 Antibiotic Action Antibiotics are either time dependent or concentration dependent in their action. - Time-dependent antibiotics must be given at their specified dosing interval for maximal efficacy, as the duration of time that the antibiotic level remains above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is essential. These antibiotics include: - Cephalosporins - Beta\u2014lactam-resistant penicillins - Concentration-dependent antibiotics include fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides. With these drugs, the rate and extent of the bacterial killing increases as the antibiotic concentration increases. The peak serum concentration, not the time above MIC, is correlated with treatment efficacy; the drugs are best given at a higher dose once daily.2,3 FLUOROQUINOLONES: Use with Caution Use of fluoroquinolones should be carefully assessed in view of associations found between: - Fluoroquinolone use in hospitals and methicillin resistance in S aureus - Fluoroquinolone use in communities and fluoroquinolone resistance in Escherichia coli in hospitals.6 Additionally, studies have found that, although fluoroquinolones may not act as primary mutators for induction of methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) resistance, when they are used in cases of heteroresistant MRSA, they can select for high-level methicillin resistant mutants (which are not only resistant to fluoroquinolones but also to most other antibiotics).7,8 Antibiotic Selection When choosing empiric antibiotics, it is first important to avoid antibiotics to which staphylococcal bacteria are usually intrinsically resistant, including amoxicillin, ampicillin, penicillin, tetracycline, and nonpotentiated sulfonamides. - Antibiotic classes that are usually effective for canine pyoderma include: - Cephalosporins - For first-line therapy for canine pyoderma, most veterinary dermatologists use: - Cephalosporins - Clavulated penicillin - Potentiated sulfonamides. - For second-line therapy for deep, fibrotic infections and/or Pseudomonas infections and when no other reasonable antibiotic choices are available, fluoroquinolones are used when indicated by culture and sensitivity. Veterinary-labeled fluoroquinolones (which have near complete bioavailability4) are preferred over generic ciprofloxacin due to marked variability of ciprofloxacin absorption in dogs.5 - In one study, the oral absorption of generic ciprofloxacin tablets in dogs ranged from 98% to 29% and even at a high oral dose of 20 to 30 mg/kg, the area-under-the-curve (AUC) did not attain a high enough level for bacteria considered \"susceptible.\" This may result in therapeutic failure and increased selection of resistant bacteria, particularly when low doses are used.5 - Due to side effects and toxicity potential, aminoglycosides and chloramphenicol are only used, based on culture/sensitivity data, as a last resort and with careful laboratory monitoring in cases of methicillin-resistant infections. |Table 2.

Antibiotic Administration After an antibiotic has been selected, it should be dispensed at the correct dosage, administered at the correct dosing interval, and used for a sufficient period.1 Underdosing an antibiotic due to client concerns about cost will only be more expensive in the long run due to increased time to cure and increased chance of inducing bacterial resistance, necessitating more expenses, such as cultures and additional antibiotic courses. The duration of antibiotic therapy depends on several factors, including depth of pyoderma, underlying diseases, and use of concomitant topical therapies. - In general, superficial pyodermas usually resolve with a 3-week course of an antimicrobial; treatment should continue 1 to 2 weeks beyond healing/resolution of cutaneous lesions. - For deep pyoderma, a 6- to 12-week course of treatment (3 weeks beyond resolution of cutaneous lesions) or even longer may be required to resolve deep pockets of infection.1 - Regular rechecks are important to determine response to therapy and need for medication refills or therapy modifications.

IMMUNOSTIMULANTS When an underlying cause cannot be found in cases of canine recurrent pyoderma, use of immunostimulants may be of benefit. Two commercial are currently available. Staphage Lysate Staphage lysate (SPL, delmont.com) derived from lysed-killed S aureus and is given subcutaneously. In one study of 21 dogs with idiopathic superficial recurrent pyoderma treated with either bacterin or placebo (and an initial 6-week course of oral antibiotics), dogs given antibiotics plus the bacterin (n = 13) had a significantly better response after 18 weeks of treatment than those given antibiotic plus placebo.9 Although there is no published supportive data, staphage lysate may also be helpful as adjunctive therapy in atopic dogs that continue to develop recurrent pyoderma despite appropriate management of their atopic dermatitis. ImmunoRegulin is an immunostimulant derived from killed Propionibacterium acnes and administered IV. In one study, dogs with chronic recurrent pyoderma were treated with antibiotics plus IV injections of either P acnes or placebo. Eighty percent (12/15) of the dogs treated with antibiotics and P acnes responded with significant improvement or complete remission of lesions at the end of the 12-week treatment schedule compared with 38% (5/13) of the dogs treated with antibiotics and placebo.10 Other Immunostimulants A more recent, blinded study of an autogenous S intermedius (pseudintermedius) bacterin (prepared by culturing the individual dog's pyoderma lesions) compared the bacterin versus placebo in 10 dogs with idiopathic recurrent pyoderma; all were initially treated with a 4-week course of oral antibiotics. After 5 weeks, clinical scores were not significantly different between groups; however, at week 10, the placebo treated group had statistically higher lesion scores compared to the treatment group.11 Unfortunately, this product is not commercially available. Finally, genome sequencing technology and proteomic approaches to identify surface-exposed staphylococcal bacterial proteins may lead to development of vaccines to induce protective immunity; the entire genome sequence of S pseudintermedius has recently been determined, and this may lead to new and effective approaches for the prevention and treatment of canine pyoderma.12 The final article in this series will focus specifically on methicillin-resistant canine pyoderma.
