Dubbed the \u00abLeonardo and Peter Pan\u00bb of contemporary art, he pioneered what would later be labelled kinetic art, playing a key role in the constitution and definition of the aes - thetic programmes of groups such as Movi - mento Arte Concreta and Programmed Art . He became an internationally recognized name in the field of industrial design, win - ning the prestigious \u00abCompasso d'Oro\u00bb prize four times, while also being a prominent fig - ure in Italian graphic design, working for mag - azines such as Tempo and Domus , as well as renowned publishing companies such as Ein - audi and Bompiani . He left an indelible mark as an art pedagogue and popularizer with his famous 1970s artistic laboratories for children and was the author of numerous books, rang - ing from essays on art and design to experi - mental books . Capturing a resurgent interest in Munari at the international level, the ex - ceptional array of critical voices in this vol - ume constitutes an academic study of Munari of a depth and range that is unprecedented in any language, offering a unique analysis of Munari's seven-decade-long career . Through original archival research, and illuminating and generative comparisons with other art - ists and movements both within and outside Italy, the essays gathered here offer novel read - ings of more familiar aspects of Munari's ca - reer while also addressing those aspects that have received scant or no attention to date .Paola Colaiacomo Natasha's Dress Language of Literature, Language of Fashion This book explores interconnections between high literary modernism and the revolution in dress design of the early twentieth century . During this time, new and \u00abliberated\u00bb life - styles created a bond among figures as diverse as writers and fashion editors, painters and art critics, photographers and models, danc - ers and economists - all of whom were in dif - ferent ways looking at new \u00abinventive clothes\u00bb (Vreeland) as life experiences . Starting points of the research are Pirandello's One, no one, and one hundred thousand , where the protag - onist's disowning of his own image in the mir - ror ignites a tragedy, and Roger Fry's essays on the resuscitation of Victorianism at the end of the First World War, where the phantasma - goria of time is identified as the basis for mod - ern illusion . Each chapter in the book explores a different facet of the same topic: the distance between self and image as the dispenser or destroyer of enchantment . This issue was ac - tively pursued by philosophers (Benjamin), writers (Woolf, Mansfield, Fitzgerald), photog - raphers (Man Ray, Cecil Beaton) and fashion critics (Vreeland) . The evolution in fashion ed - iting was meanwhile instructing the sophis - ticated readers of Vogue and Harper's Bazaar in the art of contemplating their own reflec - tions in the mirror and seeing in them exactly what they wanted to see . The Natasha of the title is Tolstoy's heroine, a secret spring of cre - ative energy for Katherine Mansfield, and the source of one of Diana Vreeland's most per - ceptive insights into the nature of fashion .

Necessarily focusing on material practices - chiefly sculpture, installation, performance, and film - this discussion takes account of how and why artists have used gravity and ex - plores the similarities between their work and the popular cultural forms of circus, vaude - ville, burlesque, and film . Works by Rodney Graham, Stan Douglas, and Robert Smithson are mediated through ideas of Gnostic doubt, atomism, and new materialism . In other ex - amples - by John Wood and Paul Harrison, Gordon Matta-Clark, Peter Fischli and David Weiss, Trisha Brown, and Bas Jan Ader - mass and momentum, falling objects, and falling bodies are examined in relation to architec - ture, sculpture, and dance . In performances, projects and events curated by Bruce Nauman, Santiago Sierra, and Catherine Yass, gravity is resisted in Sisyphean ordeals and death-de - fying stunts . This account of contemporary art and performance, read through the invis - ible membrane of gravity, exposes new and distinctive approaches to agency reduction, authorial doubt, and redemptive failure . Paschal Kyoore Dagara Verbal Art An African Tradition Dagara Verbal Art examines verbal art among the Dagara people of West Africa . It provides invaluable primary material for research, and does a close analysis of folktale narration, proverb usage, riddling, chanting of dirges and popular songs by male and female praise singers, and xylophone music performance as forms of verbal art . Folktales are character - ized by wit, humor, and satire, and songs within tales are a mise-en-abyme, a story within a story that entertains but also enhances the narration through the participation of the au - dience in the performance . Moreover, Dagara tales are didactic and moralizing as a way of controlling the behavior of individuals in so - ciety . Riddling entertains but also helps to de - velop the cognitive abilities of children, and demands critical and logical thinking on the part of the participating audience . Proverbs were collected in context and analyzed closely for their meaning . The study also examines closely the art of speech-making, and con - cludes that a good locutor knows what figures of speech to use in order to enhance commu - nication with the audience . This study con - cludes that an authentic theory of Dagara\u2014 and for that matter, generally African\u2014folk - lore must be grounded on a thorough knowledge of the traditions, rites and rituals, and the socio-political structures that have held the society together in its historical ex - perience . Dagara Verbal Art is an important resource for areas such as African studies, Af - rican literature and folklore, folklore in gen - eral, anthropology, culture studies, ethnomu - sicology, ethnic studies, and gender studies, among others .Irene Noy Emergency Noises Sound Art and Gender Art history traditionally concentrates on the visual . Sound has either been ignored or has been appreciated in a highly selective man - ner within a different discipline: music . This book is about recent attempts by artists trained in (West) Germany to provoke listening expe - riences to awaken the senses . Their work is revolutionary in artistic terms and in what it reveals about human relations, especially con - cerning issues of gender . The main focus of the book is to explore a gendered reading of the unity between the visual and the aural, a strand most prominently expressed within sound art in the period from the beginning of the 1960s to the 1980s . The book juxtaposes sources that have not been considered in con - junction with each other before and questions sound art's premise: is it a separate field or a novel way of understanding art? The study also opens up sound art to gender considera - tions, asking if the genre possesses the capac - ity to disrupt conventional, gendered role models and facilitate alternative possibilities of self-definition and agency across genders . Emergency Noises brings to light the work of underrepresented female artists and explores new intersections of sound, art and gender . Oxford, 2018 .

The Gothic A Reader What is the Gothic ? From ghosts to vampires, from ruined castles to steampunk fashion, the Gothic is a term that evokes all things strange, haunted and sinister . This volume offers a new look at the world of the Gothic, from its origins in the eighteenth century to its reemergence today . Each short essay is ded - icated to a single text - a novel, a film, a comic book series, a festival - that serves as a lens to explore the genre . Original readings of clas - sics like The Mysteries of Udolpho (Ann Rad - cliffe) and Picnic at Hanging Rock (Joan Lind - say) are combined with unique insights into contemporary examples like the music of Mex - ican rock band Caifanes, the novels Annihila - tion (Jeff VanderMeer), Goth (Otsuichi) and The Paying Guests (Sarah Waters), and the films Crimson Peak (Guillermo del Toro) and Ex Machina (Alex Garland) . Together the essays provide innovative ways of understanding key texts in terms of their Gothic elements . Invaluable for students, teachers and fans alike, the book's accessible style allows for an engaging look at the spectral and uncanny na - ture of the Gothic .Mic\u00f2l Beseghi Multilingual Films in Translation A Sociolinguistic and Intercultural Study of Diasporic Films A contribution to the ever-growing field of au - diovisual translation studies, this volume in - vestigates the processes involved in the trans - lation of multilingual films, a media genre where language, culture and identity are closely interwoven . To explore the relationships that get established between audiovisual transla - tion, linguistic diversity and identity, the book analyses a corpus of immigrant films portray - ing the South Asian diaspora, with the aim of determining how diasporic identity is then reconstructed for the Italian audience through dubbing and subtitling . A sociolinguistic anal - ysis model is proposed that covers all linguis - tic levels, including the use of ethnolects and some fundamental discourse strategies, such as code-switching and code-mixing, thus il - lustrating how linguistic choices and language variation are socio-culturally symbolic .

Boyz N the Hood: Shifting Hollywood Terrain is an interdisciplinary examination of this iconic film and its impact in cinematic history and American culture . This interdisciplinary ap - proach provides an in-depth critical perspec - tive of Boyz N the Hood as the embodiment of the blues: how Boyz intimates a world beyond the symbolic world Singleton posits, how its fictive stance pivots to a constituent truth in the real world . Boyz speaks from the first per - son perspective on the state of being \u00abinvisi - ble .\u00bb Through a subjective narrative point of view, Singleton interrogates the veracity of this claim regarding invisibility and provides deep insight into this social reality . This book is as much about the filmmaker as it is about the film . It explores John Singleton's cinematic voice and helps explicate his propensity for a type of folk element in his work (the oral tra - dition and lore) . In addition, this text features critical perspectives from the filmmaker him - self and other central figures attached to the production, including a first-hand account of production behind the scenes by Steve Nico - laides, Boyz 's producer . The text includes Sin - gleton's original screenplay and a range of crit - ical articles and initial movie reviews .Maricruz Castro Ricalde Mauricio D\u00edaz Calder\u00f3n James Ramey (eds.) Mexican Transnational Cinema and Literature \u00abIt was a great night for Mexico, as usual .\u00bb Donald Trump's words about Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu on Oscars' night 2014 were a preview of his now-notorious attitude to - ward Mexicans: \u00abHe's walking away with all the gold? Was it that good? I don't hear that . It was certainly a big night for them .\u00bb Although the future president's comments were offen - sive, for scholars interested in transnational film and literature his words were pure gold, for they raise questions about \u00abnation\u00bb as a category of representation . When we invoke \u00abMexican cinema\u00bb, we imply that some kind of \u00abnational cinema\u00bb exists - but what is a na - tional cinema? Is the cinema made in the US a national cinema in the same way as that of Mexico's? And is a film made by a foreigner in Mexico part of Mexican cinema? What does it mean for a film or a literary work to cross a border? And are borders to be defined in geo - graphical terms only, or can they also be cast in terms of gender, sexual orientation, race, or language itself? This book, in short, reflects on the implications of the term transnational in relation to film and literature conceived - in any way, shape, or form - as \u00abMexican\u00bb .

Is the auditorium not a natural environment, and how can theatre and nature aesthetics co-exist in the produc - tive expression of performance? Re-Place: Irish Theatre Environments proposes a new way of thinking about Irish theatre: one that chal - lenges established boundaries between na - ture and culture and argues for theatre per - formances to be seen as conceptual ecologi - cal environments . Broadening the scope of theatre environments to encompass radio - phonic and digital spaces, Re-Place is a timely interrogation of how we understand perfor - mance history . This book examines the work, both as text and in production, of three ca - nonical Irish playwrights, J . M . Synge, Samuel Beckett and Brian Friel, and looks at how the - atre documentation can further the idea of a natural performance environment . The ques - tions under consideration extend Irish thea - tre history into the field of the environmen - tal humanities and draw on new materialist discourse to offer exciting and innovative ways to approach performance .Gregory Frame The American President in Film and Television Myth, Politics and Representation, 2nd Edition As evidenced by the election of celebrity and reality television star Donald Trump, popu - lar culture has played a vital role in the con - ceptualisation of political leadership . This re - vised edition of The American President in Film and Television explores the complex relation - ship between the construction of fictional presidents on screen and the political cultures from which they emerged . How have our pop - ular cultural fantasies of presidential leader - ship contributed to the current political real - ity? Combining textual analysis with close at - tention to political and historical contexts, the book addresses the reasons behind the proliferation of images of the president in the past twenty-five years, from the archetype in American genre cinema ( Air Force One , Inde - pendence Day and Deep Impact ) to the ideal - ised fantasy figure in network television ( The West Wing , 24 and Commander in Chief ) . With the election of a president whose worldview appears to have been formed entirely by the aesthetics and rhetoric of popular culture, where does the presidency - either on screen or in the White House - go from here?

Unbridling the Western Film Auteur Contemporary, Transnational and Intertextual Explorations According to Jim Kitses (1969), the Western originally offered American directors a rich canvas to express a singular authorial vision of the American past and its significance . The Western's recognizable conventions and sym - bols, rich filmic heritage, and connections to pulp fiction created a widely spoken \u00ablan - guage\u00bb for self-expression and supplemented each filmmaker's power to express their vi - sion of American society . This volume seeks to re-examine the significance of auteur the - ory for the Western by analysing the auteur director \u00abunbridled\u00bb by traditional defini - tions or national contexts . This book renders a complex portrait of the Western auteur by considering the genre in a transnational con - text . It proposes that narrow views of auteur - ism should be reconsidered in favour of broader definitions that see meaning created, both in - tentionally and unintentionally, by a direc - tor; by other artistic contributors, including actors and the audience; or through the inter - section with other theoretical concepts such as re-allegorization . In so doing, it illuminates the Western as a vehicle for expressing complex ideas of national and transnational identity .Mirosaw Kocur The Power of Theater Actors and Spectators in Ancient Rome This book examines performative practices of the ancient Romans, and provides fresh in - sights into the contexts of the Roman theater . Today the ancient theater is associated more with Greece than with Rome . However, the Romans went to the theater more often than the Athenians . In fact, the entire Eternal City was a vast stage for numerous performances not just by politicians, leaders, orators, and emperors, but also by common citizens . The author suggests that we look at Rome as a theater, one in which everybody, depending on circumstances, could be a performer . This book reconstructs the art of the Roman spec - tacle, and - based on detailed analyses of rich and varied source materials - extensively dis - cusses the behavior of audiences and the lit - tle-known practices of actors, such as the per - formers of Atellan farces, pantomimes, and mimes . The reader also gains an insight into the most recent research on the Roman theater .

How can we know the specifics of an event that has been and gone, an occurrence that can never be repeated? This book proposes that by considering the use of songs within a dramatic production we can gain a deeper un - derstanding of past performances, especially with regard to their communal reception . Why did a playwright employ a certain song? How might it have affected an audience? Arguing that certain song types constitute forms of collective memory, the author explores Irish theatre from the 1950s and 1960s to show that songs are a valuable means by which we can gauge changes in the popular consciousness . By necessity, songs mutate so that they can continue to express and affirm collective mem - ories and therefore fit the zeitgeist of their so - cio-cultural contexts . Through its detailed re - search, this book demonstrates that retrospec - tively analysing the dramatic employment of well-known songs not only helps us better un - derstand the performances and reception of a selection of Irish plays, but also challenges orthodox narratives of \u00c9amon de Valera's Ire 70 .- / \u20acD 59 .95 / \u20acA 61 .20 / \u20ac 55 .60 / \u00a3 45 .- / US-$ 67 .95 eBook (SUL) ISBN 978-1 -78874-004-3 CHF 73 .- / \u20acD 66 .95 / \u20acA 66 .70 / \u20ac 55 .60 / \u00a3 45 .- / US-$ 67 .95 Film and Performance Studies 7 Maria-Christina Mur The Physiognomical Discourse and European Theatre Theory, Performance, Dramatic Text The discourse on Physiognomy had an impor - tant influence and impact on European the - atrical culture at the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth centu - ries . The book discusses the debate about the scientific nature of Physiognomy . Starting from the concept that Physiognomy refers to particular signs on the face, it looks for evi - dence of a knowledge and awareness of this pseudo-scientific theory . The author researches among various acting manuals and theatri - cal works in English, German, French and Ital - ian . She points out that Physiognomy makes an appearance in many different guises . In the so-called \u00abphysiognomical portraits\u00bb, for instance, where we find animated discussions on the passions to be displayed, and also di - rect references to Johann Caspar Lavater and his science .Teresa Pkala (ed.) Witkacy. Logos and the Elements This book focuses on Stanisaw Ignacy Wit - kie-wicz, philosopher and controversial art - ist . It expresses the opinions of philosophers, museologists and artists, for whom Stanisaw Ignacy Witkacy's 130 th birthday anniversary became an opportunity to view his works from the perspective of postmodernity . The authors concentrate on Stanisaw Ignacy Witkiewicz as eminent and prophetic philosopher con - cerned about Western culture with its wan - ing metaphysical feelings, master of gesture and poses, anticipating the postmodern the - atricalization of life .Malcolm Scott Frank Capra and the Cinema of Identity Celebration and Interrogation This study proposes a new definition of Frank Capra's work as a cinema of identity, focusing on his reflection on American national iden - tity as well as his own positioning as a US im - migrant . The interplay of celebration and in - terrogation is used to show the two poles of his films' narrative structure, placing in a new critical light the supposed \u00abhappy endings\u00bb of this complex filmmaker . All of his films are discussed, including his feature films (both silent and sound, grouped thematically and in broad chronological order) and wartime documentaries . There are separate chapters on controversial works like Mr Smith Goes to Washington , Meet John Doe and It's a Wonder - ful Life . Not intended as a biography of Capra but as a study of his career and ideas on film, the book takes into account the views of nu - merous earlier critics and writers and offers a fresh appraisal of this celebrated director and his often problematic films .

Intensified Bodies from the Performing Arts in Portugal The way the body is considered and explored in the performing arts has assumed a grow - ing importance, introducing new questions and cross-cutting perspectives on our under - standing of the political, sociological and philo- sophical relevance of the body today . This book is a meeting point for these questions, bring - ing together a set of contributors experienced in examining the body's presence in live per - formances . It interweaves several disciplinary outlooks, addressing current theoretical de - bates on the body relating to the theory of af - fects, ethics, gender, age, discourse and rep - resentation . Looking at recent practice in Por - tugal, the volume examines several cases where the body and issues of corporeality raise questions of memory, identity, experience and existence . It opens a rare window onto the distinctive Portuguese post-colonial leg - acy, which has given rise to an intensified search for new forms of bodily affirmation in the world . In so doing, the book conjures up the transformative power of performing arts today: from body into Being . Oxford, 2017 .

Drawing on its Tagalog coun - terpart, buhol-buhol , entanglement is con - ceived not only as a juxtaposition among el - ements, but also as a process of muddling and snaring . Taken together, these affirm the en - tangled character of contemporary Manila theatre in overlapping representations, his - tories, relationships and genres, while at the same time marking some problematic limi - tations in the treatment of chosen subjects by Manilan artists . The reason for this is that while these entanglements render Manila the - atre far more complex than the accusations of mimicry and inauthenticity frequently lev - eled at Filipino culture, artists are often caught up in a more intractable buhol-buhol than they are willing or able to recognize . Four figures of buhol-buhol are identified in this book: (fiesta), (trap), In conceptualizing these figures of entangle - ment, the discussions start by illustrating their materiality and performativity before proceeding to reflections about how these are directed towards the complexity of Manila theatre .

The journey of the Kon-Tiki from Peru to Polynesia in 1947 became one of the found - ing myths of the postwar world . In the voyage of six Scandinavians and a parrot on a balsa raft across the Pacific Ocean the classic jour - ney of discovery was re-invented for genera - tions to come . Kon-Tiki spoke of heroism, - culinity, free-spirited rebellion against scien - tific dogmatism, and the promise of an attainable exotic world, while it updated these mythological staples to fit the times . After years of relentless media exploitation of the 101-day raft journey, Heyerdahl emerged as the protagonist in a legend that helped to cre - ate a new postwar West . A Hero for the Atomic Age tells the story of how Heyerdahl organ - ized an expedition to sail a balsa raft from Cal - lao in Peru to the Tuamotu Islands in French Polynesia, and explains how he turned this physical crossing into an epic narrative that became imbued with a universal appeal . The book also addresses the problematic nature of Heyerdahl's theory that a white culture- bearing race had initiated all the world's great civilizations .Jamal Assadi Saif Abu Saleh Short Fiction as a Mirror of Palestinian Life in Israel, 1944-1967 Critique and Anthology This volume seeks to document the develop - ment of the Palestinian short story between 1944 and 1967 . This particularly significant phase that carried the seeds, from which the short story grew, was greatly influenced by the last years of the British mandate over Pal - estine in 1944, the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948, and the subsequent changes that impacted Palestinian society in this coun - try until the Arabs' defeat in the Six Day War, 1967 . Within the fold of this volume, the reader will find two parts: the first is a general ac - count of the development of the genre of short fiction and the different approaches that char - acterized it along with a discussion of the lan - guage and an examination of the content . The second is an anthology of twenty-five stories published between 1944 and 1967 by Al-Ittid , an Israeli Arabic-language daily newspaper .

Written by his daugh - ter, the book is part historical biography, part coming-of-age novel, part memoir . It draws extensively on Averoff's prolific literary oeuvre and personal archives, while weaving seam - lessly back and forth from past to present in a voice all its own . We follow the protagonist from his birth in 1908, when Greece was still a monarchy reeling from the losses of the Greco-Turkish War of 1897, to the late 1940s and the Civil War, by which time Averoff had become a seasoned, cosmopolitan politician . In the interim, as the protagonist contends with the vagaries of history and a captivating cast of supporting characters, we see him grow into a living, breathing person, endowed with the complexity and humour so often denied the one-dimensional figures of official history . A labour of love and a meditation on loss and transcendence, the book celebrates the raw pain, passion, ambition, love and, at times, sheer luck that shape who we are .Jes\u00fas Baigorri las relaciones transatl\u00e1nticas de la UE History, Memory and European Integration from the Point of View of EU Transatlantic Relations Este libro analiza las relaciones hist\u00f3ricas y proceso de in - tegraci\u00f3n europea desde el punto de vista de las relaciones la UE con un enfo - que multidisciplinario .

It is the result of a Doctoral Seminar on that issue organised by the European Academy of Yuste Foundation from 26 to 28 January 2015 . The chapters of this book shed light on topics which from the prevailing per - spective of EU's central and northern zones are often overshadowed by Europe's relations with the United States . It is thus designed to contrib - ute to take that fresh look and to better under - stand transatlantic interactions between the EU and its Latin American partners . Oxford, 2018 .

The old - est daughter of a family of Eastern European origin, Bernice had an American-born mother, but in other things was similar to her contem - poraries, reflecting the lives of a generation of pre-WWI urban Jews in America with im - migrant parents . Her life story reflects much of the development of American Jewry dur - ing the middle of the 20 th century: the Great Depression, the Second World War, the devel - opment of Zionism, the response to the new State of Israel, and the development of Jewish suburbia . We follow Bernice's school years during the Depression, her connection with the Bronx Y, her college studies, her stint in the Women's Land Army, study trip to Israel in 1949, and marriage to Arthur Schwartz, a young army veteran and social work student from Nyack, NY . After the couple's odyssey through several East Coast Jewish communi - ties, they and their sons settled in Teaneck, New Jersey . We follow Bernice's response to her oldest son immigrating to Israel, and the couple's move to Riverdale, NY and life there during their \u00abGolden Years\u00bb in the 21st century .Ioan Bolovan Intermarriage in Transylvania, 1895-2010 This book reconstructs the perceptions about mixed marriages across generations, starting from a detailed analysis of the statistical back - ground and a description of this phenome - non in the historical past, and then focusing on the case history of families . As ethnic and religious diversity has long been an impor - tant source of social tension in Transylvania, mixed marriages have the potential to link the communities and act as a bridge between ethnic groups . Considering the multilevel analyses, the time frame from 1895 to nowa - days as well as the historical past of Transyl - vania, this volume has a strong multidiscipli - nary character, predicated on a combination of historical, demographical and sociological methods .Sophie Bouffier Dominique Garcia (eds.) Greek Marseille and Mediterranean Celtic Region This unique collection of essays contains a synthesis of recent works by distinguished ar - chaeologists and historians in their field, il - luminating extensive research in the South - ern Gaul and on the territory of the Greek city of Marseille . Investigating the occupation of Massalia territory before the foundation of the Greek city to the Roman period, these findings pro - vide an overview of the diverse issues behind the circulations between Greeks from Pho - caea and Celtic populations . This reflection on a key region of the Euro-Mediterranean space rests on the analysis of archaeological find - ings, including: urban excavations, spatial studies, analysis of necropolis, submarine re - mains, paleo-environmental data, and review - ing the ancient literary documentation . These new and innovative findings in Greek Mar - seille and Mediterranean Celtic Region will be of particular interest to both students and scholars exploring the political, economic and cultural fields of relationships between the Greek migrants and the populations they started to meet at the end of the seventh cen - tury BC .

Less well known is the uproar the ar - mies stirred up in their path, and even more, the chaos they left in their wake . The \u00abknock- on effect\u00bb of Napoleon's sweep across Europe went further than is often remembered: his invasion of Spain triggered the collapse of the Spanish Empire in Latin America, and his med - dling in the Balkans destabilised the Otto - mans . Many places had been riven with ban - ditry and popular tumult from time imme - morial, characteristics which worsened in the havoc wrought by the wars . Other areas had known relative calm before the arrival of the French in 1792, but even the most pacific soci - eties were disrupted by these conflagrations . Behind the battle fronts raged other conflicts, \u00ablittle wars\u00bb - the guerrilla (the term was born in these years) - and bigger ones, where whole provinces rose up in arms . Bandits often stood at the centre of these \u00abdirty wars\u00bb of ambushes, night raids, living hard in tough terrain, of plunder, rapine and early, violent death, which spread across the whole western world from Constantinople to Chile . Everywhere, they threw up unlikely characters - ordinary men who emerged as leaders, bandits who became presidents, priests who became warriors, law - yers who became murdering criminals . In studying these varying fortunes, Michael Bro - ers provides an insight into a lost world of peasant life, a world Napoleon did so much to sweep away .John L. Bullion Prelude to Disaster George III and the Origins of the American Revolution, 1751-1763 Prelude to Disaster is the most comprehensive account of the fateful decision to tax Ameri - can colonists . Unlike other studies, it empha - sizes the central role of the young George III in the process . Central to this examination are George's principles of statecraft and gov - ernment, his thoughts on pre- and post-war empires, his assessments of future relations with Britain's great antagonist France, his per - sonality and its development before and af - ter his accession to the throne, his friendship with the earl of Bute, and his attitudes toward domestic policies and politicians, especially George Grenville .Edward Corp Sir David Nairne The Life of a Scottish Jacobite at the Court of the Exiled Stuarts For nearly forty years David Nairne was ac - tively involved in the administration of Jaco - bite politics . A member of the exiled courts of the Stuart Kings James II and James III, he worked for and with a succession of Jacobite secretaries of state, conducting the Jacobite correspondence, deciding on Jacobite policies and negotiating with the courts of Versailles, Lun\u00e9ville and Rome . Moreover, he enjoyed particularly close relations for most of the pe - riod with both of the exiled kings . Despite this, his name is not well known to most his - torians of the period, so this completely new and original biography will restore him to the prominent and influential position which he occupied at the time . Nairne was both an ob - server and a participant in the struggle of the exiled Stuart monarchs to regain their king - doms between 1689 and the end of the 1720s . The chance survival of many of his papers has made it possible to reconstruct a full account of his life from his birth in Scotland in 1655 until his death in Paris in 1740 . Oxford, .

Cheese Manufacturing in the Twentieth Century The Italian Experience in an International Context Since the end of the nineteenth century the dairy sectors of some industrialised European and American countries have experienced a phase of growth that took place at a different rate and in a different manner in each coun - try, and which was made possible by the avail - ability of raw materials and a more widespread knowledge of scientific and technological methods . The sector's expansion was favoured by a revolution in transport networks, the be - ginning of globalisation in world markets and, decisively, by advances in packaging and re - frigeration techniques . Italy in particular, de - spite its low availability of raw materials com - pared to other countries, rose quickly through - out the last century to become one of the largest international producers and export - ers of cheese, especially of high value PDO cheeses . What factors were behind this achieve - ment and which were the strengths and weak - nesses of the sector during the twentieth cen - tury? The articles presented in this volume at - tempt to provide an answer to these questions from different points of view and using dif - ferent interpretative approaches . The geo - graphical range covered by these studies also reaches beyond Italy in order to look at other countries with relatively ancient dairy tradi - tions . This comparative approach, although limited to just a few countries, is important in that it allows us to describe the evolution of a milk and dairy sector which has had such a large influence on the economic life of many regions in the Italian peninsula .Ben Dorfman 13 Acts of Academic Journalism and Historical Commentary on Human Rights Opinions, Interventions and the Torsions of Politics Constituted of a range of essays, the present volume addresses a variety of contemporary and historical events from human rights per - spectives . Taking on issues from the Ameri - can presidential election to North Korean mis - sile tests to terrorism and \u00abcivilizational\u00bb con - flict to Cold War history, the current collection seeks to speak plainly by combining academic convention with a \u00abfeuilleton\u00bb style . Aimed at students and the public as much as other academics, the essays in this book seek to make rights concepts concrete by speaking to the issues through which they become sali - ent: international conflict, social justice prob - lems and the historical scenes that ask us to realize all human beings' equality and dignity - an equality and dignity this book seeks to promote .Thomas L. Dynneson Rise of the Early Roman Republic Reflections on Becoming Roman An audaciously daring narrative, this text pre - sents an overview of the early history of Rome, focusing the reader's attention to those dis - tinctive and often hidden cultural features that contributed to create a unique ancient Roman mindset and civic outlook . Using an historical format, Thomas L . Dynneson ad - dresses these cultural forces which ultimately shaped the Romans into the ancient world's most powerful military city-state . Comprised of numerous values and beliefs, the Romans sought to develop their citizens as a cohesive whole . This approach enabled a mastering of both the practical and utilitarian tactics for solving problems, an expression of classical intellectualism . Identifying this sense of ide - alism paralleled with the Romans embodi - ment of sacrifice to overcome all obstacles, the author explores several features of becom - ing Roman . Within this text, each section is designed to pull together the general histori - cal elements which helped to create a unique Roman citizenship . The final section of each chapter contains further analysis, including the author's narrative regarding the general sources used, and the second containing a re - view of one exceptional recommended read - ing .

It begins with Erika and Klaus Mann's self-promotional tour of the United States in 1927-1928, and follows up with their return in 1936 as voluntary exiles deter - mined to fight the spread of Nazism in Europe . As children of privilege and considerable per - sonal charm, Erika and Klaus Mann quickly became highly visible representatives of the German exile community . In examining their lives in America, the United States plays a cen - tral role . Just as the Manns' views of America evolved between 1936 and 1952, so did Amer - ican public opinion and government policy . This study examines Erika and Klaus Mann's public and private statements, while also ex - amining statements made about them by American journalists, politicians, book crit - ics, and F .B .I . and immigration officers . It fol - lows the Mann siblings' rise in America as ce - lebrity representatives of an \u00abother,\u00bb better Germany, and the forces that began to rally against them even before the outbreak of the war . It shows the many concrete actions the Mann siblings took to persuade Americans to view their country as one linked to European interests, and it describes their various war activities, with Erika becoming a U .S . war cor - respondent and Klaus an American soldier . Finally, it portrays their fears for America as the war drew to a close, America deployed the atom bomb, and the nation quickly trans - formed itself from Russian ally to Cold War combatant .Erik Eklund Melanie Oppenheimer Joanne Scott (eds.) The State of Welfare Comparative Studies of the Welfare State at the End of the Long Boom, 1965-1980 The period after 1945 saw a rapid growth in so - cial welfare, with the state taking on increas - ing responsibility for pensions, health care, unemployment relief and income support . In Western democracies economic growth un - derpinned state investment and was rein - forced by demands from the new social move - ments of the 1960s . Just as the clamour for re - formism reached a crescendo in the late 1960s, the global economy began to falter, culminat - ing in the oil crisis of 1973-1974 . This volume explores the factors that shaped the trajecto - ries of welfare state change over this crucial period . A close analysis of countries such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom reveals signs of a broader shift to - wards the decline of government spending and the first tentative moves towards a nas - cent neoliberalism . Other countries, such as Sweden and West Germany, remained com - paratively untouched by the economic crisis and even sought to reinforce their welfare state in response to it . Ireland and Northern Ireland also showed little evidence of these changes, isolated as they were by complex po - litical and religious factors .

Against this background, Anglo-Romanian dealings in the aviation industry over a period of almost thirty years are a case of converging politico-military interests with major interpretative potential . This holds true for the history of East-West relations and infra-Western commercial competition, but also for the transformation of domestic decision- making patterns and the change in economic pri - orities . While Britain became Romania's first com - mercial partner in order to offer a new outlet to the aviation industry, Bucharest was looking at the U .K . to pursue a strategy of industrial mod - ernisation and political visibility . The story of their intersection sheds light on the lower-level reality of D\u00e9tente in Europe . The degree of collab - oration across the Iron Curtain was not just the product of a generally improved diplomatic at - mosphere, but - at least in the present case - the result of a peculiar mixture of political ambition, economic viability, and technological expertise . Indeed, the change of economic paradigm in the UK (from Neo-Keynesianism to monetarist Neo- Liberalism), along with President Ceauescu's fix - ation with foreign debt, played a crucial role in the vicissitudes of Anglo-Romanian relations in the aviation industry in the period between the demise of D\u00e9tente and the end of the Cold War . This points to a reasonably articulated model, which is hinged on the category of 'transfer', rather than on the category of 'cooperation' . Brian Fleming Irish Education and Catholic Emancipation, 1791-1831 The Campaigns of Bishop Doyle and Daniel O'Connell The restrictions applied to Catholics in the early eighteenth century to curtail their po - litical and economic power in Ireland were gradually removed by the British government in response to changing circumstances . By 1800 the remaining restrictions related to membership of Parliament and a few senior judicial positions . The removal of these, while important symbolically, could have direct im - plications for very few people, given the lim - ited franchise . Yet the campaign for their ab - olition, known as Catholic emancipation, pre - sented successive British governments with serious problems and led to one prime min - isterial resignation, one government collapse and many crises . How did Daniel O'Connell use this situation to create a successful mass movement, broadening the emancipation campaign to include the issue of education? How did the area of educational provision be - come a sectarian battleground, and what part did Bishop James Doyle play in forcing a re - luctant government to become involved in setting up a state-run education system, a highly unusual step at the time? Does his vi - sion have a message for us now, when school patronage is such a contested issue in Ireland? This book provides an intriguing new perspec - tive on a critical period in Irish history .Lee Fontanella This Favoured Land Edward King-Tenison and Lady Louisa in Spain, 1850-1853 In the wake of the Irish potato famine, Edward King-Tenison, a sometime Irish politician of the liberal order and one of the first master - ful photographers of Spain, and his wife, Lady Louisa Mary Anne Anson, the eldest daugh - ter of the 1st Earl of Lichfield, left their estate of Kilronan in County Roscommon, Ireland, to reside and travel in Andalusia and, later, in Castile . The remarkable adventure on which these Irish nobles embarked in mid-nine - teenth-century Spain led to a husband-and- wife team of astonishing cultural production . While Tenison focused on photography, Lady Louisa chronicled their travels, producing sketches and establishing relations on an in - ternational level with other artists, who col - laborated in her illustrated chronicle . This book documents the fascinating travels of this couple and presents their work to a new readership . Bruxelles, 2018 . 269 pp . Euroclio. Etudes et Documents. Vol. 102 pb .

The author uses comparative methods and a broad spectrum of sources . In the early Modern Age, the Cro - atian name established itself in these areas as a temporary phenomenon, replacing the orig - inal Slovene name, which at that time had a \u00abpre-national\u00bb content and was also used by a considerable portion of today's Croats . Ex- tending the use of the Croatian name to the Slovene border regions was a component of a broader and long-term process . The author explores how this process was triggered by tectonic geopolitical changes resulting from the Ottoman conquests in the Balkans and the Pannonian Basin .Georg Grote Hannes Obermair (eds.) A Land on the Threshold South Tyrolean Transformations, 1915-2015 Among the many commemorations of World War I, little was made of the 100th anniver - sary of the secret Treaty of London between Italy and the Western War Allies in April 1915, which sealed the fate of South Tyrol for the duration of the twentieth century by passing it from Austria to Italy . In May 2015, a sympo - sium was held in the medieval Pr\u00f6sels Castle in the Italian Dolomites to mark this histori - cal moment . Contributors set out to explore the political, social and cultural impact of South Tyrol's existence \u00abon the threshold\u00bb during the twentieth century . Individually and collectively, the essays in this volume challenge the simplistic reading of South Ty - rol as merely a geographic region torn between Germanic and Italian cultures; instead, they explore the dynamic effects of its geographi - cal, political and cultural history since 1915 . South Tyrol, as a modern regional state in Eu - rope, faces many of the same problems as other European regions, be they individual states or sub-state regions . Most of the contributions in this volume are from academics and intel - lectuals within the Province of Bolzano/Bozen who negotiate and discuss these issues through their native languages: German, Italian and Ladin . By making their research accessible through English translations and abstracts, this volume seeks to bring their work on his - torical and contemporary developments in South Tyrol to a wider European and global audience .Frank Healy Brigitte Bastiat (eds.) Voyages between France and Ireland Culture, Tourism and Sport The voyage - the quest, the odyssey, the expe - dition - is one of the driving forces of civili - sation . From ancient times to the present day, human beings have travelled through neces - sity (wars, persecutions, economic and polit - ical pressures), by vocation (religious and hu - manitarian) and for pleasure (tourism, cul - ture and sport) . A voyage intensifies our perception of self, leading us to define and re - define our identity in the liminal space where we are confronted with the Other . This often leads to a change of perspective in our atti - tudes to culture, identity and politics . The sea is an important feature of the geography of both Ireland and France, so it is perhaps un - surprising that voyages occupy such an im - portant place in the history of both countries . This volume explores aspects of French and Irish society, past and present, through the prism of the voyage . The contributors focus on a wide range of topics, including cultural tourism, literature, gastronomy and sport, in order to trace the ebb and flow of the exchanges between these two countries and their con - tinued influence on one another .

Jewish Youth Clubs in the UK, 1880-1939 Youth clubs like the Boys' Brigade became a trend in the UK in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries . The Jewish commu - nity in the UK began their own clubs to edu - cate and entertain young Jews . These clubs mirrored the examples begun within the Chris - tian community and adapted their models of social control by providing purposeful recre - ation, religious education and sporting activ - ities to cultivate young minds and bodies . Much primary source material exists on these clubs, including publicity material provided by the clubs themselves as well as oral history accounts given by former members . This book looks at the records left behind by the Jewish clubs and asks to what extent they were suc - cessful in providing Jewish education to Jew - ish youth and how this education was defined by gender . The author ultimately argues that some religious elements were evident in these clubs and that where they were included, in - clusive British identities were promoted .Ayman S. Ibrahim The Stated Motivations for the Early Islamic Expansion (622-641) A Critical Revision of Muslims' Traditional Portrayal of the Arab Raids and Conquests What motivated the early Islamic conquests? Did the Arabs fight for Allah, or for wealth and dominance? Were the conquerors principally Arabs, or specifically Muslims? Were the Mus - lim believers motivated by religious zeal to proclaim Islam to the non-Muslims? Conse - quently, was Islam spread by the sword? This is a question that has crucial implications to - day . The Stated Motivations for the Early Islamic Expansion (622-641) extensively analyzes the earliest Arabic Muslim sources to answer these and other questions . It relies on over 400 works, including primary sources written by more than 90 medieval Muslim authors, Sunni, Shiite, Sufi, and Mu'tazilite . It explores how medieval Muslim writers represented the early Arab leaders, and how much we can trust their reports . It concludes with an examination of the Qur'n's commands regarding fighting and armed jihad, and questions what later commentators suggest about fighting the non- Muslims, specifically how radical Muslim in - terpretations match or violate Islam's sacred scripture . This is the first scholarly analysis to focus on the stated motivations for the early Islamic expansion in the first two decades of Islam . It is a valuable resource for courses on Muslim history, introduction to Islam, Islamic origins and texts, classical and modern Is - lamic thought, Muhammad's biography, Is - lamic Caliphates, Muslim-Christian relations, Jews in the Muslim world, Middle Eastern his - tory, and world history .David Jacques Tom Phillips Tom Lyons Blick Mead: Exploring the 'First Place' in Amesbury, Wiltshire 2005-2016 The Stonehenge landscape is one of the most famous prehistoric places in the world, but much about its origins remains a mystery and little attention has been paid to what preceded, and thus may have influenced, its later ritual character . Now, the discovery of a uniquely long-lived Mesolithic occupation site at Blick Mead, just 2km from Stonehenge, with a de - tailed radio carbon date sequence ranging from the 8th to the late 5th millennium BC, is set to transform this situation . This book charts the story of the Blick Mead excavations, from the project's local community-based origins to a multi-univer - sity research project using the latest cutting- edge technology to address important new questions about the origins of the Stonehenge landscape . Led by the University of Bucking - ham, the project continues to retain the com - munity of Amesbury at its heart . The investi - gations are ongoing but due to the immense interest in, and significance of the site, this publication seeks to present the details of and thoughts on the findings to date .95 / \u20acA 81 .50 / \u20ac 74 .10 / \u00a3 60 .- / US-$ 90 .95 eBook (SUL) ISBN 978-1 -78707-426-2 CHF 98 .- / \u20acD 88 .95 / \u20acA 88 .90 / \u20ac 74 .10 / \u00a3 60 .- / US-$ York, 2018 .

It covers such areas of the globe as Europe, Africa and Latin America, and such periods in time as ancient Rome, seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Poland, as well as twentieth-century Amer - ica . It also analyzes clientelism in U .S . policy toward the Vietnam War and in Richard J . Da - ley's mayoral rule over Chicago . In his com - parative approach the author makes broad use of theories from such fields as history, sociol - ogy, anthropology and linguistics while con - sidering the global scale of the patron-client relationship and the immense role that clien - telism has played in world history .Samuel Merrill Networked Remembrance Excavating Buried Memories in the Railways beneath London and Berlin Networked Remembrance is the first book to explore questions of urban memory within what are some of the most commonly expe - rienced subterranean margins of the contem - porary city: underground railways . Using Lon - don's and Berlin's underground railways as comparative case studies, this book reveals how social memories are spatially produced - through practices of cartography and topony- my, memory work and memorialization, ex - ploration and artistic appropriation - within the everyday and concealed places associated with these transport networks . Through nu - merous empirical excavations, this book high - lights an array of different mnemonic actors, processes, structures and discourses that have determined the forms of \u00abnetworked remem - brance\u00bb associated with the subterranean sta - tions and sections of the London Underground and Berlin U- and S-Bahn . In turn, it invites readers to descend into the \u00abburied memo - ries\u00bb that are often imperceptible to those trav - elling by rail beneath the British and German capitals and encourages them to ask what other memories might lie latent in the infrastruc - tural landscapes beneath their feet . This book was the winner of the 2014 Peter Lang Young Scholars Competition in Memory Studies .ukasz Mikoajewski Disenchanted Europeans Polish \u00c9migr\u00e9 Writers from Kultura and Postwar Reformulations of the West As Europe experienced tumultuous change after the Second World War, two Polish exiles, Jerzy Stempowski (1893-1969) and Andrzej Bobkowski (1913-1961), discussed and rede - fined their ideas of the continent in the pages of Kultura , the Polish \u00e9migr\u00e9 review . High - lighting the changes in their writings about \u00abthe West\u00bb, \u00abthe East\u00bb and \u00abcivilization\u00bb, this book pieces together the evolution of their own self-understanding as Europeans, the overlooked shifts of accents along with si - lences and falsifications . By following these two writers' accounts of the events that led them from Poland and Ukraine to France, West Germany, Switzerland, the United States and Latin America, this study shows the tension between changing discourses and individual lives, between the wider concept of Europe and the experience of exile, emigration and belonging .

Today, the Stolpersteine constitute the world's second largest Holocaust monument . In this book the author addresses some of the most crucial is - sues raised by these memorial stones . Taking as his point of departure the philosophy of Giorgio Agamben, Michel Foucault and Mar - tin Heidegger, the author discusses the jurid - ico-political structure of the Third Reich in which the victims lived and perished and iden - tifies a new paradigm for the commemoration of Third Reich victims . The subject of com - memoration is in fact not the dignified sub - ject of law, but the naked life of the Muselmann: he who can neither live nor die . This book an - aly-ses the challenge of the problem of history that the Stolpersteine testify to, and it dis - cusses whether a unique monument such as the Stolpersteine can somehow restore what was once taken from the victims .J\u00f3zsef Pap Parliamentary Representatives and Parliamentary Representation in Hungary (1848-1918) This book focuses on the history of Hungar - ian parliamentarism . Beside classic methods of historiography, the author utilizes statisti - cal and GIS methods in his analysis . He com - bines the micro and macro levels of research . The book analyses the social composition of the MPs and introduces the Hungarian elec - toral system and its special ethnic and regional features . The author shows the operation and the problems of Hungarian parliamentarism and provides a clearer picture of the Parlia - ment in the dualistic era .Peter Raina John Sparrow: Warden of All Souls Oxford \u00abI loathe all common things\u00bb John Sparrow, Warden of All Souls, was a no - table character in post-war Oxford . He was ed - ucated in the old-time classical humanist tra - dition, and this remained his field even as the world about him changed . A man with a bril - liant mind, he is often remembered negatively - as a bogeyman to progressives because of his outspoken conservatism - and as a disap - pointment to those who expected a more solid academic achievement . It was felt that his tal - ents were too widely scattered . Presenting hitherto unpublished letters and papers which vividly evoke the contemporary Oxford scene, Peter Raina traces this scattering of talent . Sparrow may have been a generalist, but he dabbled in depth in many disciplines . He was an expert on Latin, on law, on inscriptions, on rare books and on poetry . Above all he was a tireless supporter and friend of other academ - ics and poets in a special generation . The book gives context to his circles of influence and to his uncompromising intelligence and distinct charm . Oxford, 2018 .

Hoping to find a safe haven else - where in the world, some Czechoslovak Jews turned to Australia to seek refuge . This book focuses on their struggles to survive in life- threatening situations and their efforts to reach the safety of the distant continent . Al- though the German occupation of Czechoslo - vakia has been a subject of extensive academic debate, the role of the Australian government in this international event has thus far not been examined . This book evaluates the im - pact on Australia of policies pursued by Eu - rope's leading politicians with regard to Czech - oslovakia that ultimately failed to prevent the outbreak of the Second World War . Central to the book is a discussion of Australia's policy towards the admission of Jewish refugees from Czechoslovakia . Drawing on archival sources as well as original interviews conducted with former refugees from Czechoslovakia, the au - thor offers insights into the lives and experi - ences of these Jewish refugees down under . At the same time, the book sheds light on Aus - tralia's involvement in one of the defining mo - ments of the twentieth century .Martin R\u00fctten Duty, Discipline and Leadership in the British Royal Navy Edward Riou between James Cook and Lord Nelson Edward Riou (1762-1801) was a sea officer in the British Royal Navy . As a midshipman, he participated in the third voyage of Captain James Cook . He gained popular acclaim for saving HMS Guardian after she had struck an iceberg . Riou was killed in the Battle of Copen - hagen (1801) . Lord Nelson lamented Riou's death as an irreparable loss . Later authors al - luded to him as a \u00abperfect naval officer\u00bb . This biography sheds new light on Riou's notions of his duty as a King's officer and on his meth - ods to enforce cleanliness and discipline aboard the ships he commanded . It introduces dis - senting appraisals by men who served under him . As a microhistorical study, this biogra - phy analyses Riou's leadership style and puts him into his social context by comparing him with his fellow officers .Carl E. Savage Philip Reeder Richard A. Freund Harry M. Jol (eds.) Dead Sea New Discoveries in the Cave of Letters Dead Sea: New Discoveries in the Cave of Let - ters is a multidisciplinary study of the Cave of Letters in the Nahal Hever of the Judean de - sert, a site reputed for having contained the most important finds evidencing the Bar Kokhba revolt, including the cache of bronzes found buried there and the papers of Babatha, one of the few direct accounts of the context of the Bar Kokhba revolt in the second cen - tury CE . Chapters by diverse scholars report on and discuss the ramifications of the 1999- 2001 expedition to the site, the first organized archaeological activity there since the expe - ditions at Nahal Hever by Yigal Yadin in 1960- 1961 . Using advanced technological method - ologies alongside more \u00abtraditional\u00bb archae - ological techniques, the team explored several research hypotheses . The expedition sought to determine whether the material collected in the cave could substantiate the hypothesis that the cave was a place of refuge during both the Bar Kokhba revolt and the earlier Great Revolt against the Roman Empire .

Using memoirs, diaries, gov - ernment documents, and nineteenth century histories, the author paints a vivid picture of the strengths and weaknesses, character and habits, and family backgrounds and familial legacies of the leading figures of the day . He comments, often ironically and with novel metaphors and sometimes biting criticism, on the behavior of these leaders, and he pro - vides concise observations concerning the ef - fects of their actions on the country and peo - ple of Iran . He outlines as well the policies and practices of the Qajars with respect to govern - ance and traces the changes effected in the overall governmental structure of Iran dur - ing the nineteenth and early twentieth cen - tury . The gradually increasing influence of foreign powers (primarily Great Britain and Russia) throughout this era does not escape the author's acerbic comments . Appendices provide extensive documentation on kinship relationships within the royal family . The trans - lators have added notes, bracketed in the text and in footnotes, to help orient readers less fa - miliar with Iranian history than the author's original audience . These include key dates, more detail on sources (when available), refer - ence to easily accessible additional informa - tion on key figures, and explanations of se - lected Persian sayings, customs, and practices .Andr\u00e9 Straus Leonardo Caruana de las Cagigas (eds.) Highlights on Reinsurance History Despite being one of the main pillars of the insurance industry, reinsurance is little known by the general public and is rarely the focus of academic study . In this book, the authors - economic historians and experts in the field from across Europe and Japan - seek to ad - dress this by shedding light on one of the most globalized of all economic activities . In a clear and engaging manner, they reveal the history of reinsurance in both national and interna - tional contexts, aiming to illuminate this vi - tal, but often overlooked, aspect of insurance .Joanna Tokarska-Bakir Pogrom Cries - Essays on Polish- Jewish History, 1939-1946 This book focuses on the fate of Polish Jews and Polish-Jewish relations during the Holo - caust and its aftermath, in the ill-recognized era of Eastern-European pogroms after the WW2 . It is based on the author's own ethno - graphic research in those areas of Poland where the Holocaust machinery operated . The re - sults comprise the anthropological interviews with the members of the generation of Holo - caust witnesses and the results of her own ex - tensive archive research in the Polish Insti - tute for National Remembrance (IPN) . \u00ab[This book] is at times shocking; however, it grips the reader's attention from the first to the last page .

Borderland Studies Meets Child Studies A European Encounter This book provides a comparative analysis of the history of borderland children during the 20th century . More than their parents, chil - dren were envisioned to play a crucial role in bringing about a peaceful Europe . The contri - butions show the complexity of nationalisa - tion within various spheres of borderland chil - dren's lives and display the dichotomy be - tween nationalist policies and manifest non-national practices of borderland children . Despite the different imaginations of East and West that had influenced peace negotiators after both World Wars, moreover, borderland children in Western and Central Europe in - vented practices that contributed to the cre - ation of a socially cohesive Europe .Giuseppe de Vergottini Valeria Piergigli Ivan Russo (eds.)

The research promoted by the \u00abCoordinamento Adriatico\u00bb is dedicated to a range of problems chrono - logically anchored to modernity and contem - poraneity . The study focuses on the situation of the upper Adriatic with particular atten - tion to the intellectual, political, economic, institutional, legal, administrative and artis - tic expressions of life . Karina von Tippelskirch Dorothy Thompson and German Writers in Defense of Democracy Drawing on a wealth of archival material, this book investigates work and life of Dorothy Thompson, the eminent journalist who in 1928 married American novelist Sinclair Lewis . In the following decade she became the most in - fluential American woman next to Eleanor Roosevelt . Thompson's extensive network of friends and collaborators included prominent personalities on both sides of the Atlantic: Hamilton Fish Armstrong, Lion Feuchtwanger, Marcel Fodor, Ben Huebsch, Annette Kolb, Fritz Kortner, Thomas and Carl Zuckmayer . Her prolific public engagement against Hitler and on behalf of refugees and exiled writers was based on the conviction that one was not possible without the other . A fierce opponent of isolationism, she declared that indifference towards totalitarianism or the refugee crisis would destroy democracy not only abroad but also in the United States .

This examination becomes all the more important considering that re - cent contentious issues between Pakistan and the US, such as the US drone strikes, the Kerry- Lugar Bill and the capture and killing of Osama bin Laden, have impacted on Pakistan's staunch defence of its state sovereignty . The book ex - plores this state sovereignty from three dif - ferent but interwoven vantage points . Firstly, it observes US-Pakistan relations within the patron-client framework and examines the contours of Pakistan's dependence and the va - garies of US patronal influence . Secondly, it analyses Pakistan's state sovereignty in light of changing discourse on the theme . Lastly, it examines Pakistan's state sovereignty within the purview of its fragile state status . While various contributions have provided insight on how the international community has come to view Pakistan's state fragility, this book at - tempts a detailed understanding of how the Pakistani state interprets its reputation as an ostensible fragile state .Margrit V. Zinggeler Swiss Maid The Untold Story of Women's Contributions to Switzerland's Success Swiss Maid corrects the omission of women from historical narratives of Switzerland . Women helped with herculean effort in the formation of the small but extraordinary na - tion, known for its political neutrality and sta - bility, fierce independency, multiculturalism, successful economy, and innovation . The au - thor's investigation and analysis of women's work in Switzerland correlates women's con - tributions with the country's sociopolitical and economic successes . Women have made historic change in religious institutions, do - mestic life, artisanry and trade, education, care work, the military, politics, industry and business, and service sectors . Chapters pre - sent the qualitative and quantitative data nec - essary to establish socioeconomic arguments . Women have indirectly contributed to the GNP but more importantly to social progress and the well-being of the nation . Stories of ex - emplary, pioneering women are highlighted, but silent and silenced common women are also featured and finally recognized . Although Judeo-Christian traditions placed women in subservient positions, they developed their own strength and contributed to the national economy . However, women's work was not sufficiently recognized and valued because of inadequate accounting and productivity mod - els . Gender-specific education, division of la - bor, and gendered social structures of previ - ous centuries are discussed in relation to wom - en's productivity and social changes in more recent times . Multifactor productivity con - cepts and social progress measurements shed light on the value of women's work and care . Oxford, 2018 .

Spirituality and Music Education Perspectives from Three Continents This book is the product of a long journey by a company of academics and practitioners sharing a common interest, titled the Spirit - uality and Music Education Group (SAME) . It started at the International Society for Music Education Conference in Bologna in 2008, with its first gathering in Birmingham in 2010 . This book is a product of the various meetings of this group . Since the group formed, the no - tion of spirituality has been struggling to find a way through the dominant ideology of sec - ularisation in the West to a place in a post-sec - ularising world . This book concentrates on ex - amining this issue from the position of mu - sic educators on three continents . This process can be defined as both separate from as well as part of the dominant Christian and human - ist traditions, whatever is appropriate in a par - ticular culture . The book represents a fasci - nating array of lenses through which to ex - amine the many and complex strands within the concept of spirituality . Oxford, 2017 . XII, 324 pp ., 26 .

The String Quartet in Spain This is the first monograph from a scientific perspective dealing with the String Quartets composed in Spain from the eighteenth cen - tury up to the present . It is the outcome of the research and thorough study of specific works, undertaken by twenty-one musicologists, ar - chivers and performers, together with four Spanish composers . It aims both to offer an overview of the current state of research on the primary and secondary sources available, and to trace the history of the genre by exam - ining its genesis, development and reception in the European context . All this fosters an understanding of: (1) the position of the genre in Spain from its emergence until nowadays, (2) its aesthetics and main compositional fea - tures in each period, (3) its idiosyncratic pe - culiarities, and (4) the particular challenges that it has posed along its history . In addition, other goals are: to banish some prejudices about Spanish chamber music, to contribute to the recuperation of a significant part of the Spanish musical heritage, and to provide schol - ars and performers with the musical sources, aiming at facilitating the knowledge and dif - fusion of a corpus of noteworthy yet barely known works .Gregory Myers Music and Ritual in Medieval Slavia Orthodoxa The Exaltation of the Holy Cross This project fills a void in medieval musical scholarship in the West by addressing an area that is virtually terra incognita . Based on newly-accessed primary source material and grounded in the most current scholarship, the English-language monograph-length study, Music and Ritual in Medieval Slavia Orthodoxa: The Exaltation of the Holy Cross investigates the sacred music traditions of the Orthodox Slavs (Bulgaria, Serbia and Russia) during a critical period in the cultural history of the region . The approach taken is interdiscipli - nary, drawing on recent scholarship in litur - gical studies, Byzantine and medieval Slavic history, linguistics and musicology . The study traces the dissemination of liturgical and mu - sical performance practices through the dis - parate centers of the Eastern Christian world (from Southern Italy, Balkan Peninsula to Kiev and Novgorod) . It takes into account the phys - ical locus of the chanting practices, whether urban cathedral or monastery . The medieval Slavs are treated as an autonomous cultural body within the Commonwealth of the East - ern Church . Set against the shifting liturgical backdrop of the 13 th century with its pending liturgical reform, the study addresses aspects of chant performance practice in the Slavic-speaking world . Select hymnography for the celebration are sought in the rubrics of litur - gical sources describing its placement in the services, singing personnel, the style of the hymnody and the manner of its musical exe - Vol. 22 pb .

This focus on understanding others as variously coping with the claims of particular rules at - tempts to specify the variety of \u00abattitudes to - wards a soul\u00bb as discussed in the Wittgenstein - ian tradition . The book derives from the philo- sophical tradition that considers human beings as rule-following creatures . It suggests that rules followed by other people allow for un - derstanding and sympathising with them . Coping with rules is explored as a complicated lived practice, with respect to: particularised rules holding in relation to a context or to in - dividual people, the variety of our responses to rules we are subject to, or our failure in cop - ing with them .Christine Chwaszcza Social Agency and Practical Reasons A Practice Account Tying in with major traditions of ordinary lan - guage philosophy, the author presents an ac - count of practical reasons in social agency that radically challenges the two mainstream accounts of practical reasons, the desire-be - lief model and the neo-Aristotelian \u00absub-spe - cie-boni\u00bb model of practical reasons . She ar - gues that the traditional focus on instrumen - tal rationality and teleological reasoning ignores important types of non-purposive and agent-related reasons that play a major role in rule-based context of social agency and recip - rocal interaction . The argument contributes to the analysis of promising and social con - ventions, reconstructions of acting together and shared intentions, and develops a new ac - count of institutional and rule-based agency in terms of non-moral .95 / \u20acA 54 .40 / \u20ac 49 .50 / \u00a3 41 .- / US-$ 59 .95 eBook (SUL) ISBN 978-3-631 -73727-9 CHF 65 .- / \u20acD 58 .95 / \u20acA 59 .40 / \u20ac 49 .50 / \u00a3 41 .- / US-$ 59 .95 / \u20acA 44 .20 / \u20ac 40 .20 / \u00a3 33 .- / US-$ 48 .95 eBook (SUL) ISBN 978-3-631 -71986-2 CHF 53 .- / \u20acD 47 .95 / \u20acA 48 .20 / \u20ac 40 .20 / \u00a3 33 .- / US-$ 48 .95 Philosophy 27 Magorzata Czarnocka A Path to a Conception of Symbolic Truth This book deals with correspondence truth, and offers an explanation of correspondence as a symbolization of reality . The author anal - yses those basic elements of known corre - spondence truth theories which are the cause of their inadequacy . She focuses on the theo - ries which try to modify the strongest classi - cal theories and shows that these theories are unable to free themselves from seeing corre - spondence as copying (mirroring) . The book presents a \u00absymbolic\u00bb correspondence truth theory claiming that correspondence is a spe - cific kind of symbolisation in a Cassirer-close sense, and correspondence truth is neither a copy, nor any other imitation of reality, but its symbol .Andrej D\u00e9muth (ed.) The Cognitive Aspects of Aesthetic Experience - Introduction This book is centred around the examination of whether it is possible to find cognitive as - pects or purposes in aesthetic judgements and in perceptions of beauty, and whether it is pos - sible to meaningfully develop cognitive aes - thetics as a unified science (the unification of philosophical and cognitive approaches) us - ing an epistemic background of beauty and art . The book offers various aspects of under - standing cognitive characteristics of aesthetic experience . The authors examine the distinc - tion between ordinary and aesthetic experi - ence . They regard a conceptual and semantic analysis of the concept of beauty and focuse on the differences in the evaluation of physi - cal beauty between the sexes from the per - spective of evolutionary psychology . The prob - lem of the facial attractiveness and the aes - thetic experience from the perspective of cognitive neuroscience is also object of their investigation . The contributors elaborate on beauty in music and emotionality, the prob - lem of the beauty in mathematics and the mathematics of beauty, and consider the vision of how cognitive science affects art theory .

The authors investigate the self-immola - tion of German pastor Oskar Br\u00fcsewitz and compare it with other politically motivated suicides . They portray both life and pastoral activity of Br\u00fcsewitz and analyse the motives of his suicide . Furthermore, they evaluate the judgement of this tragic event by confreres in faith and other witnesses . Besides the thor - ough analysis of Oskar Br\u00fcsewitz's case, the book inspects the genesis of self-immolation and locates it in the tradition of Buddhism and Hinduism . It depicts cases of self-immo - lations in Vietnam, the USA, India, Tibet, China, Iran, and particularly in Middle-Eastern Eu - rope (Czechoslovakia, Poland and Lithuania) . The analysis also covers cases of self-immo - lations that occurred during the Arab Spring (2011-2012) and in Bulgaria in 2013 .95 / \u20acA 41 .- / \u20ac 37 .30 / \u00a3 31 .- / US-$ 44 .95 eBook (SUL) ISBN 978-3-653-06794-1 CHF 49 .- / \u20acD 43 .95 / \u20acA 44 .80 / \u20ac 37 .30 / \u00a3 31 .- / US-$ 44 .95 Philosophy 28 Martin Doj\u00e1r Self-Transcendence and Prosociality This book is a study in philosophy of religion, which proposes a new inversion model of self- transcendence . At the same time, the study examines the relation between self-transcend - ence and prosociality in order to broaden our understanding of self-transcendence also as a moral concept relevant to human behavior and its ethical reflection . The inversion model of self-transcendence is based both on the in - tentionality analysis of consciousness and phenomenological analysis of self-transcend - ence conducted on examples of great figures of spirituality from the East and the West - an anonymous medieval Christian author of \u00abThe Cloud of Unknowing\u00bb, an Indian sage Ramana Maharshi, and a contemporary spiritual teacher Eckhart Tolle .

Echeverria Revelation, History, and Truth A Hermeneutics of Dogma The general topic of this book concerns the ontology, epistemology, and teleology of the hermeneutics of dogma . In particular, the au - thor addresses contemporary challenges faced by the necessity of maintaining the integrity of dogmatic truth of the Christian faith, of di - vine revelation and its transmission through tradition, particularly with respect to the re - lationship between history and doctrinal truth . The author integrates a theological herme - neutics, namely, the L\u00e9rinian hermeneutics of Vatican II, with a historically conscious her - meneutics . His aim is to show how we can con - sider the historical and contextual nature of dogmas, creeds and confessions while at the same time honoring their assertions of dog - matic truth that are permanent, valid and binding for all times .Alina Silvana Felea Aspects of Reference in Literary Theory Poetics, Rhetoric and Literary History The book presents the various viewpoints that poetics, literary history and Western rhetoric have adopted throughout Western history . The aim of poetics is to render the specificity of the literary discourse by either highlight - ing the extra literary generative forces or by focusing on the intrinsic study of literary works . Rhetoric chiefly places emphasis on the verbal effects of discourses whereas liter - ary history predominantly examines the tem - poral succession of the literary systems or of the literary institution . The author focuses on the three sections: poetics, rhetoric, and lit - erary history and provides an introductory study on the subject of reference . New York, 2018 .

The texts of the book present the diverse profiles of cultural normativity: from philosophical assumptions and indications relating to the sources of axiology and nor - mativity in general to analyses of selected ex - amples of social practices and the reconstruc - tion of declared or presupposed kinds of cul - tural normativity . The authors evaluate the distinction between normativity and norma - tiveness as a state of norms, they describe the relationships between cultural normativity and ethics . This issue is particularly impor - tant with regard to the 20th-century criticism of essentialism, the primacy of the cultural - ist position in humanities and the importance of the concept of difference in social sciences .Harald Haarmann Plato's ideal of the Common Good Anatomy of a concept of timeless significance This study documents various historical in - stances in the development of the concept \u00abCommon Good\u00bb . The author reflects about Plato's theory of Forms, which is infused with the idea of good, as the first principle of be - ing . Plato was not the first philosopher to ad - dress the theme of the Common Good although he was the first to construct a political theory around it . This theme has remained a central agenda for philosophers throughout the ages Frankfurt am Main, 2017 . 234 pp ., 1 table Studies in Social Sciences, Philosophy and History of Ideas. Vol. 16 hb .

The author compares modern theories to the work of Ar - istotle as the first philosopher with an exten - sive corpus and one of the predecessors both of classical theory and of modal theories of \u00abconcepts\u00bb . It is surprising that there is no equivalent term for \u00abconcept\u00bb in his work . Both path\u00eama and logos are central to his the - ory of language and thought . Therefore, this book describes which notion in Aristotle's writing comes closest to \u00abconcept\u00bb and whether or not it generates a precise theory .

Loewen Sacred Science Ritual and Miracle in Modern Medicine Sacred Science is an analysis of post-war dis - courses concerning health and illness . These discourses are an attempt to grasp the mean - ing of health in our modern human condition, and as such they provide both new insights into the genealogy of conceptualizations of both health and illness, but also serve as a vi - able hermeneutic summary of many impor - tant textual moments in the recent history of health studies, including Foucault, Gadamer, Illich, Sontag, and others . This book is the re - sult of a phenomenological disquisition of the ideas employed by health scholars and phi - losophers, and its import rests both on its uniqueness in the relevant fields and its new ideas, including 'indefinitude', 'deontic factic - ity', and illness as the experience of the simul - taneous 'inexistence' of both life and death . am 2017 . 117 pp .95 / \u20acA 28 .70 / \u20ac 26 .20 / \u00a3 22 .- / US-$ 31 .95 eBook (SUL) ISBN 978-3-631 -72727-0 CHF 35 .- / \u20acD 30 .95 / \u20acA 31 .40 / \u20ac 26 .20 / \u00a3 22 .- / US-$ 31 .95New York, 2017 .

Essays on Values and Practical Rationality Ethical and Aesthetical Dimensions The essays presented here are the outcome of research carried out by members of IFILNOVA (Institute for Philosophy of New University of Lisbon) in 2016 . The IFILNOVA Permanent Sem - inar seeks to show how values are relevant to humans (both socially and individually) . This seminar is the 'place' where different research will converge towards a unified viewpoint . This includes the discussion of the following questions: What is the philosophical contri - bution to current affairs and decisions that depend crucially on values? Can philosophy make a difference, namely by bringing prac - tical reason to bear on these affairs and deci - sion? And how to do it? Which are our scien - tific 'allies' in this enterprise; psychology, com - munication sciences, even sociology and history? This volume shows the connection between practical rationality and values and covers the dimensions ethics, aesthetics and politics .Charles R. Reid The Philosophical Future Man's Psychic Journey: End or Beginning? This book surveys the breadth of mankind's postmodern malaise, which is achieved through a discussion of the major challenges, social and psychological, which every individual faces in the effort to live fully in the twenty- first century . These challenges lay in broadly familiar domains: self- and group-conscious - ness; common man and his place in a future society in which mental activity dominates; work and leisure; knowledge and values ac - cruing from it, both for self and others; pos - sibilities in education; civilization, with its \u00abDark Age\u00bb phenomena and its dreams of pro - gress; the role of the past in contemporary life; and power, both in society and within the sovereign individual who, though bound by physical and intellectual limits, functions as a seeker after the freedom and self-fulfillment which are so wholly integral to the human condition . And finally a serious question: What fate awaits the perpetual non-conformist, whose views, however unwelcome in his own time and in a contemporary environment, may in fact anticipate future living conditions?

Peirce find unity for his pragmatist philosophy through the formulation of Scholastic Realism? The author proposes the said doctrine to be a read - ing guide, leading us through the different stages of Peirce's work as a philosopher . By un - derstanding his realist doctrine, we can see why he believed it was a viable theory for un - derstanding the problem of Universals . This book demonstrates why, in Peirce's mind, such a problem has pervaded the history of philos - ophy . The author's line of argument reveals that Scholastic Realism is crucial to the un - derstanding of his philosophy, which is a new approach in Peirce scholarship . It provides a useful framework for asking questions about reality in the same way that Peirce himself did . As a result, the author shows that Peirce's realism addresses different yet related philos- ophical problems, leading Peirce to brand the final version of his philosophy as \u00abScientific Metaphysics\u00bb . The conclusion offers an inter - pretation of the Scholastic Realism principle as a solution to Peirce's concerns - a useful idea to achieve a better theory of reality in his struggle to realize metaphysics a posteriori . Peirce's doctrine is presented alongside some of its uses, especially in the fields of abstrac - tion theory, and also in the fundamental prin - ciples of mathematics . This work should ad - vance our comprehension of the problems re - lated to Peirce's philosophy as well as shedding light on pragmatism and its origins as well as the battle between realism and nominalism .Marta Soniewicka After God - The Normative Power of the Will from the Nietzschean Perspective This book analyzes the main problems of Frie - drich Nietzsche's critical philosophy, such as the theory of being, the theory of knowledge and the theory of values . It also addresses his positive program which is based on a number of fundamental conceptions, namely the will to power, the \u00dcbermensch, bestowing virtue and the notion of the eternal recurrence . The \u00abdeath of God\u00bb must, in Nietzsche's opinion, lead to a revolution in human consciousness which requires the creation of a new frame of reference for values . To realize this aim, Nietzsche invokes the will which has the nor - mative power to create values and even to overcome time . The author sets his focus on the \u00abtragic gay science\u00bb that has never been fully elucidated and still affords new perspec - tives for interpretation .

From this point of view it is a centrally significant feature of man that we humans are creatures possessing pref - erences, desires, wants, and\u2014above all\u2014needs . The possession of people's wants and needs is clearly a factual issue . What my needs are\u2014 what I require in order to have a healthy, happy, and rewarding life\u2014is part and parcel of the conditions that define me as the sort of being that I am . Both what people happen to desire and what it is that they require of a healthy, happy, communally productive life\u2014one that engenders satisfaction to themselves and en - lists the appropriation (and even admiration) of their fellows\u2014is clearly something factual, something that can be determined by obser - vation . Furthermore, it is something objective\u2014 people do not choose what it is that they need; rather, this is something that is determined for them by their mode of emplacement in the world's scheme of things . For pragmatism, these requisites pervade the whole domain of human activity, and the issue of whether our modus operandi achieves these goals is piv - otal . The pragmatic approach to validation is thus diversified in its efficacy, and it is the aim of this book to expound and illustrate its mer - its . Both teachers and students of philosophy will find material of interest in the author's normative and original point of view .

The authors focus within this book on Benjamin as a philoso - pher, or rather as a critic of modernism entan - gled in tradition (mainly Jewish), but also as a writer . Philosophical and philological read - ings are accompanied by essays presenting the complex biography of Benjamin and numerous, often unexpected, parallels which indicate traces of his reflections in works of other artists . In consequence, \u00abThe Arcades Project\u00bb, which can be described as Benjamin's opus vitae, is not only a picturesque history of Parisian arcades of the mid-19th century . It is also a polyphonic text, composed of quota - tions, commentaries and footnotes, a discus - sion of the sense of history and the literary work of art that surprises with its meander - ing quality .

Sebastiaan A. Verschuren What Does It Look Like? Wittgenstein's Philosophy in the Light of His Conception of Language Description: Part I This book is the first part of a comprehensive study of Wittgenstein's conception of language description . Describing language was no pas - time occupation for the philosopher . It was hard work and it meant struggle . It made for a philosophy that required Wittgenstein's full attention and half his life . His approach had always been working on himself, on how he saw things . The central claim of this book is that nothing will come of our exegetical ef - forts to see what Wittgenstein's later philos - ophy amounts to if his work on describing lan - guage is not given the place and concern it de - serves . The book shows what his philosophy might begin to look like in the light of critical questions around his interest to see the end of the day with descriptions, and these things only .

The author analyzes this relationship as a conjunction rather than an opposition . Illusionistic com - positional devices were current not only in mythological, biblical and allegorical images but also in proper realistic representations of the world . At the same time, many visual in - ventions, which included illusionistic con - cepts, were presented with persuasive realism of the forms . Thus, different seventeenth-cen - tury Dutch artists - such as Hendrick Goltzius, Hendrick Vroom, Rembrandt, Vermeer - at - tempted to produce \u00abopen images\u00bb and to con - duct a visual game with their beholders .

The author ar - gues that, in order to overcome ongoing meth - odological debates in psychology, it is neces - sary to confront the problem of formalisation contained in the appropriation of methods of natural science . By doing so, the subject mat - ter of psychology - the human being - and questions about the meaning of human ex - istence can be brought to the centre of the dis - cipline . Drawing on Garfinkel, Sacks, Edwards and Potter, the author sees ethnomethodo - logically informed qualitative methods, which stem from phenomenology, as a possible al - ternative to statistical methods, but ultimately finds these methods to be just another method of formalisation . She returns to Husserlian phenomenology as a way to critique the cen - trality of method in psychology and shows that the adoption of natural scientific meth - ods in psychology is part of the larger push to formalise and objectify all aspects of human existence .

It demonstrates that the Acts of the Apostles functioned as the structure-giving hypotext for the Gospel of Matthew . Accordingly, the Gospel of Matthew is a reworking of not only the Gospel of Luke, but also, in a strictly sequential way, of the Acts of the Apostles . This strictly sequential, hypertextual dependence on Acts explains the Matthean relocations of the Marcan and Lucan material, numerous Matthean modifi - cations thereof, and many surprising features of the Matthean Gospel . Critical explanations of such features, which are offered in this mon - ograph, ensure the reliability of the new so - lution to the synoptic problem .

Aidoo Shame in the Individual Lament Psalms and African Spirituality The book explores how the rhetorical func - tion of \u00abb\u00f4\u00bb (\u00abshame\u00bb) and its cognates within twelve Individual Lament Psalms (ILP) reflect persuasive responses aimed at enhancing the relational spirituality of the psalmist . It ar - gues that the Hebrew terminology of \u00abb\u00f4\u00bb is used as a response to enhance a spirituality of relatedness . The author argues that the plea for positive shame is to enhance positive spir - ituality that leads to changes of attitude, re - pentance, faithfulness, self-knowledge, and wholeness . Negative shame influences nega - tive spirituality that leads to destruction and unworthiness . The volume reflects African Christian spirituality elucidating the psalm - ist's perception of positive shame .Kwang-hyun Cho Paul's Community Formation Preaching in 1 Thessalonians An Alternative to the New Homiletic This book increases awareness about Paul's community formation preaching which has been widely ignored in the contemporary homiletical field where the New Homiletic has exerted a strong influence . By drawing on the sociological concept of symbolic boundaries, the author demonstrates that Paul in his preaching of 1 Thessalonians used three sym - bolic resources in order to create boundaries for the formation of the Thessalonian com - munity: the kerygmatic narrative, local nar - ratives, and ethical norms . This interdiscipli - nary study suggests that contemporary preach - ers, who face the task of forming Christian communities in a post-Christian society, should preach shared narratives and communal norms for the creation of boundaries as Paul did .Theodor Dieter Andrea Grillo James Puglisi (eds.) Signs of Forgiveness, Paths of Conversion, Practice of Penance A Reform that Challenges All This volume presents contributions of the Catholic-Lutheran International Conference held at the Pontifical Athenaeum of St .

The scholars were invited to reflect together on the questions of forgive - ness, conversion and penance in the context of the ecumenical dialogue that has been go - ing on since the Second Vatican Council . Pre - cisely because stemming from a deep rethink - ing of God's forgiveness, the movement that began half a millennium ago has borne di - verse fruits in different traditions . Today, within the context of fraternal dialogue we may be able to recognize in a new way \u00abthe signs of God's mercy\u00bb .

Reading Kwame Bediako from a Postcolonial and Intercontextual Perspective The centre of gravity of World Christianity has moved to the South . The numerical growth of African Christians however does not manifest itself in academic theology . Kwame Bediako (1945-2008) is a voice from Ghana that claims a space for African contributions in theology . His quest for identity, his analysis of mission, culture and language, and his critique of a \u00abWestern value setting\u00bb raise issues that are relevant beyond his own context . His state - ment that Africa is a \u00ablaboratory\u00bb for World Christianity challenges theological debates . His Christological approach is the key to crit - ical engagement with church and society . The book analyses Bediako's work from a postco - lonial and intercontextual perspective . His contribution marks an unfinished agenda in African-European encounters . Stewart Dippel Redeemed at Countless Cost The Recovery of Iconographic Theology and Religious Experience from 1850 to 2000 This book traces a recovery of iconographic religious experience and theology in the nine - teenth century . In contrast to a logocentric re - ligious focus, which privileges texts and their analysis, an iconographic focus emphasizes the visual and narrative attributes of religion . The introduction sets the stage by discussing the profound disquietude in the wake of Brit - ain's Religious Census of 1851, along with the various responses to a perceived decline in religiosity . Two subsequent chapters deal with the resurgence of iconographic religion from the perspective of theology proper, arguing that contemporary theologians, such as those represented by the Yale School of Divinity, held to a more holistic as opposed to a frag - mentary approach towards scripture . In do - ing so they came to center the scriptural sto - ries on the events surrounding Christ's pas - sion . The remaining chapters trace the recovery of iconographic religion through American, Russian, and British culture through - out the nineteenth century . Ultimately, this book argues for a revision on the standard 'read' regarding these artists and writers which holds that they were predominantly secular in orientation .Beth E. Elness-Hanson Generational Curses in the Pentateuch An American and Maasai Intercultural Analysis Although the demographics of World Christian - ity demonstrate a population shift to the Global South, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, the pre - ponderance of biblical scholarship continues to be dominated by Western scholars in pursuit of their contextual questions that are influenced by an Enlightenment-oriented worldview . Un - fortunately, nascent methodologies used to bridge this chasm often continue to marginalize indig - contradistinction, Beth E . Elness- Hanson's research challenges biblical scholars to engage stronger methods for dialogue with global voices, as well as encourages Majority World schol - ars to share their perspectives with the West . El- ness-Hanson's fundamental question is: How do we more fully understand the \u00abgenerational curses\u00bb in the Pentateuch? The phrase \u00abvisiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation\u00bb appears four times curses remain prevalent within the Maasai world - view in East Africa, an Enlightenment-influenced worldview diminishes curses as a phenomenon . However, fuller understandings develop as we listen and learn from each other . This research develops a theoretical framework from Hans- Georg Gadamer's \u00abfusion of horizons\u00bb and ap - Ellen Herda's anthropological protocol of \u00abparticipatory inquiry\u00bb . The result - ing dialogue with Maasai theologians in Tanza - nia, builds bridges of understanding across cul - tures .

Classics in Northern European Church History over 500 Years Essays in Honour of Anders Jarlert This book provides analyses of writings which have been of major importance to Protestant, Anglican, and Roman Catholic Christianity in Western Europe . Containing nine essays by renowned European historians and theologi - ans, the anthology investigates authors rang - ing from Philipp Jakob Spener to John Robin - son . By focusing on ecclesiastical classics, the contributors shed light on general church his - torical developments from the Reformation until the twentieth century . It is often claimed that a classic is a book that everybody knows about, but no one has read . The studies pre - sented in this book show, on the contrary, that groundbreaking theological works were read by many .Michael E. Hayes An Analysis of the Attributive Participle and the Relative Clause in the Greek New Testament Many New Testament Greek grammarians as - sert that the Greek attributive participle and the Greek relative clause are \u00abequivalent .\u00bb Mi - chael E . Hayes disproves those assertions in An Analysis of the Attributive Participle and the Relative Clause in the Greek New Testament , thoroughly presenting the linguistic catego - ries of restrictivity and nonrestrictivity and analyzing the restrictive/nonrestrictive na - ture every attributive participle and rela - tive clause . By employing the Accessibility Hi - erarchy, he focuses the central and critical analysis to the subject relative clause and the attributive participle . His analysis leads to the conclusion that with respect to the restric - tive/nonrestrictive distinction these two con - structions could in no way be described as \u00abequivalent .\u00bb The attributive participle is pri - marily utilized to restrict its antecedent ex - cept under certain prescribed circumstances, and when both constructions are grammati - cally and stylistically feasible, the relative clause is predominantly utilized to relate non - restrictively to its antecedent . As a result, Hayes issues a call to clarity and correction for grammarians, exegetes, modern editors, and translators of the Greek New Testament .Daniel Hoi Ming Hui A Study of T. C. Chao's Christology in the Social Context of China (1920-1949) The aim of this book is to show that during the early half of the twentieth century, Chi - nese society was disillusioned by both inter - nal dissension and external invasion, and the churches experienced many challenges . In re - sponse to the traumatic events of 1920-1949, the Chinese theologian Prof . T . C . Chao tried to construct a 'new religion' for China, believ - ing that an indigenous Christianity would of - fer a solution to the national crisis . Chao searched for a new interpretation of Jesus Christ to make him relevant to China's con - text and social thought, and tried to develop Christology based on the encounter of West - ern Christianity, Chinese culture and social change . A personality-focused interpretation of Jesus Christ was developed, and an image of Confucian Jesus was found in his thought . Chao tried to explore his contextual Christol - ogy with the purpose of being faithful to Chris - tian faith, and being relevant to Chinese clas - sical culture and the contemporary context in order to enable intellectual Christians to contribute to the national reconstruction of Country .

Jackson The Pilgrimage and Conversion of Thomas Chalmers Following His Journey from Anstruther to Glasgow This book follows the life and work of Thomas Chalmers (1780-1847) from his childhood in Anstruther to the end of his ministerial ca - reer in Glasgow in 1823 . He became a theolo - gian, minister and Scottish reformer and is best remembered for his involvement in the Disruption of 1843 . Following Chalmers' ca - reer up to the end of his Glasgow period offers a range of valuable insights into the human, spiritual and theological dimensions of a man who was once described by Thomas Carlyle as \u00abthe chief Scotsman of his age\u00bb . It has been decades since Chalmers and his work have re - ceived any notable scholarly attention and this book attempts to unravel his complicated nature by pursuing a forensic investigation into his communitarian ideology and attitude towards social reform . New facts have come to light, not least the apparent reversion of Chalmers' conversion, recognised and dis - cussed here for the first time, allowing the reader to form a more accurate picture of his legacy within Scottish religious history . As the author meticulously unravels his subject's disturbing psychological mindset, he provides a compelling critique of the Church of Scot - land and examines the role of John Bunyan's Mr Christian as Chalmers' model and mentor .Robert Lilleaasen Old Paths and New Ways Negotiating Tradition and Relevance in Liturgy The relationship between tradition and rele - vance is a core feature in religious practice in general and public worship in particular . On the one hand, worship is a bearer of religious traditions, i .e . traditions are maintained in the practice of public worship, and the wor - ship enables individuals to connect with these traditions . On the other hand, it is a quest for relevance in public worship . In order to main - tain existing worshippers and attract new par - ticipants, congregations have to consider their ability to connect their core values to the needs and expectations of existing and potential participants . This dual purpose of the worship causes a need for negotiation, and it is this ne - gotiation between tradition and relevance that this book investigates . Old Paths and New Ways is a case study of the negotiation be - tween tradition and the quest for relevance in liturgy .Ndikho Mtshiselwa To Whom Belongs the Land? Leviticus 25 in an African Liberationist Reading The main question of this book, which focuses on the role of the Old Testament in the South African context, is: If reread from an African liberationist perspective in the context of land redistribution and socio-economic justice in South Africa, could the Israelite Jubilee legis - lation in Leviticus 25:8-55 offer liberating and empowering possibilities for the poor in South Africa? The exegesis of Leviticus 25:8-55 in which the historical-critical method is em - ployed lays the foundation for the contextu - alisation of the issues arising from the exege - sis . Furthermore, within the African libera - tionist framework, the South African context serves as a lens to interpret Leviticus 25:8-55 . The striking parallels between the contexts from which the text of Leviticus 25:8-55 emerged and the context of the modern reader of the Bible in South Africa are shown . In the end, it is argued that when re-read from an Af - rican liberationist perspective and in the con - text of the land redistribution and socio-eco - nomic justice discourse, Leviticus 25:8-55 can contribute positively to the redress of inequal - ity and consequently to poverty alleviation in South Africa .

Muindi Pentecostal-Charismatic Prophecy Empirical-Theological Analysis Prophecy is a major theme both in Scripture and in Church doctrine . However, prophecy is seen by many as an ancient biblical phe - nomenon which is now redundant . There is, conversely, a form of prophecy that is very much alive in the Pentecostal-Charismatic wing of the Church . Although the Pentecos - tal-Charismatic tradition is billed as the fast - est growing movement in Church history, it has received scant attention in Pentecostal Studies in terms of its focus on Charismatic Prophecy . This book is an attempt to explore the notion of charisms of the Holy Spirit . It ex - amines, from an empirical-theological per - spective, the nature and significance of the phenomenon of Charismatic Prophecy as re - portedly manifested in Pentecostal Charis - matic liturgical settings in an African context .Paul Mutume Women's Emancipation in Africa - Reality or Illusion? A Case Study of Mbarara, Western Uganda Women's emancipation in Uganda is one of the most successful ventures an African coun - try has ever undertaken . The reality of its suc - cess, however, remains a challenge in a soci - ety with a long-held structure of patriarchy and institutional, cultural beliefs . After a crit - ical analysis, the study challenges policy mak - ers to ensure an environment free from all forms of violence and oppression against women - be it physical, economic, social, re - ligious or psychological - and to empower them through education, ensure their finan - cial independence and enhance their psycho - physical stability . The study gives credit to women of all ages and indeed all walks of life who have effectively turned their sufferings into joy . It critically analyses the institutional mechanisms and concludes suggesting con - crete measures and strategies towards gender mainstreaming .Susan Paun de Garc\u00eda Donald R. Larson (eds.) Religious and Secular Theater in Golden Age Spain Essays in Honor of Donald T . Dietz The essays in this book honor the seminal con - tributions to the field of early modern Span - ish drama of Donald T . Dietz, who has devoted his career to the promotion of classical theater, not just as dramatic poetry but as vibrant per - formance art . Written by a variety of respected scholars and never before published, the twenty-two essays, organized into six sections, present a wide variety of interests, approaches, and methodologies, including ideological and theological exegesis, poetic analysis, cultural studies, and semiotics of theater . The first sec - tion reviews Dietz's impact on the field of Co- media studies, where he played a critical role in moving the discussion from page to stage . The next two sections explore facets of reli - gious theater, including autos sacramentales and comedias de santos , as well as religious aspects of secular theater . Essays from the other sections explore questions of reading and of staging classical theater, in the origi - nal Spanish, in English translation, and in ad - aptation for the stage and for radio, as well as theoretical and practical approaches to the pedagogy of performance .

The Russian Orthodox Church in post-Soviet canon law suggests a comprehensive cultural program of moder - nity . Researched through the paradigms of multiple modernities and post-secularity, the ROC appears to be quite modern: she reflects on herself and the secular environment, em - ploys secular language, appeals to public rea - son, the human rights discourse, and achieve - ments of modern science . The fact that the ROC rejects some liberal Western develop - ments should not be understood in the way that the ROC rejects modernity in general . As a legitimate player in the public sphere, the ROC puts forward her own - Russian Ortho - dox - model of modernity, which combines transcendence and immanence, theological and social reasoning, an afterlife strategy and cooperation with secular actors, whereby es - chatology and the human rights discourse be - come two sides of the same coin .Abraham Rotstein Myth, Mind and Religion The Apocalyptic Narrative The French anthropologist Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss scoured the Amazon forest for the myths of its primitive peoples . He found that a certain logic governed the construction of these myths\u2014his mythologique ; he regarded this logic as innate in the human mind and thus universal . Despite this claim of universality, L\u00e9vi-Strauss deliberately sidestepped the myths of the biblical religions as well as the myths of modern societies . This proved to be a missed opportunity since these myths lend them - selves very well to his mode of analysis . The apocalyptic narrative is the ongoing myth of Western society . It makes its first appearance in the Bible in the story of the Exodus and in the Passion of Christ . Its characteristic feature is its opening scenario of one or another form of unendurable oppression\u2014 whether the Pharaoh in Egypt for the Jews or the bondage of the body for Christians . \u00abLord and servant\u00bb is the binary pair that prevails and through a process of inversion leads to the Kingdom of Heaven (celestial or terrestrial) . The work of Augustine and Luther follow suit as surpris - ingly enough, do the Lutheran Hegel and the Hegelian Marx . In every case, the initial op - pression is inverted and a sublime destina - tion ensues . A demonic version of the same apocalyptic narrative appears in the 1930s . The Nazis point to their own tale of \u00aboppres - sion\u00bb of the German people and in the same fashion proclaim the Dritte Tausendj\u00e4hrige Reich . It is a terrible irony but perhaps L\u00e9vi- Strauss's mythologique may help us to see through the \u00abglass\u00bb a little less darkly .Christopher David Shaw On Mysticism, Ontology, and Modernity A Theological Engagement with Secularity This new study offers a serious and long-over - due examination of the unstable bifurcation between theology and secularity . Rather than understanding these two formative elements of culture to be in a constant state of opposi - tion, the author chooses an alternative path toward their reconciliation . In this way, a con - structive relationship is developed between secular and theological ideas wherein they symbiotically challenge one another in such a way as to create new and/or re-examined opportunities for thinking about God, the world, and, indeed, the self . The book first of all embarks upon a hermeneutical reading of Meister Eckhart's defining statement that \u00abBe - ing is God\u00bb and ultimately arrives (via Kant, Hegel, Gadamer, Henry, and others) at a mys - tically informed understanding of God's pres - ence both in the world and in the \u00abheart and mind\u00bb of the human experience - an under - standing that defies conventional categories and static cultural identities . It is an impor - tant study of the history, the present, and the future of religious thought, presenting a hope - ful image of unity and love in a world that has been for too long divided by difference .

The fig-tree story plays a pivotal role in understanding the stories im - mediatlely preceding and following it . It re - verses the mode of Jesus' entry from being tri - umphal to untriumphal, and convinces the first Markan readers to feel at ease in confront - ing Jesus' outrage in the Temple . The way in which Jesus entered Jerusalem contradicts the common description of the entry as a trium - phant one . Additionally, the story finds a proper solution to the problem of Jesus' actions in the Temple being shockingly in contrast to his overall character as revealed through the Markan Gospel .Stephen Strehle Forces of Secularity in the Modern World Volume 1 Stephen Strehle is a leading scholar of church/ state issues . In this volume, he focuses his rig - orous historical analysis and philosophical acumen upon a topic of great interest today and source of cultural wars around the globe\u2014 the process of secularization . The book starts with a discussion of early capitalism and how it saw the real world functioning well-enough on its own principles of individual struggle and self-interest, without needing religious or moral principles to meddle in its affairs and eventually dispelling the need for any intel - ligent design or providential orchestration of life through the work of Darwin . The book then discusses the growth of the secular point of view: how historians dismissed the impact of religion in developing modern culture, how scientists conceived of the universe running on self-sufficient or mechanistic principles, and how people no longer looked to the prov - idential hand of God to explain their suffer - ing . The book ends with a discussion of how the Deist concept of human autonomy became a political policy in America through Jeffer - son's concept of a wall of separation between church and state and how the US Supreme Court proceeded to dismiss the importance of religion in shaping or justifying the values of the nation and its laws . The book is acces - sible to most upper-level and graduate stu - dents in a wide-variety of disciplines, keeping technical and foreign words to a minimum and leaving scholarly details or debates to its extensive notes .Sylvester Uche Ugwu Church and Civil Society in 21st Century Africa Potentialities and Challenges Regarding Socio-Economic and Political Development with Particular Reference to Nigeria In view of the unprecedented level of socio - economic and political underdevelopment plaguing the African continent, there remains one key area in the polity with great poten - tials which remains largely untapped: civil society . What can it contribute to the allevia - tion of the burden of underdevelopment in Africa? What is the place of the Church in civil society, particularly in Nigeria? Can there be a sustainable cooperation between the Church and other civic groups in the country for the purpose of development? Using mainly liter - ature-based methods, this work seeks to dig into the understanding of civil society from the ancient Aristotelian \u00abpolis\u00bb to its 21 st cen - tury African idea . It discusses the place of the Church in relation to the social question . Some of the vital areas of the Church's civil societal involvement ad intra and with other civil groups are examined, using the Caritas' struc - tural principle of approach . Some major chal - lenges hindering the vital input of the two in - stitutions towards sustainable socioeconomic and political development are x-rayed . It ex - tensively exposes the immense potentials for development through the cooperation be - tween the two institutions . Conversely, some enormous challenges facing civil societal co - operation for development are discussed . Fi- nally, research goes on to put forward some vital insights, ideas and suggestions for the fruitful cooperation towards the realization of the potentials for national development .

This unfortunate status quo contrasts with a crucial place of the theory of knowledge in the thought of such prominent authors as Origen and the Cappadocian fathers . This book surveys the patristic epistemological discourse in its various settings . In the context of the Church history it revolves around the Euno - mian controversy, Eunomius' language the - ory and Gregory Nazianzen's cognitive the - ory, where the ideas of Apostle Paul were cre - atively combined with the Peripatetic teaching . In the framework of Biblical exegesis, it touches upon the issues of the textual criticism of the Homeric and Jewish scholarship, which had significantly shaped Origen's paradigm of the Biblical studies .Gabriel T. Wankar The Dual Reality of Salvation and the Church in Nigeria This book proposes an approach to the con - nection between salvation theory and eccle - sial spirituality in Nigeria, indicating how the factors of economic, political, and religious co-existence are related, with implications for a deeper understanding of salvation . Consid - ering African Synods I and II, the author pro - poses a paradigm shift toward a new pastoral option for the Church in Nigeria in the pro - gram for seminary formation, which prior - itizes strengthening of ecumenical/interreli - gious structures of dialogue and collabora - tion as a process of rapprochement to enable an emancipatory praxis to come to existence for the Church's ministry and witnessing to \u00abbecome flesh\u00bb in the reality of people's lives . This entails a deeper spiritual and practical understanding of religion, couched in terms of dialogue that translates into alliances and cooperation for the common good based on ties common to all religions and, most impor - tantly, the possibility of forming synergies with civil society organizations in pursuit of the common good .Aaron Yom Number, Word, and Spirit Rethinking T . F . Torrance's Theological Science From a Pneumatological Perspective This book contributes to the study of Thomas F . Torrance by promoting his realist agenda, and the same time, expanding his program that takes into consideration a well-nuanced pentecostal spirituality . More specifically, it assesses the foundational methodological framework of Torrance's scientific approach to theology for the purpose of constructing a triadic methodological structure for theolog - ical science . In doing so, it not only recognizes Torrance's efforts to bridge the gap between science (number), word (hermeneutics), and spirit (theo-philosophy), but also critically re - views his theo-scientific project by identify - ing his restrictive tendencies that limit the full outworking of human spirituality and im - agination . Based upon this analysis, this study constructively modifies Torrance's theologi - cal science by complementing his realist agenda with the pentecostally driven pneumatolog - ical imagination . In the final analysis, Num - ber, Word, and Spirit argues that theological science grounded on the pneumatological im - agination can expand the restrictive tenden - cies of Torrance's theo-scientific project, thereby giving rise to a triadic analogical approach that recognizes the interplay of ontologic, in - formal logic, and translogic for the develop - ment of a theo-scientific method . The book can be used as a secondary reading material for the courses in theological method, inter - disciplinary studies, and faith and science di - alogue .
