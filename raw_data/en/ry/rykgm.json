Perdomini-IOC S.p.A. reserves the right to change the characteristics of its products without forewarning. Company with Quality and Environment Management systems in compliance with the UNI EN ISO 9001 and UNI EN ISO 1 4001 norms As a recent change in the Codex Oenologique International Organisation International de la Vigne et du Vin (OIV), the use of CMC is allowed for tartaric stabilization of wines and sparkling wines. Consequently, Perdomini -IOC offers Crystal Balance sol 5%, a sodium carboxymethylcellulose solution, highly purified and specifically se - lected for the treatment of wine. Inhibition of crystal formation and growth and stability over time Crystal Balance sol. 5% is a protective colloid which inhibits the forma - tion, or nucleation, and the subsequent growth of tartrate crystals in wine. CMC is a polysaccharide with a balance between the degree of polymerization (PG), degree of substitution (SG) and uniformity, in or - der to provide an effective stabilization with low viscosity and reduced gels formation. Its rheological features allow a high solubility and a re - duced preparation time becoming fitting with enological applications. Moreover, the effectiveness of Crystal Balance sol. 5% is maintained even when the product is exposed to varying temperature conditions, providing a longer stability over time. How and when to use Crystal Balance To facilitate the operation in cellars, Perdomini-IOC has developed a 5% sodium carboxymethylcellulose solution, allowing to avoid the dissolu - tion step. The best performance is achieved using Crystal Balance sol. 5% before bottling of wines already stable as protein content. Crystal Balance sol. 5% is not recommended if the wine is treated or should be treated with lysozyme Crystal Balance and microfiltration Perdomini-IOC has studied the impact of wine on the microfiltration membranes prior to bottling, after the addition of Crystal Balance sol. 5%. The data confirm that Crystal Balance sol. 5% did not significantly alter the filterability of the wine.Crystal Balance sol. 5% 5% CARBOXYMETHYLCELLULOSE (CMC) SOLUTION In Compliance with International Codex Oenologique. Not derived from genetically modified organisms Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC): a new oenological yellow Doses 100-200 ml/hl with a dose admitted of 200 ml/hl (OIV, OENO 2/2008, EC/606/2009). Instructions for use Add directly to wine, mixing until the solution is completely homogeneous. Storage Store in a cool and dry environment. Once opened, keep the package properly closed in a cool and dry environment. Packing Cod. 110320 - 20 kg "}
