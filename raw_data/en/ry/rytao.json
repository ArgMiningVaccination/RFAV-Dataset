Many pathogens have adapted their transmission mechanisms to take advantage of behaviours that are essential for the survival of the host species, such as eating, breathing and sexual reproduction, whereas others use insect vectors to inoculate themselves into their mam malian hosts. Some pathogens have evolved to exploit the sexual contact of the host organism for their transmission. The spread of this class of pathogen, which causes sexu ally transmitted infections (STIs), depends on the sexual maturity and promiscuity of humans. The WHO (World Health Organization) estimates that one million new cases of STIs occur every day. Y et, for the most part, vaccines that prevent STIs are not available. Compared with the intestinal mucosa, the female and male genital tracts are covered by distinct epithelial cell layers and types of mucus, are inhabited by unique microflora and use distinct innate and adaptive effector mechanisms. Unlike STIs that are caused by bacterial pathogens and that can be treated with antibiotics, there are no cures for viral STIs. Currently available antiviral agents are un able to eliminate the latent pool of viruses, such as HIV1 or herpes simplex virus (HSV). This Review is not intended to be a comprehensive overview of vaccines against STIs. Instead, I use three examples of major human sexually transmitted viral pathogens \u2014 HIV1, human papillomavirus (HPV) and HSV type 2 (HSV2) \u2014 to describe our current understanding of modes of viral entry, innate detection, initiation of adaptive immune responses and virus clearance. Furthermore, I dis cuss how understanding the innate and adaptive immune mechanisms of protection in the genital mucosa could be applied to the rational design of vaccines against STIs.Sexually transmitted virus infections Human infection with sexually transmitted viruses. Several viruses use the genital mucosa as a portal of entry into human hosts. Clinically relevant sexually transmitted viruses (STVs) include: HIV1, which causes AIDS; HPV and genital warts; HSV , which causes genital herpes; and hepatitis B virus. The epidemiology of these STVs has been covered extensively elsewhere1. Here, I briefly describe the STVs and their impact on human populations. HIV1 is a member of the lentivirus family of retro viruses, and structurally consists of an envelope that encloses a capsid, which contains two copies of a positive single stranded RNA genome (~9 kb). HIV is transmitted by sexual contact (for example, vaginal, penile and rectal contact), through blood or by vertical transmission from an infected mother to her unborn child. Since its discovery in the early 1980s, AIDS has claimed the lives of more than 25 million people and has orphaned 14 million children in sub Saharan Africa alone2,3. In endemic countries, HIV1related deaths and the reduced fertility rate of HIV positive women have dramatically affected life expectancy and population demographics3 (FIG. 1) . Genital herpes is caused by infection with HSV1 or HSV2. HSV is an enveloped virus that contains a dou blestranded DNA (dsDNA) genome (~150 kb) in the capsid. HSV is transmitted by mucosal contact through vaginal, penile and oral routes. Although HSV1 is tra ditionally associated with oral herpes, adults without immunity to HSV1 who practice oral sex are at risk of genital HSV1 infection4. Vertical transmission of HSV2 from infected mothers to newborn infants Department of Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine, 300 Cedar Street, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, USA. email: akiko.iwasaki@yale.edu doi:10.1038/nri2836 Published online 10 September 2010Antiviral immune responses in the genital tract: clues for vaccines Akiko Iwasaki Abstract | Mucosal surfaces are exploited as a portal of entry into hosts by a wide variety of microorganisms. Over the past decade, an advanced understanding of the immune system of the gastrointestinal and the respiratory mucosae has been gained. However, despite the fact that many viruses are transmitted sexually through the genital tract, the immune system of the male and female genital mucosae has received much less attention. Here, I describe and highlight differences in the innate and adaptive immune systems of the genital and intestinal mucosae, and discuss some of the challenges we face in the development of successful vaccines against sexually transmitted viral pathogens.R E V I E W S NATURE REVIEWS | IMMUNOLOGY VOLUME 10 | OCTOBER 2010 | 699 \u00a9 20 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In the USA, the prevalence of genital herpes is rising at an alarming rate (FIG. 2a) . HPV is a member of the Papillomaviridae family and consists of a capsid that contains a circular dsDNA genome (~8 kb). Following sexual contact, HPV estab lishes productive infections only in the stratified epithe lium of the skin or the mucous membranes. Although the majority of the nearly 200 known types of HPV cause an asymptomatic infection in most people, 'high risk' types of HPV are the causative agents of more than 90% of cases of cervical cancer, which is the second leading cause of death among women worldwide. High risk HPV types, such as HPV16 and HPV18, also and HPV types cause genital warts5. Although HPV infection is also common in men, it is usually asymptomatic. HPV is the most common STI in the world and causes 260,000 deaths annually, 80% of which occur in developing countries6. Anatomy of the female and male genital mucosae. Although men can also become infected, the global prevalence of HSV2 and virus associated morbidity is significantly higher in women (FIG. 2b) , and HPV causes morbidity and mortality almost exclusively in women. The underlying mechanisms for such gender based dif ferences are undoubtedly complex and include differ ences in societal rank, behaviour, sexual practices, sex hormone regulation of the immune system, exposure dose and the route of infection. For example, in many countries, women are less able to negotiate condom use and are more likely to be subjected to non consensual sex. In the genital tract of pre menopausal women, sex hor mones control the expression of many genes, including cytokines and chemokines, and dictate cellular composi tion, immunoglobulin secretion and antigen presentation during the menstrual cycle7. In addition to these factors, anatomical differences between male and female genitalia have an important role in the acquisition and progression of disease following STV exposure (FIG. 3) . Furthermore, circumcision considerably reduces STI rates in men8 (BOX 1) . In both sexes, anal intercourse has been shown to be important for the transmission of STIs. A compari son of the genital and rectal mucosae reveals important barrier differences in these organs (FIG. 3; TABLE 1) . Mucosal surfaces can be generally divided into two types \u2014 type I mucosal surfaces (such as those in the gut and the lungs) are covered by a simple columnar epithe lium, whereas type II mucosal surfaces (such as those in the vagina, eyes and mouth) have a protective stratified squamous epithelial laye r9 (TABLE 1) . The female genital tract consists of type II mucosa (for example, the outer vagina, inner vagina and ectocervix) and type I mucosa (for example, the endocervix and uterus). The male Figure 1 | Effect of HIV1 infection on human demographics. In countries with a high prevalence of HIV1, life expectancy at birth has decreased dramatically. In southern Africa, the average life expectancy at birth is now less than 50 years in the subregion and less than 40 years in Zimbabwe3. By contrast, the comparatively smaller HIV1 epidemics in western Europe and Asia have barely affected life expectancy trends in these regions, and average life expectancy continues to increase steadily.

Other important dif ferences between the two types of mucosa include the presence (type I mucosal surfaces) or absence (type II mucosal surfaces) of IgA transport mechanisms. In addi tion to the difference in epithelial cells, the sub mucosa of type I and type II tissues differ with respect to cell composition and the presence (type I mucosal sur faces) or absence (type II mucosal surfaces) of mucosa associated lymphoid tissues (MALTs). In general, the submucosa that underlies type epithelia constitutively macrophages and mem ory lymphocytes, whereas the submucosa of the type II tissues contains a sparse network of DCs, macrophages and rare lymphocytes. The uterus contains lymphoid aggregates of unknown function that consist of a B cell core that is surrounded by CD8+ T cells. These aggregates become enlarged during the secretory phase7. The uncircumcised glans penis is covered by a loose fold of skin that is known as the foreskin or prepuce (FIG. 3b) . During sexual intercourse, the foreskin is pulled back to expose the glans. The penis is covered by external skin, except for the inner foreskin that consists of a typical type II mucosal epithelium10. The mucosal surface of the foreskin is similar to the inner vaginal canal and may be more susceptible to invasion by STIs. The foreskin fold could also trap infectious materials, providing a greater window of opportunity for STI pathogens to enter the host. Circumcision surgically removes the foreskin just below the glans. The glans penis of a circumcised male is covered by the protective cornified external skin (FIG. 3c) . Accumulating data suggest that male circumcision has longterm beneficial health effects for both males and females by limiting the spread of STIs (BOX 1) . In contrast to the genital tract, the rectum is part of the gastrointestinal tract and shares its type I mucosal characteristics (FIG. 3d) . Large aggregates of submucosal lymphoid follicles are present in the rectal mucosa that is adjacent to the anorectal junction11, which defines the area where the columnar epithelia of the rectum end and the squamous epithelia of the anal canal begin. The lower half of the anorectal canal is lined by stratified squa mous (type II) epithelium, providing a stronger physical barrier than the upper half. Invasion mechanisms used by STVs. STVs have evolved to use the biology of the genital mucosae for their trans mission among humans. HIV1 uses the CD4 molecule as its receptor and CCchemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) or CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) as co receptors to enter a host target cell. After the viral genome has been reverse transcribed into DNA, it is integrated into the genome of the infected host cells. The activation of CD4+ T cells induces the transcription of the pro virus, which leads to viral synthesis and the release of new virus particles. Several modes of entry have been suggested, including: transcytosis through a microfold cell (M cell), which is only present above the MALT in type I mucosal epithelia; uptake by DCs, which extend dendrites into the mucosal cavity; and entry through microabrasion in the epithelial layer12. Preexisting gen ital lesions that are caused by other STIs also contribute considerably to increasing the risk of HIV1 transmis sion13. Most women who acquire HIV1 infection do so through heterosexual contact with infected men. Virus entry probably occurs near to the transformation zone of the endocervix, where the virus first replicates in local CD4+ T cells and sets up founder cells14. Homogeneity Figure 3 | Anatomy of the genital mucosae and anorectal canal. a | The female genital tract consists of the upper reproductive tract (the uterus and cervix) and the lower reproductive tract (the vagina).

Founder virus A transmitted virus, or a virus that gives rise to all virus quasispecies in an infected individual. Goblet cell A mucus-producing cell that is located in the epithelial cell lining of the intestine and lungs.of the founder virus indicates that a single virus is responsible for establishing infection in humans15,16. The virus can subsequently disseminate through the lymph to local lymph nodes and to the systemic cir culation. However, the vaginal route of transmission is estimated to only be successful in between 1 in 200 and 1 in 2,000 encounters, probably owing to the protec tive type II epithelial layer that is present in this tissue. The risk of HIV1 transmission from females to males is even less, particularly in circumcised males (BOX 1) . By contrast, HIV1 can enter the host through the rectal mucosa much more efficiently and transmission rates are estimated to be as high as 1 in 10 encounters13. This difference in transmission rate probably reflects the fact that the rectal mucosa is covered by only a single layer of columnar epithelia that, following the physi cal trauma that occurs during anal intercourse, can allow viral access to the systemic circulation. The rectal mucosa also contains many memory CD4+ T cells in the lamina propria and MALT that could be targets for HIV1 infection (FIG. 3d) . HSV1 and HSV2 enter the human host through various mucosal surfaces, including the vagina and the penis, and first infect the type II epithelial layer. HSV uses multiple cell surface proteins for entry, including heparan sulphate chains on cell surface proteoglycans, a member of the tumour necrosis factor receptor family and two members of the immunoglobulin superfamily that are related to the poliovirus recepto r17. Primary replication in the keratinocytes results in the subse quent infection of sensory ganglia through nearby nerve endings. The de enveloped virus migrates to the nerve cell body through retrograde axonal trans port. By residing in the ganglia, HSV can establish a lifelong latent infection in the host. Immune suppres sion results in reactivation of the virus, which causes lesions in the external genitalia. Notably, HSV virions are shed even in asymptomatic individuals18, which increases the likelihood of transmission from carriers to their non infected partners. HPV infects the genital skin of the vagina or cervix in women and the penile shaft (for example, the glans and foreskin) in men19. To infect, HPV requires dis ruption of epithelial cell integrity, which allows access to the basement membrane. HPV uses an unconven tional mechanism for infection in that it first binds to the basement membrane for subsequent entry into the basal keratinocytes. Following binding to the base ment membrane, the virus undergoes a conformational change that results in cleavage of a capsid protein and the transfer of the capsid to the epithelial cell surface20. After HPV has infected the basal keratinocyte stem cells, the virus uses the differentiation programme of the epi thelial cells to complete its life cycle5. HPV virions are shed from the superficial layer of the type II mucosa and are then transmitted to sexual partners. Most sub clinical infections of HPV regress spontaneously and only a very small percentage of HPV infected women, if left untreated, go on to develop cervical cancer over a period of many years. Innate immunity in the genital tract Mucus. Mucus covers the internal surface of the vaginal tract, penis and anal canal and functions to trap infec tious microorganisms and pollutants. Mucus is made up of mucins, which are complex, high molecular mass glycoproteins that contain at least one and sometimes multiple protein domains, which are sites of extensive Oglycan attachment. In the type I mucosal surfaces (for example, the gut and lungs), the goblet cell is the main producer of mucus, whereas in the type II genital mucosal surfaces (such as the vagina, the lower half of the Box 1 | Male circumcision and transmission of sexually transmitted infections Three randomized clinical trials have evaluated male circumcision for the prevention of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in Africa8. The trials reported that male circumcision decreased HIV1 acquisition by 53-60%, herpes simplex virus type 2 acquisition by 28-34%, and the prevalence of human papillomavirus by 32-35%. Among the female partners of circumcised men, bacterial vaginosis and Trichomonas vaginalis infection were reduced by 40% and 48%, respectively. Genital ulcer disease was also reduced among males and their female partners. In addition, male circumcision reduced urinary tract infection, penile cancer and hygiene related conditions (such as phimosis, paraphimosis and balanitis)108. The underlying mechanism for such enhanced protection in circumcised men is unknown, but it could be related to the absence of the type II mucosal surface; the only mucosal non keratinized epithelium of the circumcised penis is the stratified squamous cells of the urethral opening that are located near to the external meatus.

During ovula tion, crypts in the cervix secrete mucus that descends and covers the vaginal canal; cervical mucus is less acidic and more conducive to sperm movement through the cervix. In addition to mucins, mucus contains various other defence molecules, including immunoglobulins, complement, antimicrobial peptides, lysozyme and lactoferrin (discussed below). Antimicrobial factors. Bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses encounter a variety of antimicrobial arsenals in the mucus layer. Microbicidal molecules, such as com plement components and antimicrobial peptides, can directly bind to and kill microorganisms before they can reach the host epithelial cell layer. The epithelial cells, glands of the cervix and neutrophils produce most of the antimicrobial peptides that are present in the vaginal fluid, including calprotectin, lysozyme, lactoferrin, secre tory leukoprotease inhibitor, human defensins21. In the gut mucosa, a similar array of including lysozyme, defensins, cathelicidins and secretory phospholipase A2, have an important role in preventing the outgrowth of the commensal bacteria and also in the defence against pathogenic bacteria22. The main producer of anti microbial factors in the small intestine is the Paneth cell , which is absent in the rectal mucosa; instead, rectal epithelial cells are the main source of antimicrobial peptides. Endogenous flora. Commensal bacteria are essential for shaping intestinal immune responses in both health and disease23. Recent advances in 16S ribosomal RNA sequenc ing and deep metagenomic sequencing have enabled tax onomic identification of human microbial communities. Human gut associated communities are dominated by only four phyla \u2014 Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria24. More than 1,000 species of bacteria are estimated to live in the gut of humans 25; in addition to providing key metabolic, trophic and defence functions in the mammalian host, the microbiota shape the gut immune system in various ways (BOX 2) .In contrast to the intestinal tract, the normal vaginal flora is predominately composed of Lactobacillus spe cies26, which carry out key functions for the female host. Vaginal hydrogen peroxide producing lactobacilli pre vent the outgrowth of harmful bacteria that can cause bacterial vaginosis. Furthermore, lactobacilli maintain the acidic pH (pH 3.8-4.0) of the vaginal fluid through lactic acid production. The acidic vaginal pH provides protection against the pathogens that (mainly the gen era Pseudomonas and Gardnerella , respectively) also con stitute substantial portions of the vaginal flora in healthy females. The vaginal microbiota is not homogenous in an individual but differs significantly depending on the anatomical location28. However, the influence of the vaginal flora on the adaptive immune responses to STIs is unknown and will be an important factor to consider for vaccine responsiveness. Innate immune cells. In the genital mucosa, various innate immune cells provide defence against invading pathogens. In the steady state, T cells , macrophages, Langerhans cells and DCs survey the type II epithelia of the vaginal and anal canals (FIG. 4) . In the uterus, spe cialized natural killer (NK) cells and regulatory T cells regulate fetal development and potentially contribute to antiviral defence. Following infection, several cell types are mobilized to the vaginal tissue, including neutrophils, monocytes, plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and NK cells. At later timepoints, antigen specific T and B cells enter the tissue to provide pathogen specific immune defence. In the steady state, Langerhans cells in the epithelium and DCs in the submucosa are highly phagocytic and express several pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that can rec ognize a wide array of microorganisms. After pathogen recognition through PRRs, DCs and Langerhans cells undergo a maturation programme and migrate to the draining lymph nodes to prime naive T and B cells. Certain cell types have been shown to have a particu larly important role in combating STVs. During HSV2 infection, a large number of neutrophils are recruited to the infected vaginal mucosa and are required for protec tion during primary and secondary challenge29. NK cells are also important in controlling herpesviruses; individu als who lack NK cells or have defective NK cell function have increased susceptibility to herpesvirus infections30. Intraepithelial T cells also contribute to immune pro tection against vaginal challenge with HSV2 (REF. 31) . NK cells have an important role in defence against HIV1 as shown by the evasion mechanisms that are used by HIV1 to specifically prevent NK cell recognition of infected cells32. Innate recognition of STVs. Similar to other mucosal surfaces, multiple PRRs that are expressed by various cell types ensure surveillance of most pathogens that enter the genital mucosa. Research over the past decade has identified several PRR family members, including the Tolllike receptors (TLRs), RIGI like receptors (RLRs) Box 2 | Role of the commensal flora in gut immune homeostasis The commensal flora help to shape the immune system of the intestinal mucosa. Germ free mice have underdeveloped gut associated lymphoid tissues, including Peyer's patches, isolated lymphoid follicles and mesenteric lymph nodes109. Commensal bacteria are detected by innate pattern recognition receptors and maintain the homeostasis of intestinal epithelial cell turnover and integrity110. Lamina propria dendritic cells (DCs) are stimulated by commensal bacteria products through T oll like receptor (TLR) engagement, which leads to the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase expression and IgA secretion B bacteria activates lamina propria DCs to generation of T helper 17 (TH17) cells112. Commensal bacteria, particularly the segmented filamentous bacteria, promote TH17 cell development in the intestine113,114. Commensal bacteria can directly activate TLRs that are expressed by regulatory T (TReg) cells and promote TReg cell proliferation and survival115. Introduction of a single commensal microorganism (such as Bifidobacterium infantis ) is sufficient to increase TReg cell numbers in the intestine and spleen116. By contrast, DNA from commensal bacteria activates TLR9 in lamina propria DCs, which supports the differentiation of effector T cells by limiting the conversion of naive T cells into TReg cells in the gut mucosa117.R E V I E W S NATURE REVIEWS | IMMUNOLOGY VOLUME 10 | OCTOBER 2010 | 703 \u00a9 20 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Engagement of the PRRs by virus derived components results in the secre tion of type I interferons (IFNs) and other cytokines that are essential for suppressing viral replication and spread through the induction of antiviral effector mol ecules34. In addition, some PRR induced responses are essential for the generation of effective adaptive immune responses to pathogens35. DCs, monocytes and macrophages express distinct sets of TLRs36. Langerhans cells express most TLRs but lack TLR4, TLR7 and TLR9 (REF. 37) . The type II epithelial cells that line the vaginal canal and ectocervix express TLR2, TLR3, TLR4 and I (RIGI) and melanoma differentiation associated protein 5 (MDA5), detect the RNA viral genome or replication products38. In addition to RNA viruses, RIGI is also involved in the recognition of dsDNA following transcription by RNA polymerase III39,40. RLRs are ubiquitously expressed to ensure that, regardless of tropism, viruses can be detected by infected cells. NLRs comprise a large family of intracellular PRRs that regulate innate immu nity in response to the recognition of various pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and stress sig nals41. NLR family, pyrin domain containing protein 1 (NLRP1) is widely expressed, whereas NLRP3 expression is restricted to epithelial cells of the oropharynx, oesopha gus and ectocervix, and immune cells42. The NLRPs can activate inflammasomes, which in turn activate caspase 1, leading to cleavage of pro forms of interleukin1 (IL1) and IL18 into mature cytokines. Recent studies show that in addition to NLRPs, absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) can couple dsDNA recognition to inflammasome NLRs are activated following infection by bac teria, viruses and parasites and are crucial in both innate and adaptive immune responses41. HSV infection is detected by multiple PRRs. In pDCs, HSV is recognized by TLR9 in the endosome47,48, whereas in other cell types, HSV is recognized in the cytoplasm by the RIGI pathway, following transcription by DNA dependent RNA polymerase III39. Certain strains of HSV also trigger TLR2 activation on DCs and macrophages49. Figure 4 | The innate defence system of the vaginal mucosa. The vagina and ectocervix are covered by type II epithelium.

Cross-presentation The mechanism by which certain antigen-presenting cells take up, process and present extracellular antigens on MHC class I molecules to stimulate CD8+ T cells.Furthermore, HSV2 activates inflammasomes50 and this activation occurs independently of AIM2 (REF. 51) . Caspase 1 is not required for adaptive immunity to genital HSV2 infection52; however, IL18 is required for innate protection against HSV1 infection53. Following HSV2 infection, pDCs are rapidly recruited to the vagina and provide a local source of type I IFNs to limit viral replication54. Recently generated HPV vaccines have used HPV derived virus-like particles (VLPs). In addition to containing viral epitopes, these VLPs stimulate innate immune recognition in DCs through a myeloid differen tiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88) dependent pathway; adaptive immunity to VLPs is compromised in the absence of MyD88 (REF . 55) . It is likely that the stimula tion of a MyD88dependent transcriptional programme contributes to the success of the HPV based VLP vaccine. Studies of the innate recognition system for the intact HPV virions, identification of the PRRs involved in VLP recognition and the nature of the PAMPs being recog nized will provide further insights into the basic biology of papillomavirus detection. Despite the recent developments in our understand ing of the cell intrinsic restriction pathways that are used to contain retroviruses56, it is not clear how HIV1 or retroviruses in general are recognized by PRRs. Studies in mice show that humoral immunity to a retrovirus (for example, Friend murine leukaemia virus) requires MyD88 and DCs57. In addition, endocytosed viral RNA is detected by human pDCs through a process that prob ably involves TLR7 (REF. 58) . However, although pDCs can produce IFN in response to HIV1, this seems to be a highly inefficient process, which requires as much as 10,000 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infective dose) of HIV1 (in comparison 1 infectious HSV or influenza virus per cell is sufficient to trigger similar levels of IFN secre tion)59. In addition, HIV1 induces a global disruption of innate signalling pathways in infected cells by degrad ing interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)60, which makes directly infected cells incapable of producing type I IFNs. Understanding which innate pathways are involved in the detection of HIV1 and which of these pathways link innate recognition to adaptive immune responses will be key to developing a successful HIV1 vaccine61. Adaptive immunity Initiation of adaptive immunity against STVs. The type II mucosa is characterized by the absence of MALT (TABLE 1) . Priming occurs exclusively in the draining lymph nodes. The human vaginal canal is drained by several lymph nodes, including the common iliac, interiliac, external iliac and inguinal femoral lymph nodes (in descending order), and the penis is drained by the inguinal lymph nodes. Antigens in the anorectal canal are processed by the local MALT, which underlies the type I epithelium (such as the upper rectum), and by the inguinal lymph node, which drains the lower rectum and anus. During a natural course of infection, STVs infect specific target cells and are taken up by local antigen presenting cells. HSV2 infects the type II epithelium of the vagina and cervix. Virus infection is detected by the infected epithelial cells and by submucosal DCs in a MyD88dependent manner. Recognition of infection by both haematopoietic and stromal compartments is required for the successful induction of protective T helper 1 (TH1)type immunity52. However, directly infected cells are incapable of priming T cells because HSV2 blocks MHC class I and class II presentation and is a highly lytic virus62. Uninfected submucosal DCs take up viral antigens and migrate to the draining lymph nodes, where they present antigenic peptides to cognate CD8+ and CD4+ T cells63,64. Langerhans cells in the vaginal epithelium differentiate from circulat ing bone marrow derived precursors, express low levels of Langerin65 and do not participate in TH1 cell priming63,64. In addition, vaginal Langerhans cells were shown to induce IL17secreting CD8+ T cells that sup press cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses following intravaginal immunization with ovalbumin and cholera toxin B66. Early immune responses against genital HSV infection fail to clear the virus because it can invade the innervating ganglia and establish latent infection prior to the onset of highly effective immunity. Although CD8+ T cells provide important immune surveillance of the infected neurons through a non lytic mechanism, latent virus cannot be cleared by T cells or antibodies67. Natural immunity against HSV1 offers some level of protection against the acquisition of genital HSV2 in women but not in men68. Natural infection with HPV induces poor immunity; HPV encoded molecules engage multiple mechanisms to prevent the initiation of a robust immune response, including depletion of Langerhans cells by HPV E6 protein69, molecules E5 protein70 and blockade of type HPV E7 protein71. Thus, HPV antigens are likely to undergo cross-presentation only by uninfected DCs, the antigen presentation machinery of which is not affected by the virus evasion mechanisms. Presumably such DCs are activated by a cell extrinsic mechanism through the recognition of virus infected cells by an endosomal PRR35. The nature of the DCs that are responsible for this priming is unknown, but because HPV infection occurs only in the type II epithelial layer, Langerhans cells in the epithelial layer and possibly submucosal DCs that extend their dendrites towards the epithelial layer are the most likely to participate in this process. During HIV1 infection, the type of DC that primes CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses is unknown. Rather, much of the focus has been placed on the role of DCs and Langerhans cells in enhancing HIV1 infection. Langerhans cells HIV1 glycoprotein through mannose Ctype lectins72. Using an ex vivo human organ culture system, Langerhans cells were shown to take up HIV1 by endocytosis73. As Langerhans cells exit the epithelium at the basal side, they transport intact virions, thereby enabling the infection to spread beyond the site of viral entry12. Strong immune responses that are induced by HIV1 infection occur too late to eliminate the infection74. In addition, HIV1 superinfection can occur in individuals with a strong and broadly reactive virus specific CD8+ T cell response75.R E V I E W S NATURE REVIEWS | IMMUNOLOGY VOLUME 10 | OCTOBER 2010 | 705 \u00a9 20 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Vaccines that simply mimic the 'best' immune responses that are generated during natural STV infection will not be effective as a preventive measure. In addition, an 'immunogenic' vaccine will not necessarily be protec tive. Thus, it is important to understand what constitutes a protective immune response to a given pathogen and to tailor prophylactic vaccines accordingly. Effector mechanisms. Once generated, effector and memory lymphocytes that are specific for a given patho gen can migrate to various sites in the body and provide protection against the infection (FIG. 5a) . Neutralizing antibodies are the preferred effector mechanism as they can establish sterile immunity and provide complete protection against most viral infections. In addition, because antibodies circulate throughout the body and can access most mucosal tissues, there is no need to generate local antibody producing cells. As type II epithelial cells cannot transport IgA, antibodies in the vaginal lumen come from two sources: IgA is secreted from the cervix and uterus (type I epithelium), and there is paracellular diffusion of serum derived and locally produced IgG through the type II epithelium of the vagina76. Antibody profiles in male genital tract secretions resemble those that are present in the serum rather than those that are characteristic of typical external secretions77. This sug gests that after circulating levels of antibodies are estab lished, recipients of a vaccine might be protected from challenge through multiple mucosal routes. In addition to neutralizing antibodies, cell mediated immunity by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells has a crucial role in antiviral defence . CD4+ T cells provide help for anti body production by B cells and are also required for Figure 5 | The adaptive immune system of the vaginal mucosa. a | Following primary virus infection, virus specific T and B cells that are generated in the lymph nodes migrate to the site of infection in response to chemokine signals. CD4+ T cells migrate into the infected vaginal tissue, secrete interferon (IFN) and block virus replication. IFN also induces the expression of chemokines that are necessary for CD8+ T cell migration. In the tissue, CD8+ T cells migrate to the infected epithelial cells and induce apoptosis, which prevents viral synthesis. B cells secrete IgG and block the spread of virus. b | After the clearance of the primary virus infection, clusters of memory lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs), form near to or in the epithelial cell layer . These clusters represent a local and rapid responder unit that is capable of secreting antiviral cytokines and releasing cytotoxic cells following secondary exposure to the same virus.R E V I E W S 706 | OCTOBER 2010 | VOLUME 10 www.nature.com/reviews/immunol \u00a9 20 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved 10CD8+ T cell responses during the priming phase of effector T cell differentiation78-81 and for the generation of memory T cells82-84 that mount a robust secondary response. Furthermore, CD4+ T cell help is required for the entry of CD8+ T cells into the genital mucosa dur ing the effector phase of the immune response85. Finally, CD4+ effector T cells themselves have a direct antivi ral role; in the mouse genital herpesvirus model, TH1 cells enter the infected vagina and secrete high levels of IFN, which blocks viral replication in infected cells86. CTLs are key antiviral effector cells that block further dissemination of the virus through direct elimination of infected cells by perforin and granzyme mediated cytolysis. Immunization protocols that only elicit CTL responses are sufficient to provide protective immu nity against genital herpesvirus challenge in animal models87,88. In addition, CD8+ T cells are important for preventing reactivation of latent HSV in neurons89-92. Establishment of memory cell foci in the genital mucosa. The vaginal submucosa does not contain MALT in the steady state. However, notably, once the initial wave of virus has been cleared, foci of DCs and T cells form beneath the epithelial layer of the vagina (FIG. 5b) . In mice, after the clearance of infection with thymidine kinase mutant HSV2 (TK- HSV2, which is incapable of in the sacral ganglia), clusters of cells, con sisting largely of memory CD4+ T cells, B cells, DCs and macrophages, form along the vaginal submucosa86. In humans, similar clusters, which also include CD8+ T cells, are found in patients with recurrent HSV2 disease93. These structures are not found in naive hosts, but fol lowing HSV2 infection in mice86 and humans93 or after C. trachomatis infection in mice94, they can persist for months after the pathogens have been cleared. In older humans without any STI symptoms, a distinct band of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with an inner core of B cells is often found directly under the epithelium in both the cer vix and vagina95. These clusters are probably important for providing an immediate response following a secondary infection. A secondary infection of TK- HSV2primed mice with wild type HSV2 results in the rapid produc tion of IFN by pre existing CD4+ T cells, which are pre sumably stimulated locally by DCs and B cells in the cell clusters86. A study in humans that followed HSV2specific CD8+ T cells revealed that such T cells are rapidly recruited following reactivation of infection and persist adjacent to peripheral nerve endings at the dermal-epidermal junction for more than 2 months after reactivation and healing96. Importantly, subsequent virus reactivation at the site where CD8+ T cells are present did not result in lesion formation, indicating that HSV2specific CD8+ T cells at the site of genital herpesvirus lesions control local viral replication. Therefore, localized mucosal memory T cell populations seem to provide superior control of viral infection compared with circulating memory T cells, which suggests that vaccines against STIs should generate localized memory T and B cell populations at sites of potential exposure. Vaccines against sexually transmitted viruses A success story \u2014 HPV vaccines. Two recent vaccines against HPV have resulted in overwhelming success: quadravalent HPV vaccine (Gardasil; Merck & Co., Inc.), which comprises VLPs of the four major mucosal HPVs \u2014 HPV16 and HPV18 (which are high risk factors for cervical cancer) and HPV6 and HPV11 (which cause genital warts); and which comprises VLPs of HPV16 and HPV18. In clinical trials both vaccines have been shown to be extremely effective, providing protection from infection in almost 100% of cases97. The protection that is conferred by VLP based vaccines is thought to be mediated by neutralizing antibodies98. The outcomes of these trials highlight that success ful vaccines against STVs are possible. However, the studies described below show that each STV probably requires a specific type of effector immunity to confer protection in the host. Challenges ahead. Although the success of HPV vac cines paves the way for other STV vaccines, protective immunity that is based solely on neutralizing antibodies may not be achievable for other STVs. For viruses that undergo rapid mutation, such as HIV1, a high titre of broadly neutralizing antibodies that target conserved epitopes of HIV gp120 must be generated99; however, vaccine candidates tested so far have failed to achieve this goal. Likewise, several clinical trials of antibody based vaccines for HSV2 have failed to show significant protection, despite inducing high titre serum antibody levels in vaccine recipients100. Therefore, vaccines that simultaneously elicit effective CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell and B cell responses are probably needed to prevent the spread of HIV1 (REF. 101) and HSV2 (REF. 18) . In addition to traditional vaccines, topical microbicides that could prevent entry and infection of STIs are also currently under consideration (BOX 3) . Box 3 | Vaginal microbicides Unlike vaccines, microbicides are topical agents that act to block the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) without eliciting specific immune responses. Microbicides must be applied prior to sexual intercourse to interfere with the incoming pathogen. More than 45 clinical trials have been conducted to test the efficacy of topical microbicides for the prevention of HIV1 transmission27. Infection by HIV1 depends on its ability to enter the vaginal tissue through microabrasion, infect CD4+ T cells and macrophages in or beneath the epithelial cell layer and establish a local founder virus population; microbicides have been developed to interfere with each of these steps. Non specific microbicides include: surfactants, which disrupt cellular and microbial membranes; protective gel for minimizing mucosal breaks; vaginal milieu protectors for maintaining an acidic pH (either by a buffering mechanism or by the introduction of live lactobacilli bacteria); and anionic polymers that block the attachment, fusion and entry of viruses. These classes of microbicides have a broad range of targets and can be effective in preventing entry by viral, bacterial and protozoan pathogens. HIV1 specific microbicides include inhibitors of CCchemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and reverse transcriptase. Unfortunately, a Phase III efficacy trial that used the surfactant nonoxinol9 reported an increased seroincidence of HIV1 when the surfactant was used more than three times per day118. This is probably due to the ability of nonoxinol9 to disrupt the epithelial cell membrane, facilitating viral invasion. However, the recent clinical trial of a vaginal microbicide that contains tenofovir, a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor, was shown to be efficacious in preventing HIV1 transmission119.R E V I E W S NATURE REVIEWS | IMMUNOLOGY VOLUME 10 | OCTOBER 2010 | 707 \u00a9 20 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved 10T argeted lymph node immunization A subcutaneous immunization technique that aims to administer a vaccine in the proximity of the internal and external iliac lymph nodes. This technique has been proposed as a means to harvest the naturally existing imprinting mechanism for instructing effector lymphocytes to migrate to the tissue (for example, the genital and rectal mucosae) that is being drained by a particular lymph node.Although many vaccine approaches have been tested to date, none of these has proven to be successful in prevent ing HIV1 infection in humans, despite inducing robust levels of antibody or cell mediated immunity. Although the immune correlate of protection is still unclear, experts agree that establishing a local pool of memory T cells is key to protection against HIV1 (REFS 14,101) . Given that a single HIV1 virion is responsible for establishing infection in humans15,16, preexisting local memory CTLs might have an opportunity to reduce the replication and dissemination of the founder virus. Recent data indicate that the establishment of tissue resident memory T cells provides more robust protection against skin HSV1 infection than circulating memory T cells102. Therefore, a key feature of future vaccines against STVs may be the ability to recruit and establish resident memory T cells at susceptible exposure sites. Targeting T cells to the genital mucosa. How can we make vaccines that establish local memory T cells in the genital mucosa? To answer this question we must turn to the migration behaviour of effector and memory T cells. The current paradigm of cellular migration is that effector memory T cells circulate throughout the peripheral tissues, whereas central memory T cells reside in the secondary lymphoid tissues103. Indeed, regardless of the site of pathogen or antigen encounter, pathogen specific memory CD8+ T cells104 and CD4+ T cells105 can be found in various tissues, including the gut, lungs, liver and lymph nodes. However, peripheral tissue distribution of memory T cells occurs mainly after infection with live replicating vectors that cause systemic infection104 or with antigen that is injected sys temically105 (BOX 4) . Furthermore, circulating memory CD8+ T cells do not migrate efficiently into the brain or intestinal lamina propria even after infection with rep licating viruses106. Such restricted migration of memory T cells is even more exaggerated in response to localized immunogen or vectors that cause localized infection. In such settings, memory T cells seem to follow two distinct migration patterns \u2014 permissive migration (to the spleen, lungs and liver) and restricted migration (to the central nervous system107, skin102 and vaginal mucosa85). Migration into restricted tissues requires a subset of CD4+ T cells to pave the way first85,107. Such pio neering CD4+ T cells respond to local chemokines, enter the tissue and induce a subsequent wave of chemokines that enable other CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to enter the tis sue. These results indicate that pioneering CD4+ T cells may be needed to establish tissue specific populations of both CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells. Thus, vaccines based on the generation of only systemic CD8+ T cell immunity are likely to fail because such T cells are not selfsufficient for entry into the genital tissue. 'Prime and pull' approach for STI vaccines. The most effective means to establish a memory T cell response is by intravaginal immunization with live agents that infect the vaginal tissue. However, assuming that this is not a viable option in humans, several other approaches have been tested (BOX 4) . An ideal HIV1 vaccine should estab lish a local memory CD8+ T cell population and robust IgG and IgA secreting plasma cells in the genital tis sues without establishing a large pool of activated CD4+ T cells (which can become targets for HIV1 replica tion93). However, traditional approaches do not allow for selective recruitment of CD8+ T cells and/or plasma cells. On the basis of recent advances in our understanding of the recruitment pathways for each lymphocyte subset, a new way to approach this issue could be to generate robust systemic immunity through the use of conven tional immunization. Such immunization would trigger all arms of the adaptive immune response (prime) and then reorient selective lymphocyte subsets (such as CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells or B cells) into the genital mucosae by using a second signal (pull). Such a prime and pull strategy alleviates the need to develop a new vaccine formulation and can be applied to any mucosal tissue, as long as the chemokines that are used to 'pull' selec tive lymphocyte populations into the relevant tissues are identified. For example, humans can be primed with a conventional vaccine intramuscularly to generate cellu lar and humoral immune responses. After the effector cells are generated, CTLs can be pulled into the vaginal tissues85 by applying CXC chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9) locally. Identification of the molecular signature that is required for the entry of memory and effector T cells is the key to manipulating their migration behaviour. Concluding remarks Recent studies have shed light on the biology of genital mucosal immunity against STVs. We now have a bet ter understanding of the invasion mechanisms that are used by HIV1, HSV2 and HPV , the importance of viral replication in target cells in susceptible tissues and the Box 4 | Intranasal vaccines to induce genital immunity? It has long been known that intranasal delivery of immunogens results in effector T and B cell responses in the female genital mucosae. Several studies have reported that the intranasal route of antigen delivery, but not the intraperitoneal or subcutaneous routes, induces IgA in vaginal secretions120-127, presumably by recruiting IgA secreting plasma cells to the cervical mucosa. In addition, CD8+ T cells that are specific for the immunogen have been detected in the vaginal tissue following immunization with an adenovirus vector or when antigen is delivered with CpG containing DNA126. What is special about the intranasal delivery route in this regard is unknown; it is possible that because the lung is a highly vascularized tissue, intranasal inoculation often results in the delivery of vaccines not only to the respiratory mucosa but also to the gut mucosa and spleen123, enabling dendritic cells (DCs) in various tissues to prime robust T cell responses. By contrast, the targeting of cutaneous lymph nodes by subcutaneous or intraperitoneal128 inoculation of antigens tends to induce only serum IgG and not cervical IgA responses, which suggests that DCs in the skin are not sufficient to induce IgA responses129. However, when a replicating vector is used, other routes of infection can also induce vaginal T cell responses following infection with Listeria monocytogenes (intramuscular route of infection)130 route of infection)131. The induction of these vaginal responses is due to the ability of these vectors to disseminate and establish systemic infection. In addition to intranasal vaccines, sublingual vaccine delivery132 and targeted lymph node immunization133 are being tested for their efficacy in establishing vaginal mucosal immunity. Results from studies in humans indicate that the intranasal route of immunization might hold some promise for the establishment of effective immunoglobulin responses in the female and male genital mucosae134-136. Whether this and other approaches can be used to establish local T cell immunity in the genital mucosa in humans requires further study.R E V I E W S 708 | OCTOBER 2010 | VOLUME 10 www.nature.com/reviews/immunol \u00a9 20 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved 10various host factors that restrict viral replication. In par allel, multiple evasion mechanisms that are used by the viruses to interfere with innate and adaptive recognition, PRR signalling, IFN responses and effector functions of IFNstimulated genes have been uncovered. A common theme that has emerged is that the natural immunity that develops following infection with these viruses provides minimal protection against secondary challenges with a heterologous virus. Thus, a vaccine may need to elicit a different type of immune response altogether to achieve protection in the immunized hosts. Several basic areas of genital mucosal immunity warrant future investigation. First, we must better understand the rules that govern effector and memory lymphocyte migration into the different areas (such as the epithelium, submucosa, cervix, vagina and penis) of the genital mucosa. selectins, integrins and adhesion molecules are involved? What chemokines are responsible for the recruitment of each lymphocyte subset? How are these lymphocytes recruited and main tained in the genital mucosa? To this end, studying the lymphoid clusters that form following exposure to STIs may provide important insights. Second, deeper under standing of the importance of the innate signals that are required to mobilize DCs and prime appropriate immune responses is crucial. How are the naive T cells programmed to migrate back to the infected tissue? Is there a unique biology of genital mucosal DCs that enables such programming? What antigen presenting cells are responsible for the priming and the recall phases of immune responses to STIs? Finally, after an ideal vac cine has been produced, a key issue is how best to deploy the vaccines economically to the developing countries where they are needed most. The development of doityourself technologies for delivering chemokines and antigens to the relevant mucosa would facilitate vari ous cutting edge vaccination approaches for establishing protective immunity against STIs. 1.
