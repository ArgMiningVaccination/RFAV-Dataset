During Spring quarter, 1977, George Murphy, then vice\u00ad chancellor of student affairs, sent two memos to the Advisory Committee assuring them \"prior advice\" on the realloca\u00ad tion of future savings. \"Prior advice\" means consultation before action. Murphy resigned in April, 1977, and Hunt took over until a permanent replacement could be found. When the Advisory Commit\u00ad tee reconvened in Fall quarter, 1977, the controversy over the $103,000 allocation by Hunt continued to grow (Triton Times, Oct. 24, 1977). After a temporary withdrawal from the Advisory Committee by the student members, the adminis-tration agreed to rewrite the committee 's policy and procedure manual to include \"prior advice\" in the guide\u00ad lines, \"Rubber stamp Advisory Committee . \"The vice-chancel\u00ad lor is not answerable to us, he doesn't have to do anything the committee says,\" he said. \"It's pretty much of a rubber stamp committee.\" \"The committee is a farce,\" said O'Connor. \"I don't want to give legitimacy to that kind of process. Ostensibly it controls a budget of $4 million, but it really controls nothing.\" Chancellor William McElroy said the resignations were \"a mistake. It (the conflict) is water over the dam.

First of all. the Unification Church Is not Christian. Moon denies the deity of Christ. He also Sundesert plant issue raised Editor: A tremendous conflict re,ardin, the enerlY needs of San Die,o is presently under consideration by the State Ener,y Resources Conservation and Development Commission . The issue is whether San Die,o Gas and Electric (SDGE) should build a nuclear reactor complex near Blythe. California . which would supply area residents and industry with 1900 me,awatts ofincreased power potential by 1_. Since the Triton Times has cbaracteristically ienored the issue. I would like to express a. few points. The project called \"Sundesert \" is presently outlawed by an act of the state legislature . Construction of all new nuclear power plants was banned until satisfactory plutonium storage methods were found. SDGE is appealing to the legislature to grant an exemption for Sundesert through A.B. 1852. This requires the state Energy Board to make a recommendation to the legislature on whether the exemption should be granted. This same board held public hearings in San Diego on Jan. 18 and 19. The idea of public hearings sounded so much like democracy. that fabled beast the stalks so much of American history. that I had to attend. Listening to the flow o( citizens expounding their views. I got the (ollowing impressions. The pro-Sundesert forces were primarily of that class of citizens who have power and/or wealth and wish to keep it. They were manufacturere s. builders. research scientists and local business lrouPS. Many were heavy usen of electricity and were concerned about a continued supply. Others. who were facilitators of San Dielo's continued growth. feared that electrical shortales might curb the population potential of the area. It was euy to see the economic interests which guided their thoulhts. Nuclear scientists too. had their stake. but they were much more direct. makiDi statements such as. if future leoerations are too dumb to handle nuclear power and waste. then they're too dumb to carry on the human race. and deserve their fate. Another spoke about the issue as a completely technieal one. He lectured the audience. not the commission . for 25 minutes (10 minute limit) on the radioactive dangers o( coal burning plants. and concluded that nuclear power was our alternative . The Incredible arrolance and complete lack of rapport with the common man is characteristic of the elite technologist class. They consider themselves the only ones capable of deciding questions such u nuclear power. The average citizen is far too emotional! Average citizens were at the hearing in vast majority and they were angry. A housewife spoke briefly on the tremendous risks. then poured a small bag of flour onto the podium. This. if it were plutonium . could kill everyone in the United States. she stated. A woman from the Committee for Economic Democracy pointed out that SDGE's record had rashly sunk 80 million dollars into Sundesert before approval. and now desperatel y (Please turn to page 11) Private institution in Oakland is \"first rate\" Most of this income comes from his followers. selliDi items and asking donations . ten to fifteen houn a day. six days a week, Certainly everyone has the freedom to join any or,anization but I ur,e anyone considering one of Moon's twCHIay seminars to investij(ate the Unification maintains that salvation throu,h Cbrlst i. incomplete, that a complex system of obedience to Moon Is necessary .

However. due to the totally inappropriate headline given to his letter, as well as the smaller type size in which it. as well as all letters recently printed in the Trash's pages. probably few people read, or even saw. Montlomery 's letter. I have no doubt that the Trash. carrying on a tradition found throughout its history. will fail to print my letter. Failing that. it will be headlined with some totally irrelevant phrase. somewhat akin to the \"TT blamed for Opinion Letters\" placed over a letter of mine printed last year in your rag. (In that letter I criticized the Triton Trash for endoning letters it knew to be not only incorrect. but slanderous .) There is little the TT can do to surprise me. A precdent for almost any dirty trick or shoddy journalistiC practice can be found in the Trash's history. In the beginning of this year I expressed my belief tha t the TT was improving . at that point it appeared to be approaching the finesse. and quality. of a high school journal. However. the TT has snatched itself from the jaws of mediocrity. and returned to the yellow psuedo\u00ad journalism at which it has earned its name.

Panthers' school threatened by charges\u00b7 by Pat Roberto Pacific News Service Oakland. CA. Jan. 26 - A pace\u00b7setting private elementary school which has provided first\u00b7rate educations to some of this city's poorest children -and high acclaim to the Black Eanther Party which runs it -is facing an uncertain future as a result of charges of attempted murder, extortion and fraud brought against party members. The allega\u00b7 tions. some believe . may threaten the .survival of the Black Panther Party itself. The accusations . including welfare fraud, extortion and two shooting s supposedly connected with the murder trial of Panther leader Huey Newton. have already created a breach between the school and public officials such as Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson. who recently resigned from the school's board. Pal Roberto reports for Time magazine from tbe San Fr n isco Bay Area. ., et. while officialdom is maiqtaining a discreet distance from grown even mere loyal. . 1 go down there and I see for mJ s,U the love and concern tht;y have for the children.\" saId one mother. \"Why should I care who runs it or what is being said about them?\" \"You read that the Panthers did this or they did that,\" said another mother whose two daughters attend the school. \"Then you turn around and see all the good things they do and the progress these children are making.\" If reading and math scores and a demanding curri<!ulum are indications, the progress of the Oakland Community School's 150 two\u00b7and\u00b7a\u00b7half to 12-year\u00b7old students is remark\u00b7 able. . Children enrolled in the program from the sta rt consistently score one to two yea rs beyond grade level on the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills. which the school administers at the beginning and end of each year. Transfer students from the Oakland Public Schools, where students score among the worst in the state and the nation in reading, usually reach grade level in two years' time. The staff, who devised the curriculum and plan to market it. feel the achievements of their students are small cause to marvel. \"This is o)\"dinary everyday stuff,\" said Carol Granison, language arts director and former staffer for Scbolastic magazine . \"For a child to learn is as inevitable as breathing . What is. extraordinary is the millions of kids who learn nothing sitting in public school classrooms . ' . What is also extraordinary is the number of services and the amount of attention available to students at the school. The staff consists of 16 full\u00b7time teachers: 14 blacks and two whites. Class sizes vary from seven to 12 students. as compared to the public school average of 28. The school provides before\u00b7 and\u00b7arter-school child care. three hot meals a day, complete medical and dental treatment and overnight care at a Panther\u00b7 run dormitory when parents request it. All of this is free to parents who cannot afford the $25\u00b7a\u00b7 month tuition. And most parents are single mothers who cannot. It costs the school about $30.000 a month to provide the services and pay salaries, with the money coming from a variety of grants, public food programs and private contri\u00b7 butions. \"We do everything for our children, \" said Ericka Hug\u00ad gins. director of the school. \"We see to it they have their meals. that their noses are wiped and that they are feeling okay.\" All of this adds up to an exceptionally heavy workload for the teacbers. three\u00b7quarters of whom are credentialed instructors with public school experience . At OCS they earn \" flat $800 a month, or an average of $300 a month less than their public school counterparts. Most feel that the chance to work with small classes and the freedom from bureaucracy is ample compensation for the difference in pay. But even with these advant\u00b7 ages the work is rigorous . Teachers work eight to ten hours a day. including super\u00b7 vising children before and after school. They rotate breakfast , lunch and dinner duty. often serving the children and eating with them. They must also write brief weekly reports on every child they teach. And they are responsible to the other teachers if their home\u00b7 room students fail to turn in assignments . At weekly faculty meetings. teachers and staff discuss the behavior and academic per\u00b7 formance of individual children and plan strategies fo\" improvement . A certain singularity of purpose -the welfare of children -per\u00b7 vades. \"Sure we sympathize with public school teachers who say they need more pay and better working conditions ,\" said OCS curriculum coordinator Dr. Bill Moore. \"But if you want those things, show us where your children are progressing and show us where they are not shooting up on drugs or drinking alcohol or tricking in the hallways . Because if you are a teacher, these things are your responsibility too.\" There is an added dimension to the teaching zeal at the Oakland Community School: The majority of teachers and administrtors are members of the Black Panther Party. With their social, political and professional lives largely focused on the school. they form the core of a crucial alliance between faculty, parents and communit y resource people. \"These people are vision\u00b7 arjes without any economic motives.\" said one observer . \"For the sake of that vision they have learned to fit into any structure that exists. They know how to organize . to get projects funded. Whatever it takes. \" Non\u00b7party members at the school praise the party for its idealism but insist they see little influence emanating from a Panther ideology . \"What binds us as a group is our (Please tum to pale 3) Panthers' school ... (Continued from pale Z) commitments to the same goal. not politics,\" said mathematics teacher Jackie Nado. \"We are working together to educate children so they can analyze and make choices. There is nothing more exciting.\" Besides the dedication of teachers, Director Huggins says a crucial element in the school's success is the heavy involvement of parents. who are asked to work 12 hours a month as classroom aides, cafeteria workers or office personnel at the school in lieu of tuition. Family members are encouraged to participate in Panther-run teen projects and adult education courses at the schOOl. In this way. the sta (f has constant contact with the parents and siblings of their students, \"Without prying. we try to know as much as we can about a child's home environment and we don't hesitate to make suggestions when we feel a change is needed,\" Huggins said. For example. one four\u00b7year \u00b7 old girl, labeled autistic by a county psychologist . had seen her parents fighting constantly , at times threatening each other with guns. \"That situation could not be improved. So we explained to the mother how deeply her child was being hurt and urged her to move.\" said Huggins. \"She did. and the girl started to talk and later to read much as any child.\" Since ghetto children rarely have any alternative to the local public school. parents whose children go to OCS express a mixture of enthus\u00b7 iasm and gratitude toward the school. \"I consider myself terribly lucky.\" said Marianne Keyes. whose nine\u00b7year-old son spent one year in public school \"without learning a single thing. I was beside myself,\" she said. \"I had to get him out 01 there. He was going into a shell. Since he's been at the commun \u00b7 ity school I just can't believe the difference. He's grown up. He reads well a nd he has a lot of con ridence. \" Pat Dudley has three child\u00b7 ren at OCS. A fourth daughter who graduated last year is an honors students at one of Oakland's best junior high schools. The school helped Dudley get legal help after one of her children was hit by a car. And when she went to the hospital this past summer. the school took care of the children at its dormitory facility. \"For the first time in my life I have had time to do things with the peace of mind that my kids are being take,n care of.\" sai\" Dudley. a single mother. \"They love the school. r was thinking of leaving the state but they pleaded with me not to take them out of the school.\" Parents seem unconcerned over the possibility that their ~hildren might be politically mCluenced by the Panthers . no politics involyed . Spria. Break i. MAZATLAN But they do talk to the children about where they live and why they live there.\" said Rita Means. \"There is a lot of discussion about social conditions. The children become aware.\" The emphasis on social conditions rather than political interpretation is a distinction that avoids indoctrination Huggins says. \"We do not impress our ideas on these children,\" she said. \"But the education they get here is not just the three R's either. ltis an understanding that there is no more important purpose than to be obligated to other human beings.\" On the other hand, Huggins says the school and other community programs spon\u00b7 sored by the party in no way signal change of Panther philosophy . \"We are the same people we always were.\" she said. \"We want a new order of things in this society and in the world. But we realize that if 'A' is oppressioin and 'Z' is freedom, youjustcan 'tjump from A toZ. If we want to change things thtO best way to begin is to educate our children.\" Although education students from nearby colleges constant\u00b7 ly observe classes and write papers on the school, and state officials periodically commend it. local public school officials have shown little interest in OCS. \"The children in that school are the same as you find in the public schools . yet their intellectual output is prodi\u00b7 gious.\" said Oakland City Councilwoman Mary Moore. \"Unfortunately. most educa\u00b7 tors want to ignore the school because it is run by the Panthers and also because it is a tremendous indictment of the school system.\" Vet public school teachers familiar with the Community School do not feel personally indiCted by its successes. On the contrary. they feel the school makes the very case teachers have been trying to make all along. \"Smaller classes. and an administration that draws in the parents and the commun\u00ad ity, make all the difference in the world.\" said Ron De George . a teacher at Kaiser school in Oakland. Councilwoman Moore be\u00b7 lieves the public schools could benefit from studying the community school and adapt\u00b7 ing some of its developmental programs . \"It would cost a fortune, but it could be done and it would save money later on. for welfare and prisons,\" she said. . AllegatIons But the school. or more properly . the Educational Opportunities Corporation that runs it. is being studied from a different angle in recent weeks.

His appearance as part of the UCSD muisc department's Scholarship Piano Series will feature major works by Mendelssohn. Grieg,. Scriabin and Beethoven, including the immense \"Hammerklavh,ir\" Sonata. Kuerti bas made a glowing reputation for himself as an interpreter of Beethoven. He has already added his name to the select few who have recorded all 32 of Beetboven's Sonatas. Of that set, Gaynor Jones wrote in Fugue Maga\u00ad zine: \"Every serious record collector or lover of Beethoven should acquire these record\u00ad ings ... because of the unique\u00ad ness of Kuerti's musical gestures and the manner in which his magic has been captured on disc.\" The critics have been no less pleased with his concert appearances. From the San Francisco Examiner and Chronicle: \"Kuerti plays with flawless technical ease, an always beautiful tone, and ideal tempos ... his phrasinll and sense of line are superlative . Taken as a whole, these performances rank beSide those of SctlOabel , which they resemble. \" Born in Vienna, Anton Kuerti came to the United States at an early age and began his musical training when he was five years old. At age 12, he performed the Grieg Concerto with Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops Orchestra . By the time he was 18, he had already finished his formal education at the Curtis Institute with Rudolf Serkin.

(Continued from page 8) Rudee said Marshall left specific instructions that no reporters be allowed to talk with him. However, at a pre\u00ad dedication ceremony dinner at McElroy's house Saturday evening, a San Diego Union reporter was present. The Triton Times had been told no reporters would be allowed to talk with Marshall or Brown. \"If the off-campus press was allowed at the dinner, then the Triton Times should have been invited,\" Frost said. \"But the party wasn't at my house.\" Two students, who sat on the Warren naming committee, were allowed to attend the dinner at McElroy's house. -Mark LOWEST POSSIBLE RATES IN CAR INSURANCE YOU AUTO KNOW BETTER (To Proye Our Point, listen in to the following conyersation) .

Philosophy of 'enda, The philosophy of the All-Cal Tournament is in Coach John Helmich's opinion, \"to have good competition 'in an informal atmosphere rather than an event where everyone is concerned about placings and team showinlS , The results of this competition do not count towards team standings and all the usuallealUe-nll es of eligibility do not apply for this tourney.\" Fencing, an intercollegiate sport at UCSD since 1969 is a game of \"live chess,\" according to Helmich. who was a me~ber of the original squad. \"It involves about 30 percent technique the rest being the strategy of preparing your opponent to be hit. You try to cause your opponent to make mistakes and then take advantag e of them,\" he said.

Tournament host Andy Williams made his grand entrance at 10 am on the south course first tee.

The one day affair ended much quieter than it began, as the gallery slowly melted away after the final fivesome departed down from the first tee at 10:45.
