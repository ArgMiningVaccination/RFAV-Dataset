[Dr. Shweta Badghare](/doctor/dr-shweta-badghare-homeopath-6)Homeopathy Doctor 20 Years FCAH, CGO, accupunture, Herbal Naturopath/ writing, medical coding, MEDICAL TRANSCRITPTINIST [Autism](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/autism)- Autism is a spectrum disorder that encompasses abnormalities in the development of the brain. It is characterized by under-developed cognitive abilities and difficulties in verbal and nonverbal communication. Repetitive behavioral patterns are also symptoms of autism. Symptoms Of Autism: - Less or no eye contact while communication - Annoying obstinacy in behavior [Abnormal behavior](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/abnormal-behavior)like excessive possessiveness to certain objects or repetitive acts - Prefers solitude - The child shrieks and screams. There are mood swings, such as crying and laughing without any reason. - Physical under-activity or [hyperactivity](https://www.lybrate.com/treatment-for-hyperactivity) - Under-developed fine motor skills, such as writing, reading, drawing, and others. - The child repeats the same words (echolalia). - Oversensitivity or low sensitivity to [pain](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/pain) - Such children cannot express themselves intellectually but can reciprocate if shown affection. The causes of Autism, though not definitively known, are believed to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. There are some structural and functional changes in the brain in case of autism, however, the exact cause is still unknown. It is a complex disorder where the causes are presumed at the genetic level, such as some contraindicated medicines consumed during [pregnancy](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/pregnancy), exposure to environmental chemicals, metabolic imbalance, [vaccination](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/vaccination), and others. However, vaccination is the most uncommon cause of autism. Attention Deficit [Hyperactivity Disorder](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/hyperactivity-disorder) ( [ADHD](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/adhd))- Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is a neurological disorder that affects the [executive](https://www.lybrate.com/lab-test/executive-health-check-up-level-iii/health-feed) functions of the brain which help us assess and plan. ADHD manifests itself as an inability to concentrate and follow instructions in order to complete a task. Difficulty in organizing activities and reluctance in engaging in tasks are also symptoms of ADHD. Being easily distracted, speaking excessively and intruding conversations can also be symptoms of the condition. These are the common symptoms seen when a child is evaluated for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder- - Distractibility & difficulty with focus and concentration - Procrastination - Short-term memory lapses - Tardiness, impulsiveness - Weak planning and execution - symptoms to look for in adults - Problem in organizing the ideas and belonging Common causes to be linked: - Genetic disorder - Head injury - Tobacco [smoking](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/smoking)during pregnancy [Malnutrition](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/malnutrition) Since both Autism and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder affect the cognitive and behavioral patterns and development of the child, an overlap between the two is understandable. Physicians are extremely careful when they diagnose a child with either of the neurological disorders. Homeopathy Treatments- Homeopathic treatments methods do not involve chemicals and thus can be administered for a long time. They also do not carry any risk of side effects. Since homeopathic therapies are tailored to individual needs, each remedy is targeted for different patients depending on each person's needs and requirements. Also, since they have a direct impact on the nervous system, they produce effective results. Homeopathic treatments can remedy either the entire constitution of the child or target individual symptoms. These remedies will help the child concentrate and develop his cognitive abilities. Benefits of Homeopathic Treatments- - Individuality- No two children are the same and a neurological condition, be it Autism or ADHD, will not manifest itself in the same way in any two of them as well. The symptoms may be similar but how they respond to the treatment will vary. And practitioners of homeopathy allow the individuality of a child to be the driving factor when any treatment option is prescribed. - Safety- Homeopathic medicines are extremely safe and have no adverse side effects. And since these medications are administered to children with Autism and ADHD, both neurological disorders, their safety is a vital benefit that needs to be taken into account.
