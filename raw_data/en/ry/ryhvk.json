The terrain is everything\" - Louis Pasteur, germ theory of medicine Toxins create an environment that supports the over-growth of microorganisms. If a patient does not deal with the numerous toxins stored within the body, it will take longer to get rid of the disease and the physical symptoms. We have developed a specialized method of detoxification of toxic metals, chemicals, pesticides, and other toxins for individuals who cannot eliminate toxins normally due to genetic snps and an inability to methylate certain nutrients. Detoxification is also useful for individuals suffering from allergies, cancer, inflammatory conditions, arthritis, auto-immune disorders, anxiety, and much more. We formulate the ideal therapy that carefully incorporates both detoxification and antimicrobial therapies, at a rate and sequence that can be tolerated. Bioenergetic frequency therapies and Laser Energetic Detoxification therapies are specialized methods for detoxification that is unique to the Center for Holistic Healing. Other means of detoxification includes: - Near-Infrared full-spectrum light saunas promotes detoxification deeper than the layers of the skin. - Oil pulling can facilitate the removal of fat-soluble toxins which collects in the mouth during the night while asleep. - Baths or foot baths can facilitate the removal of certain pesticides and heavy metals which carry a chemical charge. - Homeopathic and herbal remedies can be more effective for toxins without a chemical charge such as solvents. Other methods of toxin removal are clay baths, detox baths, liver and gallbladder flushes, exercise, herbs and other oral chelators, dry skin brushing, rebounding or the use of other lymphatic tools such as a Chi machine and photomagnetic lymph therapies are also helpful. Opening up blocked energy flow throughout the body will help to move toxins out. "}
