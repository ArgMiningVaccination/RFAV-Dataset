Overview of Development and Regulatory Approvals 128 candidate vaccines are in clinical development: 28 in Phase 3 trials, and 10 in Phase 4 trials - Table 1; Figure in COV ID-19 Vaccines and Therapeutics Regulatory Tracker (Phases tab). 23 vaccines have received regulatory approvals in various countries, and 22 are at various stages of engagement with WHO for emergency use listing (EUL). COVID -19 vaccines performance again st variants of concern (VOC) is provided based on WHO's Weekly Epidemiology Update (19th October): Table 3. No updated information was published in the supplement dated 26th October, 2021 . There are 8 COVID -19 vaccines (6 different moieties ) by 7 developers that have been approved by WHO for EUL to date . CARPHA -CRS has recommended all the WHO EUL COVID -19 vaccines to Member States, with updates inclusive of additional sites and monthly safet y updates : Table 4. In its 29th October, 2021 press announcement , United States Food and Drug Administration authorized the emergency use of the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine for the prevention of COVID -19 to include Children 5 through 11 Years of Age . Immune responses of children 5 -11 years were compar able to th ose of individuals 16 -25 years. In addition, the vaccine was found to be 90.7% effective in pr eventing COVID -19 in children 5 -11 yrs. In ongoing safety studies involving 3,100 children aged 5-11 who received the vaccine , no serious side effects have been d etected . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will convene a meeting of its immunization advisory committee this week to review clinical pa rameters for use of the vaccine .

Vaccine Deployment in the Caribbean Several Caribbean countries have approved / received COVID -19 vaccines purchases and/or donations . 15 CARPHA member states have received vaccine deliveries from COVAX as of 1st Novem ber, 2021. Belize receive d 58,500 doses on 27th October, 2021 and Jamaica received 100, 620 doses on 29th October, 2021 of the Pfizer - BioNTech Covid -19 Vaccine through COVAX facility . Jamica will receive an additional 369, 600 of the AstraZeneca Covid -19 Vaccine today (1st Novem ber) as a donation from the Canadian government. Based on data collected by the Global Change Data Lab's Our World in Data site, between 0.31% and 80.73 % of p ersons in CARPHA Member States have been fully vaccinated (Figure s 1-2). Counts may be a couple days out of date, as these are subject to data collection by OWID. Completed vaccination schedules, based on data from PAHO , are shown in Figure 3. Based on the PAHO Dashboard COVID -19 Vaccination in the Americas as of 29th October, 2021 , among CARPHA Member States, vaccine administration (at least 1 dose) ranges from 1.1 to 179.8 doses per capita (Figure 4). Approximately 5,401,820 doses have been administered among CMS - Table 2.

Reports of Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFIs) with COVID -19 vaccines to CARPHA VigiCarib CARPHA's Caribbean Regulatory System (CRS) assists Member States with the collection of reports of adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) (also known as Events Supposedly Attributable to Vaccination or Imm unization (ESAVIs) following use of COVID -19 vaccines. As of 31st Octo ber, CARPHA -CRS has received 51 AEFI case reports via its online reporting form since its launch in August : 15 were considered as 'Serious' including one death. All reports were submitted to the national focal point within one business of receipt. CARPHA notes that the AEFI case reports received by the CRS are unconfirmed and are subject to verification and/or investigation by the local authorities. 6: 01.Nov .2021 Table 3: Summary of vaccine performance against variants of concern (VOC) relative to ancestral stains - 19th October, 2021 WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL) Vaccines Vaccines Under Consideration for WHO EUL* AstraZeneca SII Covavax Alpha (B.1.1.7) Summary of VE* Protection retained against all outcomes Severe disease 2 2 5 Symptomatic disease to 5 1 4 1 Infection to 3 2 2 Neutralization to 7 1 4 to 12 to 39 to 6 2 2 3 1 Beta (B.1.351) Summary of VE* Protection retained against severe disease; reduced protection against symptomatic disease; limited evidence Severe disease 1 1 3 Symptomatic disease to 2 1 1 2 1 Infection 1 1 Neutralization to 7 to 2 to 6 to 14 to 40 to 6 to 3 2 to 3 1 Gamma (P.1) Summary of VE* Unclear impact; very limited evidence Severe disease 1 1 1 Symptomatic disease 1 1 1 Infection 1 Neutralization to 3 3 7 to 28 to 4 1 2 Delta (B.1.617.2) Summary of VE* Protection retained against severe disease; possible reduced protection against symptomatic disease and infection; limited ev idence Severe disease 3 2 5 Symptomatic disease to 5 1 to 4 1 Infection to 3 1 2 2 Neutralization 7 to 5 5 to 17 to 4 to 2 to 3 2 VE refers to vaccine effectiveness and vaccine efficacy *As of submission of this update *Summary of VE: indicates the general conclusions but only for the vaccines evaluated against the specific variant. Arrows ge neralize the magnitude of reduction in VE or neutralization: \"\" <10% reduction in VE, or VE >90% with no comparator, or that there was a <2 -fold reduction in neutralization; \"\" 10 to <20% reduction in VE, or 2 to <5 - fold reduction in neutralization; \"\" 20 to <30% reduction in VE, or 5 to <10 -fold reduction in neutralization; \"\" 30% reduction in VE, or 10 -fold reduction in 7: 01.Nov .2021 neutralization. When more than one neutralization study is available, the interquartile range (25th and 75th percentiles) of fol d-reductions across all studies used. \"Moderna -mRNA -1273/Pfizer BioNTech -Comirnaty\" indicates that both vaccines were evaluated together in study. The number of studies is shown as subscripts: vaccine effectiveness and neutralization studies informing this table can be found on the VIEW -hub Resources page ( https://view -hub.org/resources ). For individual vaccine effectiveness studies, see 'COVID -19 Vaccine Effectiveness Results Summary', reference numbers noted with a '#'. For a list of all neutralization studies, see 'COVID -19 Vaccine Neutralization Studies Table'. References indicated by superscripts next to VOC name in column 1 are vaccine efficacy results from randomized controlled trials informing this ta ble and are included in the Annex 1. Annex 1. Additional notes on VOC impacts on vaccines Studies reporting VOC -specific vaccine efficacy or effectiveness (VE) estimates for full vaccination ( 7 days post final dose) are assessed against a comparator VE estimate for that vaccine product to determine level of reduction in VE. For symptomatic disease, VOC VE is compared against phas e 3 randomised RCT results from non -VOC settings. For severe disease and infection, due to instability or lack of phase 3 RCT estimates for these outcomes, VOC VE is compared to n on-VOC VE estimates from the same study when available (or to Alpha VE from s ame study when assessing Beta, Gamma, or Delta); with an exception for AstraZeneca Vaxzevria for infection (when a phase 3 es timate of VE against infection due to non -VOC is available and used as comparator). In some instances, a study may be included for severe disease or infection outcome even without a comparator if a very high VE estimate is reported against a VOC (i.e., >90%). It is also important to note that studies vary in population, outcome definitions, study design and other methodological co nsiderations, which may in part explain differences when comparing VE estimates for a product between different studies. In addition, the reductions summarized in the table repr esent VE point estimates and do not represent the uncertainty intervals around t hese estimates which vary substantially across studies. The reductions in VE noted should be interpreted with these limitatio ns in mind. Table 3 summarizes the impact of VOCs on COVID -19 vaccine performance in the absence of waning, and, therefore, does not include studies that only assess VE greater than 4 months post final dose.
