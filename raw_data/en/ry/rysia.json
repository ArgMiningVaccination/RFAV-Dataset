The toxic build-up leads to cell death and cell mutation, which weakens your immune system. We will be talking about this in more detail at the next health workshop that is focused entirely on [Raising Healthy Families](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/healthy-families-raising-the-next-generation-naturally-tickets-44113198765). Ready to get a head start? Learn the Top 10 Toxic Food Additives to Avoid 1. Sodium Benzoate: This stealthy killer flies under most people's radar. It is found in just about everything in jars and bottles including: - salad dressing - pickles - sauces - mayonnaise - almost all soda and juice drinks - even in foods labeled as \"all natural\". 2. Canola Oil This artificial, Canadian-exported GMO is super popular and is found in over 30% of all products. It chokes out your mitochondrial cells. Canola oil is rapeseed oil and can cause emphysema and respiratory distress, eventually leading to cancer. 3. Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) The FDA allows 20 \"pseudo\" names for MSG including: - autolyzed yeast extract - free glutamate - glutamic acid - soy lecithin - calcium caseinate - hydrolyzed corn - hydrolyzed soy protein Just because a product says \"No MSG\" doesn't mean it's not in there! 4. Sodium Nitrates (nitrosamines) Used for fertilizers and explosives, and as a solvent in the dry cleaning industry. This ingredient keeps hemoglobin molecules in your blood from carrying oxygen to your body tissues. It's considered a \"super salt\" (like [MSG](http://newlifechiropracticrocklin.vaultwebsites.com/truth-behind-food-labels/)) added to things like hot dogs, cold cuts and bacon for added shelf-life, color, and flavor. Problems compound when microwaved. 5. Margarine The body cannot incorporate trans-fatty acids into membranes, thus causing deformed cellular structures. Vegetable shortening and partially hydrogenated vegetable oils accelerate aging and degenerative changes in tissues. 6. Anti-foaming agents (Dimethylpolysiloxane) An industrial chemical used in caulks and sealants. This component is mostly used in fast food chicken nuggets and eggs. Also, watch for TBHQ, a petroleum derivative, used as a stabilizer in perfumes, resins, varnishes and oil field chemicals, and linked to stomach tumors and DNA damage.

Anti-caking agents Chemicals that absorb moisture and prevent other compounds from sticking together. These are added to table salt and powdered food products. They are often composed of phosphate, carbonate, silicate and oxide compounds that contain aluminum. Watch for: - sodium alumino-silicate - alumino-calcium silicate - Aluminum Aluminum is linked to Alzheimer's and is also used in flu shots and vaccines. 8. Artificial colorings Synthetic petrochemicals made from petroleum, antifreeze, and ammonia. - Blue #1 causes kidney tumors in mice. - Red #2 and Blue #2 cause brain and bladder tumors in rats. - Red #3 causes thyroid cancer in animals, and is banned in cosmetics, but still allowed in food. - Red #40 debilitates the immune system. - Green #3 causes bladder and testes tumors. - Yellow #5 and #6 cause adrenal tumors in animals. 9. Emulsifiers Carrageenan, Polysorbate 80 and brominated vegetable oil (BVO). These are stabilizing, smoothing and thickening agents. They are typically found in: - chocolate milk - cottage cheese - ice cream - infant formula BVO remains in body fat for years. Polysorbate 80 is also found in most vaccines. 10. Artificial Sweeteners - Aspartame - Acesulfame K - Sucralose - Sorbitol - Truvia Because they taste sweet, these chemical sweeteners trick the body into ingesting them and holding on to them for extended periods of time, turning rancid in the body fat. Fake sugars are the \"Trojan horses\" of the cell-choking and mutating, food agent industry. Sorbitol is also found in many vaccines. Concerned about toxic overload?
