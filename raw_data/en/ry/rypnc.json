Certification Decision 1.1. Having taken utmost account of the European Commissions (the Commission ) opinion2 on our preliminary certification decision on the application for certification submitted by Blue Transmission Walney 1 Limited (the Applicant) , the Authority3 concludes that the Applicant complies with the requirements of the ownership unbundling model as set out in GB legislation and should therefore be certified as ownership unbundled. 1.2. This docu ment provides a summary of the assessment of the information submitted by the Applicant to the Authority and the Commission for the pur pose of assessing the Applicant s compliance with the unbundling requirements (the five tests as detailed below) and certification as independent from production, generation and supply undertakings under the GB legislation implementing the unbundling provisions of the Electricity Directive of the Third Package. 2. GB Legislation - Transposition of Directives 2009/72 and 2009/73 2.1. In GB the ownership unbundling requirem ents set out in Directive 2009/72 (the Electricity Directive ) have been transposed through the Electricity and Gas (Internal Markets) Regulations 2011 (the Regulatio ns) which insert new sections 10A to 10O into the Electricity Act 1989 (the Electricity Act ).

The Authoritys final decision and analysis on application for certification as unbundled by Blue Transmission Walney 1 Limited 2 of 3 3.2. The Applicant is a joint venture between an investment fund managed by Barc lays plc, namely Barclays Integrated Infrastructure Fund (BIIF) , and Mitsubishi Corporation (Mitsubishi). 4. Summary of our analysis 4.1. First test : The applicant (a) does not control a relevant producer or supplier; (b) does not have a majority shareholding in a relevant producer or supplier; and (c) will not, on or after the relevant date, exercise shareholder rights in relation to a relevant producer or supplier . 4.2. The Applicant has confirmed that it does not have any shareholding in nor does it control any other company . Furthermore , it has provided a signed undertaking that during the term of its OFTO licence, it will not exercise, or cause to be exercised on its behalf, any shareholder rights in relation to a relevant producer or supplier that it might acq uire during the currency of the undertaking. Therefore the Applicant meets the requirement s of the first test. 4.3. Second Test : Where the applicant is a company, partnership or other business, none of its senior officers has been, or may be, appointed by a person who (a) controls an electricity undertaking which is a relevant producer or supplier; or (b) has a majority shareholding in an electricity undertaking which is a relevant producer or supplier . 4.4. The Applicant has provided details of the process for ap pointing directors. The Applicant meets the requirements of the second test as none of its senior officers has been, or may be, appointed by a company or a natural person who (a) controls an electricity undertaking which is a relevant producer or supplier; or (b) has a majority shareholding in an electricity undertaking which is a relevant producer or supplier . 4.5. Third Test : Where the applicant is a company, partnership or other business, none of its senior officers is also a senior officer of an electricity undertaking which is a relevant producer or supplier . 4.6. The information provided by the Applic ant confirms that none of its directors or senior officers is also a senior officer of electricity undertaking which is a relevant producer or supplier . The Appli cant therefore meet s the requirement of the third test. 4.7. Fourth and Fifth Tests : The applicant is not controlled by a person who (a) controls a relevant producer or supplier; and, (b) has a majority shareholding in a relevant producer or supplier . 4.8. The Applicant has provided a comprehensive account of the corporate structures of its ultimate controllers and identified its controllers, namely Barclays plc and Mitsubishi and certain associated entities . Both Barclays and Mitsubishi directly or through various subsidiaries control electricity undertakings which are involved in the production of electricity. We are satisfied that these interests do not involve relevant producers or suppliers and that there is no realistic prospect of the Applicant discri minating in favour of these undertakings. We are therefore satisfied that none of the controllers of the Applicant controls or has a majority shareholding in a relevant producer or supplier. Therefore, the Applicant meets the requirements of the fourth and fifth tests. 5. European Commission Opinion 5.1. The Commissions opinion is dated 15 February 2013 . 5.2. Pursuant to Article 3(2) of the Electricity Regulation the Authority is required to take \"utmost account \" of the Commissions opinion in reaching its final certification decisions. We The Authoritys final decision and analysis on application for certification as unbundled by Blue Transmission Walney 1 Limited 3 of 3 summarise below how we have taken \"utmost account\" of the Commission s opinion on the Authority s preliminary certification decision s in relation to the Applicant . 5.3. The Commission set out the relevant legislation in its opini on. Article 9(1)(b) of the Electricity Directive prohibits the same person or persons from directly or indirectly exercising control over a transmission system operator or over a transmission system, and directly or indirectly exercising control or exercis ing any right over an undertaking performing any of the functions of production or supply , and vice versa . 5.4. Article 9(1)(c) and (d ) of the Electricity Directive prohibits the same person or persons from control ling or exercising any right over an undertaki ng performing any of the functions of production or supply and at the same time be a member of or be entitled to appoint members of the supervisory board, the administrative board of a transmission system operator or bodies legally representing the transmission system operator . 5.5. The Commission noted that \"the existing production or supply interests of Barclays and Mitsubishi do not constitute a risk of discrimination in the operation of the network or to adequate investment in the network controlled by the Applicant. Consequently an obstacle to certification cannot be identified .\" The Commission also noted that it \" considers a refusal of certification would run counter to the principle of proportionality given the fact that th e interests of the person s controlling the TSO (ie the OFTO) do not lead to a situation the unbundling rules seek to prevent \". 5.6. The Commission recall ed the obligation set out in Article 10(4) of the Electricity Directive to monitor the continuing compliance of TSOs with the unbundl ing requirements. 5.7. The GB legal framework provides a number of measures to ensure the robustness of our certification decisions on an ongoing basis. The Authority has an obligation under section 10I, 10J and 10L of the Regulations to monitor and review whe ther a certified person should remain certified according to the process set out in the Regulations. We require certified parties to inform the Authority of any significant changes that are relevant to our certification decisions promptly and to provide th e Authority with an annual update. 5.8. In compliance with the GB legal framework and the Electricity Directive, we will continue to monitor whether the basis on which the Authority decided to certify the Applicant continues to apply, and will include a condit ion in our final certification decision which requires the Applicant to regularly report to us on the relevant circumstances in this respect.
