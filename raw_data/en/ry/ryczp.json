Patients who are hospitalized and test positive for COVID-19 may be admitted to an acute care bed (a regular hospital bed), or an intensive care unit (ICU) bed. This data shows the daily total count of COVID+ patients in these two bed types, and the data reflects totals from all San Francisco Hospitals.

Cases are included on the date the positive test was collected. Population charac- teristics are subgroups, or demographic cross-sections, like age, race, or gender. The City tracks how cases have been distributed among different subgroups. This information can reveal trends and disparities among groups. Data is lagged by ve days, meaning the most recent specimen collection date included is 5 days prior to today. Tests take time to process and report, so more recent data is less reliable.

This data includes a daily count of test results reported, and how many of those were positive, negative, and indeterminate. Reported tests include tests with a positive, negative or indeterminate result. Indeterminate results, which could not con- clusively determine whether COVID-19 virus was present, are not included in the calculation of percent positive. Testing for the novel coronavirus is available through commercial, clinical, and hospital laboratories, as well as the SFDPH Public Health Laboratory.

The data is broken down by multiple demographic slices. The three dose types are counted separately, i.e. (1) rst doses administered as a part of a two-dose vaccination, (2) second doses administered as part of a two-dose vaccination, and (3) single-dose vaccines administered. here NOTE: This dataset is no longer supported and will be deprecated on the next release (v0.1.3). The covid19sf_population dataset is an alternative for covid19sf_vaccine_demo.

All vaccines given to SF residents are included, no matter where the vaccination took place (the vaccine may have been administered in San Francisco or outside of San Francisco). Data provides counts for people who have received at least one dose and people who have completed a vaccine series. A vaccine series is complete after an individual has received both doses of a two-dose vaccine or one dose of a one-dose vaccine.
