However, a basic mechanistic understanding of its function remains elusive. This is further complicated by the observations that animals can function properly even without sleep for extended periods. Drosophila, a genetically potent sleep model, needs sleep to form long-term memories, similar to mammals. However, conditions such as starvation require flies to remain active to forage for food, and therefore the ability to form memory without sleep may confer an evolutionary advantage. My work showed that starved flies can form long-term reward memories without sleep but require sleep for memory consolidation if food is available. Flies rely on a feeding/hunger-dependent adaptive switch that drives the recruitment of distinct neuronal circuits to form either sleep-dependent memory or sleep-independent memory. The neuronal circuit required for sleep-dependent memory in fed flies also drives sleep post-training, thereby linking sleep and memory. This adaptive circuit-based mechanism allows flies to retain essential information in varying environmental conditions. Altogether, this work demonstrated that the role of sleep in memory formation is not universal but is adaptive and is regulated by physiologically relevant environmental factors. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Mammalian cilia and flagella play key roles in cellular signalling, sensory activities, organogenesis (primary cilia), embryonic symmetry (nodal cilia) as flow and motility (motile cilia and flagella). The core structure of cilia and flagella, the axoneme, is a microtubule-based structure that is a hub of various tubulin posttranslational modifications (PTMs) - a key component of the 'tubulin code' that currently emerges as a regulator of microtubule properties and functions. Among the different PTMs enriched in cilia, glycylation is exclusive to cilia and flagella and while it was evidently observed on motile cilia, it was rarely detected on primary cilia. Developing new antibodies to glycylation, I established that primary cilia do have glycylation, and that similar to motile cilia, it has a role in stabilizing the primary cilia. To obtain an in-depth molecular and physiological understanding of the role of glycylation in mammals, I developed a transgenic mouse model knocked out for both the initiating glycylases (Ttll3-/-/Ttll8-/-). Despite their lack of glycylation in all ciliated tissues, strikingly, the Ttll3-/-/Ttll8-/- mice did not show any signs of ciliary dysfunctions characteristic of ciliopathies. However, the male mice were sub-fertile with defects in sperm flagellar beating and overall motility, resulting in majority of the sperm swimming in a circular/helical pattern that impede straight-line swimming, thus leading to a concomitant loss of progressive motility. In-depth cryo-electron tomography analysis of the molecular alterations within the axoneme determined that lack of glycylation causes abnormal conformations of the dynein arms within sperm axonemes, providing the structural basis for the observed dysfunction. Overall, our work unravels the importance of microtubule glycylation for controlled flagellar beating, directional sperm swimming, and male fertility. Apart from glycylation, cilia are also rich in glutamylation and how these two impact primary cilia functions in mammals is barely understood. The primary cilia are a hub of various signalling pathways, which are regulated by trafficking of different signalling molecules through the intraflagellar transport (IFT). In the future, I propose to determine the molecular link between tubulin PTMs and intraflagellar transport and how this impacts the different signalling pathways, thus influencing diverse cellular functions that are regulated through primary cilia. I will also establish how defects in tubulin PTMs can lead to ciliopathies, deciphering the molecular mechanisms and clinical implications of tubulin posttranslational modifications, thus establishing tubulin PTMs as a key regulator of organ function and tissue homeostasis. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Archives at the National Centre for Biological Sciences Public Lecture Series https://www.ncbs.res.in/events/apls 38th edition Monthly talks framed around explorations in and around archives. Discussions by artists, archivists, academics, lawyers, teachers, journalists and others. The extent of virtue: Impossible Idealism, Drastic Choices, and the Urge to Help Larissa MacFarquhar in conversation with Samanth https://youtube.com/BLiSCIndia Abstract: What does it mean to devote yourself wholly to helping others? In her work, Larissa MacFarquhar seeks out people living lives of extreme ethical commitment and tells their deeply intimate stories; their stubborn integrity and their compromises; their bravery and their recklessness; their joys and defeats and wrenching dilemmas. A couple adopts two children in distress, then four, then ten, then twenty. An activist lets go off of everything he possesses, all for a cause. A woman believes that if she spends money on herself, rather than donating it to buy life-saving medicine, she's responsible for the deaths that result. She lives on a fraction of her income, but wonders: when is compromise self-indulgence and when is it essential? In her talk, which draws from her book, Stranger Drowning, she will touch upon what drives some people to live lives of extraordinary moral commitment. What are the joys, the difficulties, and the complications of such a life? And why do the rest of us not give more than we do? It's not just selfishness: deep cultural forces push people away from altruism. Her work challenges us to think about what we value most, and why. MacFarquhar draws on history, literature, philosophy and social science to ground these deeply reported stories around lives of extreme virtue. Through its sympathetic and beautifully vivid storytelling, her work confronts us with fundamental questions about what it means to be human. Note: Much of this abstract is excerpted from the book jacket of Strangers Drowning. https://www.amazon.in/Strangers-Drowning-Impossible-Idealism-Drastic/dp/0143109782 Bio: Larissa MacFarquhar has been a staff writer at The New Yorker since 1998.

Although RT is effective in providing local tumor control, it causes a wide range of normal tissue changes, such as oxidative stress, inflammation, immunomodulatory and mitogenic cytokine production, extracellular matrix production, and senescence tissue stem cells. The senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) can promote inflammation and stimulate alterations in the surrounding tissue. Therefore, we hypothesized that senescent cells from irradiated lung tissue would enhance tumor growth. Using a murine syngeneic tumor model of lung metastasis, we demonstrate that lung radiation causes a significant increase in markers of senescence within 4 to 8 weeks. Further, injection of B16F0 cells at these time points after radiation results in an increase in the number and size of pulmonary tumor nodules relative to unirradiated mice. Treatment of irradiated mice with a senolytic agent (ABT-737) or agents that prevent senescence after irradiation (Rapamycin, INK-128) was sufficient to reduce senescent cell numbers in irradiated lung and to mitigate radiation-enhanced tumor growth. These agents also abrogated radiation induced expression of 12-Lox, a molecule implicated in several deleterious effects of senescence. Further, deficiency of 12-Lox was sufficient to prevent radiation enhanced tumor growth. Together, these data demonstrate the pro-tumorigenic role of senescence in irradiated tissue, introduces the dual mTORC inhibitor INK-128 as an effective agent for prevention of radiation-induced normal tissue senescence, and identifies Alox12 as an important component of the pro-tumorigenic irradiated tissue microenvironment. These studies suggest the combination of senescence modifying agents with radiotherapy may lead to a decrease in therapy-induced tumor growth. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| SUMO (Small ubiquitin-like modifier) is an important post-translational regulating various cellular processes. SUMO modulates the target protein\\\\'s function and activity by providing an additional noncovalent interaction interface where conjugated SUMO interacts with other proteins. Interaction between SUMO and interacting partner is mediated by the SUMO Interacting Motif (SIM). SIM mediated interaction regulates several cellular processes by changing the SUMOylated protein\\\\'s intracellular localization, stability, conformation, and enzymatic activity. Viruses modulate cellular pathways to create a suitable environment for survival and replication in the host cell. SUMOylation, being a key regulator of several cellular pathways, is a strategic viral target. Viral proteins exploit both the covalent interaction with SUMO (SUMOylation) and noncovalent SIM-SUMO interactions. Thus, interaction between and SUMO, both covalent (SUMOylation) and noncovalent (SIM-SUMO), is important for effective viral infection. The thesis addresses how immediate-early (IE) proteins of Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) interact with the host SUMOylation pathway. IE genes are the first viral genes transcribed during the lytic infection cycle. Thus, IEs are essential to optimize the host cell environment for viral genome replication and the transcription of early and late genes. Understanding the molecular details of IE-SUMO interaction can provide us significant insights into how HCMV exploits the host SUMOylation machinery. HCMV expresses two IE proteins - IE1 and IE2, which are multifunctional and essential proteins for viral propagation. Together IE1 and IE2 help to evade anti-viral responses, modulate the host cell cycle to promote viral genome replication, and transactivate various viral/host promoters. Interestingly, the pathways targeted by IE1 and IE2 (like cell cycle, transcription, immune response) are also regulated by SUMO. Hence, the IEs hijack the host SUMO machinery to control these pathways. The thesis attempts to study the IE1/IE2 interaction with SUMO. We carried out a study to characterize SIMs in HCMV-IE1. Two SIMs were predicted in IE1. NMR confirmed the binding of predicted IE1-SIMs and SUMO. Interestingly, IE1-SIMs did not bind to SUMO2, indicating that IE1-SIMs have paralog specific binding exclusive to SUMO1. The importance of newly identified IE1-SIMs was analyzed for different IE1 functions. IE1-SIM1 facilitates IE1-IE2 synergy to transactivate IE2 responsive promoters. The literature suggests that IE1 mediated transactivation and PML-disruption are co-dependent activities. Our studies showed that the two activities of IE1 are separable. IE1-SIM1 is involved in the IE1-IE2 synergy, but not in IE1 mediated loss of PML SUMOylation. Taken together, the study reveals critical insights into the functional role of noncovalent interactions between E1 and SUMO. Besides, a systematic study was carried out to study interactions between IE2 and SUMO. NMR titrations confirmed that IE2 has two SIMs. Interestingly, IE2-SIM1 shows a three-fold higher affinity for SUMO1 in comparison to IE1-SIMs. In contrast, IE2-SIM2 binds weakly to SUMO1, but not SUMO2. Interestingly, IE2-SIM1 is adjacent to the IE2 SUMOylation sites. SUMOylation assays and structural studies reveal recruits E2~SUMO thioester to enhance SUMOylation at revealed two kinase (CK2) sites to IE2-SIM1. the Serines creates new salt- bridges with SUMO residues, which increases the SUMO/IE2-SIM1 affinity by eight-fold. The phosphorylation drastically enhances IE2 SUMOylation as well. Phosphorylation also enhanced the SUMO-dependent transactivation activity and auto-repression activity of IE2. Altogether, we reveal an intriguing mechanism used by the viral factor IE2 to exploit a cross-talk of two post-translational modifications, phosphorylation and SUMOylation, to ensure an effective viral replication. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| The prostate is a walnut-sized organ that sits around the male urethra and contributes secretions important for sperm health. With age, the prostate increases in size and constricts the urethral opening. Prostate hyperplasia affects the vast majority of aging men and is a leading cause of urinary problems. Secretions from the prostate drain into the urethra in a region called the transition zone which is the primary site for hyperplasia. I will describe how single cell RNA-sequencing and histological studies led to the identification of two novel cell types, club and hillock, in the urethra and transition zone of the prostate. Unlike prostate cells, these novel urethral cell types do not depend on male hormones for survival. Men with prostate hyperplasia are treated with drugs to reduce the key male hormone dihydrotestosterone and shrink the prostate. Prostate cells in men treated with hormone reducing drugs undergo an unexpected transition to a club cell-like state. This transition is characterized by a reduction in prostate gland size and morphology as well as an increase in NF-KB signaling. This epithelial plasticity appears to be a survival strategy and a protective mechanism in the face of reduced dihydrotestosterone and increased inflammation. The induction of a urethral cell state as a protective mechanism in the prostate highlights understudied aspects of urethral cells in maintaining homeostasis, immune regulation and anti-microbial activity at the urethral barrier. 10:15 AM, Monday, Jul 05, 2021 | Remote VCSeminar by Dr Rakesh Chatrikhi on 'Mechanisms of Gene Regulation During T Cell Activation' 06:00 PM, Thursday, Jul 08, 2021 | Remote VCThesis by Mr Bishal Basak transfer 04:00 PM, Wednesday, 14, 2021 | Remote VCSeminar by Dr Vikas Bansal on 'Single-Cell and of iPSC-Derived Dopaminergic Neurons from Parkinson's Disease Patients' 10:00 AM, Friday, Jul 16, 2021 | Remote VCThesis Seminar by Ms Ananya Mukherjee on 'Visualizing spatio-temporal protein activation and dynamic signal integration with engineered fluorescent biosensors' 10:15 AM, Monday, Jul 19, 2021 | Remote VCSeminar by Dr K Venkatesan Iyer on 'Investigating the mechanisms of tissue fluidity and its role in wound healing and tumor invasion.' 10:15 AM, Monday, Jul 26, 2021 | Remote VCSeminar by Dr Sudarshan Gadadhar on 'Tubulin posttranslational modifications: functional implications in mammalian cilia and flagella.' 03:30 PM, Monday, Jul 26, 2021 | Remote VCPresynopsis Thesis Seminar by Ms isoforms G-protein coupled signaling in vivo' 09:00 AM, Friday, Aug 06, 2021 | Remote VCSeminar by Dr Avantika Lal on 'Deep Learning Models to Enhance Epigenomic Data' 03:00 PM, Tuesday, Aug 10, 2021 | Remote VCThesis Seminar by Ms Shreya Das Sharma on 'Characterization of the electrophysiological properties of human pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons (hPSC) from fragile X Syndrome patients' 04:30 PM, Thursday, Aug 12, 2021 | Remote VCPresynopsis Thesis Seminar by Ms Anjali Jaiman 'Glycan variability and control in the Golgi 06:30 PM, Friday, Aug 13, 2021 | Remote VCPublic Lecture by Dr Harsh Mander on 'Can a State Love its People?
