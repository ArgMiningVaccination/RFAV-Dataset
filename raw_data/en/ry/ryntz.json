There is no evidence that aspirin decreases the incidence of coronary artery abnormalities, and there is no data to suggest that a high vs. moderate dose of aspirin is superior. The AHA guidelines state it is reasonable to administer moderate- or high-dose aspirin until the patient is afebrile, although there is no evidence it reduces coronary artery aneurysms. This pathway does not recommend high-dose aspirin in those already receiving steroids, since steroids offer a powerful anti-inflammatory effect. This pathway suggests transitioning to low-dose ASA after 24 hours to allow for a better assessment of fever and treatment resistance prior to discharge. |Dose|| | |2nd Line Thrombosis Prevention|| | |Special Considerations|| | Reference [Diagnosis, Treatment, and Long-Term Management of Kawasaki Disease: A Scientific Statement for Health Professionals From the "}
