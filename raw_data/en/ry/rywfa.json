You may have even heard of \"fertility herbs for men and women\" being discussed online. However, there is no scientific evidence that they work; therefore, if you plan to use herbs for fertility, consult your doctor or a herbal medicine specialist beforehand. In this post, we have included a list of herbs that promote fertility in both men and women. Can Herbs Cure Infertility? There is no conclusive evidence to say that herbs cure infertility. However, they have been used in many cultures to support female and male reproductive health and fertility. Chinese and Ayurvedic medicines still encourage the use of some herbs and herbal blends to support hormonal balance and fertility cycles. Some herbs were also used in combination with in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intrauterine insemination (IUI)i [X]A procedure in which a sperm is directly put inside the uterus to increase the probability of egg fertilization. [(1)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6047296/). FDA Does Not Regulate Herbal Supplements. Are They Safe To Take? Herbal fertility supplements have limited US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation. They are not subjected to the same scientific scrutiny and are not regulated as much as medications. Therefore, herbs and herbal supplements, though marked 'natural,' may still have side effects [ (2)](https://ods.od.nih.gov/pubs/DS_WhatYouNeedToKnow.pdf). Always check with an experienced herbalist or naturopath before trying any herbs. Do Herbal Medicine Practitioners Own Licenses Or Registrations? Herbal medicine practice is not usually a licensed profession. But some providers take up a regional or national board certification. To stay safe, consult a practitioner who has a certification. Delayed pregnancies and continuous fertility rate decline propel fertility supplements' growth in the market. As a result, market analysts predict that the global fertility supplements market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.9% from 2022 to 2030. Moreover, while the natural supplement market is expected to experience steady growth, the segment for synthetic or a blend of synthetic and natural supplements is projected to grow substantially. The following graph depicts this growth trend.

Ashwagandha (Withania Also referred to as ayurvedic rasayana or rejuvenator, ashwagandha is believed to aid fertility. It is said to enhance the endocrine system, thus regulating the adrenal and thyroid glands, which may help balance the reproductive hormones. Ashwagandha is also believed to strengthen [the ovaries](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/early-pregnancy-ovary-pain-causes-treatment_00785754/), uterus, and the immune system [ (3)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4687242/). [X]A pituitary gland hormone responsible for sexual function, and menstruation. and luteinizing hormonei [X]A hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary gland, responsible for regulating ovulation in women and androgen synthesis in men. , leading to positive effects on female reproductive health [(17)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5833251/). 2. Red raspberry (Rubus idaeus) [Red Raspberry](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/can-you-eat-raspberries-when-pregnant_00379885/) is said to have properties for enhancing fertility naturally. It is a nutritive, astringent herb that might support uterine tissues. In some cases, it may lead to loose stools and nausea. 3. Red clover (Trifolium pretense) It has plant estrogens that may help boost fertility in women with estrogen deficiency. It may also help in correcting fallopian tube scarring due to its anti-inflammatory properties, is believed to regulate an irregular menstrual cycle, and can be a supportive herb in unexplained infertility. Red clover is contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding. So, if you believe you have conceived, stop drinking it. It is also contraindicated in conditions such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosisi [X]A disorder in which the uterine tissue grows outside the uterus. , or [uterine fibroids](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/effective-treatments-to-cure-uterine-fibroids-during-pregnancy_0095804/) due to its estrogen-like properties. [Period Calculator](https://www.momjunction.com/period-calculator/) 4. Dong Quai (Angelica Sinensis) Extensively used in Chinese medicine, this herbal medicine is said to regulate menstruation and ovulation, clear stagnation of blood (a major cause of infertility), and assist in toning the uterus [ (4)](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/936.html). Do not take this along with blood-thinning medications. Stop using when [affected by diarrhea](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/diarrhea-during-pregnancy-causes-home-remedies_00750375/), excessive menstrual flow, or hemorrhagic conditions. [(4)](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/936.html). 5. False unicorn (Chamalerium luteum) Although this herb is used for fertility, you should use it only when a qualified herbalist or midwife prescribes it.

It is used as one of the aphrodisiac herbs in some medical practices [(6)](http://medicinalgardens.web.unc.edu/wild-yam/). You may have to use it before ovulation, i.e., the first half of the menstrual cycle. This herb is not advised if you have a history of estrogen-responsive cancers. 7. Vitex (Chaste tree) This herb is believed to normalize the ovulation process by stimulating the luteinizing hormone and minimizing the release of the follicle-stimulating hormone. Vitex is also thought to balance the estrogen and progesterone production in the body [ (7)](https://sites.evergreen.edu/plantchemeco/calling-all-ladies-mother-natures-remedy/).

However, there is no science supporting the use of this herb for fertility. 10. Motherwort (Leonurus cardiac) This herb is believed to stimulate the uterus and improve the uterine tone. It is also thought to bring on the menstrual cycle that may be delayed due to stress or anxiety. There is no research though, to explain its effect on fertility.

American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) This herb is said to tone and nourish the male reproductive system and treat impotence. It is known to improve sperm count, motilityi [X]The ability of the sperm to move and swim. , and testosterone concentration too [ (9)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3861174/). Avoid combining it with blood-thinning medications. 13. Peruvian Maca (Lepidium meyenii) Peruvian Maca root is believed to improve libido, sperm count, and motility. It is an active endurance enhancer and may rectify erectile dysfunction [ (10)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3184420/). It might stimulate energy and should not be taken before bedtime. 14. Saw palmetto (Serenoa repens) It has been traditionally used for improving prostate wellness, low libido, and impotence. It might also build and tone the male reproductive system too [ (11)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4002402/).

It is believed to improve the testosterone levels, stimulate sensory nerves, and boost healthy sperm production [ (12)](http://healthpsych.psy.vanderbilt.edu/HealthPsych/hornygoat.htm). Long-term use might lead to vomiting, nausea, headaches, thirst and dry mouth, [breathing difficulties](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/deal-breathing-problems-pregnancy_0080320/), and episodic spasms. 17. Astragalus (Astragalus propinquus) It might help in boosting immunity and improving sperm quality and motility [(13)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4936768/) [(14)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5422695/). The most common side effect of this herb is diarrhea. It may also influence blood sugar levels and blood pressure. 18. Yohimbe (Pausinystalia yohimbe) The bark is believed to support healthy circulation in the reproductive organs. It might, therefore, be used to treat erectile dysfunction and as a libido booster [(14)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5422695/). Avoid using in case of low blood pressure; it can be toxic in high dosages. 19. Goji berry (Lycium barbarum) The dried Goji fruit might protect sperm from overheating (hyperthermia), thus helping preserve sperm quality and quantity. It may also support hormonal balance by supporting liver functioning [ (15)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4402873/). Avoid goji berries if your blood sugar and blood pressure levels are low, as they can further drop them [ (16)](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/1025.html). 20. Schisandra berry (Schisandra chinensis) This herb is believed to help in enhancing sperm production. There is also a belief that it may increase enzyme production and the levels of glycogen, which might be essential for gonad and kidney health.
