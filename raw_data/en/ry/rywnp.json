Prayer Ceremonies: THE WORLD NEEDS YOUR LOVE. During this world crisis, we felt a need to do something positive and from a place of love. We decided to perform a monthly prayer ceremony for healing and unity for at least over a few months. Each ceremony is being offered to help us all unite and realize that the power of our combined prayers and intentions can bring about healing and peace. You can submit your prayers to us so we are able to pray for your wishes. And join us live online to participate in the ceremony and be a part of this World Wide sacred event for healing and hope. 21-Day Prayer Meditations: These meditations are for those who wish to create a powerful current of love and hope for our entire planet. You will be first invited to participate in our ceremony online with your wish to heal yourself and the world. In an effort to support you in your continuous prayer, we will provide guidelines on how to do a 21-day prayer meditation after each ceremony, so together we can bring about healing and peace not only for ourselves but for all of humanity and the Earth.
