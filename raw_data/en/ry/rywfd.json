You probably make routine trips to the doctor for check-ups, try to eat healthy, and make sure everyone is getting regular exercise. But it's important not to overlook another important area that impacts our daily and long-term health: the types of cleaning and personal products we use every day. In this guide, you'll find everything you need to get started using less-toxic products in your home! This post may contain affiliate links. If you click one of them, I may receive compensation at no additional cost to you. Please see my full [disclaimer](https://saraheverafter.com/disclaimer/) for more information. Why Switch to Less Toxic Products? If you've been using conventional products for years (and your mother and grandmother used them before you) why is it so important to make the switch now? Does it really have that much impact on our health? Yes, it really does For one thing, many of the products are not exactly the same as they were when our mother and grandmother used them. Plus, these days, we have access to a lot more information about what the ingredients in our cleaning products and cosmetics really are and how they have been impacting our health over the past decades. Studies show that many of the ingredients in products commonly sold in our grocery and drugstores are linked to health problems such as skin irritation, allergies, breathing problems, reproductive harm, and even cancer. We're automatically being exposed to more toxins than ever before, thanks to pesticides, pollution, and other chemicals that have leached into our environment over the past 100 years or so.. While we can't avoid all of these toxins in our air, water, and soil, we have a lot more control over the products we choose to purchase and bring into our homes. And that can take some of the burden off our bodies, so they can continue their natural detoxifying processes and we can stay as healthy as possible. I don't know about you, but I'm ready to stop using products that are potentially harmful and start using products that are just as effective but are safer for me and my family! How to Know Which Ingredients to Avoid There are thousands of ingredients and chemicals in common household products and cosmetics. The good news is you don't need to personally learn what every single one of them is and does and whether it's considered safe. Instead, start by familiarizing yourself with some of the most common worst offenders, such as: - Parabens - Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) and Sodium Sulfate (SLES) - Phthalates Triclosan and Triclocarban Aluminum - Propylene Glycol (PG) & Butylene Glycol - Mineral Oil - Formaldehyde And of course, if there are specific ingredients you know you have an allergy or sensitivity too, you can add them to the list. Then, you can take advantage of resources to research specific ingredients and products, and even to find solid recommendations for safer brands! Resources for Researching Ingredients and Product Safety Ratings There are so many more resources out there for finder safer products now than there were when I first started switching! Whether you're ready to dive into reading safety studies yourself or you just want someone else to point you in the right direction, you'll be able to find a resource that works for you. The Switch Natural App My favorite resource for finding clean products right now is the [Switch Natural app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/switch-natural/id1585993920). It isn't free (the price is a one-time charge of $20, with no further in-app purchases needed) but it is SO worth the price. With this app, you can take a photo or screenshot of the ingredients of ANY product, and the app will flag any potentially harmful ingredients for you. You can then tap on the ingredients to read a synopsis of why it's of concern, and if you want to know more, there are clickable references so you can read studies or articles for yourself. You can also search for whatever type of product you're looking for and the app will provide suggestions for clean options for that product. What I really like about the Switch Natural app is that is it strictly focused on flagging ingredients of concern, rather than presenting a rating for the product, which can be misleading. For example, sometimes in other apps a product will contain multiple poorly rated ingredients but still be rated highly overall. That means I have to do more research to try to figure out the discrepancy, or question whether there might be some sort of bias toward that brand. With Switch Natural, you simply get either a clean rating OR a list of ingredients of concern. Then you can decide whether you want to pass on that product due to the presence of that ingredient, or not. The Switch Natural app is straightforward and easy to use and it's creator is constantly working to improve it and add new product recommendations. It's the resource I wish I would have had when I started switching to safer products! Free Research Options That being said, I know cost can be an option, especially when you're just starting out. So if you're looking for a free option to start with, check out the [EWG's Healthy Living app](https://www.ewg.org/apps/) or the [ThinkDirty app](https://www.thinkdirtyapp.com/). They are ratings-based, so they'll give you an overall rating for the product. You can also dive deeper by looking at each ingredient and it's rating. As mentioned above, sometimes it can be a little confusing because the ratings don't always line up obviously with the ingredients, but it's a good place to start at least. You can also use the Environmental Working Group's (EWG's) [SkinDeep Database](https://www.ewg.org/) (for beauty and personal care products) and [Healthy Living Database](https://www.ewg.org/guides/cleaners) (for cleaning and household products) to do research online. And the [MADE SAFE website](https://www.madesafe.org/) is very helpful too, both for general research about ingredients and products and for finding solid recommendations for less-toxic brands and products. You can also look for their symbol when you're shopping; if you see it, you know the product has passed their rigorous standards. Blogs and Social Media You can also find great recommendations from other regular people who are the journey to less-toxic living and who share their tips and favorite products online. Here are some of my favorites: - Websites and Blogs: [Wellness Mama](https://wellnessmama.com/) [CleanMama](https://www.cleanmama.net/) [I Read Labels for You](https://ireadlabelsforyou.com/) Of course, you should always be sure that you're taking recommendations from reputable sources and that you do your own research before choosing products to try. Only you know what's right for yourself and your family! Should You Purchase Natural Products or Make Your Own? Making your own products gives you the most possible control when it comes to choosing ingredients. But not everyone wants to DIY their products, especially when they're first starting out. You might feel more comfortable easing into natural living by purchasing less-toxic options that feel more similar to the conventional products you're used to. And that's fine. Generally speaking, making your own products will save you more money and purchasing less-toxic products will save you more time. So ask yourself which is more of a priority for you right now. Keep an Eye Out for \"Cleanwashing\" If you do decide you're going to stick with store-bought products, it's important to be wary of \"cleanwashing\" as you shop. You may be more familiar with the term greenwashing, which is when companies spin their products and practices as being more natural and eco-friendly than they really are. Cleanwashing is a bit of a newer term and it refers to marketing ploys that make products appear to be more natural and less-toxic than they really are. Just because a product says it contains natural ingredients, doesn't mean it contains ONLY natural ingredients! Here are some examples of cleanwashing: - Language like \"green,\" \"natural,\" or \"plant-based.\" - Claiming to be \"organic,\" without USDA certification to back up the claim. - Using a lot of green on a label or images like leaves or flowers. - Drawing a lot of attention to a list of ingredients that the product is \"free-from.\" It's easy to be misled by these types of marketing ploys \u2014 companies use them because they work! That's why it's important to research your choices using resources like the ones listed above. My Experience with Cleanwashing In fact, I was surprised when I starting diving deeper into some of the brands I had been using (such as Method and Mrs. Meyer's) to learn that they're not as clean and natural as I would have thought. Many of their products get ratings of D or even F. Yikes! Now, when you're just starting out cleaning up your products, you may want to opt for brands like those because they're easily accessible and affordable. Personally I viewed those products as stepping stones on my journey to less-toxic living. So don't feel bad if you're using these products right now! The point is to remember that there is a range out of there of products that contain many potentially harmful ingredients, products that contain a few potentially harmful ingredients, and products that are as non-toxic as possible. So keep doing your research and educating yourself about which brands, products, and ingredients you feel comfortable with at any given point on your journey. Some Clean Brands to Get You Started The good news is that there are more and more truly clean, natural, less-toxic brands and options out there than ever before, with new ones being added all the time! I guarantee that if you keep doing your research and keep an ear out for recommendations, you'll discover some amazing sources for clean products for your home. To get you started, here are some of my favorite brands and products: [Branch Basics Concentrate](http://www.branchbasics.com)(Cleaning, Laundry, Hand Soap) Freshener, Linen Spray) [The Honest Company](https://www.honest.com/)(Cleaning, Household, Baby, Skin Care, Makeup) [Pure Haven](https://purehaven.com/)(Skin Care, Household, Cleaning, Baby Care, even Pets) [Mineral Fusion](https://www.mineralfusion.com/)(Makeup) [100% Pure](https://www.100percentpure.com/)(Skin Care, Makeup) [Acure](https://acure.com/)(Skin Care, Hair Care) [BeautyCounter](https://www.beautycounter.com/)(Skin Care, Makeup) [Pretty Frank](https://pretty-frank.com/)(Deodorant, Skin Care, Oral Care) And here are a few specific products that I use that are fairly clean, even thought they are from brands with other products that I am not comfortable using: [Seventh spray](https://amzn.to/3a4zvUX) More and more, I'm interested in making my own products \u2014 especially cleaning products. It's a bit more daunting to make your own cosmetics, although you can find recipes on Pinterest if you want to give it a try. Where to Shop for Natural Products and DIY Supplies When it's finally time to shop for and purchase your non-toxic alternatives, or the ingredients you'll use to make your own, where should you look? Here are some of my favorite places to find natural products and ingredients: Local Stores It's especially helpful if you have a local health food store or natural living store. But even if you don't, most grocery stores now carry at least a few natural alternatives for cleaning and personal care products. Just be sure to do your research ahead of time or have one of the apps recommended above so you can scan products as you shop so you know which ones are really safer. Amazon The sheer variety on Amazon, plus their low prices make them a great place to purchase natural products, ingredients, and supplies like glass spray bottles that you'll need to make your own recipes. (More about that below.) Individual Websites Many great clean brands are only available via their own websites. Some of my favorites that I have to purchase through the company website are Branch Basics, Beautycounter, and Risewell toothpaste. While it's not as convenient as purchasing on Amazon or in my local grocery store, it's totally worth it to get products we enjoy using and feel good about! As with deciding whether to DIY or not, choosing where you purchase your safer products really comes down to how much time and money you have, and which products you and your family end up liking the best! Getting Started with Making Your Own Natural Products Even if you're not ready to try making your own products right away, I encourage you to eventually give it a try. Making your own cleaning products or beauty products not only ensures that you're using pure and safe ingredients, it's also very economical. And it can be fun too! Many ingredients in homemade products \u2014 like baking soda, for example \u2014 are items you likely already have in your pantry. Others may be items you've never used before. Here are some ingredients and supplies you can use to get started making your own products: Good Starter Ingredients: - baking soda - white vinegar (Be sure to check out [my guide to cleaning safely and effectively with vinegar](https://saraheverafter.com/clean-with-vinegar/)!) - coconut oil - rubbing alcohol or inexpensive vodka [castile soap](https://amzn.to/3WTFceH) - essential oils (Learn more about [the best affordable brands for great quality essential oils in this post](https://saraheverafter.com/best-essential-oil-brands/).) Essential Supplies: [glass spray bottles](https://amzn.to/3XaD55Z)(16 oz) [glass spray bottles](https://amzn.to/3X9P9EL)(8 [silicon base sleeve for 16 oz spray bottles](https://amzn.to/3il6XxS) [glass containers with lids](https://amzn.to/3IrwHDq)(eg, mason jars - great for holding [cleaning scrubs](https://saraheverafter.com/diy-kitchen-sink-scrub/)and non-liquid products) [microfiber cloths](https://amzn.to/3Go38jr) You don't have to invest in everything all at once, simply purchase an item here and there as you need it to spread out the cost. I've found that even ingredients that seem pricy, like essential oils, tend to go a long way and have multiple uses, so they're a worthwhile investment.

You'll also receive my free Decluttering printables pack as well: 5 Simple Steps to Help You Switch to Natural Products Without the Overwhelm Whew, I know I've thrown a lot at you in this post. And it can be completely overwhelming to think about all the products in our home and how to switch them over to more natural alternatives. It's important to remember is that you don't have make the switch all at once. Unless you have a pressing health issue that needs to be addressed immediately, you can work gradually through your home to make the process easier. Choose one or two products at a time to swap out, research them thoroughly, and give them a try before moving on to the next product. Don't let the process become stressful. Instead, keep it simple. Try to enjoy the process, have fun with it, and feel good about the changes you're making! So let's move on to talking about a step-by-step process for switching over the products in your home. 1. Make a List of What You Use First, write down every product in your home \u2014 all of the products you use for cleaning, laundry, bathing, baby care, makeup, etc.... Cross off any that you already know are less-toxic. For example, maybe you're already using a natural diaper cream on your baby or you use coconut oil to moisturize your skin. You'll be left with a list of items that need to be upgraded to safer options. 2. Choose a Product to Start With How can you decide which product on your list to start with? Here are some ideas to help you narrow down your list: - Start with an ingredient. Choose an ingredient from the worst offender list I mentioned earlier and identify any products you own that contain it. - Start with whatever you run out of next. Look for a product you're almost out of and start researching how you can replace it with a natural alternative. - Start with what you use most often. For a big impact, replace the products you use most first \u2014 maybe an all-purpose cleaner or lip balm you carry with you all day long. - Start with what's accessible and affordable. Even if they don't get a perfect EWG rating, choosing a product that fits your budget and is available at your local grocery store is a good way to get your feet wet with natural products. - Start with what you're least picky about. For example, it's a lot easier to choose a new hand soap than it is to find a mascara you're crazy about. And trying a natural toothpaste is less intimidating than making the switch to natural deodorant. Here are some of the changes I've found easiest in our home: - Trading out traditional fabric softener [for wool dryer balls](https://saraheverafter.com/how-to-use-wool-dryer-balls/) - Using this [DIY Granite Cleaner](https://saraheverafter.com/easy-homemade-granite-cleaner/). - Learning [how to make my own foaming hand soap](https://saraheverafter.com/foaming-hand-soap/)(spoiler alert: it's super easy!) - Using this [DIY Dry Shampoo](https://saraheverafter.com/diy-dry-shampoo/). (It can be tinted to match any hair color.) - Switching to [safer sunscreen](https://saraheverafter.com/best-safe-sunscreens/). - Using the methods [outlined in this post to clean our hardwood floors](https://saraheverafter.com/clean-hard-wood-floors-simply-naturally/). I hope that gives you some idea of where you could start switching over to natural products. The key is, not which specific item you choose, but simply that you get started! 3. Do Your Research Now that you've chosen a product to replace, it's time to do some research and find a suitable alternative. First, I recommend looking up the product you already use to see how safe it is and why. (You might even be surprised to find that it doesn't have such a bad rating after all \u2014 not every conventional product contains horrible ingredients or causes harm.) Then, once you have a this information as a starting point, you can continue to do your research for a safer alternative using the resources we discussed earlier. 4. Pick a Product to Try or DIY Once you know your options, go ahead and choose a product or recipe to try out. Do your shopping (or use what you already have on hand if you're going the homemade route) and then have fun trying your new product! 5. Review, Refine, and Repeat Not every natural product you try will be a hit. I tried making a DIY wood polish, for example, that's just been a total miss for me. But it's all part of the process! Learn from the products you love as well as the ones that don't work so well for you and use it to make choices in the future. Have fun trying new things and seeing what works best for you. Keep repeating this process as you switch more and more products over to natural alternatives. And enjoy all the benefits of living a less-toxic life! Where Will You Start Your Journey to a Natural Home? Whichever product you start with, I'd be willing to bet you'll quickly find yourself hooked on using natural products. They're just as effective as their conventional counterparts, but without all the harmful side effects. I hope you're found this guide helpful and you have an idea how to start your own journey to a natural home. Which product do you plan to start with? Are there any natural products you already "}
