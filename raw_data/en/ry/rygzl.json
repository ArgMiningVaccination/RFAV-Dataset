Highlights from this plan, courtesy of [Thorn Run Partners](http://thornrun.com/partners) include: - Delivery System and Payment Reforms (-$60B/10): Among other recommendations, includes the cost of replacing the SGR with a payment freeze coupled with a short-term \"modest\" reduction below the freeze and medium-term development of a formula that promotes participation in new care models. Also expands penalties for avoidable complications and readmissions, as well as: o Broadens competitive bidding to medical devices, laboratory tests, radiologic diagnostic services and other commodities; o Fosters \"alternative benefit packages\" (e.g., that combine Parts A, B and D and offer care coordination); and - Ensures IPAB is not restricted by \"special interest carve-outs.\" The report also recommends considering giving IPAB the prerogative to recommend benefit design and cost-sharing changes. - Reform Medicare Cost-Sharing Rules (-$90B/10): Proposes restricting Medigap first-dollar coverage and replacing current Medicare cost-sharing rules with a unified deductible, uniform co-insurance and out-of-pocket (OOP) maximum; the report also makes modifications to the original Fiscal Commission recommendation on cost-sharing changes, proposing varying the deductible and OOP limit with income. - Expand Income Relating of Medicare Premiums (-$65B/10) - Increase the Medicare Age with an Income-Related Buy-In (-$35B/10) - Reduce and Reform Post-Acute Care Payments (-$70B/10): Recommends adopting the President's policy of reducing annual growth in payments to SNFs, IRFs, LTCHs and home health facilities. - Reduce Various Payments to Hospitals (-$65B/10): Recommends a phase-out of all reimbursement for bad debts, reduced subsidies for graduate medical payments to \"better align with patient care costs\" and reduced enhanced payments to rural hospitals. - Reduce the Costs of Prescription Drugs in Medicare (-$90B/10): Recommends mandated rebates for dual eligibles covered under Part D but notes that \"unlike other proposals, this recommendation would not extend rebates to new classes of beneficiaries who were not subject to rebates prior to implementation of Part D.\" Bars pay-for-delay arrangements. - Reduce Fraud, Abuse and Excessive Payments Within Medicare (-$25B/10): Among other policies, recommends giving HHS authority to align clinical lab payments with private-sector payments and reclassify certain payments for hospital outpatient evaluation/management (E/M) visits \"so they are treated the same as similar visits to a physician's office.\" - Additional Recommendations: Relate to malpractice reform, a new waiver program for state innovation and reforming Medicaid financing by reducing overpayments to States. In addition, the Bipartisan Policy Center's Health Care Cost Containment Initiative released a [report](http://bipartisanpolicy.org/sites/default/files/Cost%20Containment%20Report.pdf) (see [executive summary](http://bipartisanpolicy.org/sites/default/files/BPC%20Health%20Care%20Cost%20Containment%20Report%20Executive%20Summary.pdf)) by former Sen. Majority Leaders Tom Daschle and Bill Frist, former Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, and former Congressional Budget Office Director Alice Rivlin presenting 50 health-specific recommendations estimated to reduce the federal deficit by $560B over 10 years. Highlights from this report, courtesy of [Thorn Run Partners](http://thornrun.com/partners) include: Medicare Networks: Creates a third option within FFS Medicare that beneficiaries could elect - or choose Traditional Medicare or a Medicare Advantage Plan - that would involve an ACO-like network. Beneficiaries electing these new Medicare Networks would receive incentives to enroll via discounted standard premiums, an opportunity to share in savings and differential cost-sharing for in-network and out-of-network providers. The SGR would be fixed, with the highest updates during a transition period going to physicians participating in Medicare Networks accepting 2-sided risk. Employer-Sponsored Health Insurance (ESI) Tax Exclusion: Replaces the ACA's \"Cadillac tax\" on high-cost plans with a limit on the income tax exclusion for employer-sponsored health benefits at the dollar amount equal to the 80th percentile of single and family (age and gender adjusted) ESI premiums in 2015 ($262B revenue increase/10). Medicare Advantage (MA): Establishes a standardized minimum benefit for MA Plans that would include all services covered by traditional Medicare, a cost-sharing limit to protect against catastrophic expenses and slightly lower cost-sharing. Plans would be paid using a \"competitive pricing system,\" although this only would take effect in certain regions where it saves costs to the federal government versus the old benchmark (this proposal is detailed on p. 43 of the full [report](http://bipartisanpolicy.org/sites/default/files/Cost%20Containment%20Report.pdf)). Separately, the report recommends ending the MA Star Demonstration and \"revert[ing] to the smaller bonus payments under current law.\" Modernized Benefit Design: Includes a single, combined A+B deductible and generally replaces co-insurance with co-payments on most covered services, similar to MedPAC recommendations, among several other provisions. - DME: Recommends continued implementation of competitive bidding but lower benchmarks for certain equipment types because \"over the long term, we believe the median-bid level is unnecessarily generous to DME suppliers.\" - Site of Care Differentials: Suggests equalizing the payment rates for E/M services to the rate of the lowest-cost setting, including facility payments (estimated to save $8.7B/10), and equalizing payments at the level of the lowest-cost site for procedures that are performed both in outpatient departments and physician offices in certain circumstances, such as when the procedure is conducted in physician offices more than half of the time (savings not estimated). - High-Quality, Low-Cost Drug Utilization: Makes various recommendations including: Adjusting the Part D LIS cost-sharing to encourage the use of high-value drugs (-$44.3B/10); Changing Part B reimbursement for provider-administered drugs (specifically, changing the reimbursement to equal the average sales price of the medication plus a flat payment, with the flat payment being set separately - and being payment neutral, before any behavioral change - for each therapeutic class, as designated by HHS) (Savings not estimated); Convert from Average Wholesale Price to Average Sales Price for remaining Part B drug and vaccine reimbursements (Savings not estimated); Address anti-competitive settlements between brand and generic drug manufacturers (-$4B/10); and Close the REMS loophole that \"inhibits development of generic drugs\" (-$753M/10). - Graduate Medical Education: Makes several recommendations including reducing IME percentage add-on to inpatient hospital admissions from 5.5 percent to 3.5 percent and repurposing savings for performance-based incentive payments and additional residency slots.
