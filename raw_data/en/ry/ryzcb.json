The aim of this Guidance on Good Cell CulturePractice (GCCP) is to promote the maintenance ofthese standards and to reduce uncertainty in thedevelopment and application of animal and humancell and tissue culture procedures and products, byencouraging greater international harmonisation,rationalisation and standardisation of laboratorypractices, quality control systems, safety procedures,recording and reporting, and compliance with laws,regulations and ethical principles. The scope of the document has deliberately been broadly defined, to include systems based on cells andtissues obtained from humans and animals, andissues related to the characterisation and mainte-nance of essential characteristics, as well as qualityassurance, recording and reporting, safety, educationand training, and ethics. Background The first ECVAM Task Force on GCCP was estab-lished in the autumn of 1999, in response to proposalsmade at a workshop on the standardisation of cell cul-ture procedures (1), held during the 3rd WorldCongress on Alternatives and Animal Use in the LifeSciences, Bologna, Italy, in 1999 (2). The proposal that guidelines should be developed to define minimumstandards in cell and tissue culture, to be called GoodCell Culture Practice (GCCP), led to the publication ofoutline guidance on GCCP in 2002 (3). The principlesof GCCP are analogous to the OECD Principles ofGood Laboratory Practice (GLP), which cannot nor-mally be fully implemented in basic research, includ-ing in vitro studies (4). In October 2003, a new task force was convened in Ispra, Italy, with a broader range of expertise in celland tissue culture, in order to produce a more-detailedGCCP guidance document which could be of practicaluse in the laboratory. This Guidance is required to serve the rapidly expanding use of in vitro systems: in basic research, to meet regulatory requirements for chemicals and prod-ucts of various kinds; in the manufacture of variousproducts; in medical diagnostics; and in therapeuticapplications such as tissue engineering, and cell andgene therapy. Further significant developments are certain to result from, inter alia : the use of in vitro systems for high throughput screening in pharmacology and toxi-cology; the human of biomarkers of disease, susceptibility, expo-sure and effect. This Guidance is intended to support best practice in all aspects of the use of cells and tissues in vitro , and to complement, but not to replace, any existingguidance, guidelines or regulations.

This GCCP Guidance is based upon the following six operational principles. 1. Establishment and maintenance of a sufficient understanding of the in vitro system and of the relevant factors which could affect it. 2. Assurance of the quality of all materials and meth- ods, and of their use and application, in order tomaintain the integrity, validity, and reproducibil-ity of any work conducted. 3. Documentation of the information necessary to track the materials and methods used, to permitthe repetition of the work, and to enable the targetaudience to understand and evaluate the work. 4. Establishment and maintenance of adequate measures to protect individuals and the environ-ment from any potential hazards. 5. Compliance with relevant laws and regulations, and with ethical principles. 6. Provision of relevant and adequate education and training for all personnel, to promote high qualitywork and safety. The Application of GCCP GCCP sets the minimum standards for any workinvolving cell and tissue cultures. However, itsdetailed implementation depends on the nature of thework involved. Whilst this guidance is considered aminimum standard for the preparation and mainte-nance of cell cultures, deviations from its specific ele-ments may be necessary under certain conditions, inwhich case they should be justified. Research and development This guidance is important for research work, to avoid poor reproducibility of data and the invalida-tion of results from cell culture processes. Researchinvolving the derivation of new cell lines should always include detailed records of the derivationprocess and of the reagents and materials used, asthe cells may go on to be used for purposes notanticipated at the time, and in some cases, this mayinclude clinical use. Particular care should be takenwhere cells and tissues are to be used as a referencepoint or reference material, especially for datainterpretation related to the equivalent cells andtissues in vivo . Critical testing procedures In diagnostics, toxicology and pharmacology, specific regulations are in place in order to protect humanhealth and the environment, such as EuropeanPharmacopoeial requirements and EU and OECDtest guidelines. This Guidance has been written toensure that the appropriate standards can be main-tained when cells or tissues are used in meeting theseregulations and requirements. Manufacture of products and therapeutic preparations of cells and tissues A number of specific regulations and requirements relate to the nature and quality of cells and tissuesused in the manufacture of products, including vac-cines, monoclonal antibodies, hormones, and cellsand tissues for therapeutic use, as well as to thepreparation of the final products. The application ofGCCP must be consistent with these regulations andrequirements, and provides guidance generally notcovered in requirements for specific applications. Principle 1: Establishment and maintenance of a sufficientunderstanding of the in vitro system and of the relevant factors whichcould affect it The essential elements for assuring reliable and accu- rate work when using cell and tissue-based systems,are: \u2014 authenticity, including identity of the system, for example, provenance and confirmation of geno-typic and/or phenotypic characteristics; \u2014 purity, for example, freedom from biological con- tamination; and \u2014 stability and functional integrity of the system in relation to its intended use. The standardisation of in vitro systems begins with the original animal or human donor and the cells ortissues derived, and also embraces their subsequentmanipulation, maintenance and preservation.262 S. Coecke et al.Standardisation is a difficult task, since cells and tissues are prone to change in culture, andinevitably are subjected to physical and/or chemicalinsults during their isolation, culture, use and stor-age. However, by establishing a framework of pro-cedures for factors that can be controlled, variationand other adverse effects on reproducibility andreliability can be minimised. The availability ofwell-characterised and quality-controlled stocks ofcells and tissues, and of media and other criticalreagents, further reduces variability. Various classifications have been published, which define different types of in vitro cell and tis- sue systems (see Figure 1 and, for example, refer-ence 5). Three broad categories will be consideredin this Guidance: \u2014 isolated organs or tissues; \u2014 primary and early passage cultures; and\u2014 cell lines (including finite, continuous and stem cell lines). 1.1 Cells and TissuesIsolated organs or tissues Isolated organs and tissues, taken for direct use from animal or human donors, are used for a widevariety of in vitro applications. These systems are difficult to standardise, because they often havecomplex environmental and nutritional needs, andbecause of variation between donors. Tissues or organ fragments can be used, often perfused with physiological buffers, in a variety ofdevices. Such in vitro systems, including isolated skin and eye models, are very popular for toxico-logical applications, due to their similarity withthe in vivo situation. It is important to be able to study an adequate number of replicates in suchexperiments, and one approach is to use slice tech-nology. Ultra-thin slices of tissues such as liver,lung, kidney or brain, can be used to provide apreparation retaining some of the structural andfunctional features of the original organ.Inevitably, however, such features tend to be rap-idly lost. Methods involving the isolation and reaggrega- tion of cells from organs such as the skin, brain andliver, can lead to the reconstruction of three-dimen-sional structures, again with some of the structuraland functional properties of the original organ ortissue. Cells from blood and other body fluids are readily prepared as homogeneous preparations, which arevery useful for in vitro studies. Preparations such as umbilical cord blood and bone-marrow offer richsources of stem cells, and could become the basis ofan expanding range of other systems. Primary cultures and early passage cultures The initial in vitro culture of harvested cells and tissues taken directly from animals and humans iscalled primary culture . In many cases, such cul- tures also exhibit key characteristics similar tothose seen in vivo, so they are widely used for basic research and for a number of in vitro appli- cations. Although cells in some primary cultures can pro- liferate and can be subcultured (as early passage cultures ), they generally have a limited life-span and are known to change their differentiated char-acteristics with time in culture. They commonlyrequire complex nutrient media, supplementedwith animal serum and other non-defined ill-defined components, although serum-free mediumformulations are becoming increasingly available.Primary cultures often represent heterogeneouscell populations, and are difficult to standardise andto reproduce, because of uncontrollable variationsbetween preparations. Primary cultures have traditionally been main- tained either in suspension or, more commonly, as Second ECVAM Task Force on good cell culture practice 2 6 3 Organ explants (cell outgrowth)Figure 1: Relationships between the main types of in vitro systems Tissue or organ fragment Transfer to culture Primary culture Subculture (passage) Cell line ContinuousDissociated cells (attachment and proliferation) Stem cell Finitemonolayers on glass or plastic surfaces. However, methods employing extracellular matrix compo-nents, and innovative techniques such as the co-cul-ture of different cell types and three-dimensionalculture, now offer much greater potential for main-taining differentiated structure and function. Cell lines Cell lines comprise cells that are able to multiply for extended periods in vitro and can therefore be maintained by serial subculture. They can be subdi-vided into finite cell lines, continuous cell lines andstem cell lines. Finite cell lines Finite cell lines are cultures of cells that possess theability to be subcultured numerous times, butwhich eventually cease replication and enter a stateof senescence, in which cell division has stopped,but the cells remain viable and may also retainsome functional activity. Finite cell lines have a useful life-span in vitro , and can be maintained as well-characterised andquality-controlled cell banks. However, changesoccur as they approach senescence, so they shouldnot be used above defined population doubling lim-its, which can be established by experimental inves-tigation. Numerous finite cell lines have been established. Many of them are human diploid fibroblast celllines, which are genetically stable and remaindiploid for many passages, but which generallyreach senescence after 60-70 population doublings. Continuous cell lines Certain cell lines show an apparent ability to besubcultured indefinitely, and are known as continu-ous cell lines. They do not show the senescenceexperienced with finite cell lines. Continuous celllines are typically derived from tumours or normalembryonic tissues. While many continuous cell lines have proved to be stable over long-term passage in vitro , they may undergo substantial and irreversible changes. It istherefore important to avoid subjecting cell lines tovariable culture and passage conditions, and toestablish cryopreserved stocks of early passagecells. Some continuous cell lines can be a heteroge- neous mixture of phenotypes (for example, humanpromyelocytic HL-60 leukaemia cells, RD, SH5Y-SY). Other cell lines may undergo changes to thedifferentiation state due to certain medium addi-tives (for example, retinoic acid, dimethylsulphox-ide) or culture conditions (for example, whenadherent cultures, such as Caco-2 or MDCK, areallowed to reach confluency). In such cases, thepotential for the selection of certain cell types as aresult of sub-optimal in vitro maintenance, han- dling and preservation, is a significant risk for in vitro cell-based methods. Continuous cell lines may arise spontaneously, or can be produced by using a variety of other method-ologies, such as: \u2014 exposure of normal cells and tissues to irradia- tion and/or treatment with chemical mutagensor carcinogens; \u2014 isolation from cultures infected with viruses (for example, Epstein-Barr virus); \u2014 genetic modification of cells by transfection with cloned genes (for example, SV40 large T-antigen,adenovirus E1, telomerase); and \u2014 isolation from transgenic animals. Stem cell lines Stem cell lines, such as embryonic and germ celllines, are types of continuous cell lines that retainthe characteristics of stem cells and can producediverse differentiated cell types. They require greatcare in their maintenance, handling and preserva-tion, in order to ensure that their stem cell charac-teristics and capacity for differentiation are retained. Embryonic stem cell lines are usually established and maintained on embryonic mouse fibroblasts orother feeder cell layers, which are critical to theirsuccessful culture. Although serum-free and feeder-free culture methods are currently being developed,the effects of these new developments on the stabil-ity and quality of the cultures have yet to be ascer-tained. Some continuous cell lines, notably cancer cell lines, are known to contain stem cell or precursorcell populations. For the purposes of thisGuidance, these are not included as stem cell lines.The exact nature and significance of the apparentstem cell component in such lines remains to bedetermined. Standardisation for specific uses Standardisation of cell lines used for specialised stud-ies and for production purposes will require attentionto specific characteristics, as well as to the funda-mental issues which apply to all cell cultures (seeGCCP Principle 2). They should be checked, andrechecked at appropriate times, for the expression ofcritical functions and markers (for example the path-ways for biotransformation of xenobiotics, specificcytoskeletal markers, and characteristic morphologyand ultrastructure). The number of passages forwhich they remain usable should be established. 1.2In Vitro Culture Conditions Cell and tissue culture environments differ in many respects from those found in vivo . Key elements of in vitro culture conditions include culture media,264 S. Coecke et al.supplements and other additives, culture-ware, and incubation conditions. Basal medium In vitro work is generally performed in complex nutri- tive media. Depending on the circumstances, the basalculture medium can be serum-supplemented (as intraditional cell culture methods) or serum-free, butsupplemented with additives necessary for obtainingsatisfactory cell proliferation and production, or formaintaining a desired differentiation status. Many slightly different formulations exist under the same general medium names, such as MinimumEssential Medium (MEM), and even subtle changes inthe medium formulation can substantially alter thecharacteristics of certain cells and tissues. In manycases, these variations are deliberate for specific appli-cations. Therefore, the medium to be used should beprecisely specified, and it is important to check thatnew supplies of medium meet the required specifica-tions. Serum Serum is essential for the maintenance and/or pro- liferation of many cell types. It is a complex mixtureof a large number of constituents, including low andhigh molecular weight biomolecules with a varietyof physiologically balanced growth promoting andgrowth inhibiting activities. However, due to itscomplexity and to batch-to-batch variation, serumintroduces unknown variables into a culture systemand can interfere with its performance. Animal serum can be derived from adult, new- born or fetal sources. Bovine sera are most com-monly used, and during the last few decades, fetalbovine serum (FBS) has become the standard sup-plement for cell culture media. It is a cocktail ofmost of the factors required for cell proliferationand maintenance, and thus is an almost universalgrowth supplement. As the composition of serum is highly variable, it is important that, when an existing batch of serumis substantially depleted, a new set of serumbatches should be evaluated in parallel with thecurrent in-use batch. A range of growth promotiontests can be used for this purpose, one of the mostconvenient and most widely used of which is theplating efficiency test (see reference 6). It may also be useful for individual users to define serum specifications that meet their particularneeds, including the maximum acceptable levels ofserum components, such as immunoglobulins(which may have inhibitory effects), endotoxins(indicative of bacterial contamination, but whichare also powerful cell mitogens), and haemoglobin(indicative of haemolysis during clotting).Animal sera are a potential source of microbio- logical contaminants, notably mycoplasma, bovineviruses, and possibly the agent which causes BovineSpongiform Encephalopathy (BSE). Suppliers use avariety of including filtration, irradia-tion and heat-inactivation, to reduce microbial con-tamination. Nevertheless, it is wise, and for someapplications, obligatory, to specify sourcing ofserum from countries where there is a low risk ofinfection, and, in the case of bovine sera, from ani-mals of less than 30 months old. The use of human serum is restricted to spe- cialised applications, as it carries additional risks,such as the potential presence of human pathogenicviruses. Its use must be subject to the strictest qual-ity controls, including documentation to demon-strate origin and viral safety. Because of the disadvantages inherent in the use of animal and human sera, there have been manyattempts to find alternatives. These have includedthe use of poorly defined supplements (for example,pituitary extracts, chick embryo extracts, bovinemilk fractions, bovine colostrums), and various plantextracts (for example, vegetal serum). In some cases,it is possible to use fully chemically defined mediawith appropriate hormones and growth factors. Acompilation of commercially available serum-freemedia was published recently, and can be found athttp://www.focusonalternatives.org.uk. Nutritional status The exhaustion or inactivation of essential nutri- ents in cell culture media, and rising levels ofmetabolites, will inhibit cell growth and cell func-tion, and will ultimately cause cell death. Planningan appropriate procedure for medium replenish-ment (i.e. frequency and volume of medium) andpassaging (for example, split ratio) is thereforeessential. This should also be considered whenusing conditioned medium from one culture in anattempt to promote the growth of another. Antibiotics It is important to remember that antibiotics are agents that arrest or disrupt fundamental aspectsof cell biology, and, while they are effective againstprokaryotic cells (i.e. bacteria), they are also capa-ble of causing toxic effects in animal cells. Not sur-prisingly, antifungal agents, being directed athigher order, eukaryotic micro-organisms, arelikely to be more toxic to animal cell cultures. Giventhese obvious contra-indications, the use of antibi-otics in cell and tissue culture should be focused intwo areas: a) protection of tissues, organs, primarycultures and cell lines from contamination; and b)the positive selection of recombinant cell clones Second ECVAM Task Force on good cell culture practice 2 6 5based on the expression of antibiotic resistance genes. In addition, it is important to obtain antibi-otics from companies that are willing to provide cer-tification for the concentration and purity of theantibiotics they supply. Where possible, the use of antibiotics should be avoided. It should not become routine in the cell andtissue culture laboratory, and can never be relied onas a substitute for effective aseptic techniques. Cell culture surface/matrix The surfaces to be used for cell cultures may need to be pre-washed or pre-treated, for example, to achievethe comprehensive wetting of a complex matrix.Where coating materials are used, the preparationmethod may lead to toxic conditions (for example, lowpH), and washing before cell seeding may be neces-sary. There may be batch-to-batch variation in coat-ings of biological origin, so pre-use testing is essential. 1.3 Handling and Maintenance Care should be taken not to expose the cells or tissues to inappropriate conditions (for example extendedperiods out of the incubator). Key items of equipment,including incubators, laminar air flow and microbio-logical safety cabinets, and cryostorage systems, mustbe set up and used appropriately (see Appendix 1 andAppendix 2). Aseptic techniques, where appropriate, should be rigorously applied. The routine isolation, handling andmaintenance protocols for cells and tissues should beestablished as Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Temperature The optimal culture temperature depends on the type of cells involved. Insect cells have a relativelylow optimal growth temperature compared to mam-malian cells, and their growth characteristics maybe altered at higher temperatures, for example,above 28\u00b0C. The exposure of mammalian cells totemperatures above 39\u00b0C may induce apoptosis,whilst growth below 35\u00b0C may slow replication butmay also enhance the expression of certain cell pro-teins. Recombinant cell lines expressing the tem-perature-sensitive form of SV40 large T-antigen,will replicate at around 33\u00b0C, but not at 37\u00b0C. Atmosphere Oxygen and carbon dioxide are known to be vital for cell growth, and variations in the levels of these gasescan have significant effects on cell cultures. High levelsof both gases will be toxic, and very low levels willinhibit cell growth and may result in cell death. Oxygen levels may need to be optimised for particular purposes,for example, to promote growth in large-scale culturesin bioreactors. For many cell cultures, the appropriateatmosphere would be 5% v/v carbon dioxide in air, butthe optimum carbon dioxide concentration will dependon the medium in use, the cells being cultured, and pos-sibly on other specific considerations. pH The optimal physiological pH for mammalian cell cul- tures is usually considered to be pH 7.2-7.4, and pH6.0 for insect cells. Variation outside a relatively nar-row pH range may have significant effects on cell phe-notype, growth and viability. Cell detachment and subculture Detachment solutions, such as trypsin/EDTA, can have significant effects on cells, if their use in specificcircumstances is not appropriate. Residual detach-ment solutions can lead to adverse effects, and there-fore should be removed after cell dissociation. Most cell lines are subcultured before they reach confluency. This may be particularly important insome cases, such as where cell differentiationoccurs progressively after confluency is reached (forexample, Caco-2 cells). The repeated passage ofsome cell lines after they have reached full conflu-ency, may result in the loss of desired characteris-tics. For example, the subculture regime can affectthe apparent productivity of recombinant cell lines,and the differentiation capacity of Caco-2 cells. 1.4. Cryopreservation Cells and tissues can be cryopreserved in a stable state for limited or prolonged periods. The cryo-preservation process includes freezing, storage andrecovery. In the development of a preservation pro-cedure for a new cell culture, the following pointsrelating to the biochemical and morphologicalnature of the culture system, must be considered: \u2014 original cell or tissue type (i.e. gross morphology or complexity of culture system); \u2014 growth phase (usually, cells should be harvested during exponential growth to increase the propor-tion of cells with a high nucleus:cytoplasm ratio);and \u2014 status of cells (other biochemical or morphological features, affected by differentiation, adherence,etc., will influence the success of cryopreservation). There are also a number of key technical elements in the process of cryopreservation that should beconsidered, including:266 S. Coecke et al.\u2014 cryoprotectant (select type and concentration to balance the degree of cryoprotection against anytoxic effects, for example, 10% v/v DMSO); \u2014 additives to improve cell survival (for example, serum); \u2014 cooling rate (for example, freezing at controlled rate in the presence of the selected cryoprotec-tant: typically 1\u00b0C/minute with 10% v/v DMSO); \u2014 storage conditions (sufficiently low temperature to eliminate biological changes, for example, liq-uid nitrogen vapour or liquid phase); and \u2014 recovery method (for example, rate of thawing, gradual dilution to minimise osmotic shock,removal of cryoprotectant to avoid any toxiceffects). Storage in the liquid phase of nitrogen provides the lowest, most stable and most convenient storage tem-perature, but vapour phase storage is generally con-sidered to be safer (see Appendix 1). Electricalstorage systems provide a very practical and mainte-nance-free, low temperature storage solution.However, in a multi-user environment, such systemsare prone to the effects of temperature cycling instored material, and in the absence of liquid nitrogenor carbon dioxide back-up systems, they are at highrisk in the event of loss of power supply. The failure of liquid nitrogen refilling procedures can result in the loss of valuable cells and tissues, soit is vital that there are effective training and mon-itoring procedures for the filling and maintenanceof liquid nitrogen containers. In addition, it is advis-able to store aliquots of important stocks at morethan one storage site. 1.5 Microbial, Viral and Cellular Cross- contamination Contamination with bacteria, yeast and other fungi can result in the complete loss of cultures. Undetectedcontamination with slow growing micro-organisms, orwith micro-organisms resistant to antibiotics, canhave a significant impact on the quality and/or valid-ity of data obtained from in vitro systems. The most common example of such an infection is mycoplasma. There are various potential sources of viral contam- ination, including the operator, cell culture reagents ofanimal origin, and cells or tissues of animal origin. Allcell and tissue culture facilities should therefore haveappropriate measures for minimising the risk of micro-bial and viral infections and for their detection. Viruses can cause lytic infections, thus destroying the host cells, but may also become established as per-sistent, sub-lethal infections, which are maintainedwith passage of the host cell line. Many cell lines bothcarry and express virus sequences without producinginfectious virus particles. In a small number of cases,infectious human pathogens are released into the cul-ture medium from lymphoblastoid cell lines (for exam-ple, Epstein-Barr virus from the B95-8 cell line, and human T-lymphotrophic virus II from MT4 cells).Animal viruses are expressed by some cell lines (forexample, bovine viral diarrhoea virus in certain bovinecell lines). Mammalian genomes contain many retro-virus-like sequences, which, whilst not overtly infec-tious, may be released in large quantities asretrovirus-like particles in murine myeloma cells,hybridomas and other cell lines (for example, CHOcells and BHK cells). The expression of such virus-likesequences is also observed at the RNA level in manyhuman cancer cell lines and also in primate cell lines. Cross-contamination of cell lines with other cell lines is a real, but often neglected, problem.Whenever possible, cells should be obtained fromcertified sources, and appropriate proceduresshould be applied to minimise the risk of cross-con-tamination during their storage and use in the lab-oratory (see Principle 2). Principle 2: Assurance of the quality of all materials and methods, andof their use and application, inorder to maintain the integrity,validity, and reproducibility of anywork conducted The aim of quality assurance is to confirm the consis- tency, traceability and reproducibility of in vitro cell and tissue work. Each laboratory should have desig-nated persons to oversee the quality assurance of: \u2014 the cells and tissues; \u2014 growth media and all other materials;\u2014 the methods, protocols, and SOPs;\u2014 the equipment and its maintenance;\u2014 the recording procedures; and\u2014 the expression of results. 2.1 Cells and Tissues A laboratory should have specific protocols or SOPs for the receipt of new or incoming cells and tissues,and for the handling, maintenance and storage ofall cells and tissues, with regular monitoring forcompliance. The following are among the factors tobe considered: \u2014 doublings;\u2014 differentiation state; \u2014 performance controls specific to the application; and \u2014 contamination and cross-contamination.Second ECVAM Task Force on good cell culture practice 2 6 72.2 Other Materials and In Vitro Culture Conditions The quality control of media, supplements and additives is both time-consuming and expensive.Since most of these materials are obtained commer-cially, the supplier should be expected to operateaccording to standards appropriate to their supplyand use, and to provide the relevant quality controldocumentation (Table 1). The user laboratory has the responsibility: \u2014 to confirm that all the materials to be used are suitable for their intended purposes; \u2014 to ensure that all materials are appropriately handled, stored and used; and \u2014 to monitor batches of materials with regard to changes or variations which may affect their use(for certain critical reagents, for example,serum, pre-use testing may be necessary). In the case of critical reagents, the manufacturer cannot be expected to know the user's specificrequirements. The user should therefore define aspecification to include general details of thereagent, such as quality controls for identity (com-position), purity and activity and stability. Whererelevant, the specification should include compli-ance with international standards (such as ISOstandards or pharmacopoeial protocols). All other working materials which come into direct contact with cell and tissue cultures shouldbe regularly monitored, and appropriate proceduresshould be in place for ensuring; the quality of cul-ture vessels and surface coatings; the cleanlinessand sterility of any re-used equipment (for example,glassware); and lack of toxicity (for example, plas- tic, absence of detergents, and rubber components). Appropriate procedures are necessary for the purchase, installation, commissioning, correct use,performance monitoring (for example, calibration)and maintenance of the following: \u2014 low temperature storage refrigerators; \u2014 incubators;\u2014 laminar air flow and safety cabinets (see Appendix 2), and other sterile work areas; \u2014 automatic pipettes and pipettors; \u2014 sterilisation ovens and autoclaves; and\u2014 analytical and production equipment. European Norms and ISO standards can be adopted for these areas, and in some cases, compliance maybe a legal requirement (for example, for pressurisedgases, such as carbon dioxide/air for cell cultures,where there will be ISO standards for the gases, andsafety standards for the cylinders and pressure reg-ulators). Principle 3: Documentation of the information necessary to track thematerials and methods used, topermit the repetition of the work,and to enable the target audience tounderstand and evaluate the work In cell and tissue culture, as in any practical sci- ence, clear documentation of the systems used andprocedures followed is mandatory, in order to per-mit the traceability, interpretation and repetition ofthe work. Therefore, accurate records of cell type, Table 1: Assessment of the quality of reagents used in cell and tissue culture Quality assessor Reagent Parameter Supplier End user Serum Sterility and endotoxin testing + Physical and biochemical analysis + Functional testing +(general) +(specific) Basal medium, complete medium Sterility testing + (e.g. serum-free medium), additives Physical and biochemical analysis + (e.g. non-essential amino acids) Functional testing +(general) +(specific) Detachment solution (e.g. trypsin/EDTA) Sterility testing + Physical and biochemical analysis + Functional testing ++ Surface coating for cell attachment Sterility + Physical and biochemical analysis + Functional test ++268 S. Coecke et al.origin, authentication and characterisation, and of the materials used and the culture techniques per-formed, are essential. The documentation should be retrievable, and should include: \u2014 the objective of the work; \u2014 the rationale for the choice of procedures and materials used; \u2014 the materials and equipment used;\u2014 the origin and characterisation of the cells and/or tissues; \u2014 the laboratory records, including results, raw data and quality control records; \u2014 cell and tissue preservation and storage proce- dures; and \u2014 the protocols and SOPs used, and any deviations from them. In some circumstances, for example, where compli- ance with GLP or Good Manufacturing Practice(GMP) is required, there should be formal proce-dures for the retrieval and review of documenta-tion, and for resolving any questions or disputesthat may arise. 3.1 Origins of Cells and Tissues A minimal set of information is essential when working with cells or tissues of animal or humanorigin (Table 2). 3.2 Handling, Maintenance and Storage It is essential that records should be kept on the fol- lowing: \u2014 culture media (including all supplements and additives) and other solutions and reagents(including details of supplier, batch, storagerequirements, expiry date), and methods ofpreparation (these may be generically specifiedin SOPs for research and development work, butfor specific standards, the traceability of eachprocedure to ensure the use of appropriatereagents may be required); \u2014 culture substrate (type and supplier of coating material, for example, collagen, fibronectin,laminin, poly-D-lysine, Matrigel \u00ae, coating procedures,where applicable; and \u2014 procedures for preparation or use of cells or tis- sues. The records on handling, maintenance and storage related to culture-ware and equipment shouldinclude:\u2014 type and origin of culture-ware (types and sup- pliers flasks, Petri dishes, T-flasks, roller bot-tles, etc.); laminar air and safety cabinet testing, cali- bration, maintenance and repair; \u2014 monitoring of humidity (if appropriate), temper- ature and CO 2levels in incubators; \u2014 monitoring of refrigerator and freezer tempera- tures; \u2014 monitoring of liquid nitrogen level and/or tem- perature in storage containers; \u2014 sterility controls (for example, autoclaving, sterility tests); and \u2014 regular maintenance and calibration of all other critical apparatus (according to manufacturers'manuals). The level of monitoring and testing may vary, from installation of alarms for research and developmentwork, to continuous monitoring of calibrated moni-toring systems for critical work. With regard to the in vitro system, critical infor- mation must be recorded, to permit tracing of thehistory of the biological material, its characteris-tics, and the treatments, manipulations, measure-ments and procedures applied to it, includingstatistical procedures used to analyse the resultsobtained. Cell and tissue preservation and storage details should include (but not be limited to) the following(Table 3): \u2014 type of cell or tissue, passage/identity number; \u2014 cryoprotectant used, and its concentration;\u2014 number of cells and volume per cryovial;\u2014 position in storage container;\u2014 viability and plating efficiency after thawing; and \u2014 date and operator. Any changes in storage location should be formally recorded and, when appropriate, relevant notifica-tion should be given (for example, to the owner,safety officer or quality control personnel). The disposal procedures for culture laboratory waste (used solutions, toxic treatments, biologicalmaterials, etc.) must be documented, and compli-ance with them should be ensured. 3.3 Reporting Effective communication is an essential part of cell and tissue culture work, so careful attention shouldbe given to the reporting procedures used. The format of a report will depend on the target audience, for example, in-house personnel, a clientor sponsor, a regulatory body, the scientific com-munity, or the general public. The person(s)responsible for the report should be identified.Second ECVAM Task Force on good cell culture practice 2 6 9Where appropriate, the report should be formally authorised for its intended purpose. A high-quality scientific report should cover the objective of the work, the protocols and SOPsused, planning and experimental design, the exe-cution of the study, data collection and analysisand a discussion of the outcome. It should also be made clear that the whole study was establishedand performed in accordance with any relevantstandards, regulations, statutes, guidelines orguidance documents, and safety and qualityassurance procedures.Table 2: Examples of requirements for documentation concerning the origins of cells and tissues Isolated organs and Primary cultures tissues of animal of animal All materials of origin (e.g. rat origin (e.g. rat human origin Cell linesbrain tissue) hepatocytes) (e.g. cord blood) (e.g. Balb/c, 3T3) Ethical and safety ++ + Applicable, if human or issues involving recombinant DNA or pathogens Species/strain ++ + + Source ++ + + Sex ++ + + Age ++ + + Number of donors ++ If applicable na Health status ++ + + Any special ++ + + pre-treatment Organ/tissue of origin ++ + + Cell type(s) isolated ++ + + Isolation technique ++ + + Date of isolation ++ + + Operator ++ + + Supplier ++ + + Informed consent na na + If human, may be applicable Material transfer na na ++ agreement Medical history na na + (if available) If human, may be of donor applicable (if available) Pathogen testing If applicablea If applicablea +a +a Shipping conditions ++ + + State of material ++ + + on arrival Cell line identification na na na + and authentication Mycoplasma testing na nab nab + aScreening tests for animal colonies or donors of cells and tissue may be appropriate. bMay be important if material is preserved for longer term use (e.g. as feeder layers for other cultures). na = not applicable.270 S.

Many countries also issue guidelines on occupational health and laboratory safety, and indi-vidual laboratories may also have rules which reflectlocal circumstances. Thus, the guidance on safety inthe cell culture laboratory given here in no respectreplaces these laws and regulations, but rather drawsattention to certain aspects of them and highlightsissues specific to the in vitro culture of animal and human cells and tissues. In many countries, each lab-oratory is required to appoint a biological safety offi-cer, and this individual should be involved in thesafety evaluation of any cell culture procedures.4.1 Risk Assessment Identifying and evaluating risks, and taking appro- priate action to avoid or minimise them, are thefoundations on which safety is built. In the workenvironment, and particularly in the laboratory,where hazards may be complex and their evaluationrequires specialist knowledge, risk assessmentshould be performed in a structured way.Furthermore, the results of such risk assessmentsshould be recorded, not only to confirm that theyhave been carried out and appropriate action taken,Table 4: Details to be included in papers for publication in journals, using the example of mouse 3T3 cells Details Supplier details Type of culture Continuous cell line na Cell/tissue type Fibroblast-like 4mM Irvine, UK Complete medium No further comment naFrequency of medium change At subculture, when used naCulture flasks stock closed flasks (167008) or Scientific Laboratory Supplies, Nottingham, UK Culture plates for test 96-well tissue culture plates (167008) NunclonCulture well inserts Not used na Surface coating Not used naSubculture frequency At confluency naSubculture split Usable passage 25-45 na Passage number at receipt 30 naPassage 35-40 naMaintenance conditions 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2in air na Storage conditions Stock cells in liquid nitrogen in 40% NBCS/ na 20% DMSO Use 3T3-NRU phototoxicity test Standard Operating OECD TG 427, EU B.29 naProcedures/guidelinesReferences 12, 13 naFurther comments None na na = not applicable.272 S. Coecke et al.but also to act as a reference document for individ- uals performing the tasks assessed. These assess-ments should be reviewed at regular intervals, totake into account any changes in local practice,national or international regulations, or increasesin scientific knowledge. It is important to pay particular attention to risks which may be specific to, or more significant in, cer-tain groups of workers. For example, where womenof reproductive age may carry a (possibly undiag-nosed) pregnancy and would be at greater risk fromthe effects of certain chemicals, such as teratogensor biological agents. Similarly, persons with adiminished immune response (for example, due tomedication or to a medical condition) should seek expert medical advice before they are allowed towork in a laboratory where cell and tissue culture isperformed. The safety conditions highlighted below relate not only to the safety of individual cell and tissueculture workers, but also to that of their colleagues,the general public and the environment. Some of the areas of concern with regard to gen- eral laboratory safety, and to which it might beappropriate to apply risk assessment, are shown inTable 6. Hazards of particular concern in the cell ortissue culture laboratory are further discussed inSections 4.2 and 4.3, below.

A risk assessment plan should consider allthese hazards in relation to the proposed work. Asalready mentioned, this assessment should not belimited only to the laboratory and laboratory per-sonnel, but should also cover risks to people in theentire facility, people in the external environment,and to the environment itself. This is not only avital aspect of basic research and testing, but is par-ticularly important when cultured cells and tissuesare used for diagnostic purposes or for producingtherapeutic products, or when the cells and tissuesthemselves are used for therapeutic purposes. Physical hazards The cell and tissue culture laboratory does not pose any specific physical hazards. However, laborato-ries and workspaces should always be kept cleanand tidy, and free of material stored on the floor oranywhere where it can cause risk to other people.Any equipment or apparatus used should meetnational safety guidelines. Equipment such as auto-claves and laminar flow or microbiological safetycabinets should have a programme of maintenancefor safe use, usually carried out at a minimum fre-quency of once a year. The correct operation ofequipment should also be regularly checked.Procedures should be in place for ensuring thesafest possible use of equipment connected withultra-violet light, lasers, radioisotopes, liquid nitro-gen (see Appendix 1) and pressurised gases. Chemical hazards The cell and tissue culture laboratory is not a par- ticularly dangerous place to work with regard tochemical hazards. However, some chemicals haveill-defined or unknown biological effects, so generalsafety standards should always be maintained toprotect workers against these uncertain hazards.Material Safety Data Sheets for all chemicals usedin the laboratory should be requested from the sup-pliers. For any substances which are potentially hazardous to health (for example, mutagens, cry-oprotectants, labelling dyes), these data shouldform the basis of a risk assessment for the use ofthis chemical, as the level of risk will vary, depend-ing on, for example, the quantities being used andthe techniques being employed. This is covered bynational legislation in some countries. Approvedwaste disposal procedures should always be fol-lowed. Materials being tested in in vitro toxicity tests represent a particular problem, particularly if thestudy requires that they be anonymously coded andsupplied via an independent, external source.Although the concentrations used in the final testsolutions may be very low, the storage of the bulkmaterial and its handling can represent a signifi-cant potential risk. It should always be possible tobreak the code in the event of an accident.Particular care should be taken with certain kindsof materials, such as when women of reproductiveage may be exposed to teratogenic test materialsduring an in vitro reproductive toxicity study. Biological hazards Many different issues related to potential biological hazards must be considered and, in certain cases,monitored and recorded in the cell and tissue cul-ture laboratory. Risk assessments should address issues that could arise from the species of origin (i.e. humanand primate cells of highest risk, see reference 7),the health status of the donor, the available datafrom microbiological screening tests, and the cul-ture and storage history (8). Although not usuallydangerous to the user, cells and tissues have thepotential to permit the replication of viruses poten-tially pathogenic to humans, and should thereforebe routinely treated as if they are a potential healthrisk (Table 7). All cells and tissues new to the laboratory should be handled under a strict quarantine procedure,including suitable precautions to prevent thespread of potential contamination, according to thegeneral guidance given in Table 7, with additionalcontrols, as necessary (such as the use of separatededicated media and equipment, and work by dedi-cated staff). Horizontal laminar flow cabinetsshould not be used when handling cells, as such cab-inets are designed to protect only the work area andthe air flow is directed toward the user. Where the nature of the work means that there is a significant risk of biological hazard, special pre-cautions must be taken in accordance with nationalrequirements, most of which, where infectiousorganisms are concerned, are based on the WorldHealth Organisation classification for humanpathogens (Appendix 3). 274 S. Coecke et al.If the cells or tissues originate from a certified source, such as a recognised cell bank, which pro-vides certification of freedom from certain contami-nants, this documentation may suffice for riskassessment, provided that the cells have not beenexposed to potential sources of contamination sinceleaving the bank. However, it is recommended that,as a minimum and where advisable, mycoplasmatesting should be carried out on all samplesreceived. Due to the risk that the operators' immune sys- tems may not protect them against, for example,the tumorigenic growth of their own cells whichmay have been altered via the in vitro procedures (for example, by transformation, immortalisation,infection, or genetic modification), most nationalguidelines make it unacceptable for operators toculture cells or tissues derived from themselves orfrom other workers in the same laboratory, nor togenetically manipulate such cells or tissues, or treatthem with potentially pathogenic organisms. Many countries have national safety committees, which establish guidelines for work with geneticallymodified organisms (GMOs) and help and requirescientists to classify and perform their work at theappropriate biosafety level. Recombinant cells, (i.e.those produced by genetic engineering or geneticmodification [terms used to cover most techniqueswhich artificially alter the genetic make-up of anorganism by mixing the nucleic acids of differentgenes and/or species together]) will generally fallwithin the requirements of such guidelines. Theclassification and control of this kind of work differs between countries, and countries may decide toclassify work at a higher or lower level when newinformation on a particular vector/host systembecomes available. Risk assessment is clearly a dynamic process, and has to take into account new developments and theprogress of science. It is the responsibility of the sci-entists involved to keep up to date with develop-ments in this expanding field of activity, and at alltimes to respect national and international guide-lines and requirements. 4.3 Risk to the Environment Risks to the environment are generally due to poor waste disposal, leading to contamination of water,air or soil, or the escape from containment of haz-ardous materials. The environment can also be con-taminated by release of biological material due toaccidents, including transport accidents, and sys-tems should be put in place either to prevent orminimise the potential for such damage. Supportfrom the local biological safety officer should besought, if available. Waste disposal Methods of waste disposal appropriate to the work in hand must be identified during the risk assess-Table 6: Some areas of concern in general laboratory safety to which risk assessment should be applied Facilities (such as laboratories, offices, storage and sanitation): for example, are they appropriate and adequate for the intended use, well maintained, and properly heated, ventilated and lit? Security: depending on the work, are special security precautions required, (for example, for restricted access tosite/laboratories, and for removal of hazardous material from the site)? Health and safety of staff: is the health and safety monitoring of staff regularly carried out and documented? Laboratory equipment: is the equipment used certified as sufficiently safe for its specific and intended purpose? Infectious/biohazardous materials: are hazard classification, receipt, processing, containment, storage and disposalconducted correctly, with use of the appropriate protective equipment, clothing and other precautions? Chemicals and radioactive substances: are the receipt, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials (forexample, radioisotopes, toxic compounds, flammable liquids) conducted according to the correct procedures? Hazard prevention: are appropriate hazard prevention plans established, are staff regularly trained in theseprocedures (for example, fire evacuations), and are they applied correctly? Waste disposal: is a waste management procedure established that ensures prompt and safe removal from the cleancell culture areas, followed by disposal according to approved procedures?Second ECVAM Task Force on good cell culture practice 2 7 5ment process. These methods must protect not only the individual tissue culture workers themselves,but also their colleagues, the wider population, andthe environment. Work with known pathogens andGMOs must be performed according to the relevantregulations (see above), including methods of wastedisposal. Where methods are not specified in theseregulations, there is a requirement to assess andjustify all proposed methods of waste disposal aspart of the risk assessment. Similarly, the appropri-ate method of disposal of hazardous chemicals mustbe identified before work with them is undertaken.In line with the above precautionary principle, thefollowing minimum precautions should be takenwhen disposing of waste from the cell culture labo-ratory: \u2014 all liquid waste, with the exception of sterile media or solutions, should be either chemicallyinactivated (by using sodium hypochlorite oranother disinfectant) or autoclaved before dis-posal; and \u2014 all solid waste contaminated with tissue culture liquid and/or cells should either be autoclavedbefore leaving the laboratory, or should be placed in rigid, leak-proof containers beforebeing transported elsewhere for autoclaving orincineration. Transport The transportation of any biological materials, chemicals (including liquid nitrogen) or other mate-rials (for example, dry ice) of potential risk tohumans, animals, plants and/or the environment,must comply with national or international regula-tions (see, for example, http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/dangerous_goods). They should bepacked so as to prevent spills in the case of break-age, be correctly labelled (with appropriate hazardsymbols), and have the appropriate accompanyingdocumentation (materials safety data sheet, importform, export form, and CITES permit, if applica-ble). A typical materials safety data sheet for a cellline is shown in Table 8. Where appropriate, theInternational Air Transport Association (IATA)guidelines should be followed, as they are stringentand are recognised internationally (for regularTable 7: Typical precautions to be used to ensure operator safety when handling cells and tissues Hands should be washed or disinfected before and after handling cells. An appropriate gown or laboratory coat should be worn, to be put on when entering the laboratory and removed whenleaving it. Personal accessories (for example, rings, watches), which might compromise cell and tissue culture activities, shouldbe removed or covered up to prevent contamination.If appropriate, gloves should be worn, and replaced immediately if torn or punctured or during extended worksessions. When handling cell and tissue cultures, workers must avoid transferring contamination on the hands from the culturework to unprotected body parts (for example, eyes or mouth), clothing or items in the open laboratory environment. As far as is reasonably practicable, all cell and tissue work should be performed in a Class II cabinet or otherappropriate (micro)biological safety cabinet (see Appendix 2). NB: certain cabinets, such as horizontal flow cabinets,protect the cells and tissues, but not the user or the general environment. Mouth-pipetting must be strictly prohibited. All procedures should be undertaken by using methods that minimise the production of aerosols that might spreadcontamination by micro-organisms or cells. All disinfectants used should be effective and appropriate for the work. All work surfaces should be cleaned with an appropriate disinfectant, before and after use. The use of sharps should be avoided as far as is possible. Any used sharps should be disposed of safely according toapproved procedures. All cultures should be clearly and unambiguously labelled.276 S. Coecke et al.Table 8: Typical material safety data sheets for animal cell cultures (Containment Level 1 or 2), but without references to specific national and local legislationa Cultures are not specifically defined as hazardous, but as live cells, they are potential biohazards, and should be treated as if biohazardous.

SECTION VIII Special precautions or comments:Recommended that appropriate safety procedures be used when handling all cell lines, especially those derived fromhuman or other primate material. For detailed discussions of laboratory safety procedures see references 15-18. aThis generalised example of a material safety data sheet is based on one that can be found at http://www.atcc.org/pdf/msds_animal.pdf ; bBiosafety Levels 1 and 2 are broadly equivalent to European Containment Levels 1 and 2.Second ECVAM Task Force on good cell culture practice 2 7 7updates, see www.wfcc.info). Before arranging transport, the various legal requirements for exportand import into the recipient country should beconsidered, including ethical issues (such as the useof human cells or tissues of embryonic origin), dis-ease transmission, endangered species regulations(www.cites.org/), and bioterrorism regulations (seehttp://www.bt.cdc.gov/). A cell culture may fall into any one of the classes of biological material used for shipping purposes,namely: \u2014 diagnostic specimens; \u2014 infectious specimens;\u2014 biological products; or\u2014 GMOs. Principle 5: Compliance with relevant laws and regulations, and withethical principles From an ethical and legal point of view, it is desir- able that high standards for cell and tissue cultureshould be established and maintained worldwide, sothat accountability, safety and ethical acceptabilitycan be universally guaranteed, as far as is reason-ably practicable. The ethical and associated legalissues raised are extremely complex and beyond thescope of these GCCP guidelines. However, all con-cerned should maintain a sufficient level of aware-ness of the ethical issues related to cell and tissueculture work, and of public opinion and the relevantlegislation at the national and international levels. At present there are no ethical guidelines relating specifically to general cell culture practices, but var-ious guidelines, regulations and laws are in placefor dealing with cells and tissues of specific originand/or use. Before any studies are initiated, matters of ethi- cal significance must be carefully considered. Thesecan be subdivided, from a GCCP point of view, intogeneral ethical considerations and more-specificconsiderations. From a general perspective, diligence in legal and ethical matters leads to data of higher value, sinceit can help to avoid waste of effort and can increaseconfidence in the outcome of the study, to the ben-efit of all concerned, including the general public. The more-specific considerations include the eth- ical implications of using material of animal andhuman origin, and GMOs. 5.1 Laws and Regulations At present, there are no international laws specifically governing cell and tissue culture practices. However,any work involving animal or human pathogens hasto be performed in compliance with national andinternational requirements. Some countries have, or are preparing, legislation or regulations to control spe-cific areas, such as the use of material of human ori-gin. New controls are also being drafted in response tothe challenges and opportunities presented by trans-plantation, regenerative medicine, stem cell researchand GMOs. Ownership of cell lines and patents mustalso be dealt with appropriately, and special condi-tions may apply where cell cultures are involved (seereference 9). In addition, there are internationalagreements relating to the provision of organisms andcell cultures that may be used for bioterrorism. 5.2 The Use of Animal Material In general, any work involving animal material should be in compliance with local and national leg-islation on animal experimentation and the ThreeRs (reduction , refinement and replacement ) princi- ples of Russell & Burch (10). In addition, other eth-ical issues may arise in certain circumstances.Examples include the use of cells derived fromendangered species (http://www.cites.org/), the pro-duction of monoclonal antibodies by the ( seeReferences: Monoclonal and ethics), and the pretreatment of animals withchemical inducers to provide cells for culture withspecific biochemical properties (for example, hepa-tocytes with elevated CYP450 enzyme levels). In order to minimise pain and distress, donor ani- mals should be handled according to the appropriateand approved procedures. As fetuses of many mam-malian species can already feel pain long before birth(11), they should also be treated with the utmost care,again according to appropriate procedures. Serum, and especially fetal bovine serum, is a com- monly-used component of animal cell culture media.It is harvested from bovine fetuses taken from preg-nant cows during slaughter. Here again, the currentpractice of fetal blood harvesting poses ethical prob-lems (blood is usually taken via cardiac puncture,without any form of anaesthetic; 11, 12). Efforts arebeing made to reduce the use of animal serum and,where possible, to replace it with synthetic alterna-tives. A wide range of other cell culture materialsderived from animals (such as tissue extracts, extra-cellular matrix materials) also raise ethical concerns. Legal issues can also arise if animal-derived cells and tissues are found to be infected with viruseswhich could infect wildlife or species of agriculturalimportance. For this reason, the discovery of suchviruses in cells and tissues may need to be notified tothe relevant authorities and appropriate action taken. 5.3 The Use of Human Material The use of human biological material is critical for medical research. It is particularly important that278 S. Coecke et al.researchers are aware of the need to handle such material in a responsible manner and in accordancewith local and national requirements. Those involved with the procurement, supply and use of human biological material should maintainproper records, to ensure appropriate traceabilityand control of the applications of the material inways which are consistent with the nature of theconsent given by, or on behalf of, the donor. All useof human tissue should be approved by the appro-priate ethics committee, and copies of suchapprovals should be kept for reference. Where sam-ples are provided to third parties, the custodian isresponsible for the safe keeping of the code whichenables samples to be linked to individual donors,where appropriate and when necessary. Human material is usually procured either from specialised cell and tissue banks or from hospitals(13). Currently, most of the banks are run on a not-for-profit basis. Nevertheless, some of them havebeen set up by private industries, particularly forthe production of engineered tissues. This raisesserious ethical concerns (including the transfer ofhuman material for profit), and has not yet beendealt with adequately at the national level in mostcountries or internationally. In Europe, this areawill be regulated under the EU Human TissuesDirective (14). Confidentiality with respect to the provision and use of human tissue is governed both by law and byprofessional guidelines. A legal requirement inmost countries is that, when dealing with humanmaterial, informed consent must be sought eitherfrom the donor or from the donor's family. Human tissue banks should be recognised as the most legally and ethically acceptable approach tothe procurement and distribution of donated non-transplantable human tissue for research, as theyare best equipped to deal with, and advise on, thecomplex issues involved, including ethics, consent,safety and logistics, as well as scientific questions. The removal of blood samples from human vol- unteers should only be performed by qualified per-sonnel, and particular precautions should befollowed to minimise any risks. Such volunteersshould also be considered to be donors, and docu-mented informed consent will be required. The use of human embryonic stem cells involves serious ethical questions, because of their originsand their potential uses. This is a relatively newresearch area, and, while some countries alreadyhave strict controls, other countries are currentlyconsidering what laws and regulations should beintroduced in the public interest. The procurement of stem cells from early embryos and fetuses is a particularly sensitiveissue, because of the circumstances in which suchembryos and fetuses become available. Stem cellscan also be obtained from adult tissues and fromumbilical cord blood, where the ethical considera-tions to be taken into account are similar to those involved in obtaining other human tissues, but it isthe use of the stem cells which requires effectiveregulation. Before any human material is used for the estab- lishment of a new cell line, ethical approval shouldbe obtained from the relevant authority. 5.4 Genetically Modified Cells The creation, storage, transport, use and disposal of genetically engineered cells are currently subject tothe requirements that apply to GMOs. This is a rap-idly expanding field, and its long-term conse-quences are as yet unknown. It involvesmanipulating genes and cells in ways that do notoccur in nature, and for this reason, it raises sensi-tive ethical issues. The above activities are regu-lated in many countries, where, before any work isinitiated, relevant approval must be sought. Principle 6: Provision of relevant and adequate education and training forall personnel, to promote highquality work and safety The range of applications for cell culture is expand- ing rapidly and involves an ever-broadening rangeof technical manipulations (such as chemicallyinduced and genetic modifications) for use in basicand applied science, manufacturing, diagnosis, andefficacy and safety testing procedures, as well as forproviding therapeutic materials. The competence of staff to perform their duties in a laboratory is central to ensuring that work isperformed according to the standards of the organ-isation in relation to its scientific, legal and safetyrequirements and obligations. This requires educ-ation and training, as well as the regular monitor-ing of performance (Table 9). A good basic education should be given in the nature and purposes of cell and tissue culture whichis an essential basis for any future training pro-gramme. The basic principles of in vitro work, asep- tic technique, cell and tissue handling, qualityassurance, and ethics should be included. It is alsoimportant that those working with material of ani-mal or human origin should have a sufficient under-standing of any additional laws or regulations thatwill apply. Training should be seen as an ongoing process for improving and developing practical skills, andmaintaining competence. Given its critical impor-tance to the success of any laboratory work, thereshould be a formally documented training pro-gramme for all members of staff, including train-ing records and regular reviews of training needs.To ensure the quality of work in the long term, itSecond ECVAM Task Force on good cell culture practice 2 7 9is also important to link training with personal development programmes for technical and scien-tific staff, in order to ensure they are progres-sively trained and educated in line with changinglaboratory activities and demands. When new staff join a laboratory, their skills and experience should be assessed, and the needfor further training procedures in relation totheir new jobs should be identified. These needsmay include a variety of general and specific pro-cedures, covering SOPs, general laboratory main- tenance, and safety and emergency procedures. Training can be provided in-house by experi- enced members of staff and/or visiting experts,via accredited on-line programmes and/orthrough attendance at external courses. For cer-tain applications including product manufactureand testing, and processing of cells and tissues forclinical use, training must be formally recordedand reviewed.

Coecke et al.Work with liquid nitrogen probably poses the great- est single threat to the safety of cell culture work-ers (as gauged by the number of individuals using itand the potential severity of any accident), and forthis reason is dealt with in greater detail here. Details of general hazards, precautions, and first aid can be obtained from the suppliers of liquidnitrogen and of liquid nitrogen vessels (see, forexample, http://www.bocgases.ie/saftey/othersaftey/pdf/cryogenics.pdf). Such relevant informationmust be obtained, and its contents must be takeninto account in the relevant risk assessments. Aprinted version should be placed in a readily acces-sible location where it can be rapidly referred to,before any work using liquid nitrogen is under- taken. A serious hazard in the use of liquid nitrogen is the risk of asphyxiation due to the displacement ofair by nitrogen gas within a confined area. Areaswhere liquid nitrogen is stored or handled musttherefore be well ventilated. In addition, oxygen-depletion monitors (wall-mounted and/or worn bystaff), which can provide an early warning that thelevel of oxygen is declining below a safe level,should be used in areas where large numbers ofstorage vessels are held and/or significant amountsof liquid nitrogen are handled. Liquid nitrogen is frequently stored in pres- surised vessels. Many countries have regulationsgoverning the design, construction, use, mainte-nance, testing and other aspects of such pressurisedvessels (for example, the UK Pressure Systems Safety Regulations 2000 ). In countries where no such regulations exist, similar precautions shouldbe taken. In particular, cell culture workers shouldensure that they know how to operate such vesselssafely (see the user's manual) and must have theirvessels maintained and tested on a regular basis.Further useful information can be found at:http://www.hse.gov.uk/hid/land/comah/level3/5c9a7bd.htm. Because of the ultra-low temperature of liquid nitrogen (-196\u00b0C), it can cause severe frostbite toexposed tissues, particularly if it is caught in looseclothing or shoes, or spilled down the cuff of an insulated glove. Therefore, appropriate clothingshould always be worn (open-toed footware is notpermissible, and clothing with loose cuffs, pocketsand turn-ups should be avoided), with eye protec-tion and insulated gloves (ideally, these should beloose-fitting for ease of removal, be made of imper-meable material, and have close-fitting, elasticatedcuffs). The other hazard associated with liquid nitrogen is that it can enter storage vials (due to inadequatesealing) when they are immersed in the liquidphase, and this may cause the vials to explode uponthawing. Therefore, steps must be taken to protectworkers from the effects of such an explosion. As aminimum , workers must wear a full-face visor, insulated gloves and a long-sleeved laboratory coatwhen thawing vials from liquid nitrogen, and otherindividuals must be kept clear of the immediatearea. The vessel containing the liquid in which thevial is being warmed, if judiciously chosen, can beused to further protect the worker by containingany flying debris and/or directing the force of theblast away from the worker. Such explosions could be particularly dangerous if the vials contained pathogenic material.Therefore, material known to be pathogenic must notbe stored in the liquid phase of liquid nitrogen, but instead should be stored in the vapour phase.Another reason for this is that transfer of patho-genic material between containers stored in the liq-uid phase has been documented. 1Clearly, the greatest care must be taken to ensure that storagevessels containing pathogenic material are fullysealed before placing them in storage, and that theywill stay fully sealed under the intended storageconditions. 1Tedder, R.S.

Other cabinets (Class I and III)have been developed, each to serve only one ofthese functions 1, but, in addressing both require- ments, the Class II cabinet is less robust if mis-used, and for safe and reliable performance of itsdual function, requires careful installation, main-tenance and practical use. Accordingly, the oper-ators of BSCs require careful instruction as totheir use. Supervisors must inform staff thatClass II BSCs are not substitutes for good aseptictechnique; in particular, the airflows will not pro-vide protection in cases of gross spillage, highenergy aerosols (for example, from centrifuges, orsprays) and physical disturbance. The followingare some typical precautions to help ensure thecorrect and safe use of a Class II BSC. \u2014 Before using the BSC, ensure that it is working correctly. Check the airflow indicators or thenegative pressure gauges. Most BSCs are fittedwith alarms to indicate any unsafe operationconditions. \u2014 Use appropriate disinfection to decontaminate surfaces before commencing work. \u2014 Ensure that all essential materials and equip- ment are placed in the BSCs before work isstarted; this will reduce the risk of interruptionsto the BSC air flow during use, and will reducethe risk of contamination. \u2014 Do not place too many items in the BSC at any one time, as cluttering the work area may affectthe air flow. \u2014 Ensure that a vessel of appropriate disinfectant is on hand, in case of spillages. \u2014 Bear in mind that once the work has started, all materials within the BSC are potentially con-taminated and should not be removed until afterappropriate disinfection. This includes glovedhands. \u2014 Do not subculture or otherwise manipulate more than one cell or tissue culture system in the BSCat any one time. This is essential, to avoid mis-labelling or cross-contamination. \u2014 Use separate bottles of growth medium for each cell or tissue culture system, as this will preventthe transfer of microbial agents between culturesystems or possible cross-contamination. \u2014 Avoid rapid movements, which may interrupt the air flow. \u2014 When the work is completed, ensure that all materials and equipment are made safe. Placeall materials that need to leave the BSC inappropriate transport containers, and disin-fect by either spraying or wiping. Disinfect thework area in case of spillage and splashes. \u2014 Depending on the work being carried out, the BSC may need to be decontaminated withformaldehyde prior to further work being under-taken. 1 \u2014 Leave the BSC running for at least 10 minutes before switching it off, in order to remove anyaerosols generated during the work. \u2014 Class II safety cabinets should be sited, installed and commissioned according to national regula-tions. 1Jones, B.P.C.

Coecke et al.Risk Group 1 (no or low individual and community risk) A microorganism that is unlikely to cause human or animal disease. Risk Group 2 (moderate individual risk, low community risk) A pathogen that can cause human or animal dis- ease, but is unlikely to be a serious hazard to labo-ratory workers, the community, livestock or theenvironment. Laboratory exposures may cause seri-ous infection, but effective treatment and preven-tive measures are available, and the risk of spreadof infection is limited. Risk Group 3 (high individual risk, low community risk) A pathogen that usually causes serious human or animal disease, but does not ordinarily spread fromone infected individual to another. Effective treat-ment and preventive measures are available. Risk Group 4 (high individual and community risk) A pathogen that usually causes serious human or animal disease and that can be readily transmittedfrom one individual to another, directly or indi-rectly.
