She authored and published a huge variety of health books; one of them is Ageless remedies from mother's kitchen. She was born of German missionaries, studied nursing at the University of Freiburg, Germany and worked in a hospital for natural healing under Professor Brauchle. In 1953 she and her family came to America and in 1958 she started one of the first health food stores. A century ago, simple home remedies were used to treat minor injuries, ailments, and pains. If someone scraped the knee, a thorough washing and a thin layer of honey on the wound did the trick. Drinking tea for an upset stomach or stuffy nose gave way to popping antacids and antihistamines instead. There were times when conventional medicine treating the symptoms took over but in the last few years home remedies have reclaimed the spotlight. However, I was very fortunate since I grew up in Northern Germany and our family doctor never prescribed drugs but herbal remedies! More than ever, many people are getting back to nature when it concerns their health. People are taking a second look at treatments their grandmothers trusted. Many folk remedies are simple, inexpensive, and effective - and most important are free of negative side effects of some over- the counter treatments.
