Experts are of the view that the benefits of vaccination to the pregnant women outweigh its potential risks . Based on the recommendations from National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI), MoHFW has approved vaccination of pregnant women against COVID -19 with the conditi on that the pregnant women may be informed about the risks of exposure to COVID -19 infection along with the risks and benefits associated with the COVID -19 vaccines available in the country . Based on the information provided , a pregnant woman will have the choice to take the vaccination. The COVID -19 vaccination has been expanded to include all citizens from 18 years of age onwards, making more than 69% of population eligible, of which nearly half (48%) are women. Pregnant women who develop COVID -19 are more l ikely to require intensive care than their non-pregnant counterparts. COVID -19 infection during pregnancy may result in rapid deterioration of health of pregnant women and might affect the fetus also. Information related to COVID -19, the impact of the disea se on pregnancy and data related to COVID -19 vaccines are rapidly evolving. In the context of current situation of the SARS -CoV-2 pandemic, experts have suggested that the COVID -19 vaccine may be offered to the pregnant women if no contraindications exist. The intent is to weigh risk versus benefit on individualized basis, so that a pregnant woman can take an informed decision. This decision is based on the wom an's understanding that the risk of infection and/or morbidity from COVID -19 outweighs the undescribed risk of being vaccinated during pregnancy. In India, at present three vaccines have received approval for restricted use in emergency situation. One of them is an inactivated vaccine (Covaxin) and other two are based on non - replicating viral vector platform (Covishield and Sputnik V). A pregnant woman who opts for vaccina tion, could be vaccinated at any time of the pregnancy. To h elp pregnant women make an informed decision to be vaccinated , they should 2 be provided with information about the risks of COVID -19 infection in pregnancy , the benefits of vaccination, along with the likely side effects of vaccination . This guidance note enables states to develop a Counseling and Vaccination plan for pregnant women. Section I: Preparing for COVID -19 vaccination of pregnant women (i) Orientation and Capacity Building Orientation of programme staff : States would undertake an o rientation of programme managers responsible of the COVID vaccination programme at district , block and sub block levels, including Health and Wellness Centres and vaccinators at the health facilities in the public and private sector and also of all FLWs and health care providers at all the level s including medical colleges, DH, SDH, CHCs, PHCs , private clinics etc. who provide ANC services to women . The orientation would be conducted virtually and would broadly cover the areas in the attached sheet (Annexure I). Training of FLWs and Vaccinations : From the above category, states would identify a pool of individuals (PHC -MOs, Staff Nurses, District Programme managers, and Community Health Officers etc. ) who would be directly be responsible for training of frontline workers and vaccinators on counseling of pregnant women and providing them with accurate information regarding the benefits and risks of the vaccine, including g uiding them on registration and the location of the a ppropriate vaccination site. This training can be accomplished in two hours. It would need to be c onducted in small batch (10 -15) at the level of the PHC, ensuring COVID appropriate behaviors . The materi al to be used is at Annexure II. (ii) Engagement of medical professionals in the private sector The state would conduct an orientation of members from professional bodies such as FOGSI, IMA, IAP & NNF, and any other state specific professional bodies they would be requested to ensure that this inf ormation is transmitted to all membeers . This could also be done virtually. 3 Section II: Counseling pregnant women for COVID Vaccination There are several points at which interface of the pregnant woman and the FLW occurs and where pregnant women could be counselled . These include: - Household visits by frontline workers; - Antenatal checkup at health facility, outreach immunization sessions, V illage Health and Nutrition Days (VHND s) and Urban Health and Nutrit ion Days (UHND s). - Facility visits by pregnant women for other reasons ; - Any other site where there is interaction with the pregnant woman - COVID -19 Vaccination Centers (CVCs); During the counselling, the FLW or vaccinator (if the women reaches the CVC direct ly and has questions related to COVID 19 vaccination ) should explain to the pregnant women the potential risks of COVID -19 on their health or that of the baby, benefits of vaccination , pote ntial side effects and precautions they need to take following vaccination . Section III : Vaccination of Pregnant Women If the pregnant woman decides to get vaccinated, the process of registration for COVID -19 vaccination needs to be explained to her and the accompanying famil y member. She also needs to be informed about the nearest COVID vaccination center The modality for registration of beneficiaries, reporting of vaccination, generation of certificate etc . remain s the same as general population . Operational guidelines and standard operating procedure s for COVID -19 vaccination are available at: https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/COVID19VaccineOG111Chapter16.pdf https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/GuidancedocCOWIN2.pdf Section IV: Adverse Events following Vaccination The full impact of COVID -19 disease on pregnancy outcomes for mother and fetus as well as for new -born is still unclear. Therefore, pregnant women require special considerations and systematic reporting of adverse events following immunization (AEFI). National AEFI surveillance operational guidelines and Covid -19 vaccination operational guidelines will be 4 followed for AEFI surveillanc e related to Covid -19 vaccination of pregnant women. Following are the additional specific activities and action points under this: 1. Obstetrician and gynecologist , pediatric ian or neonatologist to be included in AEFI committees and be sensitized on Covid -19 vaccination of pregnant women 2. Members of local FOGSI chapter and IAP should be oriented on Covid -19 vaccination of pregnant women 3. All the medical officers, private practitioners and frontline health workers to be trained on their role in AEFI surveillance related to Covid -19 vaccination of pregnant women . During vaccination : 1. The vaccinator or medical officer must consider the fact that women in reproductive age group might be unaware of the pregnancy at the time of vaccination. Therefore, the vaccinator must inform her for immediate reporting of AEFI , if any , following Covid -19 vaccination. In such cases, women will need to report immediately to the vaccinator or nearest heal th facility. Reporting : 1. The pregnancy status of women should be recorded into the AEFI notification form while reporting AEFI cases. 2. All A dverse Event following vaccination of pregnant women should be reported immediately into Co -WIN. 3. All serious and seve re adverse events following vaccination of pregnant women should be reported immediately to concerned Medical Officer / District Immunization Officer. Investigation of cases : 1. Obstetrician and gynecologist , pediatric ian or neonatologist should be part of Di strict AEFI Committee investigating all serious and severe AEFI cases following vaccination of pregnant women. 2. The investigation of all such cases to be expedited. Cytopathological examination of aborted/ perinatal death if any occurring in vaccinated women may be done. 3. The adverse event and the pregnancy outcome must be noted on the ANC/MCH card. Pregnancy registry can be used to track such cases and to determine pregnancy outcome. 5 4. All antenatal, post -natal and other relevant c linical records must be sought for and collected during investigation and gathered from the treating physician. Causality assessment: Causality assessment of all adverse events following Covid -19 vaccination of pregnant women to be expedited. Section V: Monitoring (as for current vaccination for COVID ) State Task forces (STF) will review planning, capacity building and implementation of pregnant women vaccination in the state. District Task Force s (DTF) / Urban Task Force s (UTF) will be responsible for ensuring training of health workers , sensitization of professional bodies , and monitoring of vaccination activities for pregnant women. ***** 6 Annexure I Counselling pregnant women for COVID vaccines Fact-Sheet to guide the Medical Officers As a Medical Officer , you need to build capacity of Frontline Worker s and Vaccinator s to counsel pregnant women and their families about the risks of COVID -19 in pregnancy (including, for example, that some pregnant women are at increased risk of infection, or have comorbidities that add to their risk of severe disease and adverse pregnancy outcomes ), the likely benefits of vaccinati on in the current epidemiological context, and the current limitations of the safety data in pregnant women.
