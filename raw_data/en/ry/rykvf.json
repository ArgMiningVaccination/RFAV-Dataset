The main idea behind naturopathy is that it supposedly helps the body's own self-healing process; this is based on the pre- and pseudo-scientific theory of [vitalism](/wiki/Vitalism), according to which the body has some sort of \"energy\" that is necessary for one's health. Naturopathic medicine disfavours surgery and drugs, preferring more friendly and fuzzy treatments like [herbal medicine](/wiki/Herbal_supplements) or outright [woo](/wiki/Woo) such as \" [natural energy fields](/wiki/Subtle_energy)\". Unlike medical or osteopathic doctors (M.D. and D.O, respectively), naturopathic doctors (N.D.) are not universally regulated, [[2]](#cite_note-legguide-2) so on this page the term naturopath is used for both licensed and unlicensed practitioners of naturopathy. Naturopathy doesn't have any real standards; what therapies one can expect from naturopathic care can vary wildly from practitioner to practitioner, [[3]](#cite_note-3) and are very often contradictory. Some naturopaths, like [nutritionists](/wiki/Nutritionist), may give quite good advice (\"eat fruits and vegetables\"), mixed with concepts that have no basis in reality, such as homeopathy, [Reiki](/wiki/Reiki), unproven [supplements](/wiki/Nutritional_supplement), or whatever [fad diet](/wiki/Fad_diet) they happen to believe in. (It may be noted that the practice of naturopaths themselves selling their patients supplements is widespread and in fact encouraged by naturopathic organizations. [[4]](#cite_note-aanmc-4) No [conflict of interest](/wiki/Conflict_of_interest) there at all.) Naturopaths also very frequently claim to be [holistic](/wiki/Holistic_medicine), meaning that they listen to their patients and sympathize with them, rather than just coldly treating them without any regard for their feelings. They \"focus on the patient, not the disease\". Which is actually pretty accurate, given that more often than not the \"treatments\" have no effect on the disease anyway. History[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Naturopathy&action=edit\u00a7ion=1)] Benedict Lust[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Naturopathy&action=edit\u00a7ion=2)] Naturopathy (\"the healing power of nature\"), [[5]](#cite_note-5) but in reality it was cobbled together by a [German](/wiki/German) immigrant to the [United States](/wiki/United_States) named Benedict Lust. Lust used \"Dr.\" before his name and claimed to have a degree from the New York Homeopathic Medical College in 1901 and a degree in [osteopathy](/wiki/Osteopathy) in 1902 from the Universal College of Osteopathy in [New York](/wiki/New_York), [[6]](#cite_note-lust-6) but there was no evidence that he was licensed for anything in the state of New York and he was convicted there of practicing medicine without a licence. [[7]](#cite_note-fishbein-7):122 The term \"naturopathy\" was coined by Lust's colleague, John Scheel, in 1900. Lust popularized the term through his publications, by opening the first naturopathic school (the American School of Naturopathy in [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City)), and from the establishment of health resorts known as \"Yungborn\" in Butler, [New Jersey](/wiki/New_Jersey) and Tangerine, [Florida](/wiki/Florida). [[6]](#cite_note-lust-6) Lust credited several men who preceded him for the development of naturopathy, including Sebastian Kneipp (popularizer of the [Water Cure](/wiki/Water_Cure)), Friedrich Eduard Bilz (who wrote the book Das Neue Naturheilverfahren [[8]](#cite_note-8) (translated as The Natural Method of Healing in 1898 [[9]](#cite_note-9)), and Louis Kuhne (see below). [[10]](#cite_note-universal-10) By 1918, Lust included the following fields of treatment [quackery](/wiki/Quackery) within naturopathy in his book Universal Naturopathic Encyclopedia: electro-medicine, [radiology](/wiki/Radiation), [ozone therapy](/wiki/Ozone_therapy), therapy](/wiki/Color_therapy)). [[10]](#cite_note-universal-10) The main ideas during the Lust-era of naturopathy (roughly 1900 to 1945) were all-inclusiveness \u2014 all natural \"cures\" were of value and to be included under the umbrella of naturopathy, and \"drugless healing\" in the form of strong opposition to the medical establishment. [[10]](#cite_note-universal-10) Lust's views on what is and is not naturopathy leads to [irony](/wiki/Irony) both during and after the Lust era, when: - Radiation therapy was promoted (natural, though ostensibly a drug) for use by non-physicians despite it being well-known (even before 1917 and even by its naturopathic advocates) that radiation caused cancer. [[10]](#cite_note-universal-10) [[11]](#cite_note-11) - Some modern naturopaths prescribe naturopaths were allowed to prescribe morphine (Schedule II) as well as all Schedule III, IV and V drugs. [[15]](#cite_note-15)These prescriptions would be antithetical to Lust's view of naturopathy. Louis Kuhne[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Naturopathy&action=edit\u00a7ion=3)] The 1918 Universal Naturopathic Encyclopedia also includes within it a posthumously published book by Louis Kuhne (1835-1901) titled, The New Science of Healing or The Doctrine of the Unity of Diseases (pages 223-488). [[note 1]](#cite_note-17) The book contains some remarkable cures treatments that amount to a combination of vitalism, [germ theory denialism](/wiki/Germ_theory_denialism) and [antivax](/wiki/Antivax). [[10]](#cite_note-universal-10) cough, scrofula (lymphadenopathy), rheumatism, gout, and sciatica, the treatment consists of combinations of friction sitz-baths, cold baths and steam baths. [[10]](#cite_note-universal-10) Other ailments that Kuhne claimed could be treated include: cold extremities, hot head, nervous and mental diseases, lung inflammation, tuberculosis, pleurisy, lupus, [venereal diseases](/wiki/Venereal_disease), bladder and kidney disease, diabetes, uremia, bed wetting, liver disease, gall stones, intestinal diseases, heart disease, dropsy (edema), spinal cord diseases, hemorrhoids, chlorosis (anemia), epilepsy, anemia, epilepsy, agoraphobia, [eye](/wiki/Eye) and ear diseases, dental diseases, head colds, influenza, throat diseases and goiter, headache and migraine, brain inflammation, typhus, dysentery, cholera, diarrhea, tropical fevers, [malaria](/wiki/Malaria), yellow fever, leprosy, scabies, worms [parasites](/wiki/Parasite), hernia, cancer, wounds, and \"diseases of women\". [[10]](#cite_note-universal-10) The total lack of understanding of disease causes and treatment by Kuhne would seem to be evident simply by his placement of wildly unrelated diseases within the same chapter (e.g., \"Epileptic Fits. Agoraphobia\", p. 366). [[10]](#cite_note-universal-10) Other founders[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Naturopathy&action=edit\u00a7ion=4)] - Vincenz Priessnitz (1799-1851) was a German peasant He created the [Water Cure](/wiki/Water_Cure), and with Johann Schroth (1798-1856) was a haulage contractor. He promoted an austere diet and [fasting](/wiki/Fasting), cold compresses, and steam baths. [[18]](#cite_note-19) - Sebastian Kneipp (1821-1897) was a German [Catholic](/wiki/Catholic)priest who promoted the Water Cure, sometimes known as the Kneipp Cure. The cure was part of Kneipp's five principles of water, plants (herbal medicine), exercise, nutrition and balance. [[19]](#cite_note-20) - Emanuel Felke (1856-1926) was a Protestant priest from Prussia. He advocated iridology and the \"Felke Cure\", which consisted of sitz-bath, light-and-air bath ( [nudity](/wiki/Nudity)), clay bath and sleeping on the bare ground overnight. [[20]](#cite_note-21) - Henry Lindlahr (1862-1924) graduated from National Medical University, a \"low-grade medical college\" which is no longer extant. [[7]](#cite_note-fishbein-7):118 Lindlahr promoted quackery in the form of \"strange diets, [psychoanalysis](/wiki/Psychoanalysis)\". [[7]](#cite_note-fishbein-7):119 Lindlahr was the author of Nature Cure, a foundational text of Naturopathy. [[21]](#cite_note-22) Early debunking[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Naturopathy&action=edit\u00a7ion=5)] By 1932, Morris Fishbein (1889-1976) had recorded an A-to-Z of quackery that fell within the naturopathy umbrella. [[7]](#cite_note-fishbein-7):128-139 Fishbein was an M.D. and was editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association from 1924-1949. [[22]](#cite_note-23) The quack treatments that he documented have since mostly fallen into obscurity: [[7]](#cite_note-fishbein-7) - Aerotherapy \u2014 \"the patient is baked in a hot oven\", and hence treated with [hot air](/wiki/Bullshit) - Alereos system \u2014 treatment with heat and vibrations (with reference to osteopathy and chiropractic - Astral healing \u2014 an astrological reading followed by \"medical\" advice - Autology \u2014 a moderation-in-all things regimen developed by E.

[[24]](#cite_note-germdenialism-25) [[25]](#cite_note-26) Nevertheless, there are some positions which can be considered to be quite common among naturopaths as a whole. There is the [appeal to nature](/wiki/Appeal_to_nature), which is ubiquitous (although, as \"natural\" is a pretty vague term, the conception of which therapies are natural or not can vary depending on the practitioner) [[12]](#cite_note-nstdf-12) [[26]](#cite_note-versusnatural-27) [[27]](#cite_note-sns-28); a [distrust of vaccines](/wiki/Anti-vaccination_movement) and other \" [synthetic](/wiki/Chemophobia)\" products; use of herbs and [vitamins](/wiki/Vitamin); a tendency to prefer exotic, Eastern medicine (the more expensive and obscure, the better!) such as Ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM); and the belief that our bodies are full of [toxins](/wiki/Toxin) like [lead](/wiki/Lead) and [mercury](/wiki/Mercury), which need to be purged by means of [detoxing](/wiki/Detox) or [chelation therapy](/wiki/Chelation_therapy). [Ironically](/wiki/Irony), Ayurveda and TCM actually consider mercury, lead, [arsenic](/wiki/Arsenic), and [asbestos](/wiki/Asbestos) to be legitimate medical remedies, even as naturopaths wholeheartedly recommend these systems of \"medicine\". In addition, the [American](/wiki/America) Textbook of Natural Medicine lists [Unani](/wiki/Unani) (in addition to Ayurveda and TCM) as an acceptable form of naturopathic treatment, [[28]](#cite_note-29) even though [bloodletting](/wiki/Bloodletting) and [leeching](/wiki/Leeching) are integral parts of it (even more so than in Ayurveda and TCM). Quite a few naturopaths seem to have no problem prescribing pharmaceuticals or synthesized supplements, despite the anti- [Big Pharma](/wiki/Big_Pharma) rhetoric of many. Chelation drugs, Benadryl\u00ae, colchicine, and various other pharmaceuticals are prescribed by naturopaths on a regular basis. [[12]](#cite_note-nstdf-12) [[26]](#cite_note-versusnatural-27) [[29]](#cite_note-30) [[27]](#cite_note-sns-28) It seems each individual naturopath just arbitrarily mixes and matches \"synthetic\" and \"natural\" treatments with no real rhyme or reason, depending on what \"feels right\". What is a toxic synthetic pharmaceutical for one naturopath may be a perfectly acceptable naturopathic treatment for another. To give just one of many examples, some blast [Botox](/wiki/Botox) (which, incidentally, is completely natural) as being a horrible poison, [[30]](#cite_note-31) [[31]](#cite_note-32) [[32]](#cite_note-33) while others use it quite happily. [[33]](#cite_note-34) [[34]](#cite_note-35) Principles[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Naturopathy&action=edit\u00a7ion=7)] The principles of modern naturopathy according to the Association of Accredited Naturopathic Medical Colleges are: [[35]](#cite_note-36) \"\" These may sound like [common sense](/wiki/Common_sense), but because they are not [evidence-based](/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine), there is little understanding by naturopaths about what is less harmful or what is more effective. Why, for example do naturopaths eschew vaccines for their invasiveness (generally very safe and effective), but recommend invasive colonics (ineffective and potentially dangerous [[note 2]](#cite_note-38))? Why are vaccines considered to be unnatural by naturopaths (originally performed with cowpox and a simple lance [[37]](#cite_note-39)) but colonics are considered to be natural (which use plastic tubing and modern plumbing)? Modern treatments[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Naturopathy&action=edit\u00a7ion=8)] There is no single list of what constitutes naturopathic treatment, but common treatments are covered at accredited naturopathic universities. The list of treatments has changed substantially from the olden days, perhaps because [evidence-based medicine](/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine) is not used there is no clear pathway between evolving treatments as there is in [Western medicine](/wiki/Western_medicine). Common and practice are not based on the body of basic knowledge related to health, disease, and health care that has been |\u2014Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (1968)| \"\"In our inquiry, we provided naturopaths and their professional associations ample opportunity to refute the conclusions of several major commissions of inquiry over the years that deemed their therapeutic rationale lacking in scientific credibility.

[[48]](#cite_note-50) Education does include actual science (general biology and chemistry, anatomy/physiology, physics etc.) but these colleges generally reject vaccinations or the use of actual medicine. In many states the use of naturopaths is restricted or illegal.[ [citation needed](/wiki/Help:References)] Some unaccredited schools also offer \"degrees\" in naturopathy, including Clayton College of Natural Health; [[49]](#cite_note-51) the Trinity School of Natural Health, which is \"accredited\" by an accreditation mill; [[50]](#cite_note-52) [[51]](#cite_note-53) and the Natural Healing Institute, which is also \"accredited\" by an accreditation mill.

Relman, Emeritus Professor of Medicine and of Social Medicine, Harvard Medical School and Editor-in-Chief Emeritus of The New England Journal of Medicine, reviewed the primary textbook on natural medicine, eponymously called Textbook of Natural Medicine, which was then in its second edition. [[58]](#cite_note-relman-60) [[59]](#cite_note-61) As of 2017, the textbook is in its fourth edition. [[60]](#cite_note-62) The textbook has been edited by Joseph E.

[[69]](#cite_note-case-71) In real medicine, case studies are intended to have an educational purpose, either for medical students or for fellow-doctors; case studies are used to determine a proper diagnosis, differentiate between possible diagnoses and/or to determine a proper course of treatment. [[70]](#cite_note-72) Naturopaths also use case studies, but they often look amateurish; compared to medical case studies, they often lack detail and focus. To compare the case below to an actual medical case study, see for example \"Case Study in Del(17p) Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia\".

There were no clear explanations on why any of the proposed treatments would be useful. And, there was no consensus on how to treat the patient. One is left to wonder whether each naturopath had [their own pet treatment that they always recommended](/wiki/Golden_hammer), and just happened to be offered at their own clinic. Why do people see naturopaths instead of real doctors?[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Naturopathy&action=edit\u00a7ion=13)] According to Hermes, medical doctors have historically struggled with making people feel heard, particularly women and people of color. In contrast the naturopoathic experience tends more towards empathy and learning about how people feel. To overcome this, medical doctors need to have a good bedside manner, to make patients feel like they've been heard and that they have the ability to make choices based on the medical evidence and the tools available to them (e.g. pharmaceuticals or lifestyle changes). [[84]](#cite_note-88) How naturopathic medicine can work[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Naturopathy&action=edit\u00a7ion=14)] In some cases naturopathic medicine has an effect, because it is an unrefined [proto-medicine](/wiki/Protoscience) such as [willow bark](/wiki/List_of_medicinal_plants#Willow) (unrefined aspirin) or [foxglove](/wiki/List_of_medicinal_plants#Foxglove) (unrefined digoxin). In many other cases, it works because of either [regression to the mean](/wiki/Regression_to_the_mean) (people naturally get better sometimes) or the [placebo effect](/wiki/Placebo_effect). It is known for example that some types of placebos are more effective than others. [[85]](#cite_note-kihlstrom-89) [[86]](#cite_note-90) \"\"In the treatment of pain, for example, big, dark-colored, bad-tasting placebos are more effective than small, brightly colored, good tasting ones; placebos delivered intravenously are more effective than placebos delivered intramuscularly, which in turn are more effective than placebos delivered orally. Expensive placebos are likely to be more effective than inexpensive ones. [[85]](#cite_note-kihlstrom-89) [[87]](#cite_note-91) So there are several ways that naturopaths are enhancing the placebo effect \u2014 counsciously or not \u2014 using non- [evidence-based](/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine) but possibly-effective [logical fallacies](/wiki/Logical_fallacies): [Appeal to ancient wisdom](/wiki/Appeal_to_ancient_wisdom)\u2014 This treatment has been used since ancient times, so it must work.
