The range of initiatives access over 170 projects, which includes a mix of regular commissioning work and innovative development work testing new ideas. Over 250,000 individuals and groups were direct beneficiaries of the programmes; however, previous evaluations have demonstrated that the cascade effect of these initiatives was at least threefold. One of the major challenges this year was addressing a fluent financial environment; in one hand having to yield baseline funding for efficiencies while on the other bidding for in-year non-recurrent funding from new funding earmarked under the Programme for Government for Public Health. Despite the uncertainty the teams achieved their financial targets and ensured they broke even, Table 1 summarises the financial allocation for the team. There have been a number of key developments in terms of business processes and procurement. The findings from the 2011/12 internal audit focused the spotlight on the recording and monitoring processes; this added to the work burden of staff but was a critical lesson in project management, value for money and business case development which will benefit the team in the longer term. Capacity within the team was also challenged with a number of key staff being absent due to long term sickness. In credit to the commitment from their colleagues the team pulled together to overcome the shortfall and ensure service delivery was sustained. The City of Culture 2013 initiative acted as a springboard to look at some alternative and innovative solutions to addressing health and well-being, in particular addressing inequalities. Key developments in the past year include: Access and Inclusion officer Baby's Day O ut book Velo Bikes Project Volunteer Project - Welcome Host training One of the highlights of the year was the 10th Anniversary celebration of the WIFH Partnership. The event reflected on the success of the last 10 years and examined the opportunities for the future. One of the longest running initiatives, Health Promoting Homes, continued to prove effective with over 100 families participating in the programme. The Neighbourhood Renewal Health Improvement Programme reached over 21,000 beneficiaries alone with a range of training, information and support programmes. A further 3, 759 participated in the Green Gym initiative completing a staggering 6130 hours of voluntary work. 4 Drugs and alcohol remains a major challenge to our society and the PHA has continued to invest over \u00a31 million in a range of initiatives at community level. Projects like the Lifeskills initiative by Action Mental Health in Fermanagh reached almost 700 beneficiaries while Foyle Haven facilitated an estimated 5000 drop-in sessions for those living with a chronic alcohol addiction. The PHA remains fully committed to the implementation of the Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention strategies. Through a small grants programme 465 people benefitted from a range of counselling, training and support programmes in their own locality outlining the link to alcohol and drugs and mental health. In the wider mental health sector 82 organisations underwent a self-assessment process in terms of their corporate and client standards and 547 people underwent a range of training c ourses on suicide prevention. Over 5,400 individuals benefitted from 19 initiatives funded under the small grants programme. Despite the body of evidence and legislation smoking remains a major challenge to the well- being of the local population. The PHA in the West has continued to address this challenge head on. Over 6460 children enrolled in the Smokebusters Club while 400 further education students participated in a range of education programmes. The PHA remains concerns at the rising number of sexually transmitted infections (STI). To help address the issue, focus has been placed on awareness and referral initiatives. 150 third level students participated in an awareness programme and 1000 people engaged in a Health Fair event. Over 25,000 booklets and related materials were distributed over the past year. The Healthy Living Centres have been key partners to the PHA in terms of reaching local communities, over 50,000 people use the facilities and their health and well-being projects. One of the most exciting developments in the past year had been the proposed development of a Health Village Centre for ARC HLC in Irvinestown and the PHA have provided non-recurrent investment to support the project. Accidents remain a major cause of attendance at Emergency Departments and in particular for older people. Through the WHEAP Project over 2000 people have been provided with information and resources. Furthermore work has commenced on developing a Falls Prevention Strategy for the Western area in partnership with the LCG. In addition to the local initiatives the Western team are also responsible for two major regional initiatives, the Lifeline Crisis Service and the rural isolation project MARA which have a combined budget of \u00a33.9 million pa. The Lifeline contract is not reported on in this review while the MARA Project is subject to a separate evaluation process. 5 In conclusion this gives a flavour of the activity for the past year. The success in delivery has been down to the commitment of staff and the willing collaboration of so many partners from our colleagues in the Trust, Local Government, other agencies and the community and voluntary sector. Despite the challenges, the health improvement agenda continues to be championed and opportunities for future development and innovation will continue to be exploited.

It is the major regional organisation in Northern Ireland for health improvement and health protection. Its purpose is: to protect public health and improve the health and social wellbeing of people in Northern Ireland; to reduce inequalities in health and social wellbeing through targeted, effective action; to build strong partnerships with individuals, communities and other key stakeholders to achieve tangible improvements in health and social wellbeing. The PHA was set up to provide a renewed and enhanced focus on public health and wellbeing by bringing together a wide range of public health functions under one organisation. It is also required to create better inter-sectoral working, including enhanced partnership arrangements with local government, to tackle the underlying causes of poor health and reduce health inequalities. There is five building blocks that underpin the Pu blic Health Agency's Strategy, they are: Building Blocks for a Happy Healthy Life 1.Give every child & young person the best start in life 2.Ensure a decent standard of living for all 3.Build sustainable communities 4.Make healthy choices easier 5.Ensure high quality care for all Under the overarching themes of the Public Health Agency falls the Investing for Health Strategy and Health Improvement agenda. 7 Addressing Health Inequalities Investing for Health was the first cross-departmental public health strategy, published back in 2002. It focuses on tackling the wide range of complex and inter-related factors that can impact on the health of the population. The Strategy is based upon the recognition that the inequalities, which exist in health between rich and poor are widening and argues that the wider determinants of health can be addressed by integrated interventions and a co- ordinated approach between all Sectors. In terms of local implementation the Western Investing for Health Partnership was developed in 2002, and consists of 30 member organisations, in pursuit of the aims of improving health and reducing inequalities with seven main objectives in mind: 1. To reduce poverty in families with children 2. To enable all people and young people in particular to develop their skills and attitudes 3. To promote mental health and emotional wellbeing 4. To offer everyone the opportunity to live and work in a healthy environment 5. To improve our neighbourhoods and wider environment 6. To reduce accidental deaths and injuries in the home, workplace and collisions on the road 7. To enable people to make healthier choices In addition there has been a major review of the strategy itself undertaken in early 2010 and work has began on the establishment of Investing for Health Two. New Public Health Framework The future development of the strategic context for public health addresses a 3- Pronged approach , including: The recommendations of the outcome of the Review of Investing for Health (2002- 2012) and this midterm review. Health Inequalities Agenda and the work that has been taken forward by the Public Health Agency, taking into account the findings of the Marmot Inequalities report in the UK. Review undertaken by the Northern Ireland Assembly's Health Care Committee into health inequalities . 8 The DHSSPS launched a draft consultation document 'Fit and Well - Changing Lives 2012- 22' in July 2012 and this document outlined the strategic drivers and policy direction for the next ten years. The final report is due for publication in Autumn 2013 and it will set the strategic direction for addressing health inequalities for the next ten years. 9 WESTERN HEALTH IMPROVEMENT DIVISION WESTERN INVESTING FOR HEALTH 10 Theme Investing for Health - Corporate Project City of Culture Access & Inclusion Project Strap -line Making the UK City of Culture an exciting and welcoming prospect for people with disabilities; our work will make a difference in 2013.

What happens in the early stages of life, and in particular before a child enters school, will impact signifi cantly on their growth and development throughout their school years and also their long term health, wellbeing and life chances. 13 This book helps by ensuring that parents have the right advice and support to help give their babies the best start in life in a meaningful and innovative way . We hope the children and parents treasure the book but more importantly use it to trigger a culture of reading within the home that will lead to learning and enrichment in the future\".

Aim To encourage individuals and their families/carers to engage with cycling as a pleasant past -time an d to improve the quality of life for people with physical disabilities. We hope to promote the cycle lanes as a mode of access to natural social integration with the services that exist along these routes. People with physical disabilities are marginaliz ed from services due to physical access issues, perceptions and lack of autonomy. We aim to increase inclusion and make physical disability more visible in the community and we hope to increase the confidence of our service users. A by -product of our pro ject will be the increased levels of physical activity of pilot -cyclists. Activity Our activity this year was primarily researching the availability of outdoor activities for people with the most complex types of physical disabilities. Identifying a gap in services and then generating the project idea and developing it into a reality. Following successful application for funding we purchased two accessible bikes. Output Two 'Velo' specialist bikes were purchased - the Velo Plus and the Velo O Pa ir. The Velo Plus accommodates a person in their own manual wheelchair and a pilot cyclist is required to operate the bike. The Velo O Pair accommodates a person who is able to transfer from their wheelchair or has low mobility. A pilot cyclist is requi red for this bike also. Both bikes can facilitate children as young as 4 and adults. There are restrictions for people who are excessively over weight. We have achieved partnership status with Shop Mobility Foyle who will generate membership cards and assist with delivering training for pilot cyclists. Shop Mobility Foyle will facilitate loaning of the bikes from their existing service in the Foyleside Shopping Centre. Storage of the bikes has been agreed with Derry City Council in their Templemore Sports Complex. We are in association with 'Far and Wild' who will provide pilot cyclists as and when required. We are also creatively thinking of future inclusive cycling activities that could be possible for service users. Promotional work is on -going to a dvise local community groups, social 18 services, schools and day care agencies of the existence of the bikes and the future plans for loaning the bikes. Outcome Momentum is gathering and there is a keen interest from individuals, families and agencies alike. Taster session/activity scheduled to take place in May. One person with a physical disability will participate in the City of Culture Event, the 'Wild Walls' cycle. The pilot cyclist will be provided by Far and Wild.

The concept of creating an outdoor activity that could be operated on a regular basis and not simply a one -off seemed remote. The fact that this idea has become a reality and we have acquired these amazing bikes is a great result for people with physical disabilities. Especially during this City of Culture year, it will ensure that more peopl e with physical disabilities can feel a part of the excitement and be included \".

Contact Details Patricia Flanagan Oak Healthy Living Centre , 44 Theme Investing for Health - Children & Young People Project Infant Mental Health: Family Adventure Walk Aim We want t o give every child in the WHSCT area the best start in life so we have developed five key messages to support parents and families as they nurture their growing child. They have the potential to affect a profound impact on the development of the child and can make a real difference to their contribution to society. These are: No smoking or drinking alcohol during pregnancy; Breastfeed your baby; Read a story to your child every day; Give your child lots of love, affection and praise and lastly Have fun and play with your child. The family adventure walks were a mechanism to bring families together, create meaningful experiences in an outdoor setting to have shared experience with other families, and raise awareness of the WHSCT Infant Mental Health messages and other support services available to families in their local area. Playing outdoors promotes health and wellbeing for children and allows them to be active, enjoying the setting. We hope by opening up these opportunities to children and families at an early age, we can promote and instil the value of our natural environment. \"A growing body of evidence has suggested that exposure to nature may directly benefit health. There is a strong body of evidence attributing health to physical activity, and recen t studies suggest that children who spend time outdoors are more active.\" Walking also provides many ways to boost emotional wellbeing through social connectedness and creating happy experiences. Activity The FAW were coordinated by colleagues working within Family Support Hubs, Surestart, Barnardos and Action for children. This affects 7 organisations working with disadvantaged families across WHSCT. Due to adverse weather conditions 3 of the 7 walks had to be cancelled but we were able to support 4 walks which were held the last 2 weeks of March 2013. Output Children: 158 Males: 63 Females: 95 Disadvantaged families: 45 BME (Black Minority Ethnic): 3 Rurality (those from rural areas or who are socially isolated): 94 45 Outcome Raised the parents' awareness of the benefits of engaging with their children in more outdoor activities and meeting other parents in similar situations.

Some families may never have the opportunity to engage in similar experiences due to a number of factors such as isolation, distance or other factors. Having the funds to organise a Family Adventure Walk for parents and children meant that we were able to provide new, enjoyable, stress free and educational experiences to parents and children and hopefully planted the seed in terms of the benefits of walking not only to the physical but also mental health of parent and child and given them the opportunity to s trengthen their relationships.\" Coordinator Family Support H ub 46 Photograph Contact Details Debbie Hunter Health Improvement Officer Western HSCT Health Improvement Department Maple Villa B Clooney Ro ad Derry/Londonderry BT47 6WJ 47 Theme Investing for Health - Adulthood Project Fuel Poverty - Neighbourhood Health Improvement Programme (NHIP) Aim The aim of the project is to provide information, relief and assistance to older and more vulnerable residents in the Neighbourhood Renewal Areas across Limavady, Derry and Strabane areas during winter.

Activity Neighbourhood Renewal Coordinator made contact with all the community groups across the NR area to make them aware of the project. Research from the previous year, when residents were asked which resources would help most, was used to prioritise the resources to purchase this year. Output Resources were sourced at best value with 3 quotes obtained from suppliers for each item listed.

Feedback from recipients was excellent. This year, community group members we re also asked to think of older or more vulnerable people in their community who do not come out to group sessions/are housebound. These people were visited by community members and offered the resources at home. This was also well received and ensured we reached the very hard to reach, but vulnerable community members who needed to keep warm and well over the Winter months. One local lady from the town centre who is housebound sent the community group a lovely card to thank them for the resources they brought to her door.

The project is in its initial stages of implementation. The Arts Care artist in residence, Patricia Crossey has conceived the project and created an innovat ive template of 2013 figures that join together to create an artwork that will be 1.2 kilometres in length. The artwork will be installed on a prime site in the city of Derry/Londonderry. The sculpture figures represent unity, connectivity, and togethern ess. The content that appears on the figures is a visual diary of each day of 2013 City of Culture using local papers and the Belfast Telegraph, which have been collected daily between 1st Jan 2013 -31st Dec 2013. Estimated installation of the finished scu lpture will be the end Jan 2014. The first group to take part and create a series of well -being sculptures has been a group of Arts in Health students from Florida University, USA who have been shadowing the work of Arts Care have been the first group to t ake part in the project. Other groups at this early stage of the process include participants living with the challenges of ill -mental health.

The Toolkit consists of two booklets, namely 'The True Spirit of Sport' and 'Building the Spirit of Sport'. 'The True Spirit of Sport', primarily aimed at sports players, outlines the negative impact of alcohol misuse on sporting performance and general health. It also explores the concept of athletic identify and how play ers should be supported during times of injury or under performance so that alcohol is not used as a coping mechanism. 'Building the Spirit of Sport', aimed at sports coaches and clubs, outlines the role that sports clubs can play in promoting positive approaches to alcohol in the community through the adoption of appropriate policies as well as the provision of alcohol awareness/education initiatives. Both the booklets provide contact details for alcohol support agencies. Activity 1000 copies of eac h booklet have been printed using money from PHA. These will be distributed to sports club and other community agencies throughout the WHSCT area. In order to build the profile of the Toolkit, Time2Change project in partnership with other agencies are de livering a series of Spirit of Sport seminars in the WHSCT area. The seminars will include high profile guest speakers speaking on the issues covered in the Toolkit as well as the relationship between alcohol, sport and community more generally. Output 1000 copies of each booklet produced Outcome These booklets will provide an invaluable resource to those concerned with the relationship between sport, alcohol and the community. They will increase the knowledge of those who use them regarding the dange rs of alcohol misuse, the importance of having a sensible approach to alcohol and how sporting/community groups can play a role in promoting a positive relationship with alcohol, both at an individual and wider community level.

Aim To provide support and build resilience and strengths in children and young people affected by parental drug or alcoh ol abuse. Activity Family support intervention provided to a total of 68 children affected by Hidden harm supported in the last year. We have run one \"Strengthening Families Programme\" (Oxford Brookes Model) with 7 families successfully completing the p rogramme. The Majority of children were supported for up to six months. Further support was provided by one member of the team directly supporting CAWT in the delivery of a further Strengthening Famil ies Programme in the Omagh area (Luthra Model) . Due to the often rural nature of the 21 electoral wards in the Omagh locality much of the work was delivered on an individual basis in either the family home or local community. The referral base spanned all professional sectors; gateway team, Education, health, community paediatrics and parental self -referrals'. Output Services delivered to 68 families. Outcome All children had individual assessments of need using Action for Children's \"Aspire\" assessment tool. The outcomes are directly linked to the six h igh level outcomes in \"Our Children and Young People, our pledge\" (OFMDFM 10 year strategy). Outcomes; 1. \"The Use of Harmful Substances By Parents or carers is reduced and concerns about neglect or abuse of a child are reduced.\" 2. \"The use of harmful Substan ces by a child or young person is reduced\" 3. \"Child or young person lives safely in family or family network\" 4. \"There is an improvement in a child or young person's emotional or mental wellbeing\" Overall statistics from our \"e -aspire system\" indicate that 78 % of cases achieved all or part of the selected outcomes as listed above, (Fully met 58% Met in Part 20%) 13% of cases remained open to our services beyond the remit of the funding, this includes follow up sessions to the 128 \"Strengthening families\" programme . Many of these families presented with multiple and complex difficulties and will require continuing support. The remaining 8% of cases had not met the selected outcomes at the end of the reporting period. Again these families will require on -going suppor t.

Early inte rvention Family support service 14 Darling Harm Project Strengthening Families Programme Strap -line Whole Family Intervention Aim The Strengthening Families Programme (SFP) is a 14-session, evidence - based parenting skills, children's life skills, and family life skills training program specifically designed for high -risk families. Parents and children participate in SFP, both separately in children/ teen and parent sessions and together in the family sessions. The programme emphasises the critical role of families in prevention and reducing risk to children. SFP builds on protective fact ors by improving family relationships, parental bonds, parenting skills and improving young people's social and life skills. It also reduces the risk factors for behavioural, emotional, academic and social problems and focuses on developing resilience, whi ch has been proven to mitigate against risk factors for children and families in Hidden Harm and other contexts. This programme is for all families and can be the most helpful for families experiencing a range of difficulties including behavioural, emoti onal, academic and social problems. Activity Delivery of 14 week family skills programme Output Since April 2011 Six programmes have run successfully in the WHSCT area, with a seventh currently in progress. 40 Families have graduated from the Stren gthening Families Programme to date. This is 175 people in total. 10 families (42 people) are currently engaged with the present programme and will graduate in September 2013. The current facilitators are from a range of agencies including Creggan Hub, Shantallow Hub, WELB, EXTERN, Opportunity Youth, DAISY and Lifestart. In February 2013 a programme ran for the first time on the Omagh area, with referrals and facilitators from a number of the local agencies such as Opportunity youth, DAISY, PSNI, ASCERT and Action for Children. Strengthening Families Programme training took place in Sep tember 2012, November 2012 and February 2013 with a further training booked for September 2013. To date 94 people from 45 different 130 agencies have been involved in training. Outcome SFP has been evaluated many times by independent researchers in randomized control trials or health services research with very positive results in reducing substance abuse and delinquency risk factors by improving family relationship s. Outcomes include increased family strengths and resilience and reduced risk factors for problem behaviours in high risk children, including behavioural problems, emotional, academic and social problems. Post Programme the levels of interventions requi red by agencies has been reduced. Families are able to solve problems by themselves as opposed to falling into crisis and less assistance is needed from supporting agencies. Increased communication of expectation from parents around behaviours and family rules. Teenagers are able to express their feelings more clearly and parents ability to listen and offer support improved. Families have reported increased time spent as a family, and increased family positive rituals. Families post programme repor ted regularly enjoy meal times together and talking as a family and parents have reported found increased marital support and communication, often with parents working together for solutions and providing leadership in families. Increased social rewards for children, for example thank -you, instead of financial rewards.

The message to the parents was always about the importance of their relationships and how the quality of those relationships can change behaviour, and we know that all higher level outcomes are based on positive relationships\" The programme allowed parents to gain insight t o their teens lives. By displaying teens posters it was a safe way for teens to share their experiences and feelings and parents weren't under pressure to say or do something straight away\" \"The programme has allowed the parents to exercise parental resp onsibility and seek appropriate help at a much earlier stage now. This is due to the teens improved ability to communicate and feel it's safe to share with their parents\". \"That child is 100 times safer now than she was before. Her long term outcome is m uch better, she is now asking her mammy to spend time with her\". \"It opened up areas for discussion not normally on the family agenda and offered the family the space to get alternative support when the programme ended\" \"This programme really is unique; i t is the whole family working together on issues\" \" The fact that it's the whole family approach is very important - it's fun as well as serious, it's intended in a holistic way to meet the families' needs\" \"Usin g role plays allowed them to tr y strategie s and to realise things weren't as hard to put in place\" \"Parents previously resisted change because it was easier to blame everything on their child, it was always his(the teens) fault and he lived up to that label\" \"Another strength is the multi -agency working. We had to find common ground in our way of working. The emphasis needed to be cooperation as opposed to sticking to familiar paths (comfort zone). It was interesting to see co -facilitators in a different role from how I would normally engage wit h them.

Activity To work with the local councils. To put in place initiatives to address the issue of fuel p overty locally. Output Omagh District Council provided and fitted reflective radiator panels in the homes of 60 older WHEAP clients and to the homes of older people identified through the Department for Social Development Affordable Warmth surveys which w ere carried out by the Council. The radiator panels were installed by a specialist contractor procured in accordance with the council's policies. This was the second year that this type of work was undertaken in the Omagh area. It was decided to undertak e the work due to the very positive feedback received from recipients in 2011/12. Follow up telephone surveys were conducted on completion of the works by the Council. Feedback was again very positive. A sample of properties were post inspected by the Hom e Assessment Officer, who had identified the proposed recipients. This was to ensure the quality of the work carried out. The post inspections highlighted that the work was carried out to a high standard which gave the council confidence that funding had b een used appropriately. Value for money was achieved. For some clients this work was carried out in conjunction with other insulation measures with both combined to make a considerable difference to their comfort and to a reduction in overall fuel costs. T he Home Assessment officer had also identified the other insulation measures for which people were eligible and had made referrals to the appropriate partner agencies. Additional summary information is provided below for the other council members of the WHEAP project Derry City Council reviewed existing fuel poverty initiatives within the council area to consider how a Fuel Stamps scheme would contribute to existing initiatives. It is planned to introduce a Fuel Stamps scheme. Limavady Borough Council, which had established a Fuel Stamps scheme in 2011/12 developed and marketed the scheme more wildly throughout the Borough. It targeted assistance to 400 families through the purchase of over \u00a325,000 of fuel stamps. 147 Strabane District Council introduced a pilot Fuel Stamps scheme targeted towards the smokeless zone areas of Strabane, Newtownstewart and Castlederg near the end of the financial year.

Highlight the risk factors for, and symptoms of, stress and depression. Help to reduce stigma by conveying the message that depression is an illness and not a sign of weakness. Provide information about treatments available and promote self help strategies for regaining and / or maintaining good mental health. Provide participants with relevant literature to reinforce learning and provide a future point of reference. Signpost participants to sources of support The aim of the Living Life to the Full Programme: CBT is a talking therapy which, research shows, is an effective treatment for low mood and mild to moderate depression/anxiety. It focuses on our thinking ( cognitive) and what we do (behaviour) as often when we are feeling low we tend to think and behave in unhelpful ways. Making changes in these areas, however, can help improve how we feel and also reduce some of the physical symptoms of low mood. Our Li fe Skills programme can make a big difference to your life! It can help you sleep better, feel happier, have more energy, gain confidence, get out more and enjoy better relationships . Activity 61 Mood Matters in Young people Programmes 10 Mood Matters in Adults Programmes 5 Living Life to the full programmes . Output Mood Matters focuses on positive mental health and aims to improve emotional resilience. This is our most popular presentation and is delivered mainly in secondary schools. However, be ing mindful that this information is important to all young people, we are increasingly delivering sessions in training schemes, youth clubs, sports clubs and other appropriate settings. Our training can be adapted to the needs of a particular group to en sure maximum benefit to participants. The presentation offered to 16/17 year olds includes a component dealing specifically with stress, as this is particularly relevant to students dealing with the pressure of A Level exams and the worries and concerns that may appear through the transitional period from school to university/college or work. 150 Participating schools are supplied with optional pre and post visit activities which may be delivered by teachers. Also, follow -up cards are distributed to all sc hools six months after our visit to reinforce learning and encourage continued self awareness. Information booklets are provided to all students, teachers and guardians as part of the programme. All our Mood Matters programmes are aimed at specific tar get groups and the content is regularly reviewed and revised in light of new research, best practice and experience of delivery. Research shows that depression is often a significant contributing factor in self -harm and suicide. Right now, 1 in 4 adults is experiencing depression, anxiety or stress and costing the UK economy \u00a326 billion each year. Living Life to the full programme Each week the course will cover the above topics and each participant will receive the above booklets.

Well above average in relation to young people in the community (Bamford Report 2006).The aim of the Looking After Number One strategy is to run a ten week/session programme throughout the trust focusing of specific themes that affect the mental health and emotional wellbeing of our young people. The overriding theme for the young people will be: Raise awareness of the importance of lookin g after your mental health. Highlight the risk factors for, and symptoms of, stress and depression. Provide information about treatments available and promote self help strategies for regaining and / or maintaining good mental health. Provide participants with relevant literature to reinforce learning and provide a future point of reference. Signpost participants to sources of support. Recruit and train young people to act as Safe TALK mentors and basic first aiders. Activity The programme was delive red using workshops, outdoor pursuits, Complementary therapies and art projects. Each week/session a guest speaker delivered a workshop on a particular subject, such as self harm, anxiety, etc. After a couple of weeks the group would do an outdoor activi ty or a complementary therapy. The programme finished in Derry with a healthy cook off and presentation of certificates. Output The Derry/Londonderry group has completed sessions on: Alcohol and drug awareness; depression; anxiety; stress; Self Harm and Suicide Prevention; Healthy Relationships; Exercise, Activity and Relaxation; Food is Good for Mood Outside Art project Cliff Jumping Emotional Health and Well Being. 155 Mind How you Cook (preparation of a healthy communal meal and presentation of certi ficates). Outcome The young people thoroughly enjoyed the programme. The Looked After Specialist Nurse described a marked improvement in the communication skills and confidence in one young person that participated in the programme. The young people al so asked for furth er programmes in first aid and SafeTALK . Two young people are exploring career options in Nursing and social care. Link to IFH To empower our young people with the skills, knowledge and confidence to: make informed choices on issues that affect their health and wellbeing; be aware of the symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, etc and how to access help; trained in S afeTALK and First Aid to help other young people. Link to Pillars Many of our Care Leavers go on to live in supported accommodation and shared properties with other young people \u2014some of which can be quite vulnerable. The long term aim of the Looking After Number One Mental Health Awareness Programme is to train up a large section of our young people to act as safeTALK m entors and emergency First Aiders. The training would ensure our own young people be aware of their own feelings and able to access help; but also to be aware of potential risks in other young people and to act in the event of a medical emergency, such as an overdose, self harm cuts or severe alcohol intoxication. Personal Comment \"The Participation And Lifeskills worker feels that the programme has been very successful for our young people. Initially, the SafeTALK programme was for two young people, but the another five young people asked to do the programme. Also the young people asked to be trained up in Emergency First Aid so that they can act in a medical emergency when their friends get into difficulties. One young person is seeking a career in Nu rsing and another young person is looking for a career in social care. Both saw the programme(s) as a good opportunity to add to their CV \". 156 Photograph Young Person receiving certificate for the Participation And Lifeskills (PAL) Project - Looked Afte r Children Project Organisation Contact Details Participation And Lifeskills (PAL) Project 16+ Pathway Team, WHSCT Robin Hill Road L'Derry BT47 2BG Tel: 7131 2044 157 Theme Mental Health Project Tyrone GAA Emotional Wellbeing Conference Aim Increase awareness of the support available to young people/ coaches/ mentors within Tyrone GAA of health and wellbeing issues.

Aim The project was aimed at exploring, with Young People the issue of Self Harm and the possible links to suicide, if any. Thi s project came from the production of a DVD and training manual on the effects of \"Cyber or Electronic Bullying\" produced last year. The aim of the projects was the production of a DVD which will act as a resource to help address the following issues: To take a helicopter view of the impact of suicide on Family and Friend (or those left behind) Deliver a clear message from Young survivors that there is help there and life is precious and worth fighting for... To make sure Young People and indeed adults know where to go and how to access support services. To ensure those bereaved by suicide know how and where to access help and support. To go some way in dispelling the stigma surrounding self -harm and suicide, without making it appear acceptable. Activity A group of eight Young People and six Adults engaged in a series of workshops which explored the issues of self -harm and the possible links to suicide as an outcome. It was decided very early on in the process by the Young People, that we needed to produc e something which highlights the devastating impact suicide has on those left behind, particularly the Family. It was felt that Young People today don't understand the finality or consequences of taking their own life, that it can be seen as \"having the l ast laugh\" on the bullies without any regard for what they themselves are going to miss out on, on the preciousness of their own lives and futures, or on the carnage they leave behind. Indeed, a permanent solution to a temporary problem. It was decided therefore that the group wanted to focus on this issue alone for two reasons. Firstly, self -harm and suicide are two very distinct and individual issues which cannot be grouped together. Not everyone who self -harms will go on to commit suicide. Secondly , the message needed to loud and needed to be routed in the impact on Families and Friends, it also needed to say, there is help and here i s how and where you can get it. The group decided that the best and most appropriate way to proceed would be to prod uce a documentary involving those \"Bereaved by Suicide\". It was also felt that we should talk to one or two Young 171 People who have been attempted or considered suicide as a solution to their problems but who have sought help and have been saved. These sto ries would be extremely powerful. Given the sensitive nature of what we were trying to address and the messages we wanted to put across we knew we needed a very experienced documentary producer involved. The interview process was successful and a producer was employed. The produced herself has spent years with Chanel 4 and the BBC producing some very sensitive documentaries which meant everything would be handled in the correct manner and with the greatest respect. The Young People continued to support th e producer, particularly in practical tasks including filming, sound and editing. Output A DVD production highlighting the seriousness of taking one's own life and how available help actually is in times of need. Highlighting to those bereaved by suici de the help and support available. Making it easier for Young People to talk about the issue of suicide without making it appear acceptable or a solution.

The rebranded name was the idea of the young people and reflects what happens in the Youth Centre. Our vision is to be a true community space and a hub for organisations. An ybody is welcome to come into the FIND Centre which is rich in resources and there is always a member of staff available to help out. Our community project (The HANGOUT) provides a safe and supportive social space for young people in the centre of Enniski llen. The HANGOUT is youth led and provides services to 11 - 18 year olds. Opening hours are Tuesday to Friday after school, Friday nights and Saturday afternoons. We have trained Youth Facilitators who engage with, build relationships and support vulner able young people. It is a no judgement, no criticism environment where young people come to chill out. In addition to The HANGOUT we run FIND (Fermanagh Information for Needs and Development) a One -Stop Shop that provides information, resources and supp ort for young people between the ages of 11 - 25. The HANGOUT removes the stigma of getting information and support as FIND is integrated within the space. Activity The Centre is a \"chill out\" space; activities include pool, air hockey, Xbox, full mu sic equipment, full PA system and a 6ft cinema screen. Young people find a sense of belonging and it is free to use by anyone from 11 - 18 years. Often young people present with challenging behaviour - but we have trained Youth Facilitators who are able to manage most situations. The majority of young people attend through word of mouth. FIND provides information on mental health, drugs, alcohol, sexual health, sexuality, legal, welfare, education and employment. Together they are a holistic service wi th informal daily listening and befriending, staff are fully trained in signposting and supporting referrals to relevant organisations such as Daisy, Breakthru, Lifeline, NIAMH etc. The Centre hosts a \"community space\" where not for profit groups can use the rooms of the Centre for free. Daisy use the Quiet Room for counselling as does NIAMH for ADHD Adult support. Fermanagh Women's Aid use the space and we have a number of cross border 250 projects.
