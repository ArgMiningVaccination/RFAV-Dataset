[ RSV ](https://apic.org/monthly_alerts/rsv/) Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a virus that infects the respiratory tract. RSV is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children under 1 year of age. Most children will have been infected with the virus by their second birthday. Humans are the only known source of RSV. [ Poliovirus: An Eliminated Disease Reemerged ](https://apic.org/monthly_alerts/poliovirus-an-eliminated-disease-reemerged/) Poliovirus causes poliomyelitis (most often referred to simply as \"polio\"), which is a disabling and potentially fatal viral illness only found in humans. Polio outbreaks used to be common throughout the world, but thanks to highly effective and safe vaccines developed in 1955, polio was eradicated in many countries. Like other vaccine-preventable diseases, polio cases can still occur when susceptible persons are exposed to the virus. In the United States and other countries where polio is no longer endemic, exposure is most often due to travel or possibly from vaccine-derived exposure related to inadequate sanitation practices. [ Group A Strep (GAS) and invasive GAS (iGAS): Dangerous Bacteria that May Lead to Life-Threatening Illness ](https://apic.org/monthly_alerts/group-a-strep-gas-and-invasive-gas-igas-dangerous-bacteria-that-may-lead-to-life-threatening-illness/) VGroup A Streptococcus is also known as Streptococcus pyogenes or \"group A strep (GAS).\"GAS bacteria are very contagious. This bacterium can affect anyone, because it spreads easily from person to person. The risk of spread is greatest when a person is ill, for example, with a strep throat or an infected wound. [ Adult Vaccination: You Never Outgrow Vaccines ](https://apic.org/monthly_alerts/adult-vaccination-you-never-outgrow-vaccines/) Vaccine-preventable diseases haven't gone away. The truth is that the viruses and bacteria that cause illness and death still exist and can be passed on to people who are not protected by vaccines. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID) recommend vaccinations from birth through adulthood to provide a lifetime of protection against many diseases and infections, such as influenza, pneumococcal disease, human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis A, and hepatitis B. Yet most adults are not vaccinated as recommended, leaving them needlessly vulnerable to illness, long-term suffering, and even death. [ Candida auris\u2014A new threat to patients ](https://apic.org/monthly_alerts/candida-auris-a-new-threat-to-patients-2/) Candida auris (C. auris) is a type of fungus that can cause severe infections that can be fatal.

Green grass peeks out through a blanket of snow. Colorful flowers begin to bloom on shrubs. You wake up each morning sneezing and with a stuffy nose. In past years, your first thought would be, \"It's probably allergies from the pollens and the dander.\" But now, you wonder, \"Could it be COVID-19?\" [ Herd immunity ](https://apic.org/monthly_alerts/herd-immunity/) Herd immunity (or community immunity) occurs when a high percentage of the community is immune to a disease (through vaccination and/or prior illness), making the spread of this disease from person to person unlikely. Even individuals not vaccinated (such as newborns and the immunocompromised) are offered some protection because the disease has little opportunity to spread within the community. [ Infection Prevention in Behavioral Health ](https://apic.org/monthly_alerts/infection-prevention-in-behavioral-health/) Behavioral health programs provide very important forms of healthcare. While behavioral health programs focus on mental health and wellbeing, certain characteristics of these settings may make it easier for germs to be transmitted that might make you sick. [ Don't Touch Your Face! ](https://apic.org/monthly_alerts/dont-touch-your-face/) To help prevent infections, keep your hands away from your eyes, nose, and mouth especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Why? These mucous membranes are a portal of entry for germs that cause respiratory infections, including COVID-19. [ Do you really need an antibiotic? ](https://apic.org/monthly_alerts/do-you-really-need-an-antibiotic/) Antibiotic resistance is one of the most urgent threats to the public's health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that each year in the United States, at least 2.8 million infections occur from bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics and at least 35,000 people die as a direct result of these infections. [ Preparing your facility for the flu season ](https://apic.org/monthly_alerts/preparing-your-facility-for-the-flu-season/) Influenza (\"the flu\") is a serious respiratory disease caused by influenza viruses that can cause mild to severe illness. Seasonal flu activity can begin as early as October and linger as late as May. During the 2017-2018 flu season, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that the flu was associated with nearly 49 million illnesses, more than 22 million medical visits, nearly one million hospitalizations, and nearly 80,000 deaths in the U.S. [ Removing water that doesn't belong ](https://apic.org/monthly_alerts/removing-water-that-doesnt-belong/) In May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) recorded the wettest 12-month period on record for the United States. While additional rain may be helpful for lawns, it can also mean battling water where it doesn't belong, which is known as water intrusion. An example of water intrusion could be a plumbing leak, roof leak, or even water entering a basement. When faced with water intrusion, follow these tips to reduce your risk of coming in contact with harmful organisms (germs) that could cause an infection. [ Staphylococcus aureus ](https://apic.org/monthly_alerts/staphylococcus-aureus/) Staphylococcus aureus or \"staph\" is a type of bacteria found on human skin, in the nose, armpit, groin, and other areas. While these germs don't always cause harm, they can make you sick under the right circumstances. S. aureus is the leading cause of skin and soft tissue infections, such as abscesses, boils, furuncles, and cellulitis (red, swollen, painful, warm skin). S. aureus germs can also cause more serious infections, such as pneumonia, bloodstream infections, endocarditis (infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and heart valves), and bone and joint infections. S. aureus is spread by touching infected blood or body fluids, most often by contaminated hands. [ Measles ](https://apic.org/monthly_alerts/measles/) Measles, also called rubeola, is a serious respiratory illness caused by the measles virus. It is a highly contagious virus that lives in the nose and throat mucus of an infected person. Measles can be spread even if the infected person is no longer in the room. The measles virus is spread through the air, or by direct contact, by infectious droplets. The infected droplets may also land on a surface, where they remain contagious for several hours. You can contract the virus by touching these surfaces and then putting your fingers in your mouth or nose or rubbing your eyes. The measles virus can remain in the air for up to two hours after a person with measles has occupied the area. [ Norovirus ](https://apic.org/monthly_alerts/norovirus/) Norovirus is a serious gastrointestinal illness that causes inflammation of the stomach and/or intestines. This inflammation leads to nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Norovirus is extremely contagious (easy to spread) from one person to another. Norovirus is not related to the flu (influenza), even though it is sometimes called the stomach flu. Anyone can get norovirus, and they can have the illness multiple times during their lifetime.

[ Chickenpox versus shingles\u2014What's the difference? ](https://apic.org/monthly_alerts/chickenpox-versus-shingles-whats-the-difference/) Did you know? The same virus that causes chickenpox also causes shingles. Although shingles and chickenpox are caused by the same virus, they are not the same illness. Chickenpox is usually a milder illness that affects children. Shingles results from a reactivation of the virus long after the chickenpox illness has disappeared. [ What is conjunctivitis? ](https://apic.org/monthly_alerts/what-is-conjunctivitis/) Conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye, occurs when the conjunctiva (the white part of the eyeball and the inner eye lid) is irritated by an infection or allergies. Conjunctivitis is highly contagious and can be caused by several different types of viruses and bacteria. It can occur with colds or symptoms of a respiratory infection, such as a sore throat. Wearing contact lenses that aren't cleaned properly, or aren't your own, can cause bacterial conjunctivitis. [ Vaccination saves lives ](https://apic.org/monthly_alerts/vaccination-saves-lives/) Vaccination is needed to protect us as individuals, family members, neighbors, classmates, and our communities. It also protects future generations by stopping the spread of disease.
