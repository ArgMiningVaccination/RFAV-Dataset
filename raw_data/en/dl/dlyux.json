It involves the insertion of fine needles through the skin at strategic points on the body. Acupuncturists steeped in the history of Traditional Chinese Medicine believe that an energy, life force or Qi, flows through the body in channels called meridians. It is believed that when Qi does not flow freely through these meridians it can cause illness in the body. Acupuncture can restore the flow of Qi and so restore health. It is being used for overall wellness, stress management and to treat pain. This treatment will include both Traditional Chinese Medicine Acupuncture as well as Facial Acupuncture. Facial acupuncture involves using acupuncture to improve the skin and fight the aging process. It works by stimulating the muscles of the face, using fine intradermal needles to increase tightness. As the needles puncture the skin, they create wounds, called positive microtraumas, within its threshold. When the body senses these wounds, it goes into repair mode. This will stimulate your lymphatic and circulatory system, which work together to deliver nutrients and oxygen to your skin cells, nourishing the skin from the inside out. It will also aid the production of natural collagen and thereby improve the overall quality of the skin. Organic, plant-based creams have been selected and ancient Chinese stones are used on the face for microcirculation of the blood and lymphatic drainage. During the treatment the therapist will also use an LED Light system. This system has been scientifically proven to accelerate cell renewal, boost collagen and increase the skin's elastin. This is a bespoke treatment combining both modern and ancient techniques to create the ultimate natural facial rejuvenation. Reiki is a Japanese form of energy healing. Reiki practitioners use a technique called palm healing or hands-on healing by which a universal energy or Qi is said to be transferred through the palms of the practitioner to the patient in order to encourage emotional or physical healing. A Reiki practitioner aims to change and balance the energy fields in and around the body to help heal on a physical, psychological, emotional and spiritual level. Our integrated energy healing therapy combines Reiki with crystal healing, chromotherapy or colour therapy, the use of sacred geometry symbols as well as chakra and aura balancing. The therapist will work on the main organs and meridians using these energy tools in combination with specific aromatherapy oils to unblock and balance energies. This is a deeply restorative, healing and transformative treatment. Integrated Energy Healing with Healy Device The Healy is a bio resonance tool that supports your body's energetic field, promotes cellular healing, and reinstates balance back into your emotional and energetic body. Through these resonant frequency waves the Healy is able to help people struggling with learning difficulties, inability to concentrate, stress, fatigue, chronic pain, arthritis, physical diseases/illness, recovery from injury, skin issues, emotional instability and mental health challenges. Kinesiology is a natural, non- invasive and enormously empowering therapy. Systematic Kinesiology finds imbalances in the body and uses a series of techniques to bring the body back into balance. It works on the mental, emotional, chemical, nutritional, physical, structural, energetic and electrical levels of the body. Testing the muscles shows us the energetic imbalances where health issues originate that need to be corrected. These imbalances are addressed using lymphatic massage, nutritional advice, electrically balancing the body and emotional work. Kinesiology for Nutrition supports the discovery of allergies, sensitivities, and the most ideal foods for that individual. Using it as a diagnostic tool it guides us towards ideal ingredients, food practices, and supplements for each individual's best interest. This \"Muscle Testing\" approach substantially increases the odds of a successful diet focused transformation. Reflexology is the application of pressure to areas on the feet or the hands. The theory behind reflexology is that areas of the foot or hand correspond to organs and systems of the body. The application of pressure on the feet or hands sends calming signals via the peripheral nervous system to the central nervous system bringing about a state of deep relaxation and healing to the corresponding areas of the body. When the body is in a state of deep relaxation the blood supply to the organs increases. This helps the body in stimulating its own healing processes and allows the system to achieve homeostasis or optimal functioning. Sound healing is a practice and healing tool that uses both audio tones and vibrational frequencies to repair damaged tissues, cells and DNA within the body as well as energetic and emotional healing. Conducted in a relaxed ceremonial setting, various instruments are played where the vibrational frequencies promote healing, a calm meditative state, happiness and vitality. Raising your vibrational frequencies can help to overcome sickness, disease, depression and stress which are outcomes experienced by people vibrating at lower frequencies. We have 7 major energy centres in our body known as chakras, which are responsible for our energetic, emotional, physical, psychological, mental and spiritual wellbeing. Balancing and unblocking the 7 chakras is a powerful way of bringing back harmony and healing to the body, mind and spirit. Your aura is the energy field that surrounds your body. It acts as a magnetic field of energy that picks up on emotions, health, psychic debris and circumstances around you. By regularly cleansing your auric field you can experience a drastic difference in the way you feel, returning your mind and body to peace. During a session cleansing oils, crystals and pendulums can be used to clear blockages and restore meridian energy flow. "}
