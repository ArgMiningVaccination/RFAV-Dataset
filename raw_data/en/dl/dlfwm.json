The process to revise and update the dietary guidelines is a multi-year step process that began in 2019 with the conduction of a situation analysis and a dietary modelling, followed by the formulation of key recommendations in 2020 and concluded with the development of FBDGs for Sri Lankans- Practitioner's handbook in 202, same year in which they were launched. The development process started with the planning of the revision process in which a formal request was submitted to FAO to support the process and a selection of consultants was conducted. After that, the FBDGs editorial committee and a multidisciplinary working group was created followed by the conduction of a situation analysis that included a technical review report and dietary modelling report. A series of consultative meetings with the working group were conducted to develop the FBDGs recommended messages, which were established by experts. The development of messages consisted of testing feasibility, comprehensibility, and acceptability of the recommendations, including the translation into creative and easy to understand by the general public and the validation of the recommendations. Implementation The Ministry of Health is responsible for the implementation of the FBDGs. There are dissemination, strategic marketing and communication plans endorsed by all the stakeholders involved. The sectors engaged in the implementation plan are education, agriculture, livestock, fisheries, trade, food industries, finance, development partners and civil society organizations. Evaluation There is an official monitoring and evaluation plan for the FBDGs, which plans to measure the performance of the FBDGs using analytic tools such as national surveys, Google ads and social media analytics, among others.
