The future of Medicine was since centuries appeared to rely on Naturopathic Medicine, Holistic Health and Wellness, and all studies related to natural elements that are non-toxic to humans; and was anticipated to dominate the health industry. Today, as the evolution of internet, free flow of information, and globalization have speeded up the global Health & Wellness Market exponentially, as the global wellness industry grew to $3.72 trillion in 2015, according to research released by the Global Wellness Institute. According to American Holistic Health Association, an individual is a whole made up of interdependent parts, which are the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual. When one part is not working at its best, it impacts all of the other parts of that person. Whereas, Andrew Taylor Still, MD, DO; the founder of osteopathy and osteopathic medicine, among his principles, he laid emphasis that the body is capable of selfregulation, self-Tenets healing, and health maintenance. The entire human body fully relies on specific natural substances that secure its proficiency to maintain its innate ability to self-maintain, self-protect, and self-heal. These natural substances are the body\u00e2??s essential fuels, and without the full presence of all these fuels altogether at the same time, the body system would start to collapse gradually. Can a brand new vehicle, whatever its price, model, or condition, be able to run without the right fuels; such as the engine oil, coolant water, brake oil, engine fuel, etc.? The American Osteopathic Association concluded; \u00e2??Osteopathic medicine focuses on the whole person, the relationship of the body\u00e2??s nerves, muscles, bones and organs, and the body\u00e2??s innate ability to heal itself.\u00e2? Thomas Edison, once said; \u00e2??The doctor of the future will give no medicine but will interest his patients in the care of the human frame, in diet and in the cause and prevention of disease.\u00e2? The human body is a marvelous machine that shall never be compared with any man-made machine that needs spare parts replacement. It does not at any means tolerate any foreign invaders, most especially any chemical substances made by the human himself. It carries its own system to distinguish any foreign bodies it encounters with, and destroys them instantly.
