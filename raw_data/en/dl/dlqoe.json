The word \"holistic\" is scattered across the internet, business storefronts, and packaging, but similar to the terms \"natural\" or \"grass-fed,\" its true meaning still eludes us. Consider this your guide to understanding the differences and cutting through the confusion between the modern Western approach and holistic medicine. Modern Western medicine, a.k.a. allopathic, conventional, mainstream, or bio-medicine, uses a research- and organ systems-based approach to diagnose and treat various specific medical conditions, often using pharmaceutical drugs, radiation, and surgery. In the modern Western system of medicine, it is common for patients to be referred to specialists\u2014immunologists, neurologists, endocrinologists, gastroenterologists\u2014whose expert knowledge of specific organs and body systems allows them to target treatment in those areas.

Holistic medicine focuses on bio-individual nutrition and lifestyle interventions, mental health support, social relationships, and environmental health in the prevention and treatment of health conditions. This approach tends to fall outside the paradigm of modern Western healthcare, as it involves whole body support and slow healing, with an emphasis on natural therapies. Holistic doctors and practitioners may use herbs, supplements, homeopathic medicine, acupuncture, manual medicine, neural retraining, biofeedback, and other traditional and modern therapies in addition to pharmaceuticals and surgery to treat their patients. The term \"holistic\" casts a wide net\u2014health philosophies and approaches to healing vary depending on the field or system of medicine, as well as the individual's education and personal experiences. Healthcare professionals include: There are many crossover healthcare professionals. One of the most well-known is osteopathic doctors (DO), who receive equivalent education to MDs but are trained in a more \"whole body\" approach. They use hands-on manipulation of the musculoskeletal system, among other therapies, to treat patients. Other holistic professionals may have first completed modern Western medical school and been subsequently educated in various forms of holistic medicine or holistic therapies. They may not practice within the modern Western medical model due to its constraints; in that case, their services are not typically covered by insurance.
