Although the mortality of contracting the SARS-CoV-2 virus is low, we still must remain cautious and make good, informed decisions. PREVENTION: Masking with a KN-95 or equivalent mask protects you from catching COVID-19 virus as well as decreasing the likelihood of passing it to others if you have it. Cloth masks are much less effective. When viral cases are moderate or high in our county, KN-95 masks are recommended for use in all indoor spaces. While masks are no longer required, protecting yourself by masking while you are indoors (in-person meetings/gatherings/classrooms), getting tested if you have symptoms, and getting vaccinated and boosted will help keep our Aggie community safe. VACCINES. Two shots and a booster were originally advised to prevent complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection including severe illness, the need for hospitalization and the risk of death. The current recommendations advise that Everyone 6 years and older should get 1 updated Bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, regardless of whether they've received any [original COVID-19 vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html#original-vaccines). Vaccines are available at the Alvin V. Blount Jr. Student Health Center Pharmacy. TESTING: The A.V. Blount Jr. Student Health Center is available for COVID-19 testing Monday-Friday 8 a.m. - 6 p.m. Persons who have been exposed but have no symptoms will be given tests to use at home with instructions for how to determine an infection. Those with symptoms will be tested at the A.V. Blount Jr. Student Health Center and then seen by a provider to determine the best course of treatment. ISOLATION - There is no designated isolation space on campus. There is very limited space for those who are negative for COVID-19 but have a roommate who is positive. - If you are a residential student, it is strongly recommended that you return home to complete your isolation period. - You may also choose to isolate in your residence hall room. You will need to mask around others for 10 days. You may only leave to obtain take-out meals and for medical care. - Email and questions or concerns [health@ncat.edu](mailto:health@ncat.edu) FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) - What does it mean if I have a positive COVID-19 PCR test? A positive PCR test indicates an infection has occurred in the past 90 days (about 3 months). - What does it mean if I have a positive rapid antigen test? A positive rapid antigen test indicates a new infection with contagiousness for others. - What does it mean if my rapid antigen test is positive, but my PCR is negative? The PCR test is the most accurate test. You are considered negative for SARS-CoV-2 - I have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by home test. What should I do? Wear a well-fitting mask and isolate yourself at home. Contact the Student Health Center at 336-334-7880 or by email at [health@ncat.edu](mailto:health@ncat.edu)to notify them of your positive test and if you have additional questions about the infection. - My co-worker/friend has tested positive for COVID, and we were together recently. What should I do? Wear a well-fitting mask (KN95) while around others. Report to the Student Health Center for testing IF you develop any symptoms - I have a non-urgent medical question. Who can I speak with? Email: [health@ncat.edu](mailto:health@ncat.edu)You will receive a response within 48 hours (about 2 days) from a health care professional If you have symptoms You may end isolation after day 5 if: - You are fever-free for 24 hours (without the use of fever-reducing medication) - Your symptoms are improving If you still have fever or your other symptoms have not improved, continue to isolate until they improve. If you had [moderate illness](https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/overview/clinical-spectrum/) (if you experienced shortness of breath or had difficulty breathing), or [severe illness](https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/overview/clinical-spectrum/) (you were hospitalized) due to COVID-19, or you have a weakened immune system, you need to isolate through day 10. If you had [severe illness](https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/overview/clinical-spectrum/) or have a weakened immune system, consult your doctor before ending isolation. Ending isolation without a viral test may not be an option for you. If you are unsure if your symptoms are moderate or severe or if you have a weakened immune system, talk to a healthcare provider for further guidance. Regardless of when you end isolation, avoid being around people who are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19 until at least day 11. Remember to wear a high-quality mask when indoors around others at home and in public and not go places where you are unable to wear a mask until you are able to discontinue masking (see below). For travel guidance, see CDC's [Travel webpage](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html#can-i-travel). Loss of taste and smell may persist for weeks or months after recovery and need not delay the end of isolation. Removing Your Mask After you have ended isolation, when you are feeling better (no fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and symptoms improving), - Wear your mask through day 10. OR - If you have access to antigen tests, you should consider using them. With two sequential negative tests 48 hours apart, or a single antigen test from the Student Health Center, you may remove your mask sooner than day 10. Note: If your antigen test results are positive, you may still be infectious. You should continue wearing a mask and wait at least 48 hours before taking another test. Continue taking antigen tests at least 48 hours apart until you have two sequential negative results or one from the SHC. This may mean you need to continue wearing a mask and testing beyond day 10.
