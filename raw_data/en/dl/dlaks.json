Healing Sessions: bodywork & coaching In these sessions I utilize the variety of skills developed in my thirteen years as a licensed massage therapist, my personal development studies, and my life coaching practice. This work is evaluative, nurturing and reflective. Many of the places we find ourselves stuck happen simultaneously in our body, mind and with our spirit. This work is intended to find and release tension in all three aspects; to then create understanding, flow, peace, compassion, and courage. My goal is to help you get comfortable being in your body, find solace in your deeper values, and discover peace with your unique and natural way of being. Transition Zone Guidance: spiritual development & transition support Transition Zones are those liminal spaces of events such as births, deaths, and more intentional transitions like mergers, seperations, moves, and elevations. The just before, just after, and the during of transformation. My offerings here include things like reiki and other energy work, general help and/or coaching, personal & group ceremonies to honor life openings, or happeings, or closings; guided internal spiritual journeys, and a host of other things that come up surrounding our spirit and soul development and work. My work with Transition Zones is about creating respect around natural experiences of being human and engaging change. Personal & Business: consulting & assistance Maybe you just need a little organizational push or temporary help with your business on an as-needed basis?

Spiritual Development & Support Experience At our core we all have the same needs. My job is to be non-judgementally present and help you or your family ascertain what is needed for maximum comfort and ease during someone's transition, and to craft meaningful ceremonies and/or celebrations unique to the person undergoing a big change. My decades long background in non-denominational spiritual practices as well as myriad classes, courses and books read pertaining to the human psyche and my coaching practice lend an openness and space for being authentically human and recognizing the gifts of our uniqueness.

Everyone has a story about their body and this narrative dictates how their healing journey will evolve. In my Massage and Bodywork Coaching sessions I work to illuminate aspects of my clients story so they can make adjustments to lifestyle and habits to live in their body with greater ease. In these sessions we will examine posture, alignment and physical habits to determine a set of exercises, stretches and small modifications to lifestyle you can make to decrease pain, stay in alignment and increase flexibility. We will discuss what brings you into the office, create goals for your body, and then I will tailor the remainder of your session of massage and bodywork in relation to your goals. The in-office bodywork may include massage therapy modalities, active isolated stretching, thai massage, cranial sacral unwinding, breathing exercises, guided meditations, etc. What you take with you is new knowledge and awareness of being in your body, relaxation through in-office bodywork and where necessary, notes or a video of stretches for you to do at home. Follow up sessions are recommended to see what is working for you and what needs adjustment. The goal of these sessions is to bring your body and mind into greater connection for ease in your life. Reiki Usui Reiki Ryoho When a person receives a Reiki treatment the Rei part of the energy assesses where the person has blocks and then directs the healing energy, usually to the block nearest the practitioner's hands. Reiki raises the vibratory level in and around the physical body by charging it with positive energy. This causes the negative energy to break apart and fall away, clearing and healing the energy pathways. A Reiki treatment typically ranges from 30 to 90 minutes and uses 10 to 15 traditional hand position. Many Reiki Practitioners utilize the Chakra energy system. During a Reiki session, the recipient remains fully clothed on the massage table, or in a comfortable chair and the practitioner can use a hands-on method or hold their hands above the person's body. The standard rate for a Reiki treatment is typically the same as the going rate for massage. Massage Therapy The focus of my massage practice for over a past decade has been on Medical-specific massage; honing in on specific areas of concern such as a trauma, frozen joint, repetitive motion injury, or rehabilitation from surgery or cancer. My goal is to provide opportunities for my clients to relax into their unique healing experience by introducing healthy and dynamic movements, and sensations to the body and mind. In this work I value being present, clear in intention and enabling communication as it creates a greater awareness for both client and practitioner, and allows me to adapt to the needs and preferences of each individual. I practice Non-Toxic Bodywork: using certified organic and fairly traded jojoba oil and shea butter. Massage products containing propylene glycol, isopropyl alcohol or petroleum by-products / toxic substances are not used. Products that have been tested on animals are not used. Some bleach cleaning products are used on linens in adherence with Universal Precautions for health and safety. My experience includes working with patients in pre-natal, birth and post-natal, forms of bursitis, sciatica, outlet syndromes, (including top-surgery), conditions of cancer and remission, diverticulitis, Rheumatoid, and other forms of arthritis, Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Parkinsons, Alzheimer's, Dementia, HIV, AIDS and COPD. I have also participated with clients in massage and/or reiki as a part of their end of life transition. Coherence Coaching: Emily B. Life Coach, Your Personal Change Agent I developed Coherence Coaching to help you unify your values and beliefs with your life and set goals in a logical and consistent way to serve the objectives of your greater purpose. As your personal change agent my aim is to help you discover where you want to go and find the most pleasantly efficient way for you to get there. My objective is your empowerment! Coaching serves people best when they desire change more than they desire to stay the same. Life Coaching isn't therapy and is not a replacement for professional mental therapy. It's meant to be encouraging, self-actualizing, and empowering through examination of your truths. A coach helps you grow by analyzing your current situation, helping you identify limiting beliefs and other potential challenges and obstacles you face, and devising a custom plan of action designed to help you achieve specific outcomes in your life. Having a baseline level of mental health and self inquiry means you can use coaching for its intended purpose, which is creating proactive steps to live the life you want, rather than, say, trying to figure out why you're so anxious, depressed, or self loathing all of the time. Coaches refer out to a therapist or specialist for serious issues like depression, addiction, chronic anxiety, childhood trauma, or self harm. To learn more about my style of life coaching, click [HERE](https://www.heat.center/coherence-coaching) Coherence Energy Healings (TM) These 30, 60 or 75 minute remote sessions include a variety of energetic healing techniques and tools that I've been cultivating for decades as well as new modalities that I've recently studied; I'm always learning more. I work multidimensionally with permission and energetic guidance from our resolved ancestors, guardians and spirit helpers. Some of the healing modalities and tools I may utilize in your session are: Usui Reiki Ryoho and advanced reiki techniques such as Karmic Clearing Chakra balancing, re-education, and coherence Removing malefic/harmful attachments & cords, executing wound repair, and promoting extended healing Psychic and/or medium message transfers Ushering (non-harmful) entities and stuck souls from your energy field to their next place or 'home'; psychopomp work Creating energetic filters and protective shields for your energy body Gathering fresh wisdom from oracle or medicine cards, and gemstones If I have questions about using a certain technique or whether the message I'm receiving is for you, I use a pendulum to ascertain the truth of the moment. This keeps our guides in the driver's seat and my ego on the sidelines. Just prior to our scheduled session time, I ask that you find some space that's quiet and comfortable. Feel free to play music. If you have a spiritual practice, feel free to engage it: some journaling before hand, a prayer or meditation, calling in guides and/or resolved ancestor helpers, or just some deep breathing and relaxation. If you feel you might have trouble relaxing beforehand, I can lead you through a short guided meditation over Zoom or over the phone - we would have to set this up about 15 minutes before the session. During these remote sessions I enter a meditative state and either astral-project-travel to your location to work with your astral body in a place sort-of-between-worlds or dimensions (the unseen realms), or I send specific types of healing to you. Sometimes our guides ask me to draw an oracle card or work with specific aspects of healing stones and send that energy and message to you. Coherence Energy Healings are structured as follows: 1.) A brief conversation (via phone, text or email, or using video technology such as ZOOM) to discuss any issues, goals or questions you may have. 2.) The bulk of the session: Reiki, Coherence Energy Healing, psychic transmissions. During this time, you are relaxing in a quiet place and tuning into what you are feeling. 3.) When the session is complete I compose an email with a vocal recording of my notes from that day's session, as well as photos of cards, etc., and send them to you. 4.) After all that I will email you an invoice for that day's session. 5.) I am available for follow up questions and concerns in the days and weeks after your session. A note about Remote Energy Healing Energy Healing can be shared remotely, which means that you need not be in the same room - or even the same country - as the practitioner. Energy work can also be sent backward and forward in time because this healing is not limited to a temporal construct. Sometimes I find remote energy sessions offer my clients more than regular reiki appointments in my HEAT Center treatment room. I certainly have more tools at my home office! Also, there is less distraction for me from responsibilities in the office and neighborhood goings on which allows the work to be as potent as possible. Remote sessions also offer my clients an opportunity to associate this healing work with their own environment, as well as not having to travel after receiving the work.

Intuitive Readings Using instinct, insight, a focused connection to the universal divine, and guidance from resolved ancestors and spirit helpers, I offer readings to discover hidden potentials in my client's lives. While shying away from forcasting anyone's future, my readings focus on insight that most of us would normally be able to tap into on our own in a more calm, stable and instinct-supportive culture & society. These are a bit like personal, passive ceremonies focused on your greatest well-being and outcome. In these Intuitive Readings I may utilize: Coherence Energy(TM) scan & potential healing Tarot and/or Medicine Card Reading Medicine Wheel Divination for advice on focus and timing Making a journey to the unseen realms to channel guidance Pendulum Dowsing is used throughout the reading for clarity ( so I don't get in the way of the messages meant for you ;) The structure of Intuitive Readings is very similar to Coherence Energy Healings except that they usually last two hours or more. Afterwards I type up an email with a vocal record my notes and pictures of the tools used in your reading, and send them to you. I am available to discuss what arose in the session with you over the phone or through a live online format (zoom or google meet) in the days and weeks following your reading. My Intuitive Readings are currently done remotely; they require uncompromising concentration, trust, surrender and safety for me to truly engage the work.

Reiki Re-Attunements These are for those previously attuned to reiki: reiki students and/or teachers Reiki Re-Attunement can help when one who has previously been attuned (a Reiki student) hasn't done Reiki healing for some period of time, or feels that they're less sensitive to reiki & other energies, or experiences feeling 'disconnected'. When these feelings arise for a reiki practitioner, a Reiki Re-Attunement for your corresponding Reiki Level can help to allow Universal energy to flow freely. Re-Attunements can also help heal conditions directly by using specific frequency Reiki symbols. They can also help with higher self unification, re-tune one's intuition, and strengthen one's connection to Universal guidance. Reiki Attunements are believed to be followed by 21-day cleansing process, during which physical, emotional, mental and spiritual healing is said to take place. The cleansing process is considered to occur due to Attunement to higher frequency energies during the Reiki Attunement. Ceremonies & Rituals Thess are individually priced as they are customized to meet the needs and focus of each occasion and person or group. Contact me directly through email or by phone, and visit the Ceremonies & Rituals page [HERE ](https://www.heat.center/ceremonies-rituals)for more info. I reserve the right to refuse anyone service at anytime for any reason in accordance with the United States Federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 with the addition of LGTBQ+ under N.Y. Exec. Law \u00a7 296(2)(a).. To clarify: I will not discriminate against clients based on gender identity or expression, sexual orientation or lack thereof, religion, race, age, national origin, status of citizenship, veteran status or if they are differently-abled. If a client is causing a disturbance, or is a health or safety hazard to other clients or practitioners, or is making other people in my shared office uncomfortable, then refusal of service is generally acceptable. **Notes on Healing What is Healing? Healing isn't an event, it is a change that takes place overtime in our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual landscape. We are all gifted with an ability to heal ourselves; our bodie's main objective is to maintain, or return to homeostasis. \"Healers\" do not heal you. They can assist in getting you to a place where healing can begin, they can continue to hold space and help facilitate your healing; they work in partnership with you for your healing. For much of your lifetime, YOU are your healer. It is your choice to be doing work outside of the healers sacred space to get you to your next level on your journey. With change the only true constant, bodywork, coaching and spirit work can help initiate getting un-stuck so that we can make more conscious choices for new paths on our life journey. It's a process, not a sprint ;) "}
