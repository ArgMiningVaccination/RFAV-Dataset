ESPRIT WELLNESS is your way forward. REVOLUTIONARY SCOLISMART SOLUTIONS Why do scoliosis patients, from across the country and around the world, travel to ScoliSMART Clinics - For access to \"a better way\". Over a decade ago we started out on a journey to find \"a better way\" to treat scoliosis, a way that focused on treating the condition itself, and not just the spinal curve, a way that produced no side effects or pain for the patient, a non-invasive way to train the brain how to learn to hold the spine in a straighter position, automatically, and a way to allow a child to still be a child, not a condition. Improve function and cosmetic appearance Eliminate the need for invasive hard bracing or surgery SCOLIOSIS SUCCESS STORIES 37% Initial Reduction Kaylee is a 14.4 year old female Risser IV with a primary thoracic scoliosis and right body shift of 2 inches. Initial response to 2 week BootCamp resulted in a 37% reduction of her scoliosis from 49\u00ba to 31\u00ba. She was prescribed daily home exercises consisting of a TorsoTrainer and a vestibular disc to ensure new muscle memory will be achieved. She will be evaluated in 3 months to determine the effectiveness of home care. Kaylee Scoliosis Treatment 34% Stable Correction Fifteen year old Kayla had primary lumbar scoliosis with a significant rotation Risser IV. The 14 month follow up demonstrates a 32\u00ba Cobb angle and a stable correction of 34% with de-rotation occurring, creating a very nice cosmetic improvement. Kayla Scoliosos Treatment Improved Body Shift Baili is a 13.5 year old female with severe primary thoracic scoliosis and postural deformity. Initial response to Scoliosis BootCamp exercise training was a 30% decrease to her spinal curvature, from 60\u00ba to 42\u00ba, and a 60% improvement with postural asymmetry taking her body shift from 4 inches to 1.5 inches. Stable muscle memory should occur within 3 months of the BootCamp with daily exercises, followed by another week of BootCamp where we will again aim to further reduce and stabilize her curvature.

He is friendly, warm, and supportive, with a visible interest in you getting better every step of the way. A visit never went by where many like minded individuals were out to this gem, Esprit Wellness Center, to straighten out their backs, where Dr. Sid did not give me as well as everybody else individualized attention to make sure everything was proper, be it the positions, the exercises, or otherwise. B. Haran Pain Treatment Dr. Sid is truly amazing! His techniques have helped me as well as dozens of others to relieve major back pain! Before seeing him, I was completely handicapped - literally - I could not do anything. I couldn't walk without pain, I couldn't get dressed, nor shower...I couldn't even get a good night's sleep. Todd PainTreatment I am so very thankful to Dr. Sid and his wonderful staff (Ruben and John) for the warmth and caring that is always shown to me throughout my ordeal. They have made me feel very comfortable and welcome. I am sincerely grateful to Dr. Sid for his gentility as he administers my treatments with such expertise. He is a truly amazing and an extremely skilled physician. I strongly recommend anyone having scoliosis, musculoskeletal problems, or just need to revitalize and energize his or her spine, to contact Dr. Sid's office. He is the best there is. He has changed my life with his therapeutic touch and his gentle yet strong healing hands.

RJ DeMarx Sports Medicine I can honestly say that after one treatment involving massage, ART treatment, and a traditional chiropractic realignment, my pain was reduced by 90%.
