Some evidence suggests that this alternative medicine can help relieve pain and may have some benefit for providing relief from painful complications of shingles. [Shingles](/articles/154912) is a viral infection resulting from the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which is the same virus that causes [chickenpox](/articles/239450). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about [1 out of every 3](https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/about/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fshingles%2Fabout%2Foverview.html) [Shingles pain](/articles/when-does-shingles-pain-peak) and other symptoms typically develop in stages over the course of the condition, which [usually lasts](/articles/can-you-cure-shingles-in-3-days) for 3-5 weeks. A [common complication](/articles/321198) of shingles is [postherpetic neuralgia (PHN)](/articles/160253), which is a severe, ongoing nerve pain that can last for [months or years](https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/about/complications.html) [10-18%](https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/surveillance.html) While there is currently no known cure for shingles, many [treatment options](/articles/shingles-treatment) are available. Although [acupuncture](/articles/156488) may remain controversial among some Western medical doctors and scientists, studies suggest that it can help relieve pain, such as discomfort from shingles. In this article, we will discuss what acupuncture is, and the effectiveness of acupuncture and other treatment options for shingles. [Acupuncture](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/acupuncture-in-depth) [traditional Chinese medicine](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/traditional-chinese-medicine-what-you-need-to-know) [meridians](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/acupuncture), on a person's body. Proponents [suggest](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/acupuncture-pdq) Those who practice acupuncture [state](https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/therapies/acupuncture) that pain and other disease symptoms occur when the network of qi channels stagnate. Therefore, acupuncturists gently use the needles to improve the flow and balance of a person's qi to help relieve symptoms. Some [evidence](https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/relieving-pain-with-acupuncture) suggests that it can help to relieve nerve pain, such as painful shingles rashes. While scientists still do not fully understand how acupuncture may work, some [research](https://medlineplus.gov/acupuncture.html) indicates that it may aid in the release of natural pain-relieving chemicals, help regulate blood pressure and flow, and reduce inflammation. Organizations that promote the benefits of acupuncture [suggest](https://medicalacupuncture.org/for-patients/health-conditions/) that it can help provide pain relief. The [British Acupuncture Council](https://acupuncture.org.uk/about-acupuncture/_fact-sheets/herpes-2/) states that while more research is necessary, acupuncture may help to relieve painful symptoms of shingles. A [2019 systematic review and meta-analysis](https://www.dovepress.com/is-acupuncture-an-effective-postherpetic-neuralgia-treatment-a-systema-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-JPR) reports that acupuncture may reduce pain intensity, relieve anxiety, and improve the quality of life in people who have PHN. This is consistent with a [2018 systematic review and meta-analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC6113033/) Current evidence [suggests](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/acupuncture-in-depth) According to the [National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/acupuncture-in-depth) A 2017 [case report](https://www.jabfm.org/content/30/4/552.long) notes an example of an individual developing shingles after receiving acupuncture in the ear for back pain treatment. However, the paper could not attribute the shingles case to acupuncture. While it may be possible that the auricular acupuncture triggered the shingles flare, it is more likely unrelated or an extremely rare event. Some other treatment options for shingles may include: Antiviral medicines A doctor may prescribe [antiviral medications](/articles/321198#treatment) to shingles, such as: [acyclovir](/articles/322401)(Zovirax) - famciclovir (Famvir) [valacyclovir](/articles/valacyclovir#_noHeaderPrefixedContent)(Valtrex) Antivirals may shorten the length and severity of shingles. Antiviral medicines are most effective when a person starts them within [72 hours](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/a-z/shingles-self-care) after the shingles rash appears. Shingles vaccination The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/shingles/public/shingrix/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fvpd%2Fshingles%2Fpublic%2Findex.html) [Shingrix](/articles/326241). A pharmacist or doctor gives a person two doses of the vaccine 2-6 months apart. Although it is not a treatment, Shingrix offers powerful protection against shingles and PHN. [Click here to learn more about the shingles vaccine](/articles/shingles-vaccine-after-shingles-attack). Pain medicine A person may take over-the-counter (OTC) pain medicines to help relieve pain due to shingles. For example, people may consider using [capsaicin creams](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Hope-Through-Research/Shingles-Hope-Through-Research) A doctor may also compresses, soaks, and calamine lotion A person can apply a clean, damp, and cool washcloth to their rash several times a day for [5-10 minutes](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/a-z/shingles-self-care) each time. Alternatively, people can also try bathing in cool water with added baking soda, uncooked oatmeal, or [colloidal oatmeal](/articles/oatmeal-benefits-for-the-skin). Individuals may also consider using [calamine lotion](/articles/calamine-lotion-uses) as it may provide a soothing and cooling effect on the skin. A person can gently apply the lotion after the shingles blisters have scabbed over. Stress management Handling stress in [healthy ways](/articles/145855) may help a person with their shingles pain. Suggestions include: - getting plenty of sleep - staying physically active - reducing or avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and other recreational drugs - practicing relaxation techniques - trying yoga or tai chi - talking to friends and loved ones - doing activities that help take a person's mind off the pain, such as reading books, listening to music, engaging in hobbies, or learning something new Essential oils While more research is necessary, some people may consider essential oils, such as peppermint, thyme, and lemon, to ease pain and itchiness associated with shingles. However, some people may experience reactions to these oils, such as skin irritation. A person should always talk with their doctor before applying essential oils to their shingles rash. Additionally, people should dilute essential oils in a carrier oil before applying them to the skin. A person with symptoms of shingles should contact their doctor as soon as possible to discuss treatment options. If they experience ongoing painful symptoms, such as PHN, they can ask their doctor about pain relief options, such as acupuncture. If acupuncture does not relieve shingles pain or makes it worse, it is advisable for a person to stop acupuncture treatment and contact their doctor for alternative options. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that practitioners may use to treat chronic pain conditions. As such, people may consider it as an option to relieve painful symptoms of shingles. While it may provide some relief, more research is necessary to determine its effectiveness. Shingles pain can be severe and disrupt a person's overall well-being. Along with acupuncture, other treatment options for shingles pain can include antivirals, pain medication, cool compresses, and the shingles vaccine. "}
