Aromatherapy uses aromatic essential oils to improve the health of the body, mind and spirit. Humans have used aromatherapy for thousands of years. Ancient cultures in China, India, Egypt, and elsewhere incorporated aromatic plant components in resins, balms, and oils. These natural substances were used for medical and religious purposes. They were known to have both physical and psychological benefits (1). The essential oils are extracted from plants, flowers, barks, leaves or fruit by steaming or pressing various parts of the material to capture the essence or compounds that produce the scent. How do essential oils work? Recently, the use of pure essential oils has gained popularity as a result of renewed interest in aromatherapy. Essential oils are being promoted in body-care products, medicinal mixtures, beauty products and to enhance one's personal environment, home and everyday life. Aromatherapy works through the sense of smell and skin absorption using products such as diffusers, aromatic spritzers or misters, inhalers, bathing salts, body oils and creams, massage oils, facial steamers, hot and cold compress and perfumes (2). \"When inhaled, the scent molecules in essential oils travel from the olfactory nerves directly to the brain and especially impact the amygdala, the emotional center of the brain.\" says Harpreet Gujral, program director of integrative medicine at [Sibley Memorial Hospital ](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/sibley-memorial-hospital/index.html) Essential oils can also be absorbed through the skin when applied with a carrier oil. Some essential oils are quite potent and can cause irritation if not used properly. Please make sure you are doing some research before making your own essential oil products at home. Pro Tip: The pores found on the bottoms of our feet are particularly absorbent and can pull the essential oils into our blood stream quicker than any other part of the body! Some studies show that after an essential oil has been applied to the soles of the feet, traces are found in the blood stream just 20 minutes after applying. (3) Applying some lavender oil on the soles of your feet just before getting into bed can help you relax and ease you into sleep. Benefits and uses? There are over hundreds of different essential oils and they all carry different health benefits and purposes. Each oil is unique and they all have the potential to support the body with an array of issues.
