These signals must be correctly interpreted by our central nervous system so we can execute the correct movement of our musculoskeletal system and maintain our center of gravity. If one or more of these systems are impaired, we may experience loss of balance. The primary organ of equilibrium in the body is the vestibular system, or inner ear. The vestibular system is responsible for spatial orientation and head movement and dizziness originates in the inner ear in 85% of cases. Evaluation at the [Balance Disorders Clinic](/main/balance-disorders-clinic.aspx) will help determine the cause of your dizziness, vertigo, or imbalance to guide you to the right plan of care. "}
