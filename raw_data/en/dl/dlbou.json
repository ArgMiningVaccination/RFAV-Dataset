Inequities are also pronounced, with disparities in child health outcomes across socioeconomic groups, by ethnicity, geographic location, and educa - tional level of mothers. There has been a steady improvement in immunization coverage since 2010. Accord - ing to the latest available WHO-UNICEF estimates, immunization coverage rates in - creased for DTP3 from 74 percent in 2010 to 82 percent in 2016; and the coverage of single measles vaccination at nine months increased from 64 percent in 2010 to 76 percent in 2016. However, wide inequities remain in im - munization coverage across economic, urban-rural, geographic, and ethnic di - mensions. The immunization coverage for the poor is less than one-half that of the richest income group (MoH and Lao Sta - tistics Bureau, 2012). There is a high drop - out rate for immunization, especially in rural areas with predominantly ethnic minority populations. Coverage of routine immunizations1 ranges from a low of 21.1 percent in Phongsaly province to a high of 79.0 percent in Xayabury province. Spending on routine immunization in Lao DPR has increased considerably from less than US$4.3 million in 2010 to US$24.8 million in 2016 and is expected to increase further as the country expands coverage and introduces new vaccines (HPV and ro - tavirus). To date, the increased spending has largely been made possible due to fund - ing from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which supported more than half (52 percent) of financing for new and underused vaccines in the country between 2010 and 2014, and also is providing support for health systems strengthening (HSS). However, in 2017, Lao PDR entered the final phase of Gavi sup - port, known as the Accelerated Transition, and will fully transition from Gavi support in 20222. Thus, the share and scope of domes - tically financed immunization expenditure will need to increase significantly over the next five years. As in many other countries, priority pro - grams such as the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) have set up their own structures and program functions to ensure coverage and quality of services in a con - text of health system weaknesses. While such earmarked structures may be neces - sary at the introduction of a new program and when the general health systems are less then optimally developed, such struc - tures are justified only for specific purposes. For example, campaigns to increase cov -Key Messages 1 BCG, Polio (1/2/3), DTP, HepB, HiB, Measles (one dose). 2 Countries enter the final phase of Gavi support once they have exceeded a GNI per capita of US$1,580 on average over the previous three years. 3 LAO PDR: T oward Sustainable Financing for Immunization Coverageerage of Polio or Measles vaccination are necessary to ensure high enough coverage to protect the population from public health outbreaks, but other program functions such as M&E, Financial Management and Supervi - sion, when set up separately, lead to ineffi - ciencies and duplications and create parallel systems for financing and service delivery over the long term. As Lao PDR prepares to transition from Least Developed Country (LDC) status by 2020 to become an upper-middle-income country by 2030, it also expects to face declining external financing more generally, and from bilateral donors in particular. At the same time, the country is trying to move toward covering the entire population with a basic package of health services. Thus, the need to increase domestic financing for health, which has historically been low, will become particularly important. Specifically on im - munization, Lao PDR has begun the process of transitioning from Gavi support. From an external financing perspective, a major chal - lenge for Lao PDR is to continue expanding the content and service coverage for key health programs such as immunization that have been traditionally financed externally while maintaining quality and coverage. A managed transition is vital for financial and programmatic sustainability as external funding reduces. Mainstreaming of vertical program structures into one coordinated health system would reduce the duplica - tion of program elements such as program management, outreach, supply chain man - agement, financial flow, supervision and management information systems, thereby increasing efficiency and sustainability. Ensure adequate and sustainable financing for immunization within the context of sustainable financing for UHC. Increase efficiencies by mainstreaming the separate EPI structures (likewise also for any other vertically managed programs) such as: (i) integrate EPI data as part of the national Health Information Management System (DHIS2); (ii) harmonize financial flow and management reporting and align it with the gov - ernment's financial management information system; (iii) mainstream supply chain management; (iv) implement fully integrated outreach steadily through integration/mainstreaming of EPI and MCH services; and (v) merge existing supervisory guidelines for MCH and EPI and provide integrated supervision in order to eliminate unnecessary duplication and increase efficiency. Improve coverage and increase equity of access to basic services such as immu - nization, through: (i) focused support (financial and technical) to districts with less than average service coverage; (ii) ensure adequate MCH home records at every service delivery level to cover the annual cohort of children to be immu - nized; (iii) conduct operations research to identify the most effective and effi - cient mix of facility-based and outreach services; and (iv) undertake a study to understand basic demand-side service constraints.In moving forward, several possibilities to streamline and sustain the immunization pro - gram in relation to strengthening the overall health system were identified through this immunization assessment and are recommended as priority areas for action both at sys - tem and program levels: 5 LAO PDR: T oward Sustainable Financing for Immunization CoverageThis brief draws from the World Bank re - port, Managing Transitions: Reaching the Vulnerable while Pursuing UHC in Lao PDR (World Bank, 2017b) which includes an in-depth assessment of the immuniza - tion program. The diagnostic assessment protocol identified critical constraints and opportunities facing the health financing system in the context of UHC. The over -arching objective of the report is to in - form the development of short-term and longer-term health financing strategies and reforms aimed at sustaining progress towards UHC. This policy brief aims to iden - tify key bottlenecks for service delivery and sustainability challenges of essential health services using immunization services as a tracer.Objective of the Policy Brief 6 LAO PDR: T oward Sustainable Financing for Immunization CoverageBackground Lao PDR has enjoyed robust economic growth supported by the resource sector and continued domestic and foreign direct investment in recent years. By 2011, the country had reached the status of a lower- middle-income country. GNI per capita and GDP per capita have continued to increase and reached US$2,353 and US$2,150 re - spectively as of 2016. Strong economic growth has been accompanied by a signifi - cant decline in poverty rates. The national poverty rate declined from 33.5 percent in 2002 to 23.2 percent in 2012. The country is making good progress toward attaining the Eighth National Socio-Economic Devel - opment Plan (NSEDP) outcomes to ensure Lao PDR graduates from Least Developed Country status by 2020. The country is also addressing the unfinished agenda of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and delivering early progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including UHC. Between 2000 and 2015, Lao PDR re - corded a significant decline in infant and under-five mortality rates. The infant mortality rate decreased from 83 in 2000 to 51 in 2015, while the child (under-five) mortality rate dropped from 118 to 67. Sub - stantial progress has been made in the re - duction of vaccine-preventable diseases. The share in the disease burden of, for ex - ample, Measles, Tetanus, and Whooping Cough, decreased from 9.60 percent, 2.72 percent, and 0.97 percent to 0.24 percent, 0.10 percent, and 0.54 percent respectively between 1990 and 2016. Measles fell from rank 3 in causes of death and disability to rank 74; Tetanus from rank 8 to rank 99; and Whooping Cough from rank 18 to rank 34. Despite these improvements, the coun - try has the highest child mortality level in Southeast Asia and the national av - erage conceals high levels of disparities in child mortality across socioeconomic groups, by ethnicity, provinces, and edu - cational level of mothers. Each year, an estimated 16,000 children die in Lao PDR before reaching their fifth birthday. The majority of these deaths occur among the poor and disadvantaged populations and are due to just a few preventable and treat - able conditions. There is thus a need to un - derstand the causes of unjust disparities and urgently tackle the barriers to equity of access to basic health services. 7 LAO PDR: T oward Sustainable Financing for Immunization CoverageImmunization Coverage antigens (Pentavalent, PCV, IPV, MR, JE, Seasonal Influenza campaign, and HPV demo). Furthermore, the introduction of HPV and rotavirus vaccine is currently be - ing planned for 2018/19 by the National Immunization Program (NIP). While this will address the high disease burden, the affordability and challenges must also be considered. Additional vaccines will present a challenge due to the lengthy vaccination schedule, issues in supply-chain manage - ment, more diversified target population, potentially higher reluctance against vacci -nation (due to multi-injections per visit), and the higher cost of both vaccines and service delivery. There has been a steady improvement in immunization coverage since 2010 but coverage still lies below that of countries at similar income levels. According to the latest available data (WHO and UNICEF, 2017a), immunization coverage rates in - creased steadily for DTP3 from 74 percent in 2010 to 82 percent in 2016; and for mea - sles from 64 percent in 2010 to 76 percent in 2016 (Figure 1). However, compared to other countries at similar income levels, coverage is much lower. Source: Reproduced from World Bank 2017a (based on, WHO and UNICEF, 2017). Note: x axis in log scale.Figure 1: Measles Immunization Coverage (2010 versus 2016)8 LAO PDR: T oward Sustainable Financing for Immunization CoverageEconomic, urban-rural, geographic and ethnicity-related inequalities in immuni - zation coverage rates are widespread. The wide differences apply to income groups where the immunization coverage for the poor is less than one-half that of the rich - est income group (MoH and Lao Statistics Bureau, 2012). There is a high dropout rate of children who do not complete the full vac - cination schedule, especially in rural areas with predominantly ethnic minority popu - lations. There are also wide differences be - tween provinces in immunization coverage. The coverage rate ranges from 21.1 percent in Phongsaly province to a high of 79.0 per - cent in Xayabury province (Figure 2). Source: MoH and Lao Statistics Bureau, 2012. Note: Xaysombourn was only established as a separate province in November 2013; EPI data from the area now covered under Xaysombourn is included above under Vientiane and Xiengkhuang provinces. Figure 2: Routine Immunization Coverage by Province (2011-12) (%) Accurate reporting of immunization cover - age is a challenge in Laos and there is wide variability across data sources. Survey data from the 2015 National Immunization Survey shows that, of the 5,981 children between 12 and 23 months surveyed, 91 percent had received at least one routine vaccination, but only 29.7 percent of these children had valid documentation for their immunization. Based on evidence from all sources (home-based vaccination cards, health facility records and caretaker recall), the coverage was 81.4 percent for the third dose of Pentavalent vaccine (including DTP/ HepB/HiB), while 63 percent were fully im - munized with the required antigens for that age-group and 9 percent had not received any vaccination. 9 LAO PDR: T oward Sustainable Financing for Immunization CoverageImmunization Service Delivery Immunization services are provided at all health service levels-at provincial and dis - trict hospitals as well as health centers, through a mix of fixed site and outreach ser - vices that depend on the distance of the com - munity from a health facility. Facility-based immunization services are provided to vil - lages located 5 km or less from a facility and are part of the integrated MCH ser - vices, which means that immunization services are delivered at the same time as other interventions. Villages further from the health center (5-10 kilometers or more than one hour) are provided immunization through outreach services that are provid - ed by health center staff once every three months. Immunization outreach services account for about 58 percent of the first and 86 percent of the second measles vac - cine. Due to the geography of the country, a large number of villages can only be reached through outreach and, in several cases, health staff have to walk to the villages and stay overnight in order to cover all children within the target area. This is especially problematic for health centers that do not have a functioning cold chain since the staff first have to travel to the district health of - fice to collect the vaccines and then to vil - lages which may be a full day's travel from the health center. On return, they again have to travel to the district heath office to return unused vaccines which have by then been kept in a cold box for two to three days. This places an additional time constraint on the already limited number of staff avail - able at the health centers. While immunization outreach has often been provided as a vertical service, efforts have increased to provide additional MCH, family planning and nutrition services dur - ing such outreach. Such integrated out- reach for provision of a package of multiple health services including immunization is currently being rolled out. The full package of services now includes ANC, PNC, family planning and child-growth monitoring, in addition to (i) immunization for all children aged under two years; (ii) Tetanus Toxoid immunization for women aged 15-45; (iii) iron-folic acid tablets for pregnant women and postpartum women; (iv) deworming and Vitamin A supplementation twice per year; and (v) health education. Growth mon - itoring and promotion is added for facilities with sufficient number of health staff and capacities. 10 LAO PDR: T oward Sustainable Financing for Immunization CoverageBottlenecks to Improving Outreach Service Delivery 3 MoH, 2014. Laos Service Availability and Readiness Survey 2014. 4 The study was carried out in collaboration with the Swiss Red Cross in the rural districts of Luang Prabang province and collected information on the influence of a number of family factors, including whether fami - lies owned a yellow card.A rapid field assessment conducted by the World Bank highlighted key bottlenecks re - lated to mainstreaming immunization out - reach both at system and program levels. The main findings from the rapid assess - ment include: limited understanding of the guidelines for microplanning of integrated MCH and immunization services; different incentives for conducting outreach for im - munization and MCH; and considerable var - iations in how these payments are managed across provinces and districts. These findings support other studies in Lao PDR indicating poor service delivery readi - ness. According to one survey,3 99 percent of the facilities surveyed were providing routine immunization, but only 49 percent had the required medicines and supplies available for immunization and no facilities fulfilled all requirements (staff and guide - lines, equipment, medicines and commodi - ties) for immunization. A small study (Mobasser et al., 2016)4 found that outcome measures of immunization (and growth monitoring) were significantly predicted by distance to the nearest health center or hospital, mothers' contact with health professionals (both antenatal and during childbirth), and ethnic group mem - bership. The strongest individual predictor was, however, the possession of the immu - nization card, which is often found to be out of stock at the health facility level.A UNICEF-supported equity and bottleneck analysis carried out in 2013 and 2014 found that the \"bottlenecks to equity of service access\" ranged from purely economic issues to psychological and faith-based barriers in both the demand and supply of services. The factors contributing to vaccination re - sistance included: local culture of not using modern medicine; fear of side-effects; no knowledge about the benefits of immuni - zation; being away from home during the agricultural season; and not being informed or being informed too late about immuniza - tion activities. Deeper insights into the is - sues confronting underserved populations requires qualitative research as a tool to expose and share with others the undercur - rents of not just the health-seeking behav - ior of communities but also the health pro - viders' cross-cultural communication skills. 11 LAO PDR: T oward Sustainable Financing for Immunization CoverageImmunization Financing in Lao PDR Figure 3: Overall Expenditure for Routine Immunization (2006-16)Overall spending on routine immunization has increased significantly from less than US$5 million annually in the 2007-13 pe - riod to US$24.8 million in 2016 (Figure 3). This corresponds to 12.4 percent of total government expenditure on health in 2016, while the actual government immunization spending share was 5.2 percent of total government expenditure on health. The cost of vaccines (US$11.4 million) accounted for 45 percent of total expenditure on routine immunization in 2016. Source: WHO and UNICEF, 2017b. The most important feature is the remark - able increase in expenditure since 2014 compared to the preceding years, both in terms of total immunization expenditure and in expenditure financed domestically. Between 37 and 48 percent of the total im - munization expenditure was financed by the Government of Lao PDR (GoL) during 2014- 16 (up from an average of around 7 percent in earlier years). Within the total expendi -ture, the spending on vaccines itself has in - creased more than fourfold between 2013 and 2016, mostly due to the introduction of new vaccines (such as the Pneumococcal vaccine in June 2014). The share of expendi - ture on vaccines financed domestically also went up, showing an increase from under 10 percent in previous years to 12, 23 and 24 percent in 2014, 2015, and 2016 respec - tively. 12 LAO PDR: T oward Sustainable Financing for Immunization CoverageThe immunization program has been largely dependent on funding from exter - nal sources accounting for 76 percent of the total spending on immunization in Lao PDR over the period 2010-14. The largest share of this (22 percent of total spending between 2010 and 2014 and 29 percent of external spending) was provided by Gavi. Other development partners include US CDC, UNICEF and WHO. For the 2016-20 period, the World Bank, in partnership with the Government of Australia and ADB will provide additional resources which can be used for operational costs. Spending is ex - pected to increase further in coming years, driven mainly by the higher share in domes - tically financed vaccine procurement, the increased routine operational costs due to the expansion of coverage and services in remote areas and for underserved popula - tions, and the additional two new vaccines planned from 2018/19. The GoL now pays for vaccines, injection supplies, personnel salaries, transporta - tion, maintenance and overheads, and program management. The GoL began fi - nancing vaccines in 2012, and it has rapidly increased its vaccine financing share (tra - ditional and cofinancing of new Gavi-sup - ported vaccines) from about US$125,000 in 2012 to over US$1.1 million in 2015-16 (Gavi Vaccine Alliance, 2015). Vaccines were pro - cured with financial support from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) until 2007 and then by UNICEF and LuxDev. According to the cost projection under - taken in the Lao PDR's Comprehensive Multi-Year Plan (cMYP) for Immunization, 2016-20, the total costs of the immuniza -tion program in Lao PDR during 2016-20 is projected to be US$90.5 million -fluctuat - ing around US$18 million annually (this ex - cludes operational costs of HPV operational cost and all costs of the Rotavirus vaccine). Most of the increase in annual costs over the projection period compared to the base - line year (2014, US$16.3 million) is explained by the intended scale-up of immunization coverage rates. Over the whole projection period there is expected to be a funding gap of around US$38 million (42 percent of the total resource need) with a projected annual funding gap between projected resource needs and expected funding fluctuating be - tween US$7 million and US$8 million. The largest share of the required resources is ex - pected to be financed by GoL. The cofinanc - ing requirement for Gavi vaccines is expect - ed to increase from US$750,000 in 2018 to US$1.3 million in 2019 and to US$2.1 million in 2020.5 The combined cofinancing requirements for Gavi vaccines and those for the Global Fund over the next three years will amount to US$8.7 million required from GoL; this is expected to increase further thereafter. When combined with other cost pressures from within the health sector and beyond, this phase of transition requires careful planning to ensure sustainable domestic re - sources for externally financed programs in - cluding immunization during the transition period and beyond. Given the need to plan carefully and ensure sustainable financing for UHC in the context of transitions, it is important that the assumptions made in the cMYP process and the projections for resource requirements are accurate and up - dated as necessary. 5 The estimated cofinancing requirement for Gavi does not include the additional cofinancing requirement associated with introduction of new vaccines, except HPV routine vaccination, that are under considera - tion.13 LAO PDR: T oward Sustainable Financing for Immunization CoverageKey Policy Recommendations The immunization program in Lao PDR fac - es two immediate challenges: (i) to ensure adequate financing for the immunization program within the context of declining external funding; and (ii) to reduce inequi - ties in access to immunization and ensure high coverage in all parts of the country and across socioeconomic sections of society. It is, therefore, necessary to mainstream as many aspects of NIP as possible, so as to reduce operational costs while retaining a focus on quality and equity of access. Key recommendations toward ensuring adequate and sustainable financing for the immunization program include: Ensure adequate financing for the immunization program in the broad - er context of sustainable financing for UHC. Policy options to increase domestic financing to replace exter - nal sources should not be considered program by program, but need to be assessed comprehensively as domes - tic resource mobilization for UHC. Assess fiscal space for UHC and evaluate viable policy options to in - crease public financing for health in an efficient, equitable and sustain - able manner. Increases in public fi - nancing, or \"fiscal space\" for health can potentially be realized through: (i) sustained economic growth and increases in general government rev - enues; (ii) greater prioritization given to health in government budgets; and, (iii) introduction or expansion of ear - marked consumption and income tax - es, including social health insurance. Pros and cons as well as viability of policy options to increase fiscal space need to be carefully analyzed. Understand existing bottlenecks in increasing public financing for health. Efficiency in health spending can be one of the most important factors for realizing fiscal space for health. Through this immunization assessment, the following areas were identified for improving efficiency by mainstreaming EPI activities: Harmonize financial management re- porting for EPI and align it with the government financial management information system. Fully integrate EPI data into the na- tional Health Information Manage - ment System (DHIS2) and discon - tinue separate recording at facilities. This will decrease the workload in the field while providing quality data for program management. The DHIS2 is increasingly providing robust data from all provinces. EPI data is already included in DHIS2, while the EPI pro - gram continues to use their separate recording system. This causes double work at the facility level. Integration will also solve the issue of different reporting dates leading to differences in numbers reported between the two systems.14 LAO PDR: T oward Sustainable Financing for Immunization Coverage Mainstream supply chain manage - ment, including the supply of EPI com - modities into one integrated supply chain management system that uses IT for commodity forecasting and management at least down to the dis - trict level. Implement a merger of EPI and MCH services into an integrated outreach service. The EPI has, until recently, provided separate outreach services every quarter. It has recently been de - cided to merge EPI and MCH services to form integrated outreach. During field visits it was found that a number of facilities continue to provide sepa - rate EPI outreach sessions and that some are only merged with family planning services. Effectively imple - menting integrated outreach services across the country has the potential to substantially increase availability of EPI as well as MCH services. More specifically merge the super - visory guide for MCH and EPI to in - crease efficiency and save cost. Ensure that adequate MCH home re- cords to cover the annual cohort of vaccinated children are locally avail - able. In the context of integrated out - reach, studies in Lao PDR (as well as globally) show links between avail - ability of home records for immuniza - tion and immunization coverage. This would be a simple and inexpensive means to increase immunization cov - erage, with the possible external ben - efit of increasing coverage of other MCH services. The following areas were identified to in - crease coverage and reduce inequities: Conduct operations research to iden - tify the most effective mix of facility- based and outreach services. Undertake a study on EPI and oth- er basic demand-side service con - straints. Shift from input-based to perfor - mance/results-based planning and financing for greater focus on results. This shift has been introduced with co-financing from the Government of Australia through the disbursement linked indicators (DLIs) under the World Bank-supported Health Gov - ernance and Nutrition Development Project (HGNDP) which, under the re - cently approved additional financing includes a specific DLI to incentivize increased immunization coverage in the 50 underperforming districts. This results-based design also cre - ates incentives for higher coverage and frequency of integrated outreach services, and to increase non-salary health recurrent expenditure at the district level. The use of performance- based financing to strengthen im - munization and other priority ser - vices could be further strengthened with contributions from other donors and the government channeling their funds through similar disbursement mechanisms.References Gavi Vaccine Alliance. 2011.
