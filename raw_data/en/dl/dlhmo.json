Some of the therapies are named, for instance, \"acupuncture\" and \"homoeopathy\". Others are referred to generically, for instance, \"various kinds of herbal medicine\".

Naturopaths have many remedies and recommendations for creating a healthy environment so the body can spontaneously heal itself. Naturopaths claim to beholistic, which means they believe that the naturalbodyis joined to a supernaturalsouland a non-physicalmindandthe three must be treated as a unit, whatever that means. Naturopathy is fond of such terms as \"balance\" and \"harmony\" and \"energy.\" It is often rooted in mysticism and a metaphysical belief invitalism(Barrett). Naturopaths are also prone to make grandiose claims about some herb or remedy that can enhance the immune system. Yet, only medical doctors are competent to do the tests necessary to determine if an individual's immune system is in any way depressed (Green). Naturopaths assume that many diseases, including cancer, are caused by faulty immune systems. (The immune system, in simple terms, is "}
