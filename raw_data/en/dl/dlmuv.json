These stimulate the immune system but do not cause disease in healthy people. However, the MMR vaccine should not be given to people who are clinically immunosuppressed (see below). Two brands of MMR vaccine are used in the UK: MMRVaxPro (see the Measles outbreaks in the UK and Europe Between 2001 and 2013 there was a sharp rise in the number of UK measles cases, and three people died. Numbers of cases have fallen since 2013, but rates of measles are still higher than they were in the late 1990s and seem to be rising again in 2018. In 2018 there were 966 laboratory confirmed measles cases in England - nearly four times as many as the total number confirmed in 2017 (259 cases). The majority of measles cases have been in people who are not vaccinated, especially young people aged 15 and over who missed out on MMR vaccination when they were younger. About 30% of those infected have been admitted to hospital. At the moment most UK measles cases are linked to travel in Europe. Cases have also been linked to music festivals and other large public events. Numbers of measles cases are currently high in several European countries. There were more than three times as many measles cases in 2017 as there were in 2016. In 2016 and 2017 there were 49 deaths from measles in Europe, and by November 2018 there had been another 33 deaths (see reports from the Numbers of measles cases are currently high in several European countries. There were Who should have the vaccine, and how many doses are needed? Children get two doses of MMR vaccine. The first dose is given at 12-13 months in the UK schedule. The vaccine is not usually given earlier than this because studies have shown it does not work so well in children under 1 year of age. (See the short video under 'Is the vaccine safe?' at the bottom of the page.) A booster dose is given at 3 years and 4 months at the same time as the The MMR vaccine should not be given to people who are clinically immunosuppressed (either due to drug treatment or underlying illness). This is because the weakened viruses in the vaccine could replicate too much and cause serious infection. This includes babies whose mothers have had immunosuppressive treatment while they were pregnant or breastfeeding. For more information see the There is a catch-up programme for children, teenagers and young adults who have missed out on the MMR vaccine. Anyone of any age who is not sure whether they have had two doses of measles, mumps and rubella vaccines can ask their GP for the MMR vaccine. Because of measles outbreaks in Europe and elsewhere, all travellers are advised to check that they are up to date with MMR vaccination before they travel. If you are travelling with a baby, the MMR vaccine can be given from six months of age before travelling to a country where measles is a risk or where an outbreak is taking place. See the Single measles, mumps and rubella vaccines are not available in the UK through the NHS and are not recommended by the NHS (see the The MMR vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women as a matter of caution. However, there are no known risks associated with receiving the MMR vaccine during pregnancy or just before pregnancy. See this What protection does the vaccine give? After two doses of MMR vaccine, about 99 of people out of 100 will be protected against measles, about 88 out of 100 will be protected against mumps, and almost everyone will be protected against rubella. MMR vaccine safety There are now a large number of studies that show no evidence at all of any link between the MMR vaccine and autism. In the short film below, experts say why they believe there is no link. See 'Is the vaccine safe?' towards the bottom of this page for a full list of studies. "}
