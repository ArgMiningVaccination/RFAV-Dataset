Or dreamed of the day the energy of your toddler or teen-ager could be bottled for your own consumption? If so, John Bello thinks he has a potion or two that could help. It's all part of the national trend in alternative foods, the preoccupation with exercising, healthy eating, feeling good and living longer. And Mr. Bello and his partners in the fledgling South Beach Beverage Company, based in Norwalk, think this trend will sell their juices and tea drinks. ''They are exciting, new and different,'' he says of the beverages. Maybe it's the long-necked bottle with the etched-in lizard logo. Maybe it's the Oriental-style lettering and abbreviation of the company name to SoBe. Could be the ingredients -- herbal supplements that are purported to enhance energy, brainpower and sexual performance. Then again, it might be the color and zippy taste. Most likely, it's all of the above. Whatever the reason, South Beach Beverage has hit a nerve just at the opening of the do-or-die selling season for soft drinks -- May to August. What once Mr. Bello and friends delivered from the back of a van is now being produced by a staff of 14 and chauffered to neighborhood convenience stores, delicatessens and gas station food marts by some of the largest distributors in the nation. The price tag is 99 cents to $1.50 (for a 20-ounce bottle). Mr. Bello, 51, a marketing man who has worked with Maxwell House, Pepsi and Arizona brand teas, is on the bandwagon rolled out by Snapple flavored teas in 1972 -- a boon for its original investors, a bust for Quaker Oats, which took it over in its maturity. What he's added, he says, are good-for-you ingredients. South Beach's goal is to turn the mass market on to what health food store afficionados and herbal purists have believed for years -- that ginseng, ginkgo, guarana, echinacea and yohimbe, among others, can make you feel good naturally. Although new drinks from some of the big boy beverage companies (as well as some small fries) include one or another of these ingredients, South Beach combines three or more anti-aging, immunity-building nutrients with a great taste, says Mr. Bello. In this business, he explains, ''You have to be there firstest with the mostest.'' Tom LaRosa, sales manager for G & G Beverage Distributors in Wallingford, agrees South Beach is getting more attention and shelf space from retailers with its range of trendy choices -- seven at last count. ''It's not a 'me-too' product,'' says Mr. LaRosa. ''Right now, I think they got the jump on everybody in the ready-to-drink market. They taste good, they look good and it's what the consumer seems to want.'' Mr. LaRosa says he's selling 700 to 800 cases a month in New Haven County and hopes to have the SoBe line in 300 stores and venues this month. South Beach now has six distributors in Connecticut. The drinks are proving popular with young and old alike, says Adilson Verdan, manager of Paesano's Deli on Mason Street in Greenwich, who sells them at $1.50 a pop right next to the 16-ounce Snapple, Arizona and Nestea brands at $1.25 each. ''The bottle design just grabs you from the cooler,'' he says. Judging by their energy, the South Beach folks must drink a lot of their own elixir. A few weeks ago, in Rye, N.Y., they set up coolers full of free fruit juices and teas. Those who found a bottle cap with the words ''Drain the Lizard'' (an appeal to drink to the last drop, as well as a barroom term meaning relieve your bladder) won a T-shirt with catchy lizard lingo and logos. Nearly 80 cases of drinks (1,920 bottles) were emptied. Adam Socol of Stamford, a runner, tried the orange/carrot elixir with the 3 C's -- calcium for stronger bones, carnitine to produce energy and reduce cholesterol, and chromium picolinate to build lean muscle mass, according to company literature. He expressed satisfaction. ''Especially after a thing like this,'' he said, referring to the race he had just run, ''you need to reload.'' Other runners grabbed the yellow-colored Energy drink (guarana for an instant boost; yohimbe for power, strength and endurance, and arginine, an amino acid to enhance physical performance). Although pleased with positive feedback he was getting, Norm Snyder, South Beach's chief financial officer and overseer of the free-drink and T-shirt event, said it was not a true indicator of South Beach's popularity or future success. The next few months, he said, would tell if the company has a real place in the United States market for alternative drinks. The market for these -- waters, teas, sports drinks, juice drinks and natural sodas -- reached $11.5 billion last year, up 13 percent from 1995, according to John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest, a trade publication. But like his colleagues, Mr. Snyder is undaunted by the competition. ''It's like anything else,'' he says. ''If you're good, no matter how competitive or crowded the marketplace is, you're going to do all right. We think we have a great concept and a great product.'' The Norwalk headquarters for South Beach, on Richards Avenue, is the antithesis of the hip youth-oriented resort community with its Art Deco architecture on the southern tip of Miami Beach. In Norwalk, the hallways are jammed with cases of soft drinks stacked almost to the ceiling. Typical attire is casual shirt, jeans and a baseball cap. Mr. Bello's office is cluttered with bottles, South Beach brands and otherwise. On a large table in the center of the room recently, there were smaller containers filled with variations of flavors used in a taste test by the staff. Complementing the go-get-'em attitude permeating the place is football memorabilia, including a cherished painting of former Washington Redskin John Riggins -- from Mr. Bello's days as president of NFL Properties, the football league's merchandising arm. Mr. Bello, who was born in Plainville, and his partner, Tom Schwalm of Greenwich, now vice president of operations, began South Beach two years ago after Mr. Bello's short stint with Arizona Brands. Bill Bishop, president of Sierra Communications in Wilton (a former colleague at General Foods) signed on as executive vice president. Although 200,000 cases of six teas and juices were sold last year, company officials and distributors agree the product line with the Florida Art Deco feeling wasn't different enough. Since beverages, like the latest sneakers and swanky car, are a fashion statement reflecting life style, says Mr. Bello, the company listened when customers began calling to say they liked the orange/carrot juice. ''They thought it was a health drink,'' he recalls. Enter Billy Bishop, 26, son of the executive vice president, who hit upon the growing popularity of herbs and the public's perceived belief in Oriental wellness to come up with a new product: SoBe Black Tea. After all, it has been suggested in some medical studies that tea, especially green and black varieties, might prevent or inhibit cancer. Says the company literature, ''No Drain, No Gain!'' Black Tea features the company's proprietary 3G formula -- ginseng for long-lasting endurance, ginkgo to sharpen the mind and guarana for that quick boost -- and bridges the ethnic, urban and suburban markets with its style and gingery taste, says Mr. Bello. The product having caught up with the graphic design, about 25,000 cases were sold in December alone. ''In two months,'' Mr. Bello says, ''we went from the bush leagues to the major leagues.'' The company then added Green Tea with echinacea, perceived to fight cold and flu symptoms; Red Tea with selenium, an antioxidant touted to strengthen the immune system, and Oolong Tea with bee pollen, a natural energy booster. ''I used to be the Lizard King,'' laughs Mr. Bello, who became a regular reader of health magazines. ''Now I'm the Lizard King, M.D.'' Although company officials are careful not to make outright claims that the SoBe drinks can or do improve your health, they know a segment of the public believes in the herbal ingredients. In fact, says Dr. James O'Brien, a pharmacologist and associate professor at the University of Connecticut Health Center in Farmington, ''There is a placebo effect of at least 30 percent with any preparation. The power of suggestion certainly works.'' But, he said, the stimulation generated by the herbal ingredients is comparable to that from a cup of coffee -- and at a higher price. Dr. Paul Epstein, a naturopathic physician for 13 years in Norwalk, wouldn't offer a judgment on SoBe's effectiveness, but is concerned about the whole trend towards alternative drinks and foods. While he supports the use of herbs to improve health, he says they should only be taken after consultation with a knowledgeable health care provider familiar with an individual's symptoms and needs. Otherwise, he warns, an underlying health issue may be overlooked and go untreated. ''This is the nature of the bandwagon of natural healing,'' said Dr. Epstein. ''It's the quick-fix, magic-cure mentality. Even if you take vitamin C, you should know why. You should be taking it for the right reason and in the right amount that is particular and appropriate for you.'' At SoBe, however, if all goes well, the hope is to grow from $2.5 million in sales last year to as much as $16 million in 1997, says Mr. Snyder, with 100 distributors nationwide by the end of this month. But the company is not resting on its laurels. It's working on the next generations of flavors and ingredients. Could it be shark cartilage, an antioxidant said to help reduce joint inflammation? Garlic, with a better taste? South Beach staff members listen carefully to an estimated 1,000 customers a week who call the 800 number on their bottle labels to offer comments and to order the lizard merchandise catalogue. And they're visiting health food stores, reading up on the latest herbal fads and watching closely the popularity in Europe of energy drinks. ''We've got the big guys following us now,'' says Mr. Bello. ''By the time they get there, we'll be out with hot, new additives.'' South Beach, a sponsor of the Connecticut Wolves soccer team, also plans to come out with smaller, plastic bottles for distribution to schools, institutions, golf courses and sports arenas. Now, Mr. Bello, what does SoBe really mean? Ever the salesman, ever upbeat, the president "}
