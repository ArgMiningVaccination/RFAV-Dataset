Sounds, and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not. Inspiring voices. Tens and tens of tension-teasing tender-seeking fingers. I discovered Chiva Som. The perfect destination for rebalancing, rejuvenating and reflection. Surely the global gold standard for physical, mental and spiritual well-being. Bravo and congratulation to the management and wonderful staff. - A L, Trip Advisor ReviewVisited September 2015 I love this place. I visited a while back before it was renovated so I'm only going from my own experience. I went as a solo female traveller for a few days to recharge batteries. I booked a wellness package with meals included and I found it to be incredibly worthwhile and beneficial. The packaged included a daily treatment. The spa was fantastic all the therapists were wonderful. I saw both the naturopath and PT while there and found their expertise and service to be knowledgeable and beneficial. The food is exquisite and you know exactly what your eating, very natural and made appropriately for those who wish to eat a balanced diet while relaxing. The pool, the location is very peaceful and every night the staff would light an oil burner with lemongrass for turn down service and I slept like a baby.Best to fly directly into Hua Hin its a long way away from Bangkok and reduces your stress and journey time. If you can get a transfer flight I would definitely book it to maximise your time here. I couldn't when I booked due to my work schedule so had to transfer via car and it took 3hrs but I still had a wonderful holiday. Its an oasis of calm..
