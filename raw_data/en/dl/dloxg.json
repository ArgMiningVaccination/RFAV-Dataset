This is the maximum tax rate that may be levied, unless a higher tax rate ceiling is approved by voters of the political subdivision as provided in this section; (4) \"Tax revenue\", when referring to the previous year, means t he actual receipts from ad valorem levies on all classes of property, including state-assessed property, in the immediately preceding fiscal year of the political subdivision, plus an a llowance for taxes billed but n ot collected in the fiscal year and plus an additional allowance for the revenue which would have been coll ected from property which was annexed by such political subdivision but which was not previously used in determining tax revenue pursuant to this section. The term \"tax revenue\" shall not include any receipts from ad valorem levi es on any property of a railroad corporation or a public utility, as these terms are defined in section 386.020, which were assessed by the assessor of a county or city in the previous year but ar e assessed by the state tax commission in the current year.

For purposes of political subdivisions which were authorized to levy a tax in the prior year but which did not le vy such tax or levied a reduced rate, the term \"tax revenue\", as used in relation to the revision of tax levie s mandated by law, shall mean the revenues equal to the amount that would have been available if the volun tary rate reduction had not been made. 2. Whenever changes in assessed valuation are entered in the as sessor's books for any personal property, in the aggregate, or for any s ubclass of real property as such subclasses are established in Section 4(b) of Article X of the Missouri Constitution and defined in section 1 37.016, the county clerk in all counties and the assessor of St. Louis City shall notify each political subd ivision wholly or partially within the county or St. Louis City of the change in valuation of each subclass o f real property, individually, and personal property, in the aggregate, exclusive of new construction and i mprovements. All political subdivisions shall immediately revise the applicable rates of levy for each purpos e for each subclass of real property, individually, and personal property, in the aggregate, for whic h taxes are levied to the extent necessary to produce from all taxable property, exclusive of new constructio n and improvements, substantially the same amount of tax revenue as was produced in the previous year for each subclass of real property, individually, and personal property, in the aggregate, except that the rate s hall not exceed the greater of the most recent voter-approved rate or the most recent voter-approved rate as a djusted under subdivision (2) of subsection 5 of this section. Any political subdivision that has received approval from voters for a tax increase afterSixty-Sixth Day\u2014Wednesday, May 12, 2021 1769 August 27, 2008, may levy a rate to collect substantially the s ame amount of tax revenue as the amount of revenue that would have been derived by applying the voter-appr oved increased tax rate ceiling to the total assessed valuation of the political subdivision as most recentl y certified by the city or county clerk on or before the date of the election in which such increase is appro ved, increased by the percentage increase in the consumer price index, as provided by law, except that the r ate shall not exceed the greater of the most recent voter-approved rate or the most recent voter-approved ra te as adjusted under subdivision (2) of subsection 5 of this section. Such tax revenue shall not includ e any receipts from ad valorem levies on any real property which was asse ssed by the assessor of a county or city in such previous year but is assessed by the assessor of a county or city in the current year in a di fferent subclass of real property. Where the taxing authority is a school district for the purposes of revis ing the applicable rates of levy for each subclass of real property, the tax revenues from state-assessed railroad and utility property shall be apportioned and attributed to each subclass of real property based on the perce ntage of the total assessed valuation of the county that each subclass of real property represents in the cu rrent taxable year. As provided in Section 22 of Article X of the constitution, a political subdivision may a lso revise each levy to allow for inflationary assessment growth occurring within the political subdivision. T he inflationary growth factor for any such subclass of real property or personal property shall be limited to the actual assessment growth in such subclass or class, exclusive of new construction and improvemen ts, and exclusive of the assessed value on any real property which was assessed by the assessor of a count y or city in the current year in a different subclass of real property, but not to exceed the consumer price index or five percent, whichever is lower. Should the tax revenue of a political subdivision from the vari ous tax rates determined in this subsection be different than the tax revenue that would have been determin ed from a single tax rate as calculated pursuant to the method of calculation in this subsection prior to January 1, 2003, then the political subdivision shall revise the tax rates of those subclasses of r eal property, individually, and/or personal property, in the aggregate, in which there is a tax rate reduct ion, pursuant to the provisions of this subsection. Such revision shall yield an amount equal to such d ifference and shall be apportioned among such subclasses of real property, individually, and/or personal property, in the aggregate, based on the relative assessed valuation of the class or subclasses of prope rty experiencing a tax rate reduction. Such revision in the tax rates of each class or subclass shall be ma de by computing the percentage of current year adjusted assessed valuation of each class or subclass with a ta x rate reduction to the total current year adjusted assessed valuation of the class or subclasses with a t ax rate reduction, multiplying the resulting percentages by the revenue difference between the single rate c alculation and the calculations pursuant to this subsection and dividing by the respective adjusted current year assessed valuation of each class or subclass to determine the adjustm ent to the rate to be levied u pon each class or subclass of property. The adjustment computed herein shall be multiplied by one hundred, rounded to four decimals in the manner provided in this subsection, and added to the initial rate comp uted for each class or subclass of property. For school districts that levy separate tax rates on each subcl ass of real property and personal property in the aggregate, if voters approved a ballot before January 1, 20 11, that presented separate stated tax rates to be applied to the different subclasses of real property and per sonal property in the aggregate, or increases the separate rates that may be levied on the different subclass es of real property and personal property in the aggregate by different amounts, the tax rate that shall be used for the single tax rate calculation shall be a blended rate, calculated in the manner provided under subdivi sion (1) of subsection 6 of this section. Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection to the contrar y, no revision to the rate of levy for personal property shall cause such levy to increase over the levy for pe rsonal property from the prior year. 3. (1) Where the taxing authority is a school district, it shal l be required to revise the rates of levy to the extent necessary to produce from all taxable property, includin g state-assessed railroad and utility property,Journal of the Senate 1770 which shall be separately es timated in addition to other data r equired in complying with section 164.011, substantially the amount of tax revenue permitted in this secti on. In the year following tax rate reduction, the tax rate ceiling may be adjusted to offset such district's reduction in the apportionment of state school moneys due to its reduced tax rate. However, in the event any s chool district, in calculating a tax rate ceiling pursuant to this section, requiri ng the estimating of effects o f state-assessed railroad and utility valuation or loss of state aid, discovers that the estimates used result in receipt of excess revenues, which would have required a lower rate if the actual information had been known, the school district shall reduce the tax rate ceiling in the following year to compensate for the excess rece ipts, and the recalculated rate shall become the tax rate ceiling for purposes of this section. (2) For any political subdivision which experiences a reduction in the amount of assessed valuation relating to a prior year, due to decisions of the state tax com mission or a court pursuant to sections 138.430 to 138.433, or due to clerical errors or corrections in the cal culation or recordation of any assessed valuation: (a) Such political subdivision may revise the tax rate ceiling for each purpose it levies taxes to compensate for the reduction in assessed value occurring after the political subdivision calculated the tax rate ceiling for the particular subclass of real property or fo r personal property, in the aggregate, in a prior year. Such revision by the political subdivision shall be made at the time of the next calculation of the tax rate for the particular subclass of real property or for person al property, in the aggregate, after the reduction in assessed valuation has been determined and shall be calculat ed in a manner that results in the revised tax rate ceiling being the same as it would have been had the corre cted or finalized assessment been available at the time of the prior calculation; (b) In addition, for up to three years following the determinat ion of the reduction in assessed valuation as a result of circumstances d efined in this subdivision, such political subdivision may levy a tax rate for each purpose it levies taxes above the revised tax rate ceiling provided in paragraph (a) of this subdivision to recoup any revenues it was entitled to receive had the corre cted or finalized assessment been available at the time of the prior calculation. 4. (1) In order to implement the provisions of this section and Section 22 of Article X of the Constitution of Missouri, the term improvements shall apply to both real and personal property. In order to determine the value of new construction and improvements, each county ass essor shall maintain a record of real property valuations in such a manner as to identify each year t he increase in valuation for each political subdivision in the county as a result of new construction and i mprovements. The value of new construction and improvements shall include the additional assessed value of all improvements or additions to real property which were begun after and were not part of the prior year's assessment, except that the additional assessed value of all improvements or additions to real propert y which had been totally or partially exempt from ad valorem taxes pursuant to sections 99.800 to 99.865, se ctions 135.200 to 135.255, and section 353.110 shall be included in the value of new construction and improvements when the property becomes totally or partially subject to assessment and payment of all a d valorem taxes. The aggregate increase in valuation of personal property for the current year over that o f the previous year is the equivalent of the new construction and improvements factor for personal property. Not withstanding any opt-out implemented pursuant to subsection 14 of section 137.115, the assessor shal l certify the amount of new construction and improvements and the amount of assessed value on any real prope rty which was assessed by the assessor of a county or city in such previous year but is assessed by th e assessor of a county or city in the current year in a different subclass of real property separately for ea ch of the three subclasses of real property forSixty-Sixth Day\u2014Wednesday, May 12, 2021 1771 each political subdivision to the county clerk in order that po litical subdivisions shall have this information for the purpose of calculating ta x rates pursuant to this secti on and Section 22, Artic le X, Constitution of Missouri. In addition, the state tax commission shall certify e ach year to each county clerk the increase in the general price level as measured by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers for the United States, or its successor publications, as defined and officiall y reported by the United States Department of Labor, or its successor agency. The state tax commission shall certify the increase in such index on the latest twelve-month basis available on February first of each year ove r the immediately preceding prior twelve- month period in order that po litical subdi visions shall have th is information available in setting their tax rates according to law and Secti on 22 of Article X of the Const itution of Missouri. For purposes of implementing the provisions of th is section and Section 22 of A rticle X of the Missouri Constitution, the term \"property\" means all taxable property, including state-ass essed property. (2) Each political subdivision required to revise rates of levy pursuant to this section or Section 22 of Article X of the Constitution of Missouri shall calculate each tax rate it is authorized to levy and, in establishing each tax rate, shall consider each provision for t ax rate revision provided in this section and Section 22 of Article X of the Constitution of Missouri, separa tely and without regard to annual tax rate reductions provided in section 67.505 and section 164.013. Each political subdivision shall set each tax rate it is authorized to levy using the calculation that produces th e lowest tax rate ceiling. It is further the intent of the general assembly, pursuant to the authority of Section 1 0(c) of Article X of the Constitution of Missouri, that the provisions of such section be applicable to tax rate revisions mandated pursuant to Section 22 of Article X of the Constitution of Missouri as to reestabli shing tax rates as revised in subsequent years, enforcement provisions, and other provisions not in conflict wi th Section 22 of Article X of the Constitution of Missouri. Annual tax rate reductions provided in section 67. 505 and section 164.013 shall be applied to the tax rate as established pursuant to this section and Sectio n 22 of Article X of the Constitution of Missouri, unless otherwise provided by law. 5. (1) In all political subdivisions , the tax rate ceiling esta blished pursuant to this section shall not be increased unless approved by a vote of the people. Approval of the higher tax rate shall be by at least a majority of votes cast. When a proposed higher tax rate require s approval by more than a simple majority pursuant to any provision of law or the constitution, the tax r ate increase must receive approval by at least the majority required. (2) When voters approve an increase in the tax rate, the amount of the increase shall be added to the tax rate ceiling as calculated pursuant to this section to the exte nt the total rate does not exceed any maximum rate prescribed by law. If a ballot question presents a stated tax rate for approval rather than describing the amount of increase in the question, the stated tax rate approve d shall be adjusted as provided in this section and, so adjusted, shall be the current tax rate ceiling. The in creased tax rate ceiling as approved shall be adjusted such that when applied to the current total assessed v aluation of the political subdivision, excluding new construction and improvements since the date of the electio n approving such increase, the revenue derived from the adjusted tax rate ceiling is equal to the sum of: the amount of revenue which would have been derived by applying the voter-approved increased tax rate ceiling to total assessed valuation of the political subdivision, as most recently certified by the city o r county clerk on or before the date of the election in which such increase is approved, increased by the p ercentage increase in the consumer price index, as provided by law. Such adjusted tax rate ceiling may b e applied to the total assessed valuation of the political subdivision at the setting of the next tax rate. If a ballot question presents a phased-in tax rate increase, upon voter approval, each tax rate increase shall be adjusted in the manner prescribed in this section to yield the sum of: the amount of revenue that would b e derived by applying such voter-approvedJournal of the Senate 1772 increased rate to the total assessed valuation, as most recentl y certified by the city or county clerk on or before the date of the election in which such increase was appr oved, increased by the percentage increase in the consumer price index, as provided by law, from the date of the election to the time of such increase and, so adjusted, shall be the current tax rate ceiling. (3) The provisions of subdivision (2) of this subsection notwithsta nding, if, prior to the expiration of a temporary levy increase, voters approve a subsequent levy increase, the new tax rate ceiling shall remain in effect only until such time as the temporary levy exp ires under the terms originally approved by a vote of the people, at which time the tax rate ce iling shall be decreased by the amount of the temporary levy increase. If, prior to the expiration of a temporary levy increase, voters of a political subdivision are asked to approve an additional, perma nent increase to the political subdivision's tax rate ceiling, voters shall be submitted ballo t language that clearly indicates that if the permanent levy increase is approved, the temporary levy sha ll be made permanent. (4) The governing body of any political subdivision may levy a tax rate lower than its tax rate ceiling and may, in a nonreassessment year, increase that lowered tax r ate to a level not exceeding the tax rate ceiling without voter approval in the manner provided under sub division [(4)] (5) of this subsection. Nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting a political s ubdivision from voluntar ily levying a tax rate lower than that which is require d under the provisions of this section or from seeking voter approval of a reduction to such political subdivision's tax rate ceiling. [(4)] (5) In a year of general reassessment, a governing body whose tax rate is lower than its tax rate ceiling shall revise its tax rate pursuant to the provisions of subsection 4 of this section as if its tax rate was at the tax rate ceiling. In a year following general reassessme nt, if such governing body intends to increase its tax rate, the governing body shall conduct a public hearing , and in a public meeting it shall adopt an ordinance, resolution, or policy statement justifying its actio n prior to setting and certifying its tax rate. The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to any political subdivision which levies a tax rate lower than its tax rate ceiling solely due to a reduction required by law resulting from sales tax collections. The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to any political subdivision which has received voter approval for an increase to its tax rate ceiling subsequent to setting i ts most recent tax rate. 6. (1) For the purposes of calculating state aid for public sch ools pursuant to section 163.031, each taxing authority which is a school district shall determine its proposed tax rate as a blended rate of the classes or subclasses of property. Such blended rate shall be c alculated by first determining the total tax revenue of the property within the jurisdiction of the taxing a uthority, which amount shall be equal to the sum of the products of multiplying the assessed valuation of ea ch class and subclass of property by the corresponding tax rate for such class or subclass, then dividin g the total tax revenue by the total assessed valuation of the same jurisdiction, and then multiplying the re sulting quotient by a f actor of one hundred. Where the taxing authority is a school district, such blended r ate shall also be used by such school district for calculating revenue from state-assessed railroad and utilit y property as defined in chapter 151 and for apportioning the tax rate by purpose. (2) Each taxing authority proposing to levy a tax rate in any y ear shall notify the clerk of the county commission in the county or counties where the tax rate applies of its tax rate ceiling and its proposed tax rate. Each taxing authority shall express its proposed tax rate in a fraction equal to the nearest one-tenth of a cent, unless its proposed tax rate is in excess of one dollar , then one/one-hundredth of a cent. If a taxing authority shall round to one/one-hundredth of a cent, it shall round up a fraction greater than or equal to five/one-thousandth of one cent to the next higher one/one-hund redth of a cent; if a taxing authority shallSixty-Sixth Day\u2014Wednesday, May 12, 2021 1773 round to one-tenth of a cent, it shall round up a fraction grea ter than or equal to five/one-hundredths of a cent to the next higher one-tenth of a cent. Any taxing authori ty levying a property tax rate shall provide data, in such form as shall be prescribed by the state auditor by rule, substantiating such tax rate complies with Missouri law. All forms for the calculation of rates pursu ant to this section shall be promulgated as a rule and shall not be incorporated by reference. The state audi tor shall promulgate rules for any and all forms for the calculation of rates pursuant to this section whi ch do not currently exist in rule form or that have been incorporated by reference. In addition, each taxing a uthority proposing to levy a tax rate for debt service shall provide data, in such form as shall be prescribed by the state auditor by rule, substantiating the tax rate for debt service complies with Missouri law. A tax rat e proposed for annual debt service requirements will be prima facie valid if, after making the pay ment for which the tax was levied, bonds remain outstanding and the debt fund reserves do not exceed the following year's payments. The county clerk shall keep on file and available for public inspection al l such information for a period of three years. The clerk shall, within three days of receipt, forward a copy o f the notice of a taxing authority's tax rate ceiling and proposed tax rate and any substantiating data to th e state auditor. The state auditor shall, within fifteen days of the date of receipt, examine such information a nd return to the county clerk his or her findings as to compliance of the tax rate ceiling with this sec tion and as to compliance of any proposed tax rate for debt service with Missouri law. If the state auditor b elieves that a taxing authority's proposed tax rate does not comply with Missouri law, then the state auditor' s findings shall include a recalculated tax rate, and the state auditor may request a taxing authority to s ubmit documentation supporting such taxing authority's proposed tax rate. The county clerk shall immediate ly forward a copy of the auditor's findings to the taxing authority and shall file a copy of the findings w ith the information received from the taxing authority. The taxing authority shall have fifteen days from th e date of receipt from the county clerk of the state auditor's findings and any request for supporting documen tation to accept or reject in writing the rate change certified by the state auditor and to submit all request ed information to the state auditor. A copy of the taxing authority's acceptance or rejection and any informat ion submitted to the state auditor shall also be mailed to the county clerk. If a taxing authority rejects a rate change certified by the state auditor and the state auditor does not receive supporting information which jus tifies the taxing authority's original or any subsequent proposed tax rate, then the state auditor shall refe r the perceived violations of such taxing authority to the attorney gener al's office and the attorney gen eral is authorized to obtain injunctive relief to prevent the taxing authority from levying a violative tax ra te. (3) In the event that the taxing authority incorrectly complete s the forms created and promulgated under subdivision (2) of this subsection, or makes a clerical error, the taxing authority may submit amended forms with an explanation for the needed changes. If such amended for ms are filed under regulations prescribed by the state auditor, the state auditor shall take into conside ration such amended forms for the purposes of this subsection. 7. No tax rate shall be extended on the tax rolls by the county clerk unless the political subdivision has complied with the foregoing provisions of this section. 8. Whenever a taxpayer has cause to believe that a taxing autho rity has not complied with the provisions of this section, the taxpayer may make a formal complaint with the prosecuting attorney of the county. Where the prosecuting attorney fa ils to bring an action within ten days of the filing of the complaint, the taxpayer may bring a civil action pursuant to this section and institute an action as representative of a class of all taxpayers within a taxing authority if the class is so n umerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, if there are questions of law or fact common to the class, if the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and if the representative parties willJournal of the Senate 1774 fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. In an y class action maintained pursuant to this section, the court may direct to the members of the class a not ice to be published at least once each week for four consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulatio n published in the county where the civil action is commenced and in other counties within the jurisdicti on of a taxing authority. The notice shall advise each member that the court will exclude him or her from the class if he or she so requests by a specified date, that the judgment, whether favorable or not, wi ll include all members who do not request exclusion, and that any member who does not request exclusion m ay, if he or she desires, enter an appearance. In any class action brought pursuant to this sectio n, the court, in addition to the relief requested, shall assess against the taxing authority found to be in violat ion of this section the reasonable costs of bringing the action, including reasonable attorney's fees, prov ided no attorney's fees shall be awarded any attorney or association of attorneys who receive public funds f rom any source for their services. Any action brought pursuant to this section shall be set for hearing as so on as practicable after the cause is at issue. 9. If in any action, including a class action, the court issues an order requiring a taxing authority to revise the tax rates as provided in this section or enjoins a taxing a uthority from the collection of a tax because of its failure to revise the rate of levy as provided in this sect ion, any taxpayer paying his or her taxes when an improper rate is applied has erroneously paid his or her tax es in part, whether or not the taxes are paid under protest as provided in section 139.031 or otherwise conte sted. The part of the taxes paid erroneously is the difference in the amount produced by the original levy a nd the amount produced by the revised levy. The township or county collector of taxes or the collector of t axes in any city shall refund the amount of the tax erroneously paid. The taxing authority refusing to revise t he rate of levy as provided in this section shall make available to the collector all funds necessary to make ref unds pursuant to this subsection. No taxpayer shall receive any interest on any money erroneously paid by him or her pursuant to this subsection. Effective in the 1994 tax year, nothing in t his section shall be construe d to require a taxing authority to refund any tax erroneously paid prior to or during the third tax year prec eding the current tax year. 10. Any rule or portion of a rule, as that term is defined in s ection 536.010, that is created under the authority delegated in this section shall become effective only if it complies with and is subject to all of the provisions of chapter 536 and, if applicable, section 536.028. This section and chapter 536 are nonseverable and if any of the powers vested w ith the general assembly pursu ant to chapter 536 to review, to delay the effective date, or to disapprove and annul a rule are subsequen tly held unconstitutional, then the grant of rulemaking authority and any rule proposed or adopted after Aug ust 28, 2004, shall be invalid and void.\"; and Further amend said bill by amending the title, enacting clause, and intersectional references accordingly.

Manufactured homes, as defined in section 700.010, which are actually used as dwelling units shall be assessed at the same percentage of true value as residential real property for the purpose of taxation. The percentage of assessment of true value for such manufactured ho mes shall be the same as for residential real property.

For purposes of this section, a manufactured home located in a manufactured home rental park, rental community or on real estate not owned by the manufactured home owner shall be c onsidered personal property. For purposes of this section, a ma nufactured home located on real estate own ed by the manufactured home owner may be considered real property. 7. Each manufactured home assessed shall be considered a parcel for the purpose of reimbursement pursuant to section 137.750, unless the manufactured home is re al estate as defined in subsection 7 of section 442.015 and assessed as a realty improvement to the exi sting real estate parcel. 8. Any amount of tax due and owing based on the assessment of a manufactured home shall be included on the personal property tax statement of the manufactured home owner unless the manufactured home is real estate as defined in subsection 7 of section 442.015, in w hich case the amount of tax due and owing on the assessment of the manufactured home as a realty improvement to the existing real estate parcel shall be included on the real property tax statement of the real estate owner. 9.

The assessor shall not use a value that is greater than the average trade-in value in determining the true value of the motor vehic le without performing a physical inspection of the motor vehicle. For vehicles two years old or newer from a vehicle's model year, the assessor may use a value other than average without performing a physical inspec tion of the motor vehicle. In the absence of a listing for a particular motor vehicle in such publication , the assessor shall use such information or publications which in the assessor's judgment will fairly estim ate the true value in money of the motor vehicle. 10. Before the assessor may increase the assessed valuation of any parcel of subclass (1) real property by more than fifteen percent since the last assessment, excludi ng increases due to new construction or improvements, the assessor shall conduct a physical inspection of such property. 11.
