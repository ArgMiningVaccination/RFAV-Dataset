This will help them manage your care and keep you safe. What Is It Imagery is a centuries-old technique with deep historical roots. It involves deliberate recreation of vivid personal mental images, sounds, smells and even tastes, to ease anxiety and facilitate mind-body healing. Some techniques may overlap with those used in [meditation](/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/therapies/meditation), [yoga](/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/therapies/yoga), or [music therapy](/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/therapies/music-therapy). Guided imagery can be learned from books or self-help tapes, or from a licensed practitioner. In a typical session, the practitioner helps foster a state of deep relaxation via breathing techniques, music, and/or progressive muscle relaxation in a quiet environment. Then a series of instructions or suggestions is offered to help relieve symptoms. How It Works Studies show that guided imagery has positive effects on pain, fatigue, stress, anxiety, depression, sleep, and recovery in patients with many types of illnesses including cancer. It can also reduce discomfort during procedures or side effects like nausea and vomiting that may occur with treatment. An important aspect of guided imagery is the regularity with which it is practiced and not the amount of time spent at each session. Repeating these exercises results in a conditioning effect that empowers a patient to use them whenever needed. This is especially useful for patients with fatigue or many symptoms. Purported Uses and Benefits - Pain Studies show that guided imagery helps reduce many types of pain. - Stress, anxiety Guided imagery can help reduce chronic stress and anxiety. It can also help with stress and anxiety related to treatment or procedures. - Depression Guided imagery can be helpful for patients with chronic diseases who also have depression. - Fatigue Guided imagery may decrease fatigue in cancer patients. - Nausea and vomiting Small studies suggest guided imagery can help reduce nausea and vomiting related to treatment. - Sleeping disturbance A study found improvements in sleep disturbance, fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction to be clinically significant.

Guided imagery can help reduce - Pain - Discomfort with procedures - Nausea, vomiting - Anxiety, stress It can also help improve - Fatigue - Sleep - Cognition - Well-being Guided imagery in oncology settings Adjuvant use of guided imagery improves quality of life and reduces anxiety, depression, stress, fatigue, and discomfort in cancer patients undergoing various procedures [(12)](#references-12) [(15)](#references-15) [(16)](#references-16) [(17)](#references-17) [(18)](#references-18). Improvements in sleep disturbance and cognitive dysfunction were also clinically significant [(30)](#references-30). Several other studies suggest it can help with symptom clusters that include nausea and vomiting [(20)](#references-20) [(21)](#references-21) [(22)](#references-22) [(23)](#references-23) [(24)](#references-24). It [(18)](#references-18), alleviate dyspnea [(19)](#references-19), help restore body image [(29)](#references-29), and be helpful for pediatric patients with high trait anxiety [(31)](#references-31). In other populations In patients with arthritis, other rheumatic disorders, or fibromyalgia, guided imagery had positive effects on pain, physical functioning, anxiety, depression, and quality of life [(1)](#references-1) [(2)](#references-2) [(3)](#references-3) [(4)](#references-4) [(6)](#references-6), and may help reduce analgesic use [(5)](#references-5). It also relieved anxiety and pain in burn patients receiving dressing changes [(32)](#references-32), fatigue, stigma, and mood in multiple sclerosis patients [(33)](#references-33), and stress and anxiety related to COVID or other isolation [(34)](#references-34) [(35)](#references-35). In various pediatric populations, it reduced stress, mood, and related biomarkers in Latino adolescents [(36)](#references-36), enhanced glycemic control [(10)](#references-10), and reduced recurrent abdominal pain of unknown etiology [(11)](#references-11). Guided imagery has also been used as an adjunct in rehabilitation following stroke [(7)](#references-7), along with dietary modifications to improve irritable bowel syndrome symptoms [(8)](#references-8), and to improve physical activity behavior [(37)](#references-37). Overall, this modality is particularly accessible and easy to adapt for patients with fatigue or high symptom-burden, but is not suggested for patients who are emotionally unstable without directly working with a therapist. Mechanism of Action Neuropsychological studies revealed that many of the mechanisms underlying mental imagery and perception are similar [(25)](#references-25). This suggests that imagery plays an important role in learning, memory, action, and information processing. Physiological responses with imagery are also similar to those with perception. For example, images that conjure fear produce a stress response whereas those that evoke calm and joy produce a relaxation response [(26)](#references-26). Further, data from a randomized trial suggest that positive picture-word cues can improve positive mood in those with dysphoria [(27)](#references-27). Additional research is needed to elucidate the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying mental imagery. Adverse Reactions Guided imagery is generally safe, but caution is advised for patients with a history of trauma, abuse, or mental illness who should work with a therapist to avoid potential triggers [(26)](#references-26).
