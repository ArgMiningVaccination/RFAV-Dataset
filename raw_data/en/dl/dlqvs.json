Herbs and spices have certain compounds called polyphenols that have been shown to improve health in many ways. Foods with polyphenols (fruits, vegetables, herbs, and green tea, etc.) are known for boosting the immune system and their antioxidant properties\u2014 or ability to protect cells from damage. They also may help prevent inflammation, heart disease, strokes, and cancer. Polyphenols may also reduce the risk of infection, diabetes and asthma. Here are just a few of the many culinary herbs to try: | | Basil | | Cilantro | | Sage | | Thyme | | Parsley | | Dill | | Mint | | Chives | | Oregano | | Rosemary | | Tarragon | | Chervil | | Marjoram | | Lavender | | Peppermint | | Savory Storage: - Fresh herbs can be stored in an open or perforated plastic bag in the refrigerator crisper drawer for a few days ,or place a bunch of herbs (stems trimmed) in a jar partially filled with water. Refrigerate the jar of herbs\u2014loosely covered with a plastic bag. (Note: Basil lasts longer in an uncovered jar at room temperature.) - Freeze chopped herbs in ice cube trays covered with water or olive oil. Cover tray with plastic wrap overnight. Transfer frozen cubes to labeled Ziploc. General Cooking Guidelines: - Use 3 times more fresh herbs than dried herbs in recipes. - Add delicate herbs (basil, parsley, dill, chives, cilantro, chives & mint) the last 2 minutes of cooking time or just before serving. Less delicate herbs (oregano, rosemary, sage & thyme) can be added the last 20 minutes of cooking. - Microwaving, simmering and stewing all increase the health benefits of herbs possibly because moist heat helps release the antioxidant compounds. Cooking techniques that involve dry heat cooking, grilling and frying result in decreased antioxidant effects & health benefits. - By seasoning your foods with herbs and spices you should be able to reduce the addition of salt by half. Fun Facts: - Many people think eating spicy foods like chili peppers can cause stomach ulcers. The opposite is true - spicy food actually helps create a more protective lining of the stomach called the mucosa. Chilis, garlic, onions and oregano have all been proven to kill bacteria responsible for ulcers (H. pylori). - Native Americans burned sage leaves to promote balance, a peaceful state of being and to clear negative energy. While this spiritual practice continues today, sage also continues to be studied for benefits such as enhancing memory and attention. - Cinnamon is used in holistic treatments to help prevent and manage arthritis, cholesterol, diabetes and memory loss.
