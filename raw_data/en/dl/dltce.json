Ambient practices hands-on techniques and has state-of-the-art equipment to help restore your ability and renew spirit within your life. Therapy encompasses a wide range of interventions with a common goal: restore function. Our professionals are qualified to work with all types of diagnoses and conditions including low back pain, neck pain, carpal tunnel, tendonitis, rotator cuff syndromes, headaches and whiplash to name a few. Injuries to muscles and ligaments can cause muscle and postural imbalances, not to mention pain. Specific exercises, stretching activities, manual techniques, modalities and lifestyle modifications can help you return to your normal daily activities. We can also perform computerized analysis of the spine, enabling us to determine if your vertebra is too rigid or fluid i.e.: what may be causing your pain or stiffness. Postural Restoration: Posture is a reflection of the \"position\" of the human body. This position creates patterns of movement that indicate our ability or inability to breathe, rotate, and symmetrically relax with the left and right halves of our axial structure. The body often compensates for postural asymmetry during activities. This results in irregular forces through our musculoskeletal system as we contend with gravity. The postural restoration approach restores balance, respiratory mechanics and rotation to alleviate pain. Spinal Decompression. Our Triton Decompression units improve spinal and nerve health by reducing pressures within the spine that cause dysfunction and pain. Spinal decompression has been successful with disc bulges, disc herniations, degenerative disc disease, and arthritis in the spine. Custom Orthotics. Our custom made orthotics help to ensure better function throughout the entire kinetic chain from the head to toe. Abnormal movements at one line, or joint, can interfere with proper movements at other joins. Some patients must have these abnormal forces reduced before they can achieve improved spinal function. Our custom orthotics address the structural problems with the feet, thereby reducing abnormal forces and stresses, while enhancing structural and functional relationships. Many people receive custom orthotics for many different reasons such as plantar fasciitis, heel spurs, knee pain, hip pain, improved athletic performance, leg length discrepancies, sports injuries, and to help through all phases of growth and development. Modalities. We utilize all of the common modalities that may be familiar to you including ultrasound, electrical stimulation, cold laser therapy, as well as splinting and supports. Low Level Laser or Cold Laser Therapy. Low level laser produces light in a narrow frequency. Frequencies in the red portion of the rainbow are shown to assist the healing of soft tissues. Apparently, cells of our body have receptors that are sensitive to light. How can certain frequencies of light speed up or slow down biological processes? Many theories have been suggested, but from practical application with real patients, we know it works for: Wound healing Inflammation reduction Pain management Cell regeneration Scar tissue reduction While scientists debate the mechanism by which low level laser works and publish their work in the scientific literature, our patients are just delighted that "}
