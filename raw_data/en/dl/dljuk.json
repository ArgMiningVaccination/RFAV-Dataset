If you're thinking about visiting a Knoxville, TN, chiropractor for an immune system boost, here's what you need to know. What Is an Adjustment? You may have heard the term \"chiropractic adjustment\" without knowing what it means. Chiropractic adjustments are the foundation of chiropractic care. During an adjustment, a chiropractor carefully manipulates the spine to relieve pain throughout the body. This is an effective treatment method because your entire body is connected to your spine, so relieving spinal pressure is a great way to relieve pain. The Immune System and Spine Just like most parts of your body, your immune system is affected quite a bit by your spine. Not only can compression of nerve pathways make you more susceptible to injuries and illnesses, but it can also leave your body unable to enact its regular defense mechanisms if you do get sick. Plus, stress has a big impact on your immune system. When you combine all these factors, it makes perfect sense that a spinal adjustment can improve your immune system health. Getting Help from a Chiropractor Between COVID-19, the flu, and all the other bugs we're constantly fighting off, having a good immune system is important. A chiropractor can help you achieve this through chiropractic adjustments as well as lifestyle changes. By reducing the amount of stress you're dealing with and helping you decompress, a chiropractor can have a big effect on your health without you having to rely on medication or surgery.
