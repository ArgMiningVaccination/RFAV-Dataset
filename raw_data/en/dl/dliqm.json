Overview of Development and Regulatory Approvals 170 candidate vaccines are in clinical development: 45 in Phase 3 trials, and 11 in Phase 4 trials - Table 1; Figure in COVID -19 Vaccines and Therapeutics Regulatory Tracker (Phases tab). 41 vaccines are approved in various countries, and 39 are at various stages of engagement with WHO for emergency use listing (EUL) . CARPHA -CRS has recommended all 11 COVID -19 vaccines approved for emergency use listing by the WHO to Member States to date - Table 4. The most recent recommendation was CanSino Bio COVID -19 Vaccine, (Ad5.CoV2 -S [Recombinant]) - CONVIDECIA. WHO on 18th August, 2022 published WHO Good practice statement on the use of second booster doses for COVID -19 based on the advice issued by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization. On 24th August, 2022 the World Health Organization (WHO) published Vaccines and immunization for monkeypox: Interim guidance . The interim recommendations for vaccines are: o The first -generation vaccines are not recommended for monkeypox at this time, as they do not meet current safety and manufacturing standards. There are new and safer (second - and third- generation) vaccines for smallpox, some of which may be useful for monk eypox. o Two vaccines (MVA- BN and LC16) have been approved in several jurisdictions for prevention of monkeypox. o The supply of the newer, especially third- generation, vaccines is limited at this time and approaches for enhancing vaccine access are under di scussion. On 18th August, 2022 the EMA's Emergency Task Force, advise s a temporary measure for the intrad ermal use of Imvanex / Jynneos against monkeypox to protect at- risk individuals during the current monkeypox outbreak while supply of the vaccine remains limited . The task force concluded that although the vaccine is only authorised for subcutaneous inject ion (injection under the skin), when given intradermally, a smaller dose of the vaccine can be used. COVID -19 primary series and first booster vaccines' performance against Omicron variant of concern (VOC) is provided from WHO's Weekly Epidemiology Update ( 17th August , 2022): Figure 5 and Table 3. No table or updated information was published in the supplement dated 24th August.

Vaccine Deployment in the Caribbean Up to 26th August, 7,659,596 doses of COVID -19 vaccines have been issued among CARPHA Member States - Table 2. Fifteen CARPHA member states have received vaccine deliveries from COVAX as of 29thth August, 2022 ( approx. 5,029,400 doses). Based on data collected in 24 CARPHA Member States from the Global Change Data Lab's Our World in Data site, between 1.4 6% and 88. 20% of persons have been fully vaccinated (Figures 1 and 2). In CARICOM, coverage ranges from 1.4 6% - 66.54 %. Note: Time points for data presented differ among the CMS (e.g. Country 1 data as of September 2021, Country 4 data as of June 2022). Completed vaccination schedules among all CARPHA Member States range from 1. 5 to 95. 3 doses per capita , based on data from PAHO - Figure 3 ; See COVID -19 Vaccination in the Americas as of 2 6th August, 2022. 3: 22nd August , 2022 FIGURE 1: Share of People fully vaccinated against COVID -19 in CARICOM Member States (as of 29th August 2022) FIGURE 2: Share of People fully vaccinated against COVID -19 in CARICOM Associate s / Other CARPHA Member States (as of 29th August 2022) 4: 22nd August , 2022 FIGURE 3: Completed Schedules of COVID -19 Vaccination per 100 persons (as of 26th August , 2022) Source: PAHO COVID -19 Vaccination in the Americas Dashboard .

Reports of Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFIs) with COVID -19 vaccines to CARPHA VigiCarib CARPHA's Caribbean Regulatory System (CRS) assists Member States with the collection of reports of adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) (also known as Events Supposedly Attributable to Vaccination or Immunization (ESAVIs)) following the use of COVID -19 vaccines. As of 26th August, 2022 CARPHA- CRS has received 60 reports: 59 AEFI case reports via its online reporting form since its launch in August, 2021. Amongst all the AEFI case reports 18 were considered as 'Serious' including one death. Of note, 1 of the case report received was determined to be ' non-AEFI '. All reports are submitted to the national focal points within one business day of receipt. CARPHA notes that the AEFI case reports received by the CRS are subject to verification and/or investigation by the local authorities . 6: 22nd August , 2022 From global (WHO) and regional databases for safety monitorin g: 1,593 case reports of AEFI s in CARICOM have been reported as of 26th August 2022. Aggregate reporting rate from the CARICOM countries reporting to the global database is 67.0 AEFIs per 100,000 doses. Common reactions (>10%): headache, fever, dizziness, fatigue, chills, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea and vaccination site pain. 7: 22nd August , 2022 Figure 5: WHO Summary of Vaccine effectiveness (VE) of primary series and first booster vaccination against the Omicron variant of concern Dots represent point estimates of VE from each study; dark black horizontal lines represent median VE across all studies in s tratum. All data is from a systematic review of COVI D-19 VE studies; methods and summary tables of VE studies can be found on view -hub.org. Vertical panels represent VE for full primary series (grey dots) and VE for homologous or heterologous booster vaccination (other colored dots) following completion of primary series vaccination with vaccine of primary series noted in panel header. All booster VE estimates are for first boost er dose. Severe disease includes hospitalization, and pneumonia; symptomatic disease includes disease of any severity level; any in fection can include symptomatic and asymptomatic infection. Additional details on the methods for inclusion of the estimates in the plots provided in text. 8: 22nd August , 2022 Figure 5 summarizes the impact of the Omicron variant on absolute vaccine effectiveness (VE) over time, grouped by the primary series vaccine; booster doses may have been a different vaccine (i.e., both homologous and heterologous booster vaccination VEs are shown). Additional info rmation on vaccine performance against VOCs can also be found in Annex 3.

Arrows generalize the magnitude of reduction in VE or neutralization: \"\" indicates <2 -fold reduction; \"\" indicates 2 5 to <10 -FOLD REDUCTION; \"\" indicates 10 -fold reduction. When more than one neutralization study is available, the interquartile range (25th and 75th percentiles) of fold -reductions across all studies for specific vaccine/sublineage was used. HNR indicates a median percent response across all studies of <75%; in these instances, fold- reductions can be biased and, thus are not presented. The number of studies is shown as subscripts. Additional notes Studies contributing to the table are identified from an ongoing review of the preprint and published literature on neutralization of SARS -CoV-2 variants by COVID -19 vaccines. Studies that use samples collected more than seven days and less than six months after complete vaccination and that use an ancestral strain as the reference are includ ed in the table. Studies of immunocompromised persons are excluded. It is important to note that studies vary in population and other methodological considerations, which may in part explain some differences when comparing products between differen t studies. In addition, the reductions summarized in the table do not incorporate uncertainty intervals around the degree of reductions, which can vary substantially across studies when reported.
