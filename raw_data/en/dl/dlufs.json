There is no contraindication of utilizing these 4 different types of therapies at the same time. | | Will acupuncture hurt? It is normal if you feel very short pain from the insertion of the needle through your skin. Having said that, the needle is as thin as 1 strand of hair. Many clients who express that they have anxiety about the needles will, for the most part, not even feel the needles that are inserted. Other sensations that are normal to experience during your treatment includes: heavy, dull, achy, radiating symptoms, and a sensation that there's a needle where there actually isn't one. | | How should I dress? Come dressed in loose and comfortable clothing. A gown is provided if you need to change into a gown. During your appointment, I will explain to you about your treatment and which parts of your body she will need access to in order to treat. Only the necessary body parts will be uncovered. Do note that acupuncture points are not chosen just at the site of the problem. For example: lower back pain will not be treated with just needles local to that area. | | Address 46 Cloninger Mill Rd, NE, Suite E Hickory, NC 28601 | | Telephone | | Email (best way to contact) "}
