In this role, he was able to meet and speak to a host of health practitioners who had unique approaches to human wellness and health. The more he learned, the more fascinated he became with nutrition and supplementation, and their impact on health. Started with Lysine In the early days of our company, David met an herbalist who had developed a revolutionary cold sore treatment based on L-lysine (lysine) and other botanical ingredients. The information she shared with David on the effectiveness of this natural health product was truly impressive, which led Quantum Health to agree to market the product under our own brand name. This was the birth of SuperLysine+ Cold Sore Ointment. Today, the SuperLysine+ brand includes the top selling cold sore treatment in the natural channel, along with SuperLysine+ tablets, which are the nations top selling lysine supplement. More than a decade later in 1997, after achieving tremendous success with SuperLysine+ in the natural channel, we saw the opportunity to expand our cold sore ointment to grocery stores, drug stores, and mass market retailers. But, before we could launch in these channels, our product needed a face-lift so that it could have a better chance of succeeding in these highly competitive chains. Enter Lip Clear Lysine+, our new brand marketing the same cold sore ointment that was already loved by millions. When we launched Lip Clear in 1997, we became the first natural products company to place an herbal / nutrient product in drug and grocery stores right alongside traditional over-the-counter products. Fast forward more than 20 years, and Lip Clear Lysine + is one of the top selling cold sore treatments in the country, and the fastest growing cold sore ointment among major brands. We retained our placements in these stores because the product works, and in fact, is the only cold sore treatment that both cuts healing time in half and relieves pain. Zinc and Immune Support Shortly after the launch of SuperLysine+, a revolutionary research paper was published in 1984 by Dr. George A Eby, which showed clear evidence that zinc gluconate lozenges could support the immune system when it is compromised. After reading the research, David saw the immediate potential to launch a product based on Dr. Eby's research. He contacted Dr. Eby, and with his help and advice, launched the TheraZinc brand in 1985. In so doing, Quantum Health became the first company to commercially offer a zinc gluconate lozenge for immune support. Today, TheraZinc is one of the leading immune support brands in the natural channel, and is also available in many grocery stores and drug stores. In 2017, we made TheraZinc even better when we launched 2 varieties of USDA Organic TheraZinc lozenges, which are among the best tasting zinc lozenges available today. At the same time, we launched the first and only USDA Organic cough drop in two premium flavors. Whole Lota Buzz In 1996, one of our employees talked to David about an idea she had for a new product. She had young children, and loved to spend time with them outdoors. Offering her kids up as lunch to the mosquitoes obviously wasn't an option, but she had concerns around DEET, which is the active chemical ingredient in most mosquito repellent. Some research has shown that DEET is a harsh chemical that is quickly absorbed into the bloodstream through the skin. It had been linked to some worrisome health concerns, which seemed to be more acute for young children. She had heard that it would even melt plastic, which obviously made her reluctant to spray it on her kids. Her hope was that a biological solution could win over artificial chemistry. There were studies that suggested that natural health products containing essential oils, such as citronella, could be effective at repelling mosquitoes. David loved the idea, and got to work on what would become Buzz Away, one of the original plant based mosquito repellents sold in the natural channel. Today, our original Buzz Away formula is still sold throughout the United States in stores that sell natural products, and is one of the few plant-based repellents that is also EPA registered. Our company didn't stop there, though. Over the years, researchers continued to discover additional plant-based essential oils that were effective at repelling mosquitoes and ticks. Knowing we could do better, we developed a new formula and launched it as Buzz Away Extreme, an improvement on our original formula. Today, Buzz Away Extreme is the top selling plant-based repellent in the natural products channel, because it is DEET-free, effective, and family friendly. The Eyes Have It Eye health has always been important to our company. In the late 1990's, we launched a product called See, which was one of the very first science-based eye health supplements available in the United States. It included lutein and other ingredients that had been shown to support eye health over a person's lifetime. Since the 1990's, there has been extensive research conducted that has radically advanced our understanding of how nutrition contributes to eye health. We weren't content to continue to sell a product that was based on outdated research, so we decided to do more than make minor improvements to See. Instead, we decided to start over and launch a whole new line of eye health supplements based on the absolute latest research. We couldn't do it alone, though. That is why we reached out to Dr. James Stringham, one of the world's foremost eye health researchers, who is a researcher at the Duke University Eye Center, and who had previously worked in the US Air Force Research Laboratory to enhance visual performance in military personnel. Dr. Stringham was excited about the idea of turning his research, and the research of his respected peers, into a real-world eye health supplement that could have the potential to improve the eye health of millions of people. He agreed to formulate our line of eye health products, where were launched in 2018. The line includes Macula 30+, which is formulated to promote macular health as you age, Digital Blue, which helps eyes filter high energy blue light from digital devices, and See Lutein+, which is an everyday, foundational eye health supplement at an affordable price. Our line of eye health products are sold in all of the top natural health products stores throughout the US and Canada. Complete Natural Products In addition to the brands mentioned above, Quantum Health also sells a line of Sambucus nigra Elderberry products for immune support, MigShield, which is a supplement for cerebrovascular support, and a line of skin care and repair products. Digital Innovation Innovation is a part of our company soul, but not just in the products we develop and offer to our loyal consumers. In 1996, we became one of the very first natural products companies to offer natural health products online when we launched this website, quantumhealth.com. The site has operated continuously ever since, making it one of the oldest websites in the natural health products space. "}
