While it shares the same name, this ultrasound is not the same as that used diagnostically to screen the body internally. What is Therapeutic Ultrasound? Ultrasound emits small sound waves at an extremely high frequency that is out of the range of human hearing. When applied to problem areas in soft tissues and joints, it produces heat that helps reduce inflammation and increase blood flow, in addition to decreasing pain, stiffness, and spasms. Therapeutic ultrasound is also believed to have a positive effect on the healing process. How Does Therapeutic Ultrasound Work? While its effects and goals are different from ultrasound screening technologies, ultrasound therapy is implemented in much the same way. The process may be familiar if you've ever had an ultrasound screening in the past. An ultrasound emitting 'wand' will be passed over your skin across the pain point or injury. We will apply ultrasound gel to your skin to reduce friction and allow for better transmission of the ultrasound waves. Despite the deep-tissue heat applied during the therapy, you typically will feel little or no heat at all. Therapeutic ultrasound has been shown to facilitate the body's healing process at the most basic cellular level.
