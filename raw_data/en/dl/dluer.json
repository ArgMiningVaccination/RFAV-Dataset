Our Meditation Aromatherapy Spray can be used to help deepen your meditations. To use, simply 'Shake to Activate' and then set your intention. As you spray, say something simple like: \"I ask for help to deepen my mediation.\" This Crystal Infused Aromatherapy Spray is made of 100% Therapeutic Essential Oils, which are Certified Organic. This Spray is infused with 9 healing Crystals that were chosen to amplify the intention of the Spray. We chose Snowflake Obsidian, as the Crystal for this Spray, because it helps you surrender in meditation. This Meditation Aromatherapy Spray is custom blended, after each order is placed, which guarantees freshness. The Essential Oil blend that we offer in this Aromatherapy Spray was created based on TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) principles, and our knowledge of the healing properties of Crystals.
