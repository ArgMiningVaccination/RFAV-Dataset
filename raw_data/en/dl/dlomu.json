The patient suffered a fall resulting in extensive bruising and was admitted to hospital two days later. On admission the patient's INR was raised (6.2); although the INR was corrected, the patient's condition deteriorated and they passed away. The patient's INR was reported to be well controlled on warfarin before beginning the herbal medicine. The use of CAMs is extensive amongst the elderly, as high as 27.7% according to one US study [1](#1). Concomitant use of CAMs with conventional medicines, both prescription and non-prescription is also widespread in the elderly [2](#2). Herbal products may interact with anticoagulants in a number of different ways [3](#3). For example, mistletoe may have coagulant activity, while products such as feverfew, garlic, ginger and ginkgo may have anticoagulant activity [3](#3). Meadowsweet, poplar and willow may contain salicylate components and St John's wort has been suggested to increase the metabolism and clearance of some anticoagulants [1](#1), [3](#3). Research has shown that over 40% of patients do not discuss the use of CAMs with their doctor [4](#4). This has also been seen in a New Zealand study, where 54% of patients had not discussed their CAM use with their oncologist [5](#5). Prescribers and pharmacists are in a key position to determine those patients who are taking both CAMs and conventional medicines concurrently. Healthcare professionals are reminded to ask patients about use of CAMs and to report any suspected adverse drug reactions to the Centre for Adverse Reactions Monitoring (CARM).
