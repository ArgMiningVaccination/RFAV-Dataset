It is a great deal more, and there's a reason men are often concerned about their testosterone levels. Generally speaking, laymen understand that testosterone has to do with their libido and sexual function. They also understand that testosterone affects their hair growth, the deepening of their voice, and their transformation from boys to men. There's a lot more that testosterone is responsible for, such as the production of sperm, muscle mass, muscle strength, production of red blood cells, fat distribution, and bone mass. It therefore affects not just the libido, but the entire body. In addition to affecting men's physical health, lower testosterone levels also have an adverse impact on their psychological, mental, and emotional well-being. A comprehensive, holistic method of treatment is best-suited to ensure long-term successful outcomes, which is possible through integrative medicine and therapies. Understanding Testosterone\u2014and How it Affects Men It is common knowledge that boys aged 12 or 13 begin to go through several physical and hormonal changes. These changes\u2014referred to as puberty\u2014are caused by the development of the testes and the production of testosterone. The brain increases the production of a chemical called luteinizing hormone, which stimulates the testes to increase testosterone production. Testosterone, plus a substance called Androgen Binding Protein (ABP), are produced by the testes. ABP helps raises the levels of testosterone in the testes. Ultimately, as a result of all these factors, boys' bodies undergo changes that allow them to develop into mature adult men.. These changes include: - Enlargement of the reproductive organs, relative ducts, and glands - Increased libido - Hair growth - Enlargement of the larynx, which leads to a deepening of the voice - Thickening of the skin, with increased sebum secretion - Increased muscle mass - Thickening of the bones, with increased calcium retention - Increased production of red blood cells Testosterone, then, defines men, so to speak. Its physical effects include the transformation into \"men\"\u2014with bigger bodies and prominent muscle mass, a deep voice and body hair growth: characteristics that men associate with the concept of \"manliness.\" When testosterone levels wane too much, men start observing rotundity. They begin to lose hair, their joints may ache, and their muscle mass is similarly diminished. Often thee most concerning to the patient, however, is the decline (or even loss) of libido\u2014the sex drive. Their semen production also diminishes and in some cases there is a visible reduction in the size of the testicles. The psychological effects stem in part from the physical. The decline of characteristics that define masculinity can affect men profoundly, potentially causing stress, depression, and anxiety. However lower testosterone will also directly result in issues such as decreased drive/willpower, irritability, and depression. Reduction of testosterone is thus an important issue, which is ideally dealt with in an integrative, holistic manner. The Relation Between Aging and Reduction of Testosterone Aging is associated with a reduction in testosterone. Although perhaps not realized by many, the male body also relies on sufficient amounts of estrogen, which is necessary for physical development, as well as sexual function. Testosterone is converted into estradiol - a form of estrogen - by fat tissue. As the aging process occurs, both testoserone and estrogen levels decline. According to [Harvard Health Publishing](https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/Testosterone_aging_and_the_mind), in healthy men in their forties, total testosterone ranges from 252 to 916 ng/dl. The level peaks in the late teens or early 20's, and slowly declines year after year.. As they reach their fifties, mens' testosterone declines to a range of 215-878 ng/dl.. The number wanes even further as they move into their 60s and 70s. It should also be noted that a number of other [factors](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/91/4/1336/2843369) contribute to a decline in testosterone levels. These include: - Greater BMI - Poor overall health - Low SHBG In the USA, the elderly are making up an ever-larger percentage of the population. The [Census Bureau's statistics](https://www.census.gov/history/pdf/babyboomers-boc-2014.pdf) reveal that by 2029 over20% of the country's population will be over 65 years old. Since testosterone declines with age, and the percent of the population made consisting of older men is ever-increasing, it stands to reason that the number and percentage of men who may benefit from testosterone replacement is also on the rise. After 40 years of age, if you suspect low testosterone, it is worthwhile to visit a clinic like Vitality Integrative medicine to be assessed by a specialist. The Many Causes Although aging seems to be one of the major causes of lower testosterone levels, there are various others. . Other than aging, the following causes can be responsible for testosterone deficiency: - Injuries - Infections - Medication, such as those that are used to treat conditions like prostate cancer - Corticosteroid drugs - Loss of testicles - Alcoholism - Chemotherapy - Radiation for cancer treatment - Chronic illness - Obesity, particularly if there is increased girth around the belly - Abnormalities that have been inherited (such as the Klinefelter's Syndrome wherein men have an additional X chromosome) - Excessive iron in the body - Kidney failure - Stress Testosterone Replacement Testosterone replacement is one of the therapies utilized in the field of integrative medicine. Men who have receive testosterone replacement therapy may experience significant positive changes. These changes include: - Increased energy - Improved libido - Better mood Although it is quite natural for individual mens' testosterone levels to vary between each other considerably, when it gets too low for any individual, it can seriously impact their quality of life. Some of the symptoms that testosterone replacement therapy helps manage are: - Disturbed sleep patterns - Lack of focus - Stress, anxiety, and depression - Fatigue - Obesity - Low sex drive Recognition of the various symptoms can help men realize that they may have testosterone deficiency - a very treatable condition. At Vitality Integrative Medicine in Sherman Oaks, experienced professionals prescribe the pertinent therapy in a controlled and safe manner. What sets integrative medicine apart from conventional methods of approaching this particular problem is the fact that integrative doctors do not focus on the individual complication in isolation. The underlying issues that contribute to and cause the issue are also addressed. A set of methods and therapies - which may include lifestyle changes - are prescribed. Targeted nutritional supplementation may also be employed, according to the unique needs of the individual client. How Testosterone Replacement Therapy Works At Vitality Integrative Medicine's Sherman Oaks based integrative medical clinic, physicians deem it most important to first determine whether or not the testosterone levels have really declined. This is done with a simple blood test. The testing can also help the doctor determine how much they have declined, and if [testosterone replacement therapy](https://www.vitalityintegrative.com/testosterone-replacement-therapy) or other therapies are warranted. If testosterone replacement is necessary, the therapy itself can be carried out in 4 ways, depending on which method the doctor decides is best for the particular candidate: 1. Transdermal Patch This is a skin patch, which is applied to the arm or to a part of the upper body. The patch is replaced with a new one daily. 2. Gels and Creams Testosterone gels and creams, like the patch, can penetrate through the skin when applied. They may be applied to the shoulders, arms, or even the skin right around the anus, which has a very good absorption rate. The correct amount and concentration is determined by your doctor. Some gels may also be applied inside the nose. 3. Mouth Tablets Tablets which stick to the gums are also available. The tablets are applied twice a day. They release testosterone directly into the oral tissues, and from there make their way to the blood stream. 4. Injections A more direct method of improving testosterone levels is to inject it directly into one's muscles. The injections are done anywhere from twice a week to once every two weeks. Some prefer this method because they don't have to do something every day. This route gets into the bloodstream more efficiently, but may be associated with greater risk of red blood cell elevation. Lifestyle Changes for Improved Testosterone Levels Integrative Medicine is all about treating the body, the mind, and the spirit collectively. The combined care results in better management of symptoms and can more effectively address underlying issues that affect the condition. Science also supports the fact that certain lifestyle changes can have a positive impact and can help improve testosterone levels. According to [University of Utah physicians](https://healthcare.utah.edu/the-scope/shows.php?shows=0_5j1k1sf1), the following lifestyle changes can impact a man's testosterone levels for the better: - Weight control - Exercise - Regular, satisfactory sleep cycles - Curbing alcohol intake.
