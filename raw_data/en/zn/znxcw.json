First thing that happened when I got diagnosed with the terrible debilitating incurable disease was that my mother urged me to see the famous holistic doctor in Seattle. I was surprised to find his office in a strip mall, his waiting room always under construction, with sheets of milky plastic flapping across holes where doors and windows had once been. This gave an especially pathetic aspect to the stricken, who looked like citizens of a Soviet republic that no longer existed. Perhaps because they trembled in their winter coats. Oh right, I had to remind myself: Now you are one of the stricken. Where we trembled in our winter coats. 2. The famous holistic doctor could not retain in his care all those who made appeals, so he passed me along to another doctor in his clinic, a woman whose pink complexion I took to be an indicator of health. But she was very fat, and this made me suspicious of her advice, which pertained mainly to my diet and my ingestion of the expensive vitamins she had me buy. Simultaneously, I felt queasy about my prejudice regarding her size, which revealed the shallowness of my character. So I returned diligently to my appointments though she also had an irksome habit of hugging me before I left. For a while I carried around a knapsack full of vitamin bottles. In those days my sorrow slaked on such rare occasions that I felt like an observer long-drenched, when suddenly a sunbeam shoots through a thunderhead. Because I was both young and sad, during this phase of my treatment I also went to London to track down a man I loved, and there the slaking happened when I found an exhibit in the British Museum of watercolors painted by the poet William Blake. They were displayed behind little velvet curtains so as not to be faded by even the dim museum light. Each time I lifted my arm to lift the cloth, the vitamins rattled like an aboriginal percussion instrument, like a gourd full of soft pebbles, background music that played while Nebuchadnezzar crawled on his knees and after Satan inflicted the boils on Job. 3. The doctor in practice with the famous holistic doctor urged me to remove the fillings in my teeth because they contained the toxin mercury. She recommended a dentist in Tacoma who specialized in this procedure. The filling particles were so poisonous that his assistant used a device like a Dustbuster to suck them away as he worked with his drill. I was also instructed to drink a special soup called \"Bieler's broth,\" which contained a variety of green vegetables cooked in bouillon. I felt inexplicably foolish making it from his recipe, particularly when it came time to drink the bland puree. Its pleasant banal taste insulted me, as if I were a sick child needing to be comforted, when my system really cried out for an herb to be shocked with. Yet what I liked about this guy was how he didn't engage in the annoying trademark behavior of dentists: asking questions when your mouth is full of tools. Instead he kept up a steady comic patter with his assistant, while his office stereo played what is sometimes known as \"novelty music.\" In particular I remember the song \"Guitarzan,\" a semi-spoken word number that gave both the dentist and his assistant the chance to chime in, respectively, as Tarzan and Jane. Tarzan mumbled a low-pitched rhyme, while Jane's high wail was supposed to conjure a woman clinging to a vine, swooping through the trees. 4. My coworkers at the small college where I worked of course gave me advice about alternative forms of healing that they'd found to be of use. An education professor gave me a book by the famous Ayurvedic doctor who'd not yet become famous. In the book he made an obvious point that nonetheless was stunning to me: how the mind says Now my leg will move and a complex biochemical process is unleashed that in fact causes the leg to move. So I thought: Now my leg will move. But it didn't. 5. And a sociology professor gave me the name of her Chinese doctor in Seattle. His office was in the international district, where I liked to go to a pet store whose narrow aisles were crowded with fish tanks. The tanks invariably contained dead fish, which nobody got exercised enough about to remove. I read this as a sign of clear-headedness\u2014mortality was not to be afraid of. The doctor's English was barely decipherable to me, and I understood that I represented just a small subset of his patients too stupid to be able to speak Chinese. He responded the same way Americans do when traveling abroad and wishing to be understoodmade his voice so loud I cowered. \"Stick out your tongue!\" he commanded. Then he consulted his big book of tongues, whose photos' lurid colors so contrasted with their orderly array that they left me dizzy. \"It is the liver!\" he shouted after a few minutes of flipping. Taking a Q-tip and unwinding the cotton from one of its ends, he stabbed a spot inside my ear. I understood him clearly when he said I should do this throughout the day, hard enough to hurt. 6. When I first moved to this town there was only one therapist who practiced the technique called \"jin shin jitsu.\" She also was a counselor, so our sessions comprised two distinct halves. First I would weep and then she would touch me. She placed her hands on two different topographical features of my body, say nose and shoulder, creating a kind of circuit while soothing music played. Soothing music annoys me, at least until my annoyance builds up enough momentum to burst through to surrender like the car leaping through the paper skin inside the hoop of flame. But I grew suspicious, as our weeks of weep-and-touch went by, that she wanted to cut down on the weeping and up the touching half. I got the impression she didn't think I was gaining ground on my misery quickly enough. And was it just me, or had she changed her manner of offering the tissue box? Where once had been her tentative nudge, was there now a disgruntled thrust? 7. It was in my hunt to score some vitamin B shots that I learned of Dr. Nimms, whose office I found\u2014oddly\u2014in a residential apartment complex south of town. The person who mentioned his name was the same woman who'd sent me to the Chinese doctor in Seattle, and she confided that, though she knew he gave the shots, she wouldn't necessarily recommend him. She'd seen him for a case of strep throat and had allowed him to give her a pelvic exam because he said he needed to check for signs of yeast. Then she learned other women had filed complaints. Though her humiliation obviously pained her, she was grateful for his recipe for a delicious soup that she still made. No, she said in answer to my question, it was not called Bieler's broth. Dr. Nimms himself answered the door of his apartment/office, which was long and narrow, with a windowless storage room between the front office (no receptionist) and the back bedroom, which served now as his examination room. Before he gave me the shot, he asked a dozen questions, mostly standard ones. When he asked if I had any sexual dysfunction, I said with uncharacteristic self-assertion: Why do you want to know? \"Sexual dysfunction is indicative of many underlying conditions,\" he answered, backpedaling but not quite defensive: it seemed as if he knew I knew. But soon he gave up on his line of questioning and administered the shot into my buttocks, after I cinched down my skirt as few inches as necessary in the storage room. Afterward he said, \"I believe there is hope for you. I had another patient with multiple sclerosis who came here crying\"\u2014here he did a pantomime of a woman in distress\u2014\"and now she is getting married, after I made her better.\" He lifted his shirt and swatted his chest with his hands. \"Guess how old I am!\" Sixty? \"Almost seventy! And I win swimming competitions with men half my age.\" And his body was remarkably taut\u2014it was only his eyes that looked defeated. Their black interiors not taut at all but more like raisins, a desiccated fruit. 8. Soon I learned that I could get the B shots from a naturopath. The one whose office was nearest where I worked specialized in colon irrigation. She wore heels and tight-fitting brightly colored business suits that did not flatter her figure. This amused me because, soon into our first meeting, she told me about how she'd been so constipated as a child that she moved her bowels only once a week. Her parents kept a stick by the toilet so she could chop her stools before she flushed, and though she must have told the story all the time it amused her too, so much so that afterward she'd use a tissue to blot the mascara stains that were ruining the rest of her makeup, before she signaled that it was time to return to more sober work by hitching down her skirt where it had ridden up her thighs, having skidded along the shimmering surface of her nylons. 9. Kombucha is the name of a rubbery fungus that resembles a moon-glo frisbee. My first job associated with its care was to procure a large pickle jar to keep it in, as though it were a pet like a snake in need of a terrarium. It lived by floating\u2014quivering it seemed\u2014on a lagoon of sweet green tea. Clouds and specks and ghostly tentacles appeared, drifting below it in the jar. Fermentation caused the tea to taste like apple cider vinegar, and each day I was supposed to siphon off a cup to drink. The brew was said to have healing powers that I never investigated too thoroughly, though my mushroom, which I obtained from a friend, came with a sheaf of xeroxed testimonials. Kombucha replicates by spawning a twin, a flat clone that grows slowly until its thickness equals the parent's. This meant that each week brought a new fungus to be given away, and soon all my friends had their own mushrooms\u2014the mushroom's curative powers were general enough to suit all our needs. Our collective fungal propagation came to be a civic rite that required an ever-increasing group of participants, like a pyramid or Ponzi scheme, and everybody knew it couldn't go on forever. The end may have been foreshadowed in all the ghost-gook our creatures produced. We didn't dare stare at our jars too long. Soon we began procrastinating about the chores of making the tea and pulling apart the new offspring, until we all had layer on layer of the tan mushrooms, pleated like accordions left to rot in tannic puddles in the middle of a rainy woods. Which is where we eventually left them. 10. The friend who gave me the mushroom that united so many of us for just a season lived on a shoestring, yet she invested in a machine called \"The Voyager.\" When I ask her now how she came to possess it she doesn't remember: the afflicted are never at a loss for people who show up on their doorstep with a tool or a pill to sell. This is a form of celebrity, to learn that one's name is being whispered in far-off rooms, circulating through town. And yet the vendors are sincere, having talked themselves into sincerity so as to convince themselves they are not swindlers. The Voyager could be set to various modes: Relaxation, Energy, Sleep. Put on its black visor and shooting stripes or dots appeared, like when you hurt yourself and reflexively your eyes clamp shut. When my friend loaned me The Voyager I found its painlessness disorienting: its visions looked like they'd been birthed by trauma and so I thought pain should accompany them. Every so often I'd take The Voyager off to orient myself once again to the non-Voyager world. Then I'd scan myself and become angry enough when nothing hurt that the whole purpose of my altered consciousness seemed to be defeated. 11. Let's see, there was evening primrose oil, niacin, olive extract, garlic, flax seed oil, grape lecithin, coenzyme Q10. Though I forget why I took them, some names I remember simply for their jangly quilt of syllables: pycnogenol, sphingolin. This last pill was made from cow brains, and I thought it made sense to ingest the neural coating that my immune system was attacking. If I ate a bit each day, I thought my body might get used to it. Then mad cow disease became all the rage and made my theory seem imprudent. 12. Being afflicted is expensive because hope will make a person throw a lot of coins into its wishing well. The clinking of these coins creates a communal music, to which ever-changing subsets of people dance, which makes affliction maybe half-interesting enough to compensate for the fact that it is affliction after all. The strange thing about the Bee Lady was that she charged a pittance for her services. She lived in a fine home by the water, distinguished by the lovely gardens she'd created on its grounds. Her bee work occurred in a rustic cabin amid the vegetables and flowers. My friend had been getting stung three times a week, building up her tolerance. Now that the stings belong to the middle ground of her past, she says they ruined her life: \"puking, burning, in pain . . . etc.\" But all I could think of was Peter Rabbit the one time I went there with her. The Bee Lady had pulled sixty bees from their hive before we came. She kept them in a jar where she sprayed them with honey solution to keep them calmly engaged in their compulsive grooming. My friend lay face down shirtless on a table while the bee lady extracted them one at a time with a pair of wooden tongs. By pressing bee to skin, she coaxed it to sting, making two broad stripes that ran down both sides of my friend's spine. After each bee had stung she put it into a different jar, the jar of goners. She left all the stingers in place until the end. They looked like tiny black rose thorns when finally she tweezed them out. Then she asked if I wanted to be stung\u2014this seemed a too-conscious act of charity, and reflexively I refused it. But I was glad she coaxed me until I pointed shyly to my knee. One more bee in the dead jar, and I too was admitted into the club of pain. Later that week when my friend came over my knee was still big though the swelling had withered somewhat, like an old cantaloupe. We stood in my garden, which was nothing like the Bee Lady's\u2014it was wedged in a little spot between the woodshed and the alley, through which the rats trundled on their way to the dumpsters at the fast food restaurants. When I asked how her stings felt, my friend pulled off her shirt to show the hundreds of scabs that ran along the valley of her spine. Some were fresh and some were faded: altogether their color made the speckled brown of many lizards, and they also reminded me of a lizard's decorative dorsal ridges. In my garden full of dry weeds she looked as stupendous as a dinosaur. 13. Though I was skeptical by now, hope niggled me, as always, when I entered the famous psychic healer's house. Because it was the students of the psychic healer and not the psychic healer herself who'd be doing the healing, it was being offered free. This made me wonder if the healing would be second rate. Partly my hope percolated from the fact that I'd walked with my crutches through her muddy yard. I even climbed unaided into my designated elevated cot, though in my enthusiasm I forgot to take off my shoes. When this was called to my attention I removed them before settling back into place while the psychic healer gave her introductory speech. There were many cots set up in her living room: one student each. With the shades drawn against the day, the air full of motes, she said the students were going to form a net of energy. We could expect sensations of such profundity that they might cause us to weep, and afterwards we might even see \"manifestations\"\u2014particles of matter on our cots where our illness had fallen out of our bodies. Then the dulcimer music began to ding, and the students made the net. I squinted and thought I could even see the rays of energy between them. Time collapsed like a telescope: I think I fell asleep. When the lights came up, we were all given cups of water. My student said: \"Look, you have manifestations.\" A few brown specks like mouse turds lay on the sheet. For a moment I grew elated to see how my disease had fallen out. Then I remembered the mud on my shoes. \"No I think these are manifestations,\" my student said. And the psychic healer was called over for consultation. Manifestations, yes! The room erupted then, all because of me. 14. The pale homeopath had sad limp hair. Her office was only open part time because she had to take dialysis every other afternoon. She gave me a physical exam and questioned me in detail about my youth. What about my youth? I said, and she said, you know, what kind of kid I was. I described myself as moody and when she asked me to elaborate I said for example I remember daydreaming more than once about taking a kitchen knife and stabbing it into my chest. All my answers she recorded in detailed notes. Then she looked up my condition in the big musty ancient homeopathy book that a man she called \"her mentor\" had written. Every morning he poured a pitcher of ice water down his spine, and she urged me to do the same. And she gave me the tiniest of yellow pills that, under scientific scrutiny, would be found to contain only sugar\u2014this she freely admitted. One part active substance, diluted a millionfold. She concluded by reading back the notes she'd taken to make sure she had recorded all pertinent information: \"you daydreamed of stabbing a kitchen knife into your chest,\" and though she said this quickly and without emotion, as if it were a summary of the weather, it still filled me with shame. 15. The other day I saw my former acupuncturist at the farmer's market. He's hard to recognize because he is short now, whereas he was once a tall man with a wild fringe of dark hair that circled his head like a lion's mane and which lent a devilish, or maybe I should say wizardly, aspect to his appearance. He looked as if he should have been wearing a robe covered in stars. But he wore sweatpants to indulge his catlike movements. What caused his growing shorter was the disintegration of his spine, from a form of bone cancer that should have killed him, but didn't. His shrinkage does not seem as much of a transformation as his rigid posture does. No more cat. When I ask how he accounts for his survival, he tells me he did both Eastern medicine and Western, alternative and mainstream; he flew to Europe, he tracked down every remedy and tried them all. I know that for a while we both walked with crutches, but then he got better while I got worse. Our conversation flags when it becomes obvious that our luck is riding opposite seats on fortune's wheel. But I don't want to be so miserly of spirit as to be jealous. Instead I salute him: Soldier carry on! Then stiffly he ambles off, down the aisles of organic vegetable stalls, which have been erected under white tents like the field hospitals of the Civil War. 16. Stabilized aloe vera gel, emu oil (7%), methylsulfonyl methane, horse chestnut extract. Comfrey extract, calendula extract, chamomile extract, vitamins A, D3, and E, glucosamine sulfate, allantoin, panthenol, diazolidinyl urea. This is a list of the active ingredients in the super strength Blue-Emu cream I've just bought. For three days now I have been using it to see if it will ease the scratched-by-broken-glass sensation in my lower legs. I take enough prescription drugs to put to sleep an elephant, and still the sensation will not abate. But since this emu cream . . . I don't know. It costs twelve dollars for a two-week supply, and it has given me the softest shins. "}
