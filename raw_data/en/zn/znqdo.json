World-class research universities,highly skilled technical workers and a proactivebusiness climate combine to make Iowa the smart idea for careers in biotechnology and other life sciences. Iowa's major life sciences employers are some of the most recognized names in the field. They include Iowa Health System; Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.; Monsanto; Pioneer. A DuPont rans Wacker Biochem Corporation. World-Class Employers Employing 11,500 people statewide, Iowa Health System (IHS) is one of Iowa's largest employers, as well as its largest healthcare provider. Created in 1993, IHS is the state's first and largest integrated healthcare system. It includes major hospitals in Cedar Rapids, Des Moines, Dubuque, Fort Dodge, the Quad Cities, Sioux City and Waterloo, as well as several community hospitals across Iowa. A member of IHS, Iowa Methodist Medical Center is Iowa's largest private hospital. In 1993, the hospital's John Stoddard Cancer Center became the first central Iowa facility tohouse radiation, oncology and ancillary services in one location. Reaching beyond com-passionate cancer care, IHS is also revolutionizing medical treatment through human gene therapy research. Its Human Gene Therapy Research Institute is developing new methods and applications of human gene therapy for cancer prevention, treatment and cure. The Institute has developed innovative medical techniques that allow the delivery of new genes into cells to replace missing or defective genes. Scientists at the Institute aredeveloping new gene delivery vehicles or vectors to target specific cells and are studying ways to activate the immune system to attack cancer cells in the body. In another cancer breakthrough, scientists at the Institute have developed protocols that involve selectivelykilling tumor cells while sparing healthy cells. A genetically altered virus delivers a geneinto the tumor cells, changing the cells so they can be selectively destroyed with nontoxicmedication. In 1996, the Institute became the nation's first community-based clinicalfacility to receive FDA approval to produce genetically engineered drugs.

From its main facility inIowa City, IDT's active research program contributes to a growing patent portfolio and increasing career opportunities. Since 1987, IDT has been a major force in advancing biotechnology researchas a supplier of custom oligonucleotidesynthesis and developer of innovative new biotechnologies. Co-founded by Dr. Joseph Walder, a biochemistry professor at TheUniversity of Iowa College of Medicine,IDT is the world's premier custom oligonucleotide supplier \u2014 serving 14,000 customers worldwide. Walder established the university's first facility for nucleic acid synthesis \u2014 thefuel that drives the biotechnology revolution \u2014 and pioneered breakthrough technologies, including a method for cross-linking a hemoglobin derivative, the Cycling ProbeTechnology and the chimeric \"Gap-mer\" structure. Monsanto Celebrating its 100th anniversary, Monsanto is a leading global provider of technology- based solutions and agricultural products that improve agricultural productivity andfood quality. Monsanto utilizes DNA- based genetic analysis capabilities to deliver products and solutions to the world's food producers, helping them meet the growing need for food and fiber \u2014 while conserving natural resources and improving theenvironment. Investing in Iowa's growing, critical mass of life sciences companies, Monsantobuilt a $20 million research and develop- ment center in Ankeny. The facility uses high-throughput grain analysis methods tosupport the development of new specialtygrain products. The company is expandingits trait discovery capabilities at its Holden's Foundation Seed Company inWilliamsburg, which, in combination withthe Ankeny facility, is accelerating theintroduction of new and superior hybridcorn products. Work life at Monsanto is described as providing people who enjoy facingcomplex challenges and a stimulating,ever-changing environment with thechance to make a difference.University Research Centers Iowa's state universities are renowned fortheir leadership in agricultural science,animal science, and medical and pharma-ceutical research. They are at the forefrontof scientific discovery and technologytransfer. With the goal of attracting as much as $425 million in public and privateinvestments, Iowa State University's PlantSciences Institute is the global center for the study and commercialization of products derived from plant biotechnology. Established in 1999, the Institute is an umbrella organization that involves ninecenters, 25 Iowa State University depart-ments and 250 faculty. The Plant SciencesInstitute uses new technologies to improveagriculture, the environment and humannutrition through plant genomics,proteomics and metabolomics. The Institute's director, internationally renowned molecular geneticist Stephen Howell, grew up in Iowa and recentlyreturned after two decades of teaching atthe University of California, San Diego,and serving a post as vice president ofresearch for a nonprofit corporationaffiliated with Cornell University. Hisreason for returning to Iowa: \"the momentum of Iowa's biotechnologyrevolution.\" Research conducted at Iowa State's Plant Sciences Institute will make plantsmore valuable in feeding the world'spopulation, producing livestock, andproviding bio-based fuels and industrialfeedstock. That means new products, new companies and new jobs. In addition, Iowa State University is building a Biotechnology Incubator at theISU Research Park. The facility will houseup to five companies and is expected togenerate nearly 40 high-paying research positions for the state of Iowa. The University of Iowa's Center for Biocatalysis and Bioprocessing iscomprised of 50 collaborating facultymembers and more than 300 supportingresearchers. It is one of the core researchfacilities for the university's technology Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., (IDT) is the industry leader in innovative molecular biotechnology products.
