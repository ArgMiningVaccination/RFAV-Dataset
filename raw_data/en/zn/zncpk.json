Spiritual Healing (SH) combines the ancient teachings of Sufi Spiritual Healing with modern medicine. SH works to find and heal the hidden spiritual, psychological, emotional, and energetic aspects of disease, while concurrently treating the physical aspects with traditional western methods. Dr. Jaffe has merged traditional medicine - including its diagnostic capabilities, testing, labs, and treatments - with spiritual healing to provide a comprehensive system of relief to those suffering from disease. About Dr. Ibrahim Jaffe Dr. Jaffe has helped patients to heal from many serious diseases, including some that have been unresponsive to traditional medicine and deemed irreversible or terminal. These include both physical and psychological diseases such as advanced heart disease (atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure), cancer (breast, lung and others), pulmonary disease (asthma and COPD), thyroid disease (Hashimoto's), infectious diseases (Lyme, etc.), depression and anxiety disorders, and many others. The Institute of Spiritual Healing offers courses and trainings to help teach these methods for professional practitioners seeking a Healer Certification in Spiritual Healing, and to students interested in personal transformation, and healing, through Sufi spiritual walking. As a young doctor, [Dr. Ibrahim Jaffe](https://drjaffemd.com/) witnessed a miracle in the ICU when a young girl with end-stage hepatitis was healed. After doctors had exhausted all their options using Western medicine, her condition was treated with an ancient biblical form of health that quickly returned her vital signs to normal. Dr. Jaffe was so touched by the effectiveness and mysticism of this healing that he traveled the world for years, searching for the deepest and most profound forms of healing he could find. Later in his life, Dr. Ibrahim Jaffe suffered from temporary blindness and congestive heart failure, which were both healed through the Spiritual Healing Process. His personal experience of this process has fed his passion to share it with others. After studying and witnessing healing from many spiritual healing traditions including Hindu, Kundalini, Homeopathy, Tibetan Medicine Buddha, Japanese Zen, Philippine psychic surgeons, South American shamans, Hawaiian Kahuna and more, Dr. Jaffe discovered the spiritual healing of the Sufis. He found that the Sufi healing led to the deepest inner transformation of the heart and soul and addressed the most subtle and hidden forms of disease. For this reason, he chose to apprentice for 20 years with one of the leading Sufi Masters and Healers of the century, Sidi Muhammad Al-Jamal, Guide of the Shadhiliyya Sufi Way. Through his apprenticeship, Dr. Jaffe's own illnesses were healed. As he mastered the deep teachings of his Guide, Dr. Jaffe was recognized by Sidi as a Sufi Murshid, or Guide, and a Master Sufi Spiritual Healer. He was given Ijaza, or permission, to teach spiritual healing and Sufism worldwide. In the Sufi path, he was officially given the title of Murshid Murrabai Ruhi (guide and caregiver of the Soul), one of the highest distinctions for guiding people towards the world of Unity and enlightenment and healing. Dr. Ibrahim Jaffe is a prolific speaker who brings forth a message of hope, healing, peace, and oneness for people of all faiths through the tenets of Sufism and the understanding of spiritual healing. He speaks on many topics including Sufism, spirituality, and spiritual healing. He also speaks about healing the blocks to manifesting our inner brilliance and finding and developing true spiritual and loving relationships. His healing work has also led to deep understanding of how to heal conflict and bring peace. His goal is to provide spiritual healing and guidance for people seeking to heal or transform their lives, illnesses, or organizations. Dr. Jaffe earned his medical degree as a general practice physician from the University of Illinois. In addition to being recognized as a Master Healer and Teacher within the Sufi tradition, he has studied and traveled worldwide teaching Advanced Energy Healing, an etheric approach to diagnosis and healing of illness, including teaching at the United Nations and Harvard Divinity School. His training also includes certification in electro-homeopathy according to Volls by Fuller Royal M.D., two and half years of study in classical homeopathy, and certification in healing through raw foods by both the Hippocrates Institute (under Anne Wigmore) and the Optimum Health Institute.
