There is also emergin g evidence that a range of clinical, social and economic interventions can hav e a positive benefit for the mental health of communities. Yet mental health is not giv en the priority it deserves. The aim of this study is to examine mental health policy de velopment and implementation in Ghana, with a view to identifying the key barriers to mental health policy development and implementation, and steps that can be taken to strengthen the mental health system in the country. This study forms part of a b roader international mental health research consortium based in Ghana, South Africa, U ganda and Zambia, which aims to investigate the policy level interventions that are required to break the vicious cycle of poverty and mental ill-health, in order to gener ate lessons for a range of low- and middle-income countries. Methods: The study makes use of quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Quantitative methods were employed to assess current mental heal th resources (such as budgets, beds, staff) and service utilisation. Qua litative methods were employed to provide an understanding of the processes, underlyi ng issues and interactions between key stakeholders in mental health policy de velopment and implementation. Quantitative instruments included: o World Health Organization Assessment Instrument fo r Mental Health Systems (WHO-AIMS) Version 2.2 o The WHO Mental Health Policy and Plan Checklist o The WHO Mental Health Legislation Checklist Qualitative instruments included: o Semi-structured interviews o Focus group discussions Interviews and focus group discussions were conduct ed at the national, regional and district level. 9 Data for the WHO-AIMS was collected for the 2005 in dex year. Quantitative and qualitative data collection took place between 14 th September 2006 and 30 th August 2007. Findings: The findings of the research identified a number of challenges facing the provision of mental health care in Ghana. Policy and legislation Mental health policy in Ghana was formulated in 199 4 and revised in 2000. Whilst the policy emphasises the decentralisation of mental he alth services and the development of community mental health care, there has been limited progress towards implementing the policy. Barriers to mental health policy implementation identified by participants included the stigma towa rds mental health, a lack of human and material resources, little communication of the policy, and no training for those responsible for its implementation. There is no con sultation with users of mental health services, their families, and health profess ionals at the district level in the formulation of mental health policy. In addition, t here is limited intersectoral collaboration with other agencies such as the polic e and education service, in the development of mental health policy. Importantly, t here is little reliable data gathering and dissemination of research to inform mental heal th policy and planning. Despite widely acknowledged links between mental health and poverty, mental health is not addressed within national policy on development and poverty alleviation. Current mental health legislation does not reflect best practice in mental health, such as establishing community-based mental health servi ces and protecting the human rights of persons with mental health problems. A ne w mental health bill has been drafted drawing on an extensive consultation proces s with stakeholders and WHO. The bill seeks to protect and promote the rights of the mentally ill, however it has not yet been ratified and there remain challenges to en sure that the bill is implemented. 10 Mental health services Some moves towards de-centralization of mental heal th care have begun with the opening of psychiatric units in the regional hospit als and the establishment of community psychiatric nursing services within 68 di stricts. Mental health has been integrated into all the Regional Health Management Teams and into those District Health Management Teams where community psychiatric nurses are in post. Initiatives through NGOs and other agencies to enha nce the community detection of mental illness and provide treatment have met with some success and draw on the availability of public health workers at the sub-di strict level. However progress towards the decentralization of me ntal health care in Ghana has been limited. Despite the opening of psychiatric un its in some of the regional hospitals, specialised inpatient care remains large ly concentrated in the three psychiatric hospitals in the south of the country. The population of the poorest parts of the country is therefore reached the least by me ntal health services. Community-based mental health services are provided in only about half of the districts in the country. There are insufficient nu mbers of community psychiatric nurses and other mental health professionals and li ttle integration of mental health within primary care. Poor communication between psy chiatric services and primary care is leading to a lack of effective procedures f or follow-up of discharged patients within the community. Treatment for mental health is largely biomedically based and curative. There are very limited numbers of psychosocial professionals in mental health care and a lack of rehabilitation and psychosocial treatment for me ntal health. There are few programmes for mental health promotion and the prev ention of mental illness. In addition, services are primarily focused on trea tment for severe mental disorders such as psychosis and schizophrenia. There is littl e focus on treatment for common mental disorders such as depression at the communit y level. 11 Human resources Despite an increase in the number of training place s available for psychiatric nurses and other health professionals such as medical assi stants, there remains a lack of human resources within mental health services, incl uding inpatient hospitals and community services. This presents challenges for ef fective service delivery. It is difficult to attract health professionals into psyc hiatry due to stigma, low priority of mental health, and fears of violence. There are very few specialists in psychosocial inte rventions which impedes the ability of mental health services to provide comprehensive multi-disciplinary care. In addition to psychiatrists and psychiatric nurses, t here is a need for clinical psychologists, psychiatric social workers and occup ational therapists. Furthermore, there is little opportunity for contin uous professional development for mental health professionals. Other sectors who hav e contact with those with mental health problems, such as teachers and police, lack vital knowledge on the management of mental health problems within the com munities they serve. Human rights Traditional and faith healers in the communities ar e well-placed to address some of the unmet needs of the mentally ill. However there are serious concerns about the abuse of the human rights of some of those who atte nd their facilities, for example the chaining of patients and enforced fasting. At present there is no regulatory body for institut ions providing care for the mentally ill. Therefore there is no regulation of the practi ces of traditional and faith healers in the treatment of those with mental illness, nor sys tematic monitoring of human rights within psychiatric institutions. Poor quality of ca re and human rights abuses in both government facilities and traditional and faith hea ling facilities remain officially unchecked, and few attempts are made to protect the rights of those with mental illness. Stigma There is significant stigma towards those with ment al health problems in Ghana and this extends from the mentally ill to their carers and often to mental health 12 professionals. People with mental illness encounter stigmatization and discrimination at the institutional, social and family level. In a ddition, there is stigmatization of the field of mental health itself among health professi onals. Stigma can be a hurdle to the health-seeking behavi our of people with mental health problems and has also affected the recruitment of h ealth professionals and the funding priorities of the health service. It also l eads to direct discrimination against those with mental illness in terms of employment, s ocial inclusion and equal opportunities. Funding Nationally, mental health remains a low priority in the context of competition for limited resources and a significant disease burden. This is reflected in the insufficient budget allocated for mental health. What is availab le is mostly dedicated to the psychiatric hospitals. Mental illness is not currently covered by health i nsurance which may impede access to treatment for the most impoverished. This means that patients have to bear the cost of treatment when they are treated outside of mental health services or if psychotropic drugs are unavailable within public he alth services. Increased demand on mental health services will lea d to the need for more readily available psychotropic medication. The cost of prov iding optimal treatment with new psychiatric drugs may be prohibitive, therefore dec isions regarding the best use of limited resources to achieve maximum clinical effec tiveness will need to be made. Rising rates of drug abuse, particularly cannabis, with resulting mental health problems, may put a further strain on existing reso urces. Opportunities At present in Ghana there are a number of encouragi ng opportunities for the improvement of mental health care: o There is widespread acknowledgement at the macro l evel of the need for de-centralization of mental health service provisio n and the development 13 of community-based services, indicating that there would be support from policy makers for further implementation. o The new mental health bill draws on extensive cons ultation at all levels of society, including users of mental health services, and which is consistent with WHO best practice guidelines. If passed, the l aw would signal a new standard for mental health care in Ghana and provid e a mandate for improved services. o There has been considerable collaboration and supp ort for mental health in recent years from international agencies such as the Royal Netherlands Embassy and the World Health Organization. There ha s also been a growth in the number of both international and loca l NGOs in the field of mental health. o Large numbers of traditional and faith healers off er treatment for mental illness at the community level and are well-placed to provide psychosocial and spiritual support. Some have indicated their wi llingness to collaborate with biomedical services. Additional and regular tr aining would significantly enhance the quality of service provid ed and allow the government to regulate and monitor the sector. o There has been renewed impetus to further the caus e of mental health in Ghana through research and advocacy. There is incre asing research in mental health in Ghana which could raise the profil e of mental health and provide an evidence base for further service develo pment. o Public concern regarding rising rates of drug abus e has drawn increased attention to mental health issues. Recommendations: Some suggested steps to be taken to strengthen the mental health system are: o Pass the new mental health bill, and provide the n ecessary resources and training for its implementation. o Promote mental health in the development agenda to address the links between poverty and mental health. 14 o Increase the commitment to de-centralisation throu gh opening psychiatric units in the remaining regional hospitals. Provide outreach from the regional hospitals to support mental health at the district level. o Develop rehabilitation within mental health servic es, such as half-way houses or vocational rehabilitation, in order to facilitat e the social integration of people with mental illness and prevent relapse. o Draw on lessons from anti-stigma campaigns in HIV/ AIDS and disability in order to raise public awareness of mental health an d tackle stigma. o Integrate mental health into existing structures f or primary care provision and public health education and case detection. Train a ll health workers in mental health, including all workers in primary care. o Provide a comprehensive training programme for men tal health professionals to update their skills so as to continue to provide best practice in mental health care. o Develop recruitment and retention strategies for m ental health staff to address the attrition of mental health workers. o Develop new mental health policy in line with draf t mental health bill. This should be built on extensive consultation with all stakeholders. o Promote mental health policy in the context of oth er relevant policy, and increase collaboration with other relevant sectors in the treatment of the mentally ill. o Provide training for those whose work brings them into contact with the mental health problems, such as the police, teacher s and social workers. o Develop information systems for collating data on mental health, and monitoring and evaluation of services. 15 o Disseminate mental health policy to all levels wit hin the health service, as well as other relevant sectors, and provide training and education to those responsible for policy implementation. 16 1. Introduction In the year 2000, it was estimated that mental diso rders contributed 12% of the global burden of disease and it is predicted that t his will rise to 15% by the year 2020. Currently mental disorders make up 5 of the 10 lead ing causes of health disability, and by 2020 it is predicted that unipolar depressio n will be the second most disabling health condition in the world (Lopez et al. 2006). It is estimated that 1 in 4 people suffer from a diagnosable mental disorder during th e course of their lifetime (WHO 2004). There is no comprehensive data on the incidence and prevalence of mental disorder in Ghana. However it is estimated that at least 13% of the adult population are likely to suffer from a mental disorder, with 3% of these suffering from a severe mental disorder and 10% suffering from a mild to moderate mental disorder (WHO 2007). There is emerging evidence from low-income countrie s that mental illness is strongly associated with poverty and many aspects of social deprivation associated with poverty (Flisher et al. 2007;Lund et al. 2007). Me ntal illness is associated with food insecurity (Patel et al. 1997), inadequate housing (Araya et al. 2003;Reichenheim & Harpham 1991), unemployment (Abas & Broadhead 1997; Araya et al. 2001;Inandi et al. 2002), low levels of education (Araya, Lewis, R ojas, & Fritsch 2003), social fragmentation (Harpham, Grant, & Rodriguez 2004) an d violence (including domestic violence) (Fleitlich & Goodman 2001;Harpham et al. 2005;Seedat et al. 2004;Stein, Seedat, & Emlsey 2002;Ward et al. 2001). Indeed res earchers have described the interaction of poverty and mental illness as a \"vic ious cycle\" in which the conditions of poverty lead to high levels of stress, social exclu sion, reduced access to social capital, malnutrition, obstetric risks, increased r isk of violence, and thereby to increased prevalence and worse outcomes for mental disorders. In turn, mental illness leads to increased health expenditure, redu ced productivity, job loss, and social drift into poverty (Patel 2001). Despite some significant economic growth in recent years (World Bank 2007), Ghana is classified as a low-income country with 28.5% of the population living in poverty, and 18.2% living in extreme poverty. However these figures conceal significant regional variation between the urban coastal areas and the northern regions, with 17 87.9% of the population of the poorest region, Uppe r West, living in poverty, compared to 11.8% in the capital (Government of Gha na, 2007). In spite of these disturbing trends and the growing burden of mental ill-health, there are encouraging signs that cost-effective intervent ions are available. During the last 40 years, anti-psychotic medications have revolutio nised the care and treatment of people with schizophrenia and bipolar mood disorder , in a way that allows most people with these conditions to live relatively nor mal lives in the community (WHO 2001). Cost-effective generic medications are now a vailable for people suffering from common mental disorders such as depression and anxi ety (Patel et al. 2003;Patel, Araya, & Bolton 2004). Advances in a range of psych osocial interventions have been made and documented (WHO 2001). Although many of th ese psychosocial interventions have been developed in western settin gs, several have been adapted and found to be effective in Africa and in many low - and middle-income countries (Bolton et al. 2003;Patel 2007;Siskind, Bolton, & K im 2007). The development of psycho-social rehabilitation (PSR) provides new dir ections for recovery, empowerment and re-integration into communities aft er periods of mental illness (WHO 1996). Beyond the clinical realm, there is emerging eviden ce that wider social and economic interventions can have a positive benefit for the m ental health of communities. For example, the introduction of pensions in South Afri ca was shown to reduce levels of depression in households where pensioners resided ( Case 2004). Internationally, welfare benefits have been shown to reduce rates of common mental disorder among recipients (Plagerson et al. 2008). Participa nts in a micro-credit scheme in Bangladesh have shown reduced rates of emotional st ress among women following 7 years of participation in this scheme, compared t o non-participants (Ahmed, Chowdhury, & Bhuiya 2001). Education has shown a st rong dose-response relationship in reducing rates of common mental dis orders in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) (Araya, Lewis, Rojas, & Fritsch 2 003). Nonetheless despite the burden of mental illness an d its association with poverty, disability and social exclusion, mental health rema ins a low priority in Ghana. Mental health policy and legislation are outdated, and fin ancing for mental health is inadequate to meet the needs of the population. Men tal health services continue to labour under institutional patterns of care, when i nternational trends are towards the downscaling of psychiatric institutions and the pro vision of community-based mental 18 health services (Geller 2000;Thornicroft & Tansella 1998). Decentralisation of mental health services has only occurred on a limited scal e, and community-mental health services are inadequate. Mental health care remains focused on pharmaceutical treatment, with little provision for psychosocial i nterventions, including psychosocial rehabilitation. Whilst a new mental health bill has been drafted, there are concerns as to when it will be passed, and to what extent the b ill will be implemented in practice. In conclusion, whilst there is likely to be a signi ficant burden of mental illness in Ghana, much of this remains untreated by mental hea lth services. However despite some efforts towards the reform and expansion of me ntal health care, little progress has been made. Mental health policy appears to have promised more than it has been able to deliver in practice, largely due to th e lack of human and financial resources with which to fulfil its objectives. Key research questions are therefore: o What is the process of mental health policy making in Ghana? o What is the content of mental health policy and wh at is its status? o How much of a priority is mental health for the Gh anaian government? o What are the processes of implementing mental heal th policy and legislation? How successful are these processes at national, reg ional and district level? What is the current situation regarding mental heal th service provision? o What is the opinion of a range of key stakeholders in mental health regarding mental health priorities and current policy? The aims of this research are: o to describe and understand the broad context in wh ich mental health policy- making takes place in Ghana, o to understand the general situation regarding ment al health needs and priorities, o to assess the wider policy-making practices in the public sector, o to describe and analyse the development of mental health policies and mental health law, o to assess the appropriateness of the mental health policies and mental health law, including the involvement of stakeholde rs and their influence on the formulation of mental health policies and menta l health law, 19 o to assess the practices of implementing mental hea lth policies and law at national and regional level, and o to assess the implementation of the mental health policy and law at district level. The remaining chapters of this report will set out the methodology, results, discussion and conclusions of the study. This research is conducted in the context of a wide r international study of mental health policy development and implementation in 4 A frican countries: Ghana, South Africa, Uganda and Zambia (Flisher, Lund, Funk, Ban da, Bhana, Doku, Drew, Kigozi, Knapp, Omar, Petersen, & Green 2007). This study, t itled the Mental Health and Poverty Project (MHAPP), sets out to investigate th e policy level interventions that are required to break the vicious cycle of poverty and mental ill-health, in order to generate lessons for a range of low- and middle-inc ome countries. This report presents the findings of the first phase of the stu dy, namely a situation analysis of mental health policy development and implementation in Ghana. The findings of this first phase will be used to inform a set of interve ntions, developed in partnership with the Mental Health Unit at the Ministry of Health. T he interventions conducted in the second phase will set out to address particular bar riers to the successful development and implementation of mental health pol icy in this country. These interventions will be documented and evaluated, wit h a view to generating lessons that may be of value for future work in Ghana and i n other low- and middle-income countries. 20 2. Methodology 2.1 Introduction 2.1.1 Conceptual background to the methodology In developing the methodology for this study, a con ceptual framework for understanding mental health policy development and implementation was formulated by the research consortium (Flisher, Lund, Funk, Ba nda, Bhana, Doku, Drew, Kigozi, Knapp, Omar, Petersen, & Green 2007). This framewor k was used to guide our analysis of mental health policy development and im plementation in Ghana, the data sources we explored, and the stakeholders we interv iewed. In the development of policy, it is critical to ali gn the policy with the mental health needs, context and particular health system of the specific country. By mental health policy we mean an organised set of values, principl es, objectives and areas for action to improve the mental health of a population (WHO 2 005a). The likelihood of the policy being appropriate and feasible will depend o n the processes by which it was developed and in particular, the extent to which it has included key stakeholders within this process (Walt & Gilson 1994). It will a lso depend on the degree to which the policy is evidence-based. In the implementation of policy, the existence of a n appropriate policy may be a necessary condition for improved services, but is, of course, not sufficient. Three barriers to the effective implementation of policie s are commonly experienced. Firstly, the policy itself may be too general and n ot be turned into a strategic plan or programme. Secondly, the appropriate health system may not be in place to support the policy. The third key constraint can be, at be st, a lack of support for, or at worst, resistance to, the policy and programme at the impl ementation level. Such a lack of ownership may be experienced from a number of group s including professional groups, health service managers, service users or t he wider community, partly due to the stigma often associated with mental illness. Mental health is the product of a number of determi nants, which may have their origins beyond the formally designated health secto r. Hence there is a need for a multi-sectoral approach to both policy development and implementation. The Ministry 21 of Health needs to take the lead in adopting a mult i-sectoral approach and developing appropriate tools and relationships for working with district health systems and with non-governmental and private providers. 2.1.2. Research methods and instruments The study makes use of quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Data collection employed the following methods: 1. The World Health Organization Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Systems (WHO-AIMS) Version 2.2 was completed to assess mental health resources such as budgets, beds and staff, a nd service utilisation. 2. Document analysis of mental health policy, plans and legislation utilising the WHO Mental Health Policy and Plan Checklists and the WHO Mental Health Legislation Checklist . 3. Semi-structured interviews and focus group discussi ons with key stakeholders in mental health were undertaken to pr ovide an understanding of the process of mental health policy development and implementation and key issues and challenges in mental health in Ghana . 4. Analysis of recent research with users of govern ment mental health services. Findings were triangulated where possible, using tw o or more sources of data or research methods. The fieldwork for the study was c onducted between 14 th September 2006 and 30 th August 2007. Data for the WHO-AIMS was collected f or the 2005 index year. Analysis and writing up was co nducted from 1 st June - 30 th September 2007. The four methods and the instruments employed are d escribed in turn below. 22 2.2 WHO-AIMS 2.2.1. Brief Description of the WHO-AIMS Instrument Quantitative data regarding the mental health syste m in Ghana was gathered using the World Health Organization's Assessment Instrume nt for Mental Health Systems (WHO-AIMS) Version 2.2 (WHO 2005b). The WHO-AIMS tool has been developed to assess key components of a mental health system and thereby provide essential informa tion to strengthen mental health systems. The instrument was developed following the publication of the World Health Report 2001 (WHO 2001), which focused on mental hea lth, and provided a set of recommendations. These recommendations address esse ntial aspects of mental health system development in resource-poor settings. WHO-A IMS 2.2 consists of 6 domains (covering the 10 World Health Report 2001 r ecommendations comprising 28 facets and 156 items). The 6 domains are interde pendent, conceptually interlinked, and somewhat overlapping. All 6 domain s need to be assessed to form a relatively complete picture of a mental health syst em. The domains include: Domain 1: Policy and legislative framework Domain 2: Mental health services Domain 3: Mental health in primary care Domain 4: Human resources Domain 5: Public education and links with other se ctors Domain 6: Monitoring and research The instrument includes the WHO-AIMS Excel Data Ent ry Programme and a template for a narrative report. The WHO-AIMS seeks to identify mental health services using a number of standardised definitions for terms such as 'mental hospitals', and 'community-based inpatient services ' which it proposes are mapped onto local services (See Appendix 1 for a full lis t of definitions used in WHO-AIMS). 2.2.2 Sampling and procedure for WHO-AIMS Respondents were purposively sampled from amongst p olicy makers, programme directors and other major stakeholders in mental he alth at the national level. To facilitate ease of response, the 156 facets of the WHO-AIMS were changed from statements into question format. There was also som e debate regarding how to 23 match local service provision to the WHO-AIMS defin itions. The research team jointly agreed which services would be matched to which def initions, for example 'community-based inpatient services' were equated t o the psychiatric units in general hospitals. The questionnaire was then allocated to respondents, according to the relevance of the questions to the respondent's area of responsibility. Some of the questions were sent to multiple respondents if it w as felt that they had access to the relevant information. Where their responses tallied it increased confidence in the data. Where the responses were inconsistent with ea ch other, they were cross- checked until the most plausible answer was found. In some cases the questionnaire was completed together with the researcher. Other r espondents completed the questionnaire independently. 48 respondents completed the questionnaire. These i ncluded: The Acting Chief Psychiatrist A retired Chief Psychiatrist The Medical Directors of Ankaful Psychiatric Hospi tal, Accra Psychiatric Hospital and Pantang Hospital The National Coordinator of Community Psychiatric Nurses The Coordinator of Community Psychiatric Nurses, G reater Accra Regional Health Directorate The head of the Department of Psychiatry, Universi ty of Ghana Medical School The Director of Public Health Division, GHS The Director of Institutional Care Division, GHS The Director of Legal Drafting, Attorney General's Department The Deputy Director of Pharmaceutical Services, Ac cra Psychiatric Hospital (responsible for psychotropic drugs at the national level) The Ministry of Finance The Chief Accountant, Accra Psychiatric Hospital The principal pharmacist, Pantang Hospital Social Welfare unit at Accra Psychiatric Hospital Basic Needs Ghana (NGO) Psychomental Association (NGO) 24 2.2.3 Analysis of WHO-AIMS data Data from the questionnaires was entered into the W HO-AIMS Excel spreadsheet. Numerical data were aggregated under the relevant h eadings. Some of the data could not be aggregated due to differences in the c ollection of statistics between services. For example, Accra and Ankaful Psychiatri c Hospitals compile records of those treated under the age of 19, whereas Pantang Hospital compiles records of those under 17. Descriptive statistical analyses of relevant items were conducted. Nationally aggregated responses to items were then entered into the WHO-AIMS narrative template. 2.3 Document Analysis Document analysis was conducted in two broad forms: o Formal analysis was conducted of key policy and le gislation documents, using the WHO Mental Health Policy and Plan Checkli st and the WHO Mental Health Legislation Checklist. o Background literature relevant to mental health po licy development and implementation in Ghana, including other relevant p olicy documents, were reviewed to provide an understanding of the policy context. 2.3.1 WHO Mental Health Policy, Plan and Legislatio n Checklists The WHO Checklist for Mental Health Policy and Plan s and the WHO Checklist for Mental Health Legislation are designed to assess th e content and process of developing mental health legislation, policy and pl ans according to a number of criteria. The Ghana team that reviewed the checklists include d the following: 1. The Co-Principal Investigator of the MHAPP 2. The MOH representative on the MHAPP 3. The MHAPP Research Officer for Ghana 4. The National Coordinator of Community Psychiatri c Nurses 5. The Deputy Director of Nursing Services, Accra P sychiatric Hospital. The committee sat for two days to go through the ch ecklists and completed the entries in the template sheet provided (see Appendi x 2). 25 The documents used for evaluating the checklists in cluded: /square4 The 1972 Mental Health Decree of Ghana /square4 The 1994 Mental Health Policy /square4 Five Years 2007-2011 Mental Health Programme of th e Mental Health Unit in collaboration with the Ministry of Health /square4 The 2006 draft Mental Health Bill 2.4. Semi-Structured Interviews and Focus Group Dis cussions 2.4.1 Sampling and procedure for semi-structured in terviews and focus group discussions Interviews and focus group discussions were conduct ed intensively over a five-month period at the national (macro), regional (meso) and district (micro) levels. Respondents were purposively sampled from among the major stakeholders in mental health care in Ghana within five of the ten regions: Greater Accra, Central, Ashanti, Brong Ahafo and Northern regions. A sample district, Kintampo North, was selected for interviews and focus group discussions at the micro level. Interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with policy makers, programme directors, researchers, academics, health professionals, tradi tional healers, teachers, journalists, police officers, NGOs and religious le aders. In all 122 respondents supplied information in the form of in-depth interviews and focus group discussions as illustrated in the follo wing table: Semi-Structured Interviews Focus Group Discussions Macro Meso Micro Total Macro Micro Total 35 23 23 81 1 6 7 (See Appendix 3 for samples of the interview schedu les and focus group guides.) 26 The semi-structured interviews were tailored accord ing to the specific individual being interviewed. The following generic areas were covered: 1. Major development challenges facing Ghana 2. Key challenges facing the health system 3. Perceptions of mental health 4. Mental health needs and priorities in Ghana 5. The role of stigma in mental health 6. The role of government in addressing mental heal th needs 7. General policy making process in Ghana 8. Process of mental health policy and legislation development. 9. Role of various stakeholders in mental health po licy and legislation development 10. Content of the current mental health policy and legislation 11. Implementation of mental health policy and legi slation at the national and regional levels 12. The research agenda for mental health. 2.4.1.2 National and regional level There were 35 semi-structured interviews at the nat ional level, and 23 at the regional level. 1 focus group discussion was conducted at th e national level. Respondents at the national level were drawn from: o The Ministry of Health o The Ministry of Manpower, Youth and Employment o The Ministry of the Interior o The Ministry of Information o The Ministry of Public Sector Reforms o The Ministry of Justice o University of Ghana o Kintampo Health Research Centre (GHS) o Health Research Unit (GHS) o Psycho-mental Association (NGO) o Accra Psychiatric Hospital o Senior nursing officers (GHS) o National Health Insurance Scheme 27 o Ghana Police Service o Presbyterian Church o A national newspaper o The World Health Organisation (Ghana Country Offic e) Respondents at the regional level were drawn from: o Regional hospitals o Regional Health Directorates o Community Psychiatric Nurses o Ankaful Psychiatric Hospital o Pantang Hospital o Nurse training schools o Psychiatric nurses' training colleges o Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology o Private psychiatric hospital o Basic Needs (NGO) 2.4.1.2 District level case study site: Kintampo No rth Kintampo North district in a rural area of Ghana wa s chosen as a representative case study to examine the implementation of mental healt h policy at the micro level. Kintampo district was selected as it has significan t levels of poverty, and very limited provisions for mental health care. Whilst there are other districts in Ghana with a greater provision of mental health services through the provision of CPNs and the intervention of NGOs, Kintampo is not untypical in having no dedicated psychiatric services. Kintampo was also selected as it has a su pportive infrastructure for health research. It is the location for Kintampo Health Re search Centre, one of four health research centres within Ghana Health Service, and i s also host to the Kintampo demographic surveillance system (DSS) which is a me mber of the international network of field sites with continuous demographic evaluation of their populations and their health (INDEPTH network: www.indepth-network.org ). Kintampo North District (formally Kintampo district but since 2006 politically demarcated into Kintampo North and Kintampo South D istricts) is one of the 19 districts of the Brong Ahafo region of Ghana. It i s located in the forest-savannah transitional ecological zone within the middle belt of Ghana. At 4,000 sq.km, Kintampo North is one of the largest districts in t he Brong Ahafo Region. Kintampo 28 town, the district capital, is located at the geogr aphical centre of Ghana and forms a major hub for both international and domestic passe nger and freight transport. The town is the location for the district hospital. The population of the district stands at 140,000. T his population is found in 22,475 households, spread over 4,000 compounds. The distri ct has a growth rate of 2.6% as of January 2006. The largest ethnic group of the ar ea are the Bono or Brong who form approximately 40% of the local population, fol lowed by the Mo who form about 20%. There is a significant immigrant population fr om the Northern regions, including Dagomba, Sissala, Kokomba, Grushie and Dangbe, as w ell as the descendants of Mossi and Hausa traders and a number of Fulani past oralists who herd cattle in the district. A sub-group of the Akan, the Bono speak a variant o f Twi which is also spoken as a second or third language by members of other ethnic groups. As elsewhere in Ghana, Hausa is the lingua franca among northern im migrant groups. There are high rates of illiteracy in Kintampo, particularly among women, with over half of the population never having attended school. According to official data about 50% of the populat ion of Kintampo district are Christian, just under 30% Muslim (including the maj ority of Northern migrants), and 10% 'traditionalist', that is followers of the indi genous religion 1. However religious practice is diverse and many may combine traditiona l and Christian or Muslim practices. Farming is the major economic activity for approxim ately 80% of the inhabitants, mainly as a result of the abundance of fertile land and favourable rainfall pattern. Many farmers are engaged in subsistence level agric ulture. Cash crops include timber, yams, cashew nuts, mangoes and cocoa, howev er many families grow foods for household consumption such as yams, cassava, ma ize and onions. Kintampo has a large food market on Wednesdays. Traders from all over Ghana and neighbouring countries converge to buy foodstuffs and sell a var iety of commodities, from agricultural products to textiles and electrical ap pliances. 1 Figures taken from the website www.ghanadistricts. com , produced in partnership with the Ministry of Local Government. 29 There are high rates of poverty in the district and many households lack basic amenities such as water and electricity. Transport is difficult as roads are largely unpaved, and there is poorly developed infrastructu re. At the district level, there were a total of 23 sem i-structured interviews and 6 focus group discussions. 16 of the interviews were conduc ted in English and 7 were conducted in Twi, the local language in the study d istrict and the most wide-spread language in Ghana. The focus group with traditional healers was conducted in Twi. All other focus groups were in English. In-depth interviews were conducted with representat ives of the following groups: o District Health Management Team o Ghana Education Service o Health professionals o Users of psychiatric services o Social workers o Faith healers (Christian and Islamic) o Traditional healers o School teachers o Police o Member of judiciary Focus group discussions were conducted with the fol lowing: o Nurses from the district hospital o Teachers - 1 private school, 1 public elementary s chool, I secondary school o Police o Traditional healers 2.4.2. Analysis of interviews and focus group discu ssions All the interviews conducted were digitally recorde d with participants' consent. However four respondents refused to be recorded and written notes were taken. Interviews were transcribed verbatim. Interviews in Twi were first transcribed and then translated into English by staff of the Bureau of Ghana Languages. All transcripts were entered into Nvivo 7 which was use d for analysis. 30 A cross-section of the interview transcripts were p urposively sampled and sent to respondents to ensure that the transcripts accurate ly represented their views. Among the respondents who read their interview transcript s, none demanded that anything should be changed. A framework analysis approach was adopted (Ritchie & Spencer 1994) in which certain themes were agreed upon by investigators fr om all four study countries. These themes were based on the objectives of the st udy (as set out in the introduction). From these objectives, sub-themes w ere suggested by partners, and reviewed by all partners through a process of itera tion, until a single framework was agreed upon that could be used by all four study co untries. Where specific themes emerged from the interviews that were not included in the generic cross-country framework, these were added to the coding frame, to adapt the analysis to issues specific to Ghana (See Appendix 4 for the coding fr ames employed). Transcripts were coded on the basis of these themes, with addit ional themes added to the coding framework as determined by the data. Interviews wer e coded independently for 10% of randomly sampled interviews to ensure inter-rate r reliability. Inter-rater reliability was always above 90%. 2.5 Research Ethics The protocol was submitted to the Scientific Review Committee of Kintampo Health Research Centre for scrutiny of the scientific meri t of the study. Ethical approval was granted by the Ghana Health Service Ethics Committe e at the national level and the Institutional Ethics Board at Kintampo Health Resea rch Centre (see Appendix 5 for copies of approval letters). Information sheets containing essential information on the study and the implications of participation were submitted to all participants . Participants were then requested to sign a consent form to indicate their willingness t o participate in the study (See Appendix 6 for examples of information and consent forms). Participants who were unable to read had a witness read the information s heet and consent form to them in Twi before agreeing to participate in the study. Th ese participants were requested to provide a thumb print in lieu of a signature in the presence of a witness. 31 The names and other identifying features of the res pondents have been removed in order to protect their confidentiality. 32 3. Results The results are presented below according to themes drawn from the interviews and focus group discussions, as well as quantitative da ta from the review of Ghana mental health legislation and policy, and the compl eted WHO-AIMS. To strengthen the voices of users in the report, special mention is made of research with users of mental health services. Issues of concern to them a re compared with those of users of regular health services who have chronic physic al illness. 3.1 Context This section presents the findings of the study reg arding the broad context of the mental health system in Ghana. In the interviews, r espondents were asked to give their opinion on the context within which mental he alth may be situated in the country and the major development priorities and challenges . The following themes were those which recurred most frequently, or which prod uced the most comment amongst participants: Current health policy Poverty and development The burden of disease Human rights Traditional and faith healers 3.1.1 Current health policy In 2005 the Ministry of Health produced a policy on the implementation of an initiative called Community-Based Health Planning and Services or CHPS. CHPS aims to improve community access to basic health care, advo cating that the Ministry 'moves health services to community locations, develops su stainable volunteerism and community health action, empowers women and vulnera ble groups, and improves health provision through household and community in teraction with service workers'. The focus of CHPS is on promotion and prevention, a nd case detection and referral. Community Health nurses are retrained as Community Health Officers (CHOs). They are expected to develop links with families, commun ity leaders, traditional authorities and traditional health practitioners within the com munities within which they work to improve equity in access to basic health services a nd develop effective intersectoral 33 collaboration. They are supported by Community Heal th Volunteers (CHVs) whose duties include community education, health promotio n, environmental sanitation, immunization assistance and health record keeping ( Ghana Health Service 2005). Several respondents echoed this grassroots approach to health promotion: 'The key health problems in this country, I feel th ose problems if we had good health education and the preventive aspect s were effective, personal hygiene, environmental hygiene were very effective, probably it would have reduced the commo n illnesses like malaria, typhoid fever which are also related to me ntal illness somehow. It would have reduced... and so education is very, very important.... (Respondent 55, senior psychiatric nurse, regional hospital) Many respondents situated mental health within the context of general health policy in Ghana. The current emphasis by the Ministry of H ealth in Ghana on health promotion and illness prevention was linked directl y to mental health by some respondents who suggested that mental health should be more integrated into the public health agenda. Like the respondent quoted ab ove, another suggested that rather than funding psychiatric care in institution s, the government should focus on mental health promotion through public education in the community to address potential risk behaviours: 'That is why maybe we have mental health cases inc reasing because if government has attention for mental heal th, maybe it could be not necessarily funding psychiatric hospit als or institutions, but maybe public education on what things... what lea ds to this mental disorders. We know... I mean basically smoking narcotics and those things. If there is a lot of government c ommitment, maybe even education beginning at the lower levels, can e ven prevent the increasing numbers we are having.' (Respondent 27, national newspaper editor) Some participants referred directly to CHPS as a mo del for the provision of mental health promotion and education at the community lev el. Grassroots activities such as radio broadcasts, durbars and talks in churches and schools, were some of the 34 strategies cited by participants to carry out publi c health education in the communities. 3.1.2 Poverty and development Several respondents referred to the position of men tal health within the context of widespread poverty in Ghana. Many contrasted the le vels of development in the country between rural and urban areas, and between the north and the south of the country. Rural areas were generally seen as exclude d from policy development, even though this is where the majority of the population of Ghana live. The north of the country was also seen to be relatively neglected in policy due to its distance from the centres of power in the south. This bias is reflected in mental health care in whi ch all the psychiatric hospitals are located in urban areas of the south. Respondents id entified those from the north and rural areas of the country as being poorer and gene rally less well educated. It was observed that whilst many programmes seek to address poverty and social exclusion in Ghana, mental illness is generally ove rlooked in the development agenda. Though reference is made to the 'marginaliz ed' and 'vulnerable' in development programmes, those with mental illness a re rarely included within such definitions: '... mentally ill people largely are not part of deve lopment processes, so there are countless organizations and even gover nment projects that target poor and marginalized, but most of them hardly really think about mentally ill people. ........,when they ar e talking about this, possibly they are talking about people with p hysical disabilities.' (Respondent 57, director, mental health NGO) 3.1.3 The burden of disease A common theme which emerged in the interviews conc erned the low priority of mental health compared to other serious health prob lems in Ghana such as malaria, malnutrition, maternal and child mortality and comm unicable diseases such as TB. Respondents pointed out that in the context of the high disease burden in the country there is competition for resources. Conditions whic h were seen to have higher 35 morbidity and mortality receive greater priority fr om the government and attract more funding : 'Broadly we have children dying, we have mothers dy ing, we have young people dying prematurely and we have people a ging quite faster, you know ageing, they don't age healthily. They [these deaths] are related to nutrition, they are related to commu nicable diseases, they are related to reproductive health i ssues. Those are the main health problems.' (Respondent 6, programme director, MOH) '....malaria, diarrhoeal diseases, the pneumonia dise ases, they take the chunk, because when you go to the records in th e hospitals, health facilities and the rest, they are most of th e time the top five diseases that report. So these ones have taken prom inence, far more prominence over other disease issues.' (Respondent 18, senior health researcher) Other health concerns which were perceived to take precedence over mental health included HIV, respiratory tract infections, road tr affic accidents, and emergent non- communicable conditions such as hypertension, diabe tes and cancer. Nobody mentioned mental health spontaneously as one of the disorders that required priority attention in Ghana. As expected, conditions mention ed by respondents at the policy- making level reflect recent Ministry of Health stat istics fairly accurately. Between 2001 and 2006 the five leading causes of morbidity at outpatient consultations were malaria, upper respiratory tract infections, diarrh oeal diseases, skin diseases and hypertension. Accidents formed the sixth leading ca use of consultation However there appears to be an underestimation of the incid ence of mental disorders. In 2006 mental disorders were recorded as forming 1.15% of outpatient morbidity. This is far below the percentage recorded for malaria (37.83%), and lower than the other top five conditions (6.20% for upper respiratory tract infections, 3.38% for diarrhoeal diseases, 3.34% for skin diseases, 2.78% for hypert ension and 2.27% for accidents). Nonetheless this ranks mental disorders as the twel fth most common cause of outpatient consultation, above gonorrhoea, pneumoni a, gynaecological disorders, malnutrition and communicable diseases such as typh oid, hepatitis and tuberculosis, and close to pregnancy and related complications wh ich formed 1.34% of consultations in 2006. This figure also marks a sig nificant rise from 0.17% in 2005 36 which may be due to changes in the recording of men tal disorders within outpatient departments due to the introduction of new health i nformation software (Ministry of Health Ghana 2007). Some respondents felt that mental health was barely considered within the Ministry of Health compared to other health concerns: 'Mental health in Ghana is an area that the ministr y..... the ministry does not attach any great importance to it. Yet, yo u see the other areas like the MCH or the disease control, the nutr ition and other areas, being well catered for than the mental healt h. Mental health has a lot of problems and the way mental health is being treated it's as if it is not part of the health services in the country.' (Respondent 2, senior psychiatric nurse, regional l evel) 3.1.4 Human rights Many respondents talked about mental health in the context of human rights. A majority of respondents reported that those who are mentally ill are frequently denied their basic rights simply because of the nature of the illness: 'People abuse the rights of the mentally ill person because they think when he is mentally ill he has no rights agai n. His rights have been taken away from him.' (Respondent 66, senior police officer, district lev el) Respondents pointed out that current legislation in Ghana, including mental health legislation, did little to protect the rights of th e mentally ill. Despite provisions for the protection of human rights for all Ghanaian citizen s in the Ghanaian constitution, those with mental health problems were excluded fro m many opportunities, including the right to vote: 'Well, I mean, as you are aware, they can't vote. So it means they don't have equal rights [....] there are certain area s and certain aspects that they cannot actively participate. So t hey don't have equal rights and equal opportunities because opport unity to vote is restricted.' 37 (Respondent 68, housing manager, district level) The abuse of human rights across all mental health treatment facilities and institutions in Ghana was discussed by many of the respondents. Human rights abuses were reported to occur at most places where mental health services are provided including traditional healers, faith heale rs and government psychiatric services. These include the chaining of those with mental health problems, forced fasting and beatings. Some of these abuses are ackn owledged to occur when those who are mentally ill became agitated or aggressive and there are no other available means of restraining or calming them: '....people were trying to do their best to help peop le with mental illness, but when there is inadequacy and all those things set in, we don't intentionally try to violate people's rights. But when you keep someone in the mental hospital then you can't provi de for the person, you then of course, you are violating that person's rights. Or ........if you have a child and the person is being vio lent and the only way you can control that person is to chain that pe rson...' (Respondent 16, World Health Organisation) Several respondents also criticised the quality of care within the psychiatric hospitals and other health care facilities. Human rights abus es against the mentally ill in health facilities were attributed by one respondent to the limited numbers of staff and the lack of training: \u00b4If you go into our health facilities, the intentio n is not to discriminate against the mentally challenged people, but I think it is the lack of personnel. So you may find people in the health fac ilities who are trying to handle these mental cases but do not know the best way to handle them.\" (Respondent 18, senior academic researcher) In the psychiatric hospitals, seclusion and physica l restraint was reported to occur as a result of the unavailability of sedating medicati on, or shortage of staff. Over- crowding in the psychiatric hospitals was reported to lead to inhumane and unsanitary conditions. Some complained that the sti gmatization of mental health 38 meant that violations of the person's rights was mo re common within psychiatric care than elsewhere in the health system: '...I don't think you will walk into any other hospit al and see someone lying on the floor, unless these days when the ward gets full, but here gradually maybe because of congestio n and because you think the people are mentally ill, (sebe wabo dam) [he might be mad] if he is lying on the floor somewhere, nobody care s' (Respondent 16, World Health Organization) Furthermore, it was also noted that the right of ac cess to care is strongly jeopardized by the inaccessibility of mental health services an d, in particular, the lack of psychosocial services in most parts of the country: Interviewer: 'Do you think government policy and ac tion ensures that people with mental health problems enjoy the same r espect, treatment and opportunities as other people? Respondent: 'No, I don't, because we don't have the people to handle such cases, so how do they enjoy the same? I f there is a psychiatric doctor and an ordinary medical officer, fine. Anytime they [the patients] come, there would be someone there to handle them. If there is an SRN [State Registered Nurse] and there is RMN [Registered Mental Nurse] then they are enjoying the same facilities, but once we only have the RMN, we have the medical officer, we do not have the psychiatrist, the psychoanalyst, the p sychologist, they are not given... .you know, that aspect are not given the needed attention at all.' (Respondent 62, senior public health nurse, distric t level) 3.1.5 The role of traditional and faith healers Many respondents referred to the pluralistic system of health care in Ghana, in which traditional and faith healers are major providers. Traditional and faith healers were identified by many respondents as playing an import ant role in the treatment of mental illness, a far more significant role in fact than orthodox health services: 39 'I would say that a greater percentage of all cases of mental illness are addressed by healers and fetish priest organiza tions, and so by virtue of their presence and number of cases they s ee, you cannot easily brush them aside. So they play a very, very big role.' (Respondent 57, director mental health NGO) 'They are the first point of call... People go to them first and they have their own interpretation and management system s for mental health. Some work, some do not work, but they are usually the first point of call, and they are usually the last point of call.[.... ].People think that mental health is not physical it is spir itual and they believe these are the custodians of spiritual issues so the y go to them. So they have a very important role to play.' (Respondent 6, director of department, MOH) Respondents indicated that people approach traditio nal and faith healers for various reasons. In the case of mental health they may be t he most easily accessible form of care when access to mental health facilities and pr ofessionals is not a practicality. However, many people who live within easy reach of psychiatric facilities, for example in Accra, also use traditional healers. Thi s may be because of the belief that mental illness is a spiritual illness which require s spiritual treatment: '... there are people who live in Accra who would get up and go to a traditional healer in the village somewhere. It is not because of access, it is not only because of access, I think i t is a mixture of several factors. For some people it might be becaus e of access, for some people it might be because of religious belief s, for some people it might be because of their perceptions of disease causation. I mean it is multi-factorial... I don't th ink you can just limit it to access.' (Respondent 5, senior academic health researcher) 'If they fall ill, one of the first things that the y think about is the supernatural forces, it's like something is happeni ng to me because somebody else is part of it, and because they hold that belief they end up at the traditional healers, you know, the sh rines, the religious prayer camps and something like that.' 40 (Respondent 31, senior academic psychologist) Traditional healers were seen as filling a 'yawning gap' in mental health service provision, particularly in providing psychosocial a nd spiritual support: '....traditional healers don't just tell...give you the physical causes, they give you the supernatural causes of your illne ss and so they are sometimes able to allay the fears of people and then go on to address those psychological problems, because somet imes they are possibly not drug-related conditions that need to have medications, or possibly some talking therapy, bein g able to understand where the person is coming from in terms of his own psyche and the rest, and they are able to adequatel y address this for them [.....] But to a large extent, because of wh at people think is the cause of mental illnesses, they are able to go there, and the other most important thing is that people who are p rofessionals and could have helped are woefully inadequate. So these people fill the gap. A very, very big yawning gap. Even if it is not adequate, if it is not to the best of standards, how many psychiatrist s are in the three northern regions? How many clinical psychologists a re available to people? So that is it. So that is why you just ca nnot brush them aside.' (Respondent 57, director, mental health NGO) As in the last quotation, some respondents saw the psychosocial and spiritual approach of traditional and faith healers to be com plementary to biomedical treatment: '...... some of the mental cases need somebody talk ing to them. I mean if you go to some of the spiritual healers and those kinds of things, like the churches and those kinds of things , the psychology of preaching to you, of telling positive things, ma y rekindle you and bring you to normalcy, even without medication. If there were readily available medications for treatment of cases and th ese were supported by such spiritual roles, I think that it will do a lot of good to the mental cases.' (Respondent 18, senior health researcher) 41 Several mental health practitioners, such as this C PN, reported working successfully in partnership with traditional and faith healers, visiting the shrines and churche s and providing advice and education: '...the traditional and faith healers? This people th ey are useful. Some.... you know, in our society we believe in this spiritualist and the fetish and these things, so some of our clients no matter what you do, no matter how well they become, some of the m will like to visit them and we don't deny them that. All that we are interested in is taking your medication from our side whilst you are attending for treatment from the other side too. So when our clie nts are maybe admitted at such places, if only we are informed by their relatives or the caregivers, we do pay them visits. We talk to e ither the spiritualist, the fetish priests, or whatever it is , we talk to them, we chat with them, they are friends, and even some of them this time they encourage the relatives and the clients to com e for treatment whilst they are there.' Interviewer: 'For problems that they think they can not deal with?' Respondent: 'Yes. So this time, or when they see th at the person's condition is delaying, you see, then they ask them to come. But we tell them that there are conditions, especially the acute phase, where the person may be very restless or aggressive , they should know that is not their area. That side they cannot do much about it, so they should convince them to come to the hospita l. After the person has settled, the person can be there and be receiving our treatment there and they will also be taking care o f the spiritual side.' (Respondent 2, Community Psychiatric Nurse, regiona l level) Many respondents, even at the policy-making level, advocated such collaboration between the 'clinic-based setting' and the 'faith-b ased setting' as a means of providing a holistic balance of care between psychi atric services and traditional and faith healers: 'I think, whether you like it or not, people are g oing to them, and because of our traditional beliefs and things, the first point of call 42 when people have mental illness is to go to these t raditional healers and faith healers because they think they are being bewitched or something is happening to them, which they have to seek for the causes. Most people would not even go to the hospit als and clinics. First, they would go there sometimes when they are well sorted out before they come to the hospital. So we are saying, whether you like it or not, people are going there, that is why we s hould involve them and perhaps do some kind of training for them, and also collaborate with them, so that even when they come to their pla ce, like faith healers, even though they are praying for that pers on and the church, at least the Pastor can advise that: \"See y our doctor, take your medication, come back to the church, and let's pray\". So I think we need to involve them and collaborate with them a lot.' (Respondent 16, World Health Organization) '...where I have seen successful management of mental c ases is being the link between the two - where the church e ncourages the patients to take their drugs and, you know, keeps m onitoring them, and create the environment for them to be aware of the fact that they have a problem that requires treatment, but th at is where it ends. And so we need to be able to strike that kind of relationship between the clinical setting and the faith-based se tting.' (Respondent 21, programme director, MOH) However concerns were raised by many participants a bout the human rights abuses that can occur in the prayer camps and traditional shrines. Clinicians reported that persons with acute cases of mental illness are ofte n chained, beaten and forced to engage in fasting. This nurse outlined in detail so me of the consequences of such maltreatment and reported that people with mental i llness may even die from the beatings they have received from traditional healer s: 'The traditional healers, some of them have been do ing well because some of them now, the CPNs have liaised wit h them so when conditions that they feel is getting worse, th ey call them. Even sometimes they call them and ask them for some of t he drugs to be given to the patients while the patients are there. But others too feel they know everything, so they chain the patients at the mercy of the 43 weather whether it's raining, whether it's shining, and the patients will be maybe chained to a tree and even the side w here it's chained, sometimes they develop sores, sometimes ga ngrene, sometimes because of the struggle they have fractur es and sometimes even in the hot sun they say that they wa nt to exorcise for the.....they believe that some spirits, sometimes ancestral spirits, sometimes familiar spirits, sometimes it's the pers on who have offended the gods, so they want to exorcise the bad spirit to come out of the patient. So even in the sun they beat, t hey whip the patient for that spirit to come out and in the end some of the patients become exhausted and they die. Some become unconsci ous and by the time that they call for help, the situation is worse.' (Respondent 1, senior nurse, psychiatric hospital) Some healers are reported to extort money from thei r clients or their families: 'The faith healers you know, sometimes end up abusi ng the people in various forms. They extort a lot of money from t hem for example. Sometimes there is physical abuse of rights, people are still being chained and beaten because they think that demons a re in them, and all of these are all forms of abuses.' (Respondent 31, senior academic psychologist) Some respondents felt there should be some form of regulation for traditional and faith healers in order to prevent such abuses: 'The challenge is ensuring that that system is regu lated because that is essential. We need to regulate whoever prac tices any profession. Unfortunately that system has not been well developed, so they go about and do their own things and nobody checks them.' (Respondent 5, senior academic health researcher) However one respondent pointed out some of the chal lenges in regulating traditional medical practitioners, particularly at the level of measuring the efficacy of their treatments: 44 '....officially we have a division at the Ministry of Health level coordinating traditional medical practice. Except that because of the absence of clear guidelines and regulatory frame wo rk its posing a major challenge, I mean because you are trying to i ntegrate orthodox practices with traditional ones.[.....] What is not clearly defined is the scientific basis of some of their cl aims and other things, and people's unwillingness to subject their claims to that same scientific rigour which is demanded of orthodo x medicine.[.....] We believe that they have a role, but I personally believe that the same standards we are applying to orthodox medicine should be applied to traditional medicine.' (Respondent 21, programme director, GHS) Others more pragmatically suggested education and t raining for traditional healers in mental health to support them in stopping abusive p ractices: '....So we need to actually collaborate with them [traditional healers] and then help them to be able to actually clean the ir system so that it can also help the people.' (Respondent 10, programme director, MOH) 3.1.6 Summary Interviewees situated mental health within the cont ext of current health policy which focuses on the need for health promotion and commun ity-based services which are easily accessible to the majority of the population . Mental health from this perspective was seen as a public health concern and grassroots health education as a means of promoting good mental health. Participan ts identified those living in rural and northern areas of the country as being the most affected by poverty and the distribution of health services, including mental h ealth services. However mental health was viewed as largely if not completely excl uded from the development agenda. Mental health was seen to take low priority in government policy due to the competition for resources in the context of the hig h burden of physical health concerns in the country, especially malaria and mat ernal and child mortality. The human rights of the mentally ill were recognised to be severely compromised both within allopathic and spiritual treatment centres. Many respondents recognised the value of traditional and faith healers in the psych osocial and spiritual treatment of 45 mental illness, advocating greater collaboration be tween traditional and faith healers and biomedical practice. However, it was noted that some healers abused the rights of their patients and that there was a need for edu cation of healers and closer regulation of their practices. 46 3.2 Mental Health Situation 3.2.1 Public perception of mental illness 3.2.1.1 Knowledge of mental health Respondents at the national and regional level expr essed the view that there was very limited knowledge about mental health among th e general population. Some attributed this to a lack of education. Mental illn ess was said to be misunderstood and feared: 'It is a big problem; the perception of people abou t mental health is that it is taboo. You know, people look at the ment ally ill, the mentally affected with... they look down on them. The y are scared of it, they don't understand it. So, mental illness is a misunderstood and difficult area for people in general.' (Respondent 54, senior academic) Respondents reported that for the general public, m ental illness is often viewed as a 'spiritual illness' or is connected with drug abuse . This can carry moral connotations as a punishment for misdeeds: '....they view it as a bad illness and something with evil spirits, as something to be avoided as much as possible. You kn ow, sometimes most people don't even view it as part of normal sickness, you know, and as something in response to some bad deeds, as it portrays in the films.' (Respondent 6, programme director, MOH) 'So with mental illness [..... ] .people think eit her you take in narcotics, or you are into hard drugs or you have d one something, and somebody has taken you to juju shrine that is m ostly the opinion that people hold.' (Respondent 27, national newspaper editor) 3.2.1.2 Concepts of mental illness 47 Mental illness was associated by respondents at the national and regional level with social isolation, abnormal and antisocial behaviour , dishevelled and dirty dress, nakedness, talking to oneself, and aggression: 'Maybe his dress code and everything, I mean, he do es not conform to whatever society does. His behaviour, all aspect s of his life... if he is not, or he doesn't even want to talk to peopl e, and all that. Always you see him quiet on his own. The man is in a world of his own. So he can't be part of us. So you can easily say that the man is mad.' (Respondent 22, accountant, psychiatric hospital) 'A normal human being will not talk to himself whil e he's walking, that is one of the issues. You see some people walk ing but they talk to themselves. Hallucination, or we say solilo quies, they talk to themselves whilst they walk [....] Some mental illnes s they don't talk, they walk normal, yet if you look at it from the way they dress, it is very abnormal to see somebody walking with th e genital organs open. So if you see some of these things hap pening, you will realize that this person is out of mind. It is also a characteristic which you can use to determine mental illness. Some of them dress nicely but they go about picking pieces of th ings that they are not supposed to even pick. This is also a sign, even in the beginning when it is coming these are some of the t hings that you see. But when it is getting higher, then the person begin to un- wear what he's wearing and walk naked, eat from unc lean places and other things. Some also take different dimensio ns, they attack people, when they see human beings they attack them , that one is very dangerous.' (Respondent 15, senior officer Mutual Health Insura nce Scheme) 'Well, if you see a person, I mean a normal being h e dresses nicely, but if you see somebody who dresses shabbil y and leave the hair unkempt, and normally you see the person t alking to himself, or making some gestures, you would know th at there is a problem, there is a mental problem there. If you ch at with the person, you may be conversing, but you will realize that the 48 attention of the person, or the focus of the issue, is not what the person is really talking about.' (Respondent 22, accountant, psychiatric hospital) 'Unguided statements made, you can be considered as mentally disturbed, disturbing public peace at random can be considered as a person who is mentally ill.... ' (Respondent 52, trainee counsellor) 3.2.1.3 Causes of mental illness There was a great deal of consensus among responden ts on the perceived causes of mental illness in Ghana. Many stated that mental il lness was the result of drug or alcohol abuse, particularly among young men, failed relationships in the case of women, or family hereditary traits. Excessive think ing and 'stress' were also seen to lead to mental illness. As a 'spiritual illness' me ntal illness could be caused by demonic forces or 'juju'. The following were typica l of such responses: 'But this is the use of abusive drugs, narcotic dru gs, excessive alcohol drinking, excessive use of cocaine, excessi ve use of 'wee' and all those things. They are creating those thin gs. Aside this, second is these marriage problems with the females. ' (Respondent 53, biostatistician, regional level) : '....maybe somebody being taken to juju, o r a shrine for offence committed. But largely I think it is about these fa llen or broken relationships, peddling in narcotics and maybe here dity matters.' (Respondent 27, national newspaper editor) '...the little I know is that, most people think that when someone is mentally ill, it is juju. Maybe the person has don e something wrong so they have taken him to the juju man. Some also b elieve that it is hereditary. So if they see you as a mentally ill pe rson, they say that : \"Eii!! Wei di wo abusia nu mu\" [this is in the family] you understand, and then some also believe that when yo ur pocket is not correct [you are struggling financially] you can behave 49 abnormally, that is the perception about the people in the community. And some also believe it is drugs, you k now, alcoholism and all that, you become addicted and this time the youth go into all those things.' (Respondent 42, senior health educator) 'Those who are religiously inclined tend to believe that the condition is spiritual. It could be a curse which a family ha s inherited, or a curse as a result of the person's own behaviors, ei ther insulting somebody or going against the norms of society or b reaking a taboo.' (Respondent 55, senior psychiatric nurse, regional hospital). Some participants who worked in health care contras ted lay stereotypes of mental illness with the more varied presentation of mental illness. They reported that the association of mental illness in Ghana with madness , abnormal behaviour, loss of function and violence, meant that depression and st ress were less well recognised: '...the lay person sees mental illness as illness ca used by madness... The lay person sees mental illness as some body who is naked in the street roaming about unkempt, or brand ishing a knife or cutlass, or something like that, or running into th e bush or smoking profusely, this is the concept of a mental patient to them. But this is only a small proportion of the population. Now a lo t of people, majority of people, suffer from neurotic conditions , which a lot of people cannot detect except [people like] you and me. ....the common man on the street does not know the differen ce, they only know about the one who is roaming on about the stre et who is mad.' (Respondent 56, psychiatrist in private practice) '.....So if you have problem with your brain it is pa rt of your body, but they see it as something really out of the ordinary and anytime somebody visits the mental hospital they think... say : \"You are mad\". But there is somebody, some cases that you ta ke there, you know, if you can't sleep, if you have constant head aches and things like that, if you overstress, this does not make yo u mad.' (Respondent 51, senior nurse trainer) 50 'When you say somebody is mentally unhealthy, I mea n, clearly you are talking about the obvious ones. [......] But kn owledge of late, I mean, is telling us that you may find somebody seem ingly normal but the person may have some mental deficiencies, o kay? Like a depressed person, you could classify as a mental ca se, but we have obviously thought about the violent ones in the str eets and things of that nature.' (Respondent 18, senior academic health researcher) 3.2.1.4 Women and mental illness Respondents commonly suggested that the inferior po sition of women in society, the discrimination against females in work and in famil y life, and marital breakdown or 'disappointment' in love could contribute to mental illness in women. Some respondents felt that as a result women were more p rone to mental illness than men: You see, the women are always in trouble. Even in m arriage they are in trouble, in childbirth they are in trouble, in everything they are in trouble, and the men are on top, they are messia hs.' (Respondent 35.3, psychiatric nurse) This newspaper editor made an association between b roken marriages and mental illness for women, which was repeated by other resp ondents: '....if you go to the psychiatric hospital in Accra f or instance, quite the number of people there, especially the female i nmate there, I mean have the problem as result of the broken marri ages, fallen relationships and others.' Another respondent, a biostatistician at the region al level, thought that as a result of 'marriage problems' women were more frequently admi tted to the psychiatric hospitals than men. However statistics available fr om the hospitals show a more or less equal balance between male and female users of psychiatric services. Those statistics from the mental hospitals which are disa ggregated for gender, do show a 51 greater proportion of males treated for problems as sociated with substance abuse (see p.108). However it may be that the true extent of mental di sorders among women is underestimated since many of them may not present t o psychiatric services. This researcher suggested that women may be more prone t o 'hidden' mental disorders such as depression or milder forms of psychosis and so escape attention: 'I will say that the obvious mental cases are more common in the men. You see that this can be by way of the cases w e see in the streets, do you get what I mean? But I think the on es that are not obvious, the ones that may be hidden like depressio n, psychosis, at the lower level are commoner in women, okay, and th is can be explained due to the male dominance of society and the bias in favour of males. Divorced women may run into crisis and usually it is women that are divorced. So these hidden ones are a big chunk that are not obviously sick but....so if you look at it at that level may be it could tilt even towards more women' (Respondent 18, senior health researcher) 3.2.1.5 Treatment It was stated by some participants that people in G hana generally believe that mental illness cannot be successfully treated or rehabilit ated: '....people feel that, people that are mentally ill c annot be treated which is wrong, that is a wrong perception because they can be treated, and they can be rehabilitated to live norm al lives, we just need a collective approach so that we all help to g et them out of that situation.' (Respondent 19, Department of Social Welfare) 3.2.1.6 Increasing public awareness of mental healt h In considering ways to increase awareness of mental health, public health education was seen as an important step, for example through community radio. Respondents suggested education in schools on drug abuse and te enage pregnancy, others 52 suggested talks to church groups and to chiefs in t he communities. However concern was expressed that there were no funds available to launch such campaigns. One respondent compared mental health with HIV/AIDS and suggested that mental health could draw lessons from the success of campa igns to increase the awareness of HIV/AIDS in Ghana: 'To do something about the... The problem about menta l health is that, that awareness is not coming out...We seriously as a country, need to do something about mental health, and for m e, awareness creation needs to be intensified. I will want to se e situations where people take mental health the way that HIV/AIDS pro pagation [of information] is done.' (Respondent 18, senior health researcher) 3.2.2 Low priority of mental health Mental health was perceived by many participants to be of low priority to the Ministry of Health and to society at large. It was felt that there was a lack of interest in and understanding about mental health at the government level. This view was expressed by both policy makers and mental health professiona ls: 'I think the whole issue of mental health is not lo oked at more critically like they look at maternal health and st uff like that. That is my point; the whole issue of mental health is not a n attractive place where people provide money into....' (Respondent 4, director of department, GHS) '.... the position of mental health in the social dev elopment in Ghana is very low because people are not interested in me ntal health' (Respondent 1, senior nurse, psychiatric hospital) '....people normally say everybody has a little menta l problem but unfortunately, it looks like our health policies do n't recognize that much, and for which reason we deal with other disea ses rather than mental health. And if you could get into our mental hospitals and 53 look at the structure, the facilities, the infrastr ucture itself, and even the number of doctors and nurses that managed those places, then you realize that government policies do not match e ffectively towards mental health.' (Respondent 28, criminal justice) Policy makers agreed that there is a large unmet ne ed in mental health. Concerns expressed by respondents included limited human res ources, an inadequate budget, poorly resourced and congested psychiatric hospital s, the inadequate supply of psychotropic drugs, the problems of accessibility t o psychiatric facilities for people in the central and northern parts of the country, and the presence of mentally ill vagrants. A senior policy maker at the Ministry of Health captured the gap between the mental health needs of the country, and the ava ilability of mental health services: '.....we have not been able to fulfil the totality of the mental health needs in the country. Our psychiatrists are aging, we have very few of them out there, our mental health nurses are not enough, access to mental health services in places like Savelugu t hat are far from Accra and Kumasi and things like that is limited. P eople don't have....there is no universal access to mental health services. There are too many mental health....people are mentally ill walking on the streets that we have not been able to respond to th eir needs. I mean generally, access to services, we have a problem, k nowledge about how to have good mental health is very limited in o ur society.' (Respondent 6, director of department, MOH) Mental health professionals were unanimous about th e low priority given to mental health in terms of treatment facilities and resourc es, support from other health disciplines, and even in the supply of essential me dication: Interviewer: '....is mental health in the development agenda in this country at all?' Respondent: 'On paper, yes, I have no doubt in my m ind that it is, but in practice I don't think so. Look at the situa tion in our mental health hospitals. The facilities are running down, there is shortage of nurses. Even though there is shortage everywhere we are worse off than anybody else. The way the Accra mental health hospital is run 54 down even, they wouldn't treat any other hospital l ike that.[.....] When you look at the resources that go into mental health, I don't know about elsewhere, but this teaching hospital, w e literally have to beg to be given what in my view represent the minim um requirements for us to work. We were treated that way by the administration. We have only one doctor and the wor k load here is heavy. The pharmacist, we have to beg them literall y for them to look at you in the face. Most of our drugs come an d they stay there, expire without them informing us. We will run short of drugs and they will not be replenished unless we go to beg. A s I speak now can you imagine such a thing as chlorpromazine is i n short of... ? We run out of chlorpromazine. How can you run a tea ching hospital like centre of excellence when we lack such a basic thing like chlorpromazine?' (Respondent 54, senior academic) 'If you go to the medical stores to get your drugs those who have money and they have paid for the drugs they will se rve them and they will not serve us. And even sometimes we don't get our drugs, as you are interviewing me now, since January this year we don't have any Tegretol in the system. And here we are, w e use this Tegretol for most of our patients and we don't have , and some of these are drugs when you go to the pharmacist shop, it is not drugs that are common. You can't get it so what do you ex pect from our patients? They will relapse and they will come back to us.' (Respondent 1, senior psychiatric nurse, psychiatri c hospital) There was a suggestion for greater advocacy for men tal health in order to increase the priority of mental health in Ghana: 'I think we need... we need a strong advocate or advo cates for mental health in this country, I really do. We need a group or individuals that will able to speak up on behalf of mental health because in African society, mental health has been shunned. It is something that is behind the scene, and they need a voice, they need to hear..., people need help in the mental arena .....I think we 55 need an advocate or advocates to bring mental healt h to the forefront.' (Respondent 37, clinical psychologist) 3.2.3 Poverty and mental health Respondents recognised a clear link between poverty and mental health. Deprivation was seen to lead to excessive worrying which could in turn result in mental disorder: '.....it's quite obvious, if you are poor you can't g et three square meals to eat, you can't look after your children, y ou tend to think more, you tend to get more worried and one of the c auses of mental illness is excessive worrying, when you can't find your way around problems, you will get a mental break down, those a re things that will cause stresses. You pass through all these st resses and along the line you breakdown. So we think there is a ver y strong link between poverty and mental illness' (Respondent 45, medical doctor, psychiatric hospita l) '.....somebody who is very poor and is thinking about his daily bread and his inability to fend for himself, take care of himself or the family, and is not able to come out of that situation, some times thinking about the problems can also sometime even make peop le become mentally sick.' (Respondent 17, policy maker, Ministry of Manpower, Youth and Employment) Older people were also seen to be vulnerable to pov erty and mental illness: '.... poverty is also a contributing factor, especia lly the aged ones. You know, the old ones who have nobody to care for them end up on the streets begging and before that they don't t ake their bath, they don't comb their hair, then they exhibit signs and symptoms of mental problem, but deep down if you go there you f ind out that the bottom line is poverty.' (Respondent 51, senior nurse educator, regional le vel) 56 Others also acknowledged that mental illness itself could lead someone into poverty, through impairing the person's ability to work prod uctively: 'If you are mentally retarded in the first place y ou can lose your job and that has something to do with poverty. Your fam ily can be poor because you are not working and besides that, on th e part of production, if it is on the part of farming, you wo n't be able to contribute your quota effectively to the family and that can cause a lot of harm to the family.' (Respondent 52, trainee counsellor) Some respondents linked the use of drugs and alcoho l and the consequent mental health problems to poverty, suggesting that poverty could lead to drug and alcohol abuse as an attempt to cope with the situation: '...the rich man, he who has, he manages himself, y ou know, no one would just get money, be blessed and have money and resolve to drinking and all those things. But it is those who don't have mostly, because the thinking is about: \"When I get buzzed [drunk] I forget about the problem\" So mostly they even go and borro w it, you see, forgetting that when they become sober the problem comes back.' (Respondent 22, accountant, psychiatric hospital) '....if somebody is poor and doesn't get enough resou rces to take care of his family okay? Unless the children grow, they require some basic needs: food, shelter, clothing and that kind of thing. So they would try as much as possible to even struggle them selves and sometimes these young ones fall into bad company an d because their parents have not [been] able to put them under their roof and have control over them, educate them through school , you know, talk to them, socialize them and advise them, they go into these bad groups....company, and then they begin to engage themselves... especially when they get into contact with drug- smoking and all those things. Sometimes these thing s expose them to or make them more susceptible to becoming mental ly deranged. So that is where for me poverty comes in.' 57 (Respondent 17, policy maker, Ministry of Manpower, Youth and Employment) It was felt that the low priority of mental health meant that the poor and mentally ill remain neglected in government policy: 'When you are poor and you unfortunately run into m ental health problems then you are dead, you are a carcass, beca use nobody is going to mind you....So mental health and poverty is still far down the ladder and I think something seriously needs to be done.' (Respondent 18, senior health researcher) Education was seen as one way of lifting people out of poverty and back to work. Respondents also stated that mental health policies should address poverty, since reducing poverty was a way of addressing the mental health consequences: Interviewer: '....do mental health policies address w ider societal issues like poverty, stigma and others?' Respondent: 'Yes, it should address that because wh en you get out of these things then poverty will be reduced, you s ee, it's a vicious circle, poverty can bring about the mental ill heal th, mental ill health will also bring about poverty, you know, so if you break the chain somewhere then...' (Respondent 41, regional director, GHS) 3.2.4 Stigma in mental health 3.2.4.1 Stigma towards mental illness Many respondents identified pervasive stigma toward s those with mental health problems in Ghana. This lead to mental illness bein g a hidden problem: '....there is a whole lot of discrimination and stigm a and that is a big, big problem in the sense that, if I am mentally ill , I may not tell you that I am mentally ill. I am happy to tell you I ha ve BP [high blood pressure] and so you shouldn't be talking too much because m y BP will rise [......] But to let people know that: \"Well, I suffer epilepsy so 58 when you see it this way, please help me.\" Very, ve ry few people would want to own up in that sense. And so ....the is sue is more or less swept under carpet and the rest, and that is w hy you see lots of them locked away in rooms or chained because of the extreme stigma. And that is a serious problem with regard t o understanding mental health or mental health problem confronting us as a nation.' (Respondent 57, director, mental health NGO) Stigma was related to a perception of mental illnes s as being predominantly associated with 'madness' and aggression: 'The perception is that people with mental diseases can be aggressive and therefore there is a tendency to avo id them just in case they became aggressive. But I guess it is also because people don't understand all the issues within the mental h ealth arena, even health workers are very sceptical about getting int o mental health..' (Respondent 5, senior academic health researcher) Other respondents suggested that the association of mental illness with spiritual causes, such as witchcraft or demons, a curse, or s ome form of spiritual punishment, could also result in stigma: '.....but as soon as you have mental problem, because for that one they think of demons, then all sorts of facts that probably the person who has the problem might be aggressive, so even ou r staff, even doctors, are afraid of mental patients, you underst and, because they think they can attack. Also the fact that they have these demonic ideas about them nobody wants to go near them.' (Respondent 38, psychiatric specialist) However, there were indications that attitudes coul d vary depending upon the perceived aetiology of the illness. Thus if a genet ic factor or a life event resulted in a person developing a mental illness they were more l ikely to receive public sympathy than somebody who became mentally ill as a result o f the abuse of narcotic drugs. Some respondents distinguished between mental illne ss which was 'health-related' and that which was 'self-inflicted', such as drug o r alcohol abuse: 59 Interviewer : 'Now what's your opinion on mental illness? We ha ve looked at the society's opinion so I would want to know your own opinion?' Respondent: 'I also have the same attitude because it is attitudinal; I mean it depends on how you get your mental conditio n, if it is a health related mental condition that you have not s elf-inflicted something on you by drinking hard drugs or somethin g, I mean there is the tendency to be more sympathetic and commit m oney to it and ensure that you regain your health. But if you are a habitual drug addict and it ends in that and the family tries a c ouple of times to rehabilitate you and you still go back, there is th e tendency of people giving up and leaving you to your own fate.' (Respondent 23, legal practitioner, judicial servic e) Several respondents indicated that the psychiatric hospitals are themselves a source of stigma: 'There are some places the stigma is there... remains ... so that even if you come.... once you have gone to the....once you have seen the inside walls of the mental hospital, and y ou come back, I mean nothing about you is correct.....' (Respondent 84.6, teacher, focus group discussion, district level) '....when you come into the hospital, you lose your freedom as a normal person. You are a mental patient that is, it takes a very long time for a non-mental patient to be able to co nvince the health personnel that he is not a mental patient' (Respondent 7, pharmacist, psychiatric hospital) One user revealed his experience of stigmatizing be haviour from staff working within the psychiatric hospitals: 'It is my hope that they will assist me out of this problem but now I'm not in good terms with them. Sometimes they make mo ckery of me with the sickness. Now I have made my mind to go ho me because I have seen that they want to take me to the ward whe re those who 60 are naked are living. When that happens, I will be destroyed so I will go home and even if it is outside, I will sleep.' (Respondent 77, user of psychiatric services) Whilst this view could be dismissed as merely refle ctive of the patient's lack of insight, or of symptoms of paranoia, it is illustrative of t he poor conditions of the psychiatric hospitals which is in itself stigmatising through i ts impact on the dignity of the patients. 3.2.4.2 Consequences of stigma Stigma has several consequences for those with ment al health problems and their families. It may prevent people from seeking help: 'People who are mentally ill are stigmatized, so mo st people wouldn't even come out to seek the necessary help t hat they need and to even take treatment which is available. And so people suffer for nothing and especially children with epilepsy a nd things.' (Respondent 16, World Health Organization, national level) The fear of stigma could lead to the family abandon ing the person: 'People see mentally ill patients as non-approachab le, you know, you can't approach them, they are harmful and they don't want to get near them. More so if a relative or somebody ex hibits those characteristics. They are likely to abandon that pe rson for fear of being stigmatized. So that mental health is not see n as a disease that one should associate him or herself with.' (Respondent 43, senior nurse educator) 'Well, when it happens so, from the family perspect ive, in the beginning there is that anxiety, they really want t o get cure for the person. So in the beginning, that desire, the urge is there, they rush the person to the hospital or to other places that they think they can get cure for the person, but as time goes on, if the cure is not coming, I mean, maybe it is not coming well, th en they give up and they don't see any good in the person again, an d that is why they even abandon the person altogether either at t he hospital or 61 wherever that they send the person to, and the pers on therefore is considered an outcast, you see, that is where that stigma is. So they really don't feel, I mean in terms of family, they don't even want the person to come back into the family becaus e they feel it's going to be a disgrace to them, you know, in some p laces when there is quarrel they begins to insult that: \"You, your family, you're mad people, that madness is in your family\", and th ose things, so society then also frowns on such people they normal ly don't want them back.' (Respondent 22, accountant, psychiatric hospital) The stigma associated with mental illness also resu lts in discrimination against those with mental illness in terms of opportunities for e mployment: '...when somebody is not mentally sound, no employer would want to take such a person to work for him or her becaus e it will mean that you would not be productive as it should be... I mean, as it is expected. So no employer would like to employ some body who is not sound in the mind.' (Respondent 29, counsellor) 'Employers per se, let me say that, I don't think t here is any employer who would like to give employment to a per son like that, and if the person is already in the employment and it happens then of course it's already there. If it happens and the person is rush to the hospital in good time and have the treatments a nd is a little bit ok, well the employer has no problem because the pe rson is going about his normal duty. I mean once the employer has no problem with the person I don't think that there is a probl em there, but where the person goes back and can't perform, then of course the employer also pursue that: \"You know, I cannot cont inue working with a mental person, I mean somebody who have ment al problem\", and so of course you also have to get the person out of his employment.' (Respondent 22, accountant, psychiatric hospital) 62 3.2.4.3 Stigma towards mental health professionals The stigma towards mental health was reported by ma ny respondents to extend to health professionals working in psychiatry and to t he specialisation as a whole: 'It is a fact also that when you come to psychiatry , be you a doctor or a nurse, there is a big stigma attached to you. People also use you as the butt of their jokes' (Respondent 55, senior psychiatric nurse, regional level) 'Even when you go to the market and they know that you are mental health nurse when you talk 'abodamfo \u00d4' [mad person] , because we are there, it transfers to us. Sometimes they insult us, even the general side people [general nurses], they insult us.' (Respondent 35.3, psychiatric nurse) 'Even the stigma, people sometimes when they see th at you are working with the mental health and you stay there, whenever there is something and perhaps you say, they will say: \"O h that guy don't mind him, he is with mental health so he is behavin g like them.' (Respondent 35, health administrator, regional leve l) Respondents suggested that the stigma, together wit h a fear of the patients as 'dangerous', means it is difficult to recruit healt h professionals into psychiatry: '....nobody wants to be trained for psychiatry becaus e of this stigma and then they say that there is no motivation. Do y ou understand? They think that is dangerous and there is no motiva tion, it's a dirty job, why should I go there?' (Respondent 38, psychiatric specialist, regional le vel) The stigma was seen to work even at the highest pol itical levels, meaning that psychiatry was often overlooked in policy formulati on and implementation: 'People just don't want to join the psychiatric uni t because of the stigma that is attached to it. We have to work a lo t on stigmatization; even stigmatization comes from educated people, fro m our own 63 colleagues, even the director general inadvertently , unconsciously, stigmatizes psychiatry by forgetting that we exist. They sometimes even forget that we exist. Certain letters that sho uld come down to invite us to certain places, sometimes they remembe r us as an afterthought from very high places. Politicians, th ey forget us. I remember a prominent politician I was sitting down with sometime ago, we were discussing an issue then I decided to slot in psychiatry, he just look at me, smiled and said: \"W hen we are thinking of people who would vote for us, you are t hinking of the psychiatric patient who doesn't have vote.\" This is the type of stigmatization that people have, and they stigmatiz ed everybody, not only the patient, the whole unit.' (Respondent 7, pharmacist, psychiatric hospital) Interviewer: Do you think government policy and ac tion ensures that people with mental health problems enjoy the s ame respect, treatment and opportunities as other people? Respondent: For now, I think it's no. Because, if y ou look at the way those with mental conditions are handled, even fami ly members tend to run away from relatives who are seen to be suffering from certain conditions and it looks like the support fo r such group is very little from central government. They only talk some times about these things, but we see very little action.' (Respondent 59, health manager, district level) Consequently the stigma attached to mental health w as reported to affect the prioritising and funding of mental health care. 'Most of our patients are stigmatized and that even affects the allocation of funds because people don't see how mo ney that should be given to people who are sane to be given to the insane who they feel can not contribute to society.' (Respondent 26, senior psychiatrist) 64 3.2.4.4 How to address stigma Several respondents mentioned education as a means of addressing stigma towards mental health: '....they should educate the people to get away from that stigma and then people can walk straight into the psychiatric hospitals and then come out with their problems.' (Respondent 51, senior nurse educator, regional lev el) 'Education must start somewhere, you know, educatin g people to understand that if somebody is mentally ill, it doe sn't mean the person should be avoided or something. And, like I said, that education must start somewhere, having mental healt h education incorporated into our curriculum so that it would b e taught in our basic schools.' (Respondent 27, national newspaper editor) One respondent suggested that mental health profess ionals could themselves take a role in developing a positive profile for mental he alth in Ghana: 'There is the need for people to understand what me ntal health is all about and change their attitude about mental health . There is the need for them to talk positively about mental healt h and there is the need for us who are in the mental health to carry o urselves in such a way that people realize how important our work is.' (Respondent 54, senior academic, regional level) 3.2.5 Participation of mental health service users in policy formulation Respondents differed in their opinions as to whethe r users of mental health services should be involved in policy formulation. It was acknowledged by some that for a policy to be sound, it needs the participation of those affected. This participant at the minister ial level gave as an example the involvement of people with disabilities in formulat ing the disability policy: 65 '...people with disability were involved in formulati ng that policy, it is their law, it is what they want that can make their life better and easier, so we called them to be involved. In the sa me vein, if it is the police or the prisons or whatever they want to put something like policy, the people themselves, the views of the pri sons given in there should be very, very crucial, should be impor tant when you want to make a good policy because those that are a ffected should have a say.' (Respondent 19, programme director) However when it came to the question as to whether those who are affected by mental health problems should be involved in policy formulation, some respondents, such as these teachers from the district level, exp ressed scepticism about the contribution that those with mental illness might b e able to make: 'Before you can make a... ..contribute to the policy making of the whole, it means you have to get at least a sound mi nd, and somebody with this mental illness cannot reason pro perly to give out good information, good suggestions for the entire n ation. So I don't think they are needed.' (Respondent 83.2, teacher, focus group discussion, district level) '....I don't think they [people with mental illness] should be involved [with policy formulation] because somebody who is mentally affected cannot bring normal policy for the benefit of the w hole nation.' (Respondent 82.1, teacher, focus group discussion, district level) However such responses were not restricted to non-h ealth professionals. One medical doctor saw the suggestion of involving ment al health service users in the development of policy as implying that mental healt h policy is being given less importance: 'The policy makers must look at it as very importan t area rather than asking for those in the mental health problem to co me in forming policies.' 66 (Respondent 74, medical doctor, district level) However other respondents among both health profess ionals and non-health professionals felt that since most people with ment al disorders are not chronically ill they should be allowed to take part in the formulat ion of policy when they are recovered: 'Maybe those who have been rehabilitated, they have come back to normal life, I am sure from their experiences, if t hey remember, they will be able to influence policy direction.' (Respondent 59, health manager, district level) 'There are cases where mental patients have been ful ly treated, they are fully recovered and for the rest of their lives they have lived normal life. So [for] such ones there is nothing wrong involving them in policy making as regards to the workplace and ot her place.' (Respondent 83.4, teacher, focus group discussion, district level) Some suggested that as 'experience is the best teac her', those who had experienced mental illness themselves would make valuable contr ibutions towards developing policies which concerned those facing the same or s imilar difficulties: 'I think [for] some of them it depends on the type of mental prob lem. It is better for you to let the person who has ) ex perienced the thing to come out. An example of somebody who has AIDS or somebody who has been in a little marital problem or somethi ng before, to me when the person is out of the thing, I think it is better for the person to come and sit down to explain a little about it. So in some aspects, I think those who have passed through a little shou ld be invited' (Respondent 83.1, teacher, focus group discussion, district level) '....the patients themselves, because they have ever been in such a condition, they are the best people to advise peopl e on what happens and the dos and don'ts so that others do no t fall into such mental health problems.' (Respondent 69, deputy headmaster, district level) 67 'Everybody has an opinion about something and as a matter of fact, if those at the grassroots are to partake in such p olicies, I believe sincerely we would come out with strong and concret e policies and surprisingly you may even see mental people bringin g out very intelligent opinions about how to make policies ver y strong. Though they are mentally disturbed, sometimes they are ver y intelligent. Sometimes as I said it is out of the problem they h ave encountered, out of it they have mental stress that leads to men tal illness. But that doesn't mean they are very stupid.' (Respondent 52, trainee counselor, district level) However this respondent from the Ministry of Health felt that although people directly affected by mental health policies, such as users a nd their carers should be consulted in policy formulation, they were often ex cluded due to stigma, poverty and a lack of awareness of current policy: 'First they even don't know where the policy is bei ng developed and they will not normally agitate, you know, for their rights or so. They are taken for granted because of poverty, because o f circulation, vulnerability, you know and stigma.' (Respondent 6, Programme Director, MOH) 3.2.6 Summary Responses indicated a perception among policy maker s, professionals in health care and the allied professions of a lack of knowledge a nd awareness of mental health amongst the population. Mental illness was reported to be viewed by many Ghanaians as a spiritual illness associated with pu nishment for immoral behaviour. Mental illness was seen to manifest itself in abnor mal or antisocial behaviour, including aggression. The causes of mental illness were linked to gender by several respondents. For men, mental illness was perceived to be the result of drug abuse, for women, mental illness was linked to failed rela tionships and their perceived inferior position in society. The association of me ntal illness with aggressive behaviour, drug abuse and madness, means that commo n mental illnesses such as depression may be overlooked. Public health educati on at the community level was seen as important in raising awareness of mental h ealth. 68 Participants widely agreed that mental health is a low priority in Ghana resulting in a gap between the needs of those with mental illness and the services available. Mental illness is seen to be overlooked in funding allocation and facilities neglected and poorly maintained. Consequently resources are i nadequate to provide effective mental healthcare with a scarcity of health profess ionals and facilities, as well as effective treatments. Poverty was seen to be strongly associated with men tal illness as it could lead to excessive worrying, which could in turn lead to men tal illness. It was acknowledged that mental illness could itself lead the person in to poverty through reducing productivity in work and daily life. Poverty was al so associated with the use of drugs and alcohol. The association of mental illness and poverty leads to a double burden for the person and their family. Addressing poverty was seen to have the potential to break the cycle of poverty and mental illness. Respondents identified pervasive stigma towards tho se with mental illness. Stigma was seen to arise as a result of the association of mental illness with madness and aggression, and the view of mental illness as a con sequence of spiritual punishment or malign spiritual forces such as witchcraft and d emons. Stigma has serious consequences for those with mental illness preventi ng some from seeking help. Some are hidden from public view or abandoned by th eir families. People with mental illness suffer widespread discrimination, particula rly in employment. Stigma also extends towards mental health services such as the psychiatric hospitals and towards professionals who work in mental health. Th is affects the morale of staff members and the recruitment of health professionals into psychiatry. Stigma towards mental illness also affects the prioritising and fu nding of mental health services with mental health seen to be overlooked in policy formu lation. Public education was seen as the key to addressing stigma in mental health. There were differences expressed among participants as to whether users of mental health services should be involved in policy formul ation, with some expressing the view that users would not be able to make a valuabl e contribution. Others felt that as the recipients of services, those with mental illne ss should be consulted in policy formulation for mental health and that the experien ces of users would be of benefit in formulating effective policy. However in practice i t was felt that those with mental illness were seldom consulted due to pervasive stig ma and their generally low social status. 69 70 3.3 General Policy Making Processes in Ghana Most policy makers indicated that ideally policy-ma king should be a bottom-up process that emanates from consultation with key st akeholders at the grassroots. Following the consultation, a draft policy is compi led. This is then debated in parliament, following which a white paper is drawn up, before being accepted for implementation. 'Policy making in Ghana for instance should come fr om the grassroots that is how it should be. We have member s of parliament who sit to enact..., so before they take any policy o ut, they are supposed to make sensitization, they go down to the grassroots and get the opinion and views of the people.... then when these views are collated, the various members of parliament sen d it to parliament for a debate. Then government will adopt it, write the white paper on it and then it is implemented.' (Respondent 15, senior office, Mutual Health Insura nce Scheme) 'But basically the Ministry of Health level is the policy making body and depending on the issue involved, it involves co nsulting people from the grassroots, getting feedback on a particul ar issue and then through various stakeholder discussions, we come to a consensus on that... It moves into.... the dissemination of that consensus agreement for various people to give feedback to th at, and then after passing through a series of further consultat ions, finally the minister appends his signature to the document, it is then circulated to various stakeholders, I mean, for implementation .' (Respondent 12, programme director, GHS) Stakeholders in the health sector identified by res pondents included health professionals, donors, NGOs, church leaders, tradit ional authorities, district assemblies, as well as users of health care service s and their families. Also mentioned were other related ministries and agencie s such those who deal with water and sanitation. 71 This respondent described policy-making in Ghana as a 'process' or 'dialogue' which involved consultation with a wide variety of stakeh olders, from the users of health services up to government level: '....policy formulation is a process, it is not a one time event and there are various stakeholders in the health care d elivery environment.[....] The health sector as you know, i s decentralized: we have the headquarters, we have the regional, dis trict, sub-district people, and these issues percolate from down there where the needs of the people are identified by the community members and the sub-district people identify what these needs a re and it goes up to the district level, to the regional level before it is crystallized at our national level. So it is a dialogue that is continu ous.' (Respondent 5, senior academic health researcher) However, the responses of policy makers indicated a gap between the textbook process of policy making and the reality on the gro und: '.... people think policy is about classroom work. In reality, it is not. So there is not...I mean there is supposed to be a la id- down process, but in reality it doesn't happen. I don't want to go into the theoretical processes of policy making. But basical ly, we would want to bring up a policy to address a need. A need can be defined technically, can be defined politically, or you can define it from numerous perspectives. So it can be brought on to t he agenda by the media. But generally, you will put in place a certain policy intervention to address a specific challenge and th at can be based on analysis of a certain urgency and immediacy. Ide ally, you should do all the analytical work. In reality, it does not always work. Ideally it should go through a certain process in terms of steps and in terms of consultations that ends at the cabinet level. So metimes it moves from policy to legislation, to the legislature but this doesn't always happen.' (Respondent 6, director of department, MOH) 72 This was borne out by the responses of interviewees working within health services who stated that in practice extensive consultation did not take place at the grassroots level: 'Yes those that we think they are under-representin g is the community members, talking about the District Assem blies, the local government, the religious bodies, all these people should be part of it, but they are not. It is always done at the top there, the ministerial level. Then they call us, we the professionals to m ake input. So we just go there to develop standards, protocols, proc edures, but at the end of the day the stakeholder is at the community, the district assembly, the religious bodies and the NGOs should be represented.' (Respondent 47, hospital administrator) It also became clear from the interviews that somet imes policy is driven by processes other than the needs of stakeholders. This research er claimed that government manifestoes may play an important part in driving p olicy formulation: '....the government also has a development agenda wh ich includes health, so the President can say: \"Well I think thi s is an area in health that I need to address\", so apart from the p olicies being emanated from below, government can also decide th at, for instance, I mean, they decide as their........ So, yes, government can have its policy directions that: \"This is what I want to do\".....' (Respondent 5, senior academic health researcher) Moreover respondents noted that international healt h partners and donors have a significant influence on health care policy. Some p olicy makers stated that external agencies such as WHO, the World Bank, UNICEF and DF ID, provide the majority of funding for the health budget in Ghana. According t o the Ministry of Health, the percentage of earmarked donor funding for health ra nged from 60% in 2001 to 40% in 2006, representing a significant proportion of t he total health budget (Ministry of Health Ghana 2005). It was observed that the conseq uences of this external investment in Ghana's health budget were that the f unding priorities of NGOs and other external stakeholders could determine what ne eds were addressed in health planning: 73 '....whether you like it or not, if you have a budget , a country's budget that depends almost 60% on donations from ou tside the country, then the donors also have a role. So all o f them come on board. I mean maybe DANIDA say: \"I have money to do this\", maybe USAID also say: \"Maybe as for me I don't want my money to be used for family planning\", maybe.... I mean they a ll have their interest. So you need to take all those all those o n board, and then we have the NGOs, small NGOs, also doing their own things in their corners and all that.' (Respondent 5, senior academic researcher) Policy makers stressed that policy decisions in hea lth in Ghana are not made unilaterally, but are driven by global trends and i nternational agreements to which Ghana is a signatory. For example, organisations su ch as WHO and the UN agencies have global targets, such as the Millenniu m Development Goals and policies are formulated at the government level to facilitate the achievement of such goals without going through the process of stakehol der consultation: 'There are some global.....serious global issues that will continue to influence the way we do business as a country. Mill ennium Development Goals stand out quite strongly, current ly providing a new focus for the way or for the results we all wan t to achieve. Whereas in the health sector, there are things like the global funds that have come to stay. Aiming at pushing forward t he TB, HIV/AIDS. There is a whole area of globalization an d WTO activities that is influencing international property rights i ssues as they relate to drugs, there are things to do with something cal led a Paris declaration that is about aid effectiveness, harmon ization, alignment of support. Global economic trends affect us in hea lth and the recent increases in fuel affected the health sector , terror is leading to changes in the way you do business.....everything affects everything here.' (Respondent 6, director of department, MOH) '..... there are global strategies, global policies t hat look at all these and then see how we can work towards achieving thos e goals and 74 policies. If you take the World Health Assembly for instance, it is all the health ministers who meet and then they decide the way forward. So if the heads of agencies and the AU de cide that this is the way forward, then it comes to government. It is up to government,... how best they can align their policies and strategies to attain most of these goals.' (Respondent 11, World Health Organization) One respondent compared the difficulties of working with the ideological priorities of the various funding partners to 'walking a tightrop e', in which it was easy for certain issues to become defused: 'Most of our decisions are determined by the resour ces that are put up at our disposal. We have to play a game with dif ferent partners who have different ideas and ideologies and so it i s a very difficult situation. Having said that, I would like to emphas ize the fact that, priorities in the health sector and funding priorit ies in the health sector is a very difficult issue, but it's like wal king a tightrope....' (Respondent 21, programme director, MOH) Another respondent indicated that it is sometimes t hose policies which do not pass through the process of grassroots consultation that are most easily implemented because they come with strong government support an d resources. He gave an example of the National Health Insurance Scheme: '....this government in power now have decided that out of their manifesto they want to abolish 'cash and carry'. So as far as health financing is concerned, that is their position. But then if they say they want to abolish 'cash and carry' who pays for the services? So then through that declaration the technical people are mandated to work out an alternative health financing mechanism and history tells us what has happened.' (Respondent 5, senior health researcher) Concern was expressed by several respondents abut t he gap between policy and implementation. One respondent pointed out the need to ensure that the resources are available to implement the policy in the first place: 75 '...you make sure that even if that policy that you a re going to put in place is implementable. That is the important thing : Are you going to get the desired results by putting the policy in pl ace? That is the question you should ask yourself, and of course you don't just formulate policies for the sake of formulating. You want to change a particular situation from the worse to the better, that is why you even formulate policies and put the structures in place, put the strategies in place in getting in back.' (Respondent 19, Department of Social Welfare) 3.3.1 Summary Responses identify a gap between the ideology of po licy-making in which there is extensive consultation prior to policy formulation, and the reality of policy-making in practice. Participants suggested there is little co nsultation with stakeholders at the community level and that policy in Ghana may be dri ven less by grassroots consultation than by the priorities of government a nd donor agencies. Global development policy sets targets and agreements whic h often drive the formulation of policy at the national level in Ghana. Policy can t herefore become concentrated in key areas defined at the international level. Respo ndents expressed concern about the commitment to policy implementation and suggest ed that it is often those policies which originate from government and donors which ar e provided with the most support and resources for their implementation. 76 3.4 Process of Mental Health Policy and Law Develop ment Much of this and the following section draws on res ults from the completion of the WHO Mental Health Legislation and Policy and Planni ng Checklists. The full text of the completed versions of these can be viewed in Ap pendix 2. 3.4.1 Mental health policy development Respondents indicated that the development of menta l health policy and legislation is also seen as a process that starts with consultatio n with relevant stakeholders. However it was acknowledged by this psychiatrist th at consultation rarely reached down to those stakeholders at the grassroots of men tal health service provision: 'Mostly, it is only mental health providers who are involved in the development of the policies and we involve heads of the units but it doesn't transfer to the whole other non-mental heal th providers. It is more within the.... it is more like a vertical consul tation more than involving all the other stakeholders. But then thi s is usually corrected by the meetings that we have with the man agement. We have management meetings which used to be twice a y ear. It is then that we explain some of the policies to manage ment. But that doesn't go down to the implementers at the lower le vels.' (Respondent 26, senior psychiatrist) Mental health professionals talked about the lack o f consultation in policy development, particularly in the rural areas, far f rom the centres of power. Some perceived policy-making in mental health to be a hi erarchical process which excluded those at the grassroots, such as less senior health professionals, and traditional or faith healers: 'What happens is, if let's say policy is to be draw n on psychiatry, yes we know the doctors are there, we know the nurses a re there, yes, usually you will think in terms of the specialist, we think in terms of nurses who are in charge, the PNOs [Principal Nursing Officers] , the directors, but then at times, that nurse who is not a director but is in a typical rural area representing the government as regard to 77 psychiatric services, that nurse has got some infor mation. She knows some solutions or some problems which if they were presented to this body, will be able to achieve and redraw or refocus their vision. But then these people are ignored for all... before they hear [about it] , some people have met in Accra and this is what th ey are going to do. So they say: \"Okay, let them go ah ead\". So if the thing starts, for example, a letter is sent to this people, that: This is what we are planning to do. What do you think? (Respondent 55, senior psychiatric nurse, regional hospital) This respondent thus is suggesting that it would be difficult for implementers to accept new policies when they have not been consult ed from the outset. 'Now when these things are happening, I mean nobody rise to stand and say: \"No, we are all talking about this, but ha ve you considered this area? Have you asked this man? This man is kno wledgeable, this man is in the community, even it could be thos e people who have been treating our patients in church houses, l et's go and ask them why the people come there in the first place? If we know why, yes some of them will prefer going to the fetish pr iest. Why do they go there?\" You can still ask them, they can also gi ve a contribution. But then we always think that these are experts - t he specialist, the administrators, but these people are always in the cities. Life in the cities and the philosophy when you live in the city is usually different from what is pertaining in the rural area..' (Respondent 55, senior psychiatric nurse, regional hospital) One psychiatric nurse pointed out that if mental he alth professionals are involved in developing a policy, then they will be more likely to be committed to implementing it: '... but when it comes to policy making sometimes, they make the policies and they push it onto us. We are not part of the policy.....It's not broadened. Even sometimes we are not aware of i t, and before we realise: \"This policy has been made and this is your copy\". Then how do you implement it? Because when you are part of the planning you make sure for the policy to succeed, y ou make sure you implement it very well.' 78 (Respondent 1, senior nurse, psychiatric hospital) Another respondent felt that due to the low priorit y of mental health, the formulation of mental health policy was always an 'afterthought ': 'I will tell you the truth: the attempt to formula te policy for mental health is always an afterthought in my view, it is not the priority in itself. Now when something is not a priority, we do n't give a whole lot of attention to it. We are not even attentive to th e processes that will affect the best policy for you. So, that I believe is the reason why mental health is not given the priority attention a nd therefore it is always an afterthought.' (Respondent 19, department of Social Welfare, natio nal level) 3.4.2 Current status of mental health policy in Gha na Completion of the WHO Policy checklist revealed tha t the 1994 Mental Health Policy had a high level mandate for its development as the Director General and the Chief Psychiatrist as advisors to the Minister of Health were involved in the policy formulation process. Consultation took place with t he Medical Directors of the psychiatric hospitals, the Department of Policy, Pl anning, Monitoring and Evaluation at the Ministry of Health and the Health Research D irectorate. However there was no budget allocated to the policy development process. There was no consultation with representatives from the health sector responsible for pharmaceuticals, human resource development, child health, HIV/AIDS, and e pidemic and disaster preparedness divisions. There was no intersectoral consultation with representatives from the Ministries of Finance, Education, Social W elfare and Criminal Justice. Users of mental health services and their families were a lso not consulted in the development of the policy, nor was the private sect or. There was little international consultation, although there was some exchange of i nformation with Nigeria. The main sources of data to inform the policy developme nt were student theses and quality assurance data from the psychiatric hospita ls. No research was undertaken to inform the policy, and there was no consultation wi th the Health Research Centres of the Ministry of Health. 79 The policy promotes the development of community ca re and the integration of mental health into primary health care. This was co nfirmed by participants in the qualitative interviews who stated that current ment al health policy prioritises moving the focus of mental health care away from the psych iatric hospitals and towards the integration of mental health into general medical h ospitals in the regions and primary care clinics: 'The priority is we want to establish a psychiatric wing at all the tertiary institutions like Korle Bu Teaching Hospit al, Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital and the regional hospitals in the whole place. Then when you come down to the health centres and health posts, anybody with even a psychological problem, we want that person to go to the health post, nearer... accessibility... nearer to his home or his village.....' (Respondent 1, senior psychiatric nurse) In addition the mental health policy also addresses the shortage of staff in mental health through the training of additional staff and the provision of incentives to enable the retention of staff in mental health services. However an important omission in the mental health policy is the source of funding to implement many of the policy objectives. The only specific group targeted by the mental heal th policy are those affected by substance abuse. 3.4.3 Areas of action for policy development The WHO policy checklist and interviews with partic ipants revealed several areas for policy development. Participants expressed the need for mental health policy development in Ghana, with several participants str essing the need to update current mental health policy. It was suggested by some part icipants that mental health policy development was of importance since mental illness was perceived to be becoming more widespread in Ghana and hence a public health concern: 80 '...mental health has not been given the needed supp ort in the country, we have not treated it as an important are a in our health delivery and I think is about time we become very s erious in that. Because the conditions..., mental illnesses are now b ecoming very frequent, they are becoming common; there is a publ ic health concern. So we must develop polices to be able to c hange the trend, the terrain and the development of mental he alth.' (Respondent 74, medical doctor, district level) Furthermore, it was recognised that mental health p olicy will need to be modified in the light of the new mental health legislation, so that laws and policies will be working 'hand in hand'. It was suggested that mental health policy would be given more power by making it into law: 'There are so many policies that even our policy I don't think has been, so to speak, well, I think it is approved, bu t it has not gone through parliament. The policies were approved at t he ministry level, they were not policies backed by law. So it's more like a gentleman's policy which from time to time we tease out some and implement.' (Respondent 26, senior psychiatrist) The WHO checklist revealed the need for more extens ive consultation in the development of mental health policy, particularly w ith users of mental health services and their families and other community-level stakeh olders. This was echoed by respondents in the qualitative interviews who indic ated that there needed to be greater consultation with 'grassroots' stakeholders in the development of mental health policy including service users, and local go vernment at the district level: 'I would like to see really a debate of issues in t he open by all stakeholders before any such policy is developed. W e need to talk to all stakeholders, users, we need to talk to work ers, we need to talk about the relatives of users, and we need to t alk to everybody in the society.' (Respondent 54, senior academic) 81 '....the District Assembly level, that is the grassro ots. That is where you can touch the grassroots people. For me I would suggest that the people should be involved in policy making in t he country, and then the District Chief Executive and his people sh ould be given the mandate and should be given the necessary logistics and resources to go in and educate the grassroots people with get ting their opinions as well and making sure that these opinion s from the grassroots people are sent across to the national o r for debate and implementation.' (Respondent 52, trainee counselor, regional level) There is also a need for research on best practices in mental health on which to base policy directives. It was noted in the checklist exercise and by respo ndents that many of the objectives of the policy had not been fully implemented, for e xample de-centralisation of mental health care, integration with regional and district health services, the establishment of a co-coordinating committee for mental health, and the training of workers for mental health delivery. As this former mental health polic y maker noted, the psychiatric hospitals remain the main national resource for men tal health care, despite their evident short-comings: 'We thought the Accra psychiatric hospital will no t exist after the year 2000, but it is still there, even though it is performing a purpose.... like what it serves is not really giving mental health the desired recognition because the conditions are very poor, the unhygienic conditions... its too big, there are few p eople to manage it, and the staff themselves have been institutiona lized.' (Respondent 26, former mental health policy maker) There is also little commitment in the policy towar ds improving the working conditions of mental health professionals, including maintaini ng safety and strategies for retention. This was echoed by this respondent who a dvocated the need for community-based mental health care to enable the de -centralisation of mental health services: 82 'From the grassroots we will be able to progress gr adually and reduce the incidence of these conditions before the y reach the regional level. So I feel education is very basic a nd if you want to tackle those points then the community psychiatric nursing should be effective in the country and the policy which is being drawn should be able to cover them, see to their safety a nd then give them all the necessary incentives so that they will be a ble to stay in the community and assist. And if this is done, I feel t hose who will be going to the psychiatric hospital the number will r educe.' (Respondent 55, senior psychiatric nurse, regional hospital) 3.4.4 Mental health law development Over the last ten years there has been an acknowled ged need to develop new mental health legislation in Ghana. The current 197 2 legislation is out of date and does not accord with the World Health Organisation standards. An attempt was originally made to revise Ghana's mental health leg islation in 1996, however the WHO World Health Report on mental health in 2001 (W HO 2001) gave renewed impetus to the movement for mental health law refor m. In 2004 a committee was convened to review the existing mental health legis lation in Ghana utilising the WHO Checklist on Mental Health Legislation (WHO 2004). The committee consisted of the Chief Psychiatrist and other consultant psychiatris ts, psychologists, nurses, the Director of Traditional and Alternative Medicine fr om the MOH, the human resource manager from Accra Psychiatric Hospital, and a repr esentative of CHARJ, and was supported by an external team of consultants from t he WHO Department of Mental Health in Geneva. The details of this review are se t out in the completed WHO Checklist on Mental Health Legislation (see Appendi x 2). The development of the new mental health law was pr aised by participants for the extensive consultation with all stakeholders, from mental health professionals to care givers, and community members: '..... for the first time, we went with nurses, peopl e are on the ward giving all that the policy makers... and then we the administrators..., so care givers are very much involved. And we also took ideas from even those who are looking after..., some community m embers are 83 also involved, so it a holistic something, holistic approach and participation is quite encouraging.' (Respondent 45, psychiatric specialist, regional l evel) 3.4.5 Summary As with policy-making in general, the development o f mental health policy was seen to exclude consultation with key stakeholders at th e community level. Policy-making was seen to take place in the cities, without consu ltation with those living and working in the rural areas. Those responsible for m ental health service implementation often felt that policies were pushed onto them from above. The current mental health policy was formulated with li ttle intersectoral collaboration nor grassroots consultation, and requires updating to b ring it into line with the newly drafted mental health law. Whilst mental health pol icy states a commitment to decentralization, the integration of mental health into community-based primary care services, and the training of mental health profess ionals, in practice this has not occurred. In part this may be due to insufficient a ttention in the policy to sources of funding for the planned initiatives. Respondents st ressed the need for more consultation in mental health policy formulation, p articularly with users of mental health services and their families, and with local government at the district level. However the process of mental health law developmen t has involved greater consultation with relevant stakeholders. The 1972 M ental Health Decree was reviewed in 2004 and the formulation of the new dra ft mental health legislation has drawn on an extensive consultation process at all l evels from WHO to community members. 84 3.5 Content of Mental Health Policy and Law 3.5.1 Content of the 1994 Mental Health Policy The 1994 Mental Health Policy contains a vision sta tement which includes human rights, social inclusion, and some commitment to ev idence-based practice. The policy has the following objectives: 1. Decentralisation of mental health services throu gh the development of regional mental health units and outpatient facilit ies for mental health at the district level 2. Establishment of a national mental health co-ord inating group 3. Establishment of a technical co-ordinating commi ttee 4. Provision of a specialist unit for the managemen t of substance abuse 5. Training of mental health professionals 6. Provision of incentives for the retention of men tal health workers 7. Raise mental health awareness for the family and community 8. Establish mental health personnel in regional an d district health management teams 9. Provision of transportation for community mental health workers 10. Provision of quarterly and annual reports on me ntal health activities at regional and district levels 11. Annual mental health service review and plannin g meetings 12. Training of specialist community mental health workers 13. Rehabilitation of the mentally ill in the commu nity through the provision of rehabilitation centres such as half-way homes and d ay centres 14. Provision of free psychiatric services This is consistent with WHO mental health policy ob jectives for co-ordination and management of mental health services, promoting de- institutionalisation and community-based mental health services, the trainin g of mental health workers, and the need for promotion, prevention and rehabilitati on in mental health. However the policy does not adequately address the following aspects included in the WHO policy checklist: 1. Evidence-based practice 2. Promotion of human rights 85 3. Provisions for funding of mental health services 4. Legislation 5. Protecting the safety of mental health workers 6. Training of staff in core mental health competen cies 7. User advocacy 8. Strategies for intersectoral collaboration No budget or timeframe is mentioned in the Policy w hich was judged by the reviewing committee who completed the WHO policy an d planning checklists to use 'non-committal language' and to read more like an ' action plan' than a policy The policy states a commitment to free psychiatric trea tment, but does not mention the amount, nor the sources of funding. 3.5.2 The Five Year Mental Health Programme There is a five year programme of work for mental h ealth (2006-2011) which has been drawn up by the Mental Health Unit of the Mini stry of Health and Ghana Health Service. This has the following objectives: Reorganization of mental health services Promulgation of Mental Health Law and Legislative Instruments Establishment of Mental Health Board Decentralization Training Improve quality of care Improve infrastructure Provide support services Promotion of mental health Some of the plans for achieving these objectives ar e: Dissemination of mental health policy Training of workers for mental health, including m ental health professionals such as psychiatrists, psychologists and occupational th erapists, non-specialists in primary health care and traditional healers Standardising diagnoses through the use of the IC D-10 86 Provision of mental health workers in district hea lth facilities Establishing psychiatric wings in all regional and district hospitals Improving quality of care through continuing educa tion and quality assurance Improving aftercare and rehabilitation services, i ncluding half-way homes Provision of essential drugs Rehabilitation of the psychiatric hospitals As with the policy, the Five Year Mental Health Pro gramme had a high level mandate for its establishment, as the Director of Policy Pl anning Monitoring and Evaluation division of the Ministry of Health was involved as well as the Director-General of the Ghana Health Service, the Chief Psychiatrist and a representative of the Deputy Director of Nursing Services. However, as with the policy, the development of the mental health programme did not include representat ives from the ministries of Social Welfare and Housing, representatives from th e Criminal Justice System, users of mental health services and their representatives , nor the private sector. There were representatives from the NGO Basic Needs Ghana , WHO and the Royal Netherlands Embassy. The plan includes strategies and activities that ar e consistent with the mental health policy and the draft bill. As with the policy, the plan demonstrates a commitment to the development of community-based services for men tal health. It also specifies strategies such as community education for the prom otion of mental health. However, the plan makes no reference to research as the evidence base. Whilst the document specifies clear timeframes for action, the plan lacks detail on how the objectives would be implemented, nor the sources of funding. There is very limited resource allocation which makes many of the objecti ves unfeasible. There is also a need for strategies to promote the supply and distr ibution of psychotropic medication at all levels of the health service, and to improve the structures of mental health information systems. There are no formal structures for intersectoral collaboration mentioned in the plan. There is no emergency or disaster preparedness plan for mental health in Ghana. 87 3.5.3 Appropriateness of current mental health poli cy Whilst current mental health policy states a commit ment to the decentralisation of mental health services, the development of communit y mental health, and the training of mental health professionals, the lack o f dedicated funding, particularly at the regional and district levels, means that mental health policy remains far removed from the reality of practice. Following the documen tary analysis conducted for the WHO Mental Health Policy and Plan checklist the rev iewing team concluded that: 'Mental health is a priority only on paper. In real ity it is very poorly resourced. The policy document is well-formulated. However, it is the Ministry of Health which has to decide on the p riorities and for now mental health is not one of the priorities.' In fact it was felt by the reviewing committee that mental health policy implementation was simply beyond the means of the available resour ces as reflected in this comment: 'There is a lot of lip service in terms of commitme nt to implement the mental health strategies and plans. Mental health a ppears too expensive for the policy makers to implement.' This view was closely echoed by interview responden ts: '.... even though the Ghana Health Service and Minist ry realizes that mental health is an important ingredient in th e health care delivery system, they have paid lip service and oft en resources are not given adequately for running of services both a t the institutional level and at the community level.' (Respondent 26, senior psychiatrist) '....on the ground, I have worked with the Mental Hea lth Unit and sometimes you see the handicap that they go.... I mea n in terms of finances, in terms of the support to run even the m ental health institutions and so I can say that it is not easy f or them, it is not easy for the Mental Health Unit, but otherwise governmen t states clearly in the Programme of Work, that it is, the Ministry of Health Programme of Work, that mental health is also a com ponent of the 88 health programme. Where they are talking about inte grating mental health into primary health care, they have even gon e ahead to... even some region hospitals have designated wards fo r mental health. So they are trying, is not like a total neg lect, but to me, I think if we pump in more support, financially into the se ctor it would be better.' (Respondent 16, World Health Organisation, national level) Therefore whilst there is recognition that some ele ments of the plan and policy are being rolled out, the failure to allocate adequate resources prevents their full implementation. Some mental health professionals also queried the c urrent exemption policy of providing psychiatric treatment free of charge. It was felt this was unsustainable in the long term and encouraged families to abandon th eir relatives at the psychiatric hospitals. Some participants suggested that charges should be introduced for those who can afford it: '.......even the advanced countries, people contri bute something, patients or their relatives, contribute something b ecause the government alone will not be able to pay, especiall y in a very poor country because the drugs alone are very expensive, buy the drugs, give it free, buy food, give it free, so we think t hat they should look at the funding and take a more pragmatic decision..... .' (Respondent 45, psychiatric specialist, regional le vel) 3.5.4 Links with other relevant policy Respondents referred to several government policies , some recently introduced, which have an important bearing on mental health in Ghana. These included policies on education, employment, local government, disabil ity and poverty. The following are some of the policies which were mentioned by pa rticipants as having relevance for mental health. 89 3.5.4.1 The National Health Insurance Scheme The government introduced the National Health Insur ance Scheme (NHIS) towards the end of 2005 to replace the 'cash and carry' sys tem for health care. Children under 18, adults over 70 and 'indigents' are exempt ed from contributions. By the end of 2005, 22% of the population had registered with the scheme. The NHIS does not cover psychiatric treatment as th is is provided free of charge in the psychiatric facilities such as the psychiatric hospitals and CPN clinics. Patients are therefore not required to register with the sch eme in order to receive free psychiatric treatment. However it can prove difficu lt for patients to access free treatment for psychiatric disorders outside the psy chiatric hospitals and specialist facilities. In addition, the costs of treatment for physical health problems are not met if the patient is referred to the general hospitals, u nless they are registered with the NHIS. With the understanding that psychiatric servi ces are free, many patients are not registered and so cannot access non-specialist care for physical illness. This situation provides major difficulties for psychiatr ic facilities which have to pay for medication not listed as psychotropic. A way out of this is for the psychiatric hospitals to register all psychiatric patients with the schem e as indigents. This qualifies them to receive health insurance for free. The mental healt h facilities would therefore prefer to have mental health services no longer classified as exempt from charges, but fully covered under the NHIS 3.5.4.2 The National Employment Policy The newly drafted employment policy talks broadly of equal opportunities for all people, irrespective of gender, religion, ethnic or igin or political affiliation. One policy maker pointed out that, whilst it makes no specific mention of mental health, the policy promotes equal opportunities for people with disabilities: 'The employment policy that we have, or that we've just developed, actually creates equal opportunity for everybody. I t doesn't specifically state anything about mentally unsound people. It creates equal opportunity in terms of gender, and then also in terms, you 90 know, of people with disability. There is nothing s pecifically targeting mental health as far as I know.' (Respondent 17, policy maker, Ministry of Manpower, Youth and Employment) However in practice respondents indicated that peop le with mental illness were still generally discriminated against in the workplace: 'I know some employers do not trust the ability of discharged mental patients that they are still good as they were befo re they went in there, so sometimes they don't even feel like givin g them some kind of responsibilities for fear that they might get re lapse.' (Respondent 19, Department of Social Welfare) Thus, not only is there no special provision to ass ist people living with mental illness to remain in employment for which they are capable despite their illness, but there is also active discrimination to prevent them returnin g to work. 3.5.4.3 National Disability Policy Document The National Disability Policy Document was formula ted in 2000. Whilst it includes people with mental illness in its definition of dis ability, it excludes them from its list of the categories of persons with disabilities covered by the policy. The list does however include those with 'mental impairment'. The policy makes no reference to the specific needs of those with mental health prob lems. The main policy objectives are: To promote the rights of people with disabilities (PWDs) To create an 'enabling environment' for the partic ipation of people with disabilities in the national development process, To facilitate the access of PWDs to education, tra ining and employment To ensure access of PWDs to effective healthcare a nd rehabilitation To combat stigma and social exclusion for PWDs A National Council on Disability was established wi thin the Ministry of Manpower, Youth and Employment with a membership drawn from a ll the major organisations for 91 PWDs, key ministries, and departments, and organisa tions from the public and private sectors. Its role is to work with existing government agencies, donors and NGOs to implement the policy. A Disability Act was subsequently passed in 2006 (see p.95) 3.5.4.4 Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy It was observed during the completion of the WHO ch ecklists that there is no integration of mental health policy with Ghana's po verty reduction and development policies, and that mental health strategies have no t been integrated into Ghana's strategic plans for poverty reduction and developme nt. This was echoed by one respondent who observed that mental health policy f ocuses on the medical management of mental disorder, and does not demonst rate any links to other relevant policies, in particular those which addres s the development agenda in Ghana, such as the Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS ): 'I think... the most obvious deficiency is the absenc e of ......a policy that demonstrates linkages to socio-economic aspect s of national development or national agenda.....it is just at the level of medical interventions, what happens and all that. So it nee ds to be extended to include issues of governance, to include issues of the GPRS, to include issues of education and what types of life skills education that people need to know as part of their personal development and goals....When you look at all the other policies, the y do not seem to address mental health issues. Take education policy ; take socio- economy, presently our medium term development plan , the GPRS, the Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy. I think the G PRS I was even more explicit on the vulnerable than the GPRS II, a nd even though we could take comfort in the fact that they said 'm arginalized and vulnerable' this one even seems to be more silent.... So the policy environment in Ghana does not much critically addre ss mental health issues or consciousness.' (Respondent 57, director, mental health NGO) 92 The 2006 GPRS progress report states that 'The obje ctives of health sector policy continue to focus on bridging the equity gaps in ac cess to quality healthcare and nutrition services; ensuring sustainable financial arrangements that protect the poor; and strengthening efficiency in health service deli very.' (Government of Ghana 2007b). Whilst this is equally relevant to mental h ealth policy and service provision, there is no mention of mental health within the rep ort. The GPRS notes the poor doctor to patient ratio, and the differential servi ce provision between the north of Ghana and the south. It also notes the barriers to access to health services, particularly for the 'poor and vulnerable': 'Access to health services is however still limited. This could be attributed to a number of fa ctors including socio-cultural, geographical, financial barriers and service delive ry constraints. These barriers have resulted in poor utilization of health facilities i n both urban and rural areas, particularly among the poor and vulnerable groups o f the population' (ibid:102). This inequity is directly echoed in mental health servic e provision. The GPRS also addresses the empowerment of women an d issues of employment. It states that 'Employment generation and social prote ction of the vulnerable and the excluded is central to the GPRS II.' (ibid.73). How ever there are no specific strategies to enhance employment opportunities for the mentally ill. As suggested by the respondent above, arguably those with serious a nd chronic mental health problems can be included among those who are consid ered 'vulnerable and excluded.' There is therefore a need for recognitio n that those who live with serious mental illness need to be specially targeted for he lp under the GPRS since they are included within this definition. 3.5.5 Content of Mental Health Legislation 3.5.5.1 The Mental Health Decree (1972) At the time of this report, the existing legislatio n for mental health was the Mental Health Decree of 1972. This replaced the Asylum Ord inance of 1888 which was enacted by the colonial government. The 1972 decree has the following provisions: 1. Procedures for involuntary admission, including rights to appeal 2. Accreditation of professionals and facilities 3. Enforcement of judicial issues for people with m ental illness 4. Mechanisms to implement the provisions of mental health legislation 93 It was recognised by participants that current legi slation is inadequate as it does not promote community mental health care, nor the prote ction of the human rights of those with mental disorder. The committee convened to review the 1972 legislati on utilising the WHO Checklist on Mental Health Legislation identified several are as which were not adequately addressed in the Mental Health Decree: 1. Provisions for non-discrimination against people with mental disorders 2. The promotion and protection of the rights of pe ople with mental disorders, including the right to humane treatment 3. Provision for financing of mental health care 4. Equitable provision of mental health care 5. The promotion of mental health within primary ca re 6. The promotion of access to psychotropic drugs 7. The promotion of community-based care 8. Protecting patients' privacy and rights to conf identiality 9. Provision for educational activities, vocational training, leisure activities and religious and cultural needs for people with mental disorders 10. The involvement of users of mental health servi ces, families and carers in mental health policy and legislation development an d planning 11. The rights of the family and carers of people w ith mental disorders 12. Competency, capacity, and guardianship issues f or people with mental illness 13. Informed consent to treatment for people with m ental disorders 14. The protection of the rights of those patients under involuntary admission, including inadequate definitions regarding the seve rity of mental disorders requiring involuntary admission, timeframes for the duration of involuntary admission, systematic review and the right to appea l 15. The involuntary treatment of people with mental disorders, including proxy consent 16. Issues of seclusion and restraint 17. The protection of vulnerable groups, including minors and women The details of this review are set out in the compl eted WHO Checklist on Mental Health Legislation (see Appendix 5). 94 3.5.5.2 The draft Mental Health bill 2006 The new Mental Health bill was drafted in 2006 with support from WHO. It is currently in the office of the Minister of Health, pending su bmission to parliament to be enacted into law. The 2006 Mental Health bill adopts a huma n rights based approach to mental disorder in accordance with the UN Charter o n Human Rights and international consensus on the health care needs of a person with mental disorder. The bill aims to prevent discrimination and provide equal opportunities for people with mental disorder In its preamble the bill acknowledges that \"Progres sive legislation which acknowledges the modern trend on human rights can b e an effective tool to promote access to mental health care as well as to promote and protect the rights of people with mental disorder.\" The bill has nine groups of clauses which cover the following: The establishment of a Mental Health Authority to provide mental health care at the Primary Care level The provision of mental health services at the reg ional, district and community level for the treatment, prevention, reha bilitation and counselling of persons with mental disorder, includ ing the services of community psychiatric nurses (CPNs). Voluntary treatment, including the reporting of lo ng stay voluntary patients to the Mental Health Review Tribunal Involuntary admission and treatment including maxi mum periods for involuntary admission Strengthening of the role of the Mental Health Rev iew Tribunal. The protection of the rights of persons with a men tal disorder, including equality and non-discrimination, the right to priva cy and individual autonomy, and freedom from inhumane and degrading t reatment. Other considerations included are the principle of the le ast restrictive environment and the right to information and partic ipation. The protection of vulnerable groups, including wom en, children and the aged, guardianship, the rehabilitation of persons w ith mental disorder, the role of the police, and the treatment of offenders with mental disorder The establishment of regional visiting committees to inspect mental health facilities and investigate complaints 95 Miscellaneous provisions including accounts and au dit and the reporting of sudden death, and definitions of terms used in t he bill The Bill has been highly endorsed by WHO as reflect ing best practice in mental health legislation (WHO 2007), and its enactment an d implementation is seen by actors in the field as vital for the improvement of mental health services in Ghana. Crucial to the success of the law as a framework fo r the practice of mental health care provision is the collection of accurate and re gular data which will inform relevant institutions about the use of services and the prot ection of the rights of users. This therefore makes a case for the strengthening of the mental health information system. Several respondents expressed a strong desire for t he draft mental health Bill to be passed into law so as to improve mental health care . There was optimism that the new legislation would promote de-centralisation and community mental health care, regulate traditional and faith-based healing practi ces, and promote and protect the rights of the mentally ill. However some respondent s were sceptical as to whether there was sufficient political will and financial c ommitment to implement the bill once it becomes law. There is therefore a need to develo p policies and plans, including the provision of funding, which will ensure that the Me ntal Health Act is effectively implemented. 3.5.5.3 Links with other relevant legislation There are several existing laws which protect the r ights of citizens of Ghana. Two important relevant pieces of legislation, the Disab ility Act (Government of Ghana 2006a) and the Domestic Violence Act (Government of Ghana 2007a) have been passed within the last year. Although it was not me ntioned by respondents, recent legislation on social exclusion also has direct rel evance to mental health. Constitution of the Republic of Ghana (1992) Several respondents referred to the Constitution of Ghana as defining the rights of all Ghanaian citizens, including those with mental illn ess. Clause 12(2) states that 'Every person in Ghana, whatever his race, place of origin, political opinion, colour, 96 religion, creed or gender shall be entitled to the fundamental human rights and freedoms of the individual.' (Government of Ghana 1 992). The new mental health bill highlights the existing rights of people with menta l disorder under the provisions of the Ghana Constitution. The bill states that: 'A person with mental disorder is entitled to the f undamental human rights and freedoms as provided for in the Constitu tion' (Government of Ghana 2006b) Clause 29 of the constitution also has specific pro visions for the protection of the rights of those with disabilities, although it make s no specific reference to disability arising from mental disorder. These include the rig hts of those with disabilities to live with their families and to participate in social, c reative or recreational activities, standards for establishments for the care of the di sabled, protection against 'exploitation, all regulations and all treatment of a discriminatory, abusive or degrading nature' (Clause 29(4)), and the requireme nt for judicial proceedings to consider the 'physical and mental condition' of the disabled person. The constitution promotes employment opportunities for those with disabilities. Clause 29 (7) states that 'Special incentives shall be given to disabled persons engaged in business and also to business organizati ons that employ disabled persons in significant numbers.' It commits parliam ent to legislation to ensure the enforcement of such provisions (Clause 29(5)). The constitution also has several provisions releva nt in the context of reported human rights abuses in the traditional and faith he aling facilities. The constitution enshrines the dignity of the person and outlaws tor ture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, as well as 'any other conditio n that detracts or is likely to detract from [the individual's] dignity and worth as a huma n being.' The constitution also prohibits inhumane and harmful customary practices. Clause 26(2) states that: 'All customary practices which dehumanise or are in jurious to the physical and mental well-being of a person are proh ibited' However some respondents pointed out that the const itution was itself discriminatory as it stipulates that only people of 'sound mind' a re permitted to vote: 97 'If you are mentally unsound, you may not enjoy you r full right like somebody who is okay, mentally okay, and this has a lso been up held by the constitution. When you go to our consti tution, I think article fourteen, it says that people of unsound mi nd, their rights maybe..... curtailed, their liberties.... maybe curtail ed.... because of that condition for your own welfare or welfare of t he society. So you will not have your freedom like other people.' (Respondent 84.5, teacher, focus group discussion, district level) Disability Act (2006) The Disability Act was passed in 2006 and draws on a rights-based framework for people with disability to ensure equal access to em ployment and other opportunities, and prevent discrimination on the grounds of disabi lity. Although people with mental illness are included within the definition of those living with a disability, mental illness is not readily recognised by many policy makers and implementers as a cause of disability. Ensuring that people with mental illnes s are recognised as disabled would enhance their ability to claim rights and benefits under this Act, such as disability payments, thus recognising the additional costs ari sing from the disabling effects of mental illness, such as loss of employment and loss of income of carers. One respondent explicitly highlighted the rights of the mentally ill under the Disability Act: 'Well presently, you have heard of the disability l aw. The disabled are saying that they are capable, they can also be DCEs, [District Chief Executives] , they can be doctors, ministers, provided they are given the opportunity and the push forward. I agree with you that it isn't all of them that will be able to attain the h ighest level, but the minimum standard that can make them feel accepted b y the community, the minimum help that can help them also to live on their own and not always to be dependant to be begg ing and going round or stealing, those rights must be enforced.' (Respondent 60, manager, GES, district level) However, despite the potential benefits for those w ith mental illness from the passing of the Disability Act, it is acknowledged that so f ar the implementation of the Act has been limited. 98 Domestic Violence Act (2007) The Domestic Violence Act which was passed in 2007, provides a much needed legal resource for victims of domestic violence in Ghana. Domestic violence including sexual abuse has been linked to depression, anxiety , PTSD, behavioural problems including self-harm, drug abuse and other mental he alth problems, particularly among women and girls (Fishbach & Herbert 1997). One respondent explicitly linked domestic violence with mental health problems among women in Ghana: '..... these men, the way they are beating us and har assing us, the woman is there, who is she going to share it? And t hese women go through this barbaric ways, they cannot say it, bec ause if they are going to say it, they are going to say to their fel low man, and that man is doing the same thing. If there is a problem and we are going to settle, is the men who are going to settle it, a nd they always say women are wrong. So they keep it to themselves. Bef ore you realize they have developed hypertension, they get stroke. So if someone can get hypertension, some of them deliver, and bec ause of the problem they have... they get postpartum blues. So th ere is a lot of stress, some of the men, even the moment the woman gets pregnant, that is all no support and they are fendi ng for themselves, always worried, the pressure of life, the marriages , the children, the men don't care, they leave everything for the women to do.' (Respondent 62, senior public health nurse, distric t level) Perpetrators of domestic violence can now be prosec uted and the passing of the legislation has led to a more open debate regarding the extent of domestic violence in Ghana. However a respondent pointed out that des pite advising women to report to the Women and Juvenile Unit (WAJU) of the Ghana Police Service, some were reluctant to do so because they were afraid the hus band would divorce them. WAJU has now been replaced with the Domestic Violence an d Victim Support Unit which provides counselling for victims of domestic violen ce. They refer those whom they believe may have a mental illness to the psychiatri c hospitals. 99 3.5.5.4 Areas of action for legislation development Several steps are necessary in order to develop leg islation to promote and protect the needs and rights of those with mental illness l iving in Ghana. The first task is to provide a clear definition of who constitutes a per son living with mental illness and how that person is covered under the Constitution a nd the various Acts listed above. This clarification, particularly for policy makers and the legislature, would enable the needs of people living with mental illness to be co nsidered under Acts of disability, domestic violence, the constitution, etc. The second task is a legal one, requiring careful l inks to be drawn between the existing laws as they apply to this unique group of people living with mental illness. A third task is the reworking of these important pi eces of legislation so that they spell out how they are to be funded. This would compel su ccessive governments to allocate sufficient resources to the vulnerable, in cluding people living with mental disorder, who are covered by the legislation. 3.5 6. Summary The Mental Health Bill has yet to be sent to Parlia ment. When enacted into law its advocates think it would transform the practice of mental health care in Ghana. In the last decade there have been some important and enco uraging steps taken in Ghana to protect the rights of vulnerable groups. A domes tic violence bill and a disability bill have been passed into laws. In addition, the consti tution guarantees the rights of people to be free from inhumane treatment. The Nati onal Health Insurance Act has the potential to provide free health care if patien ts are registered. However, more needs to be done in the field of employment policy to provide decent and protected working environments for people living with mental illness. There is also very little explicit reference to mental health in all the rela ted Acts mentioned above. Mental health is not explicitly addressed in policy on pov erty alleviation, although strategies to address poverty, such as the GPRS, aim to reach the most vulnerable members of society. It is therefore vital that there is a comm itment to enact the Mental Health Bill into an Act, and to give legal backing to the fundi ng of mental health services. 100 3.6 Mental Health Policy Implementation at the Nati onal (Macro) and Regional (Meso) Level 3.6.1 National and regional structures 3.6.1.1 The Ministry of Health and Ghana Health Ser vice The Ministry of Health has the following directorat es: 1. Finance 2. Administration 3. Policy Planning Monitoring and Evaluation (PPME) 4. Research, Statistics and Information Management System 5. Human Resource Development 6. Procurement and Supply 7. Traditional and Alternate Medicine Ghana Health Service as an agency of the Ministry o f Health works through nine divisions. These are: 1. Finance 2. Health Administration and Support Services 3. Human Resources 4. Institutional Care 5. Internal Audit 6. Office of the Director General 7. Policy Planning Monitoring and Evaluation (PPME) 8. Public Health 9. Supply, Stores and Management The Ministry of Health is responsible for the formu lation of policy, and GHS for implementing policy at the regional and district le vels. This clear division of responsibilities was described by this respondent: 101 'If you look at our set up, we have the Ministry of Health which is the policy formulators, they formulate the policies, an d then the Ghana Health Service, we are implementers, and of course if you take these two people then the civil society is also a s takeholder..' (Respondent 45, psychiatric specialist) 3.6.1.2 The Mental Health Unit Operationally the Mental Health Unit comes under th e Institutional Care Division. The Unit oversees the three psychiatric hospitals, the psychiatric wings of the regional hospitals, community psychiatric services and priva te psychiatric facilities, as well as regulating the practices of traditional and faith h ealers. The Mental Health Unit acts as the national mental health authority and advises the government on mental health policies and legislatio n. The unit is also involved in monitoring and quality assessment of mental health services. There is a list of essential medicines which includ es the following psychotropic 5. drugs - Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, Carbamazepine (Ghana Health Service 2004a) Although it was not included in the essential medic ines list, Olanzapine has also been available since 2004. 3.6.2 Financing of Mental Health Services It was not easy to obtain precise figures for menta l health expenditure in Ghana. 6.2 % of the health care budget of the Ministry of Heal th is dedicated to mental health. It also became clear through interviews with mental he alth professionals and Ministry 102 of Finance officials that some moneys are routinely sent to the micro level directly from the Ministry of Finance as part of the de-centralisation process, without the knowledge of some macro (national) and meso (region al) level authorities. This made it difficult to accurately compute the exact budget allocated to mental health in Ghana. The majority of the budget for mental health (nearl y 80%) is allocated for the maintenance of the three psychiatric hospitals. Des pite this, funding for the psychiatric hospitals was described by participants as 'woefully inadequate'. Participants reported that funds are quickly absorb ed in meeting the basic needs of the patients, and recalled that the psychiatric hos pitals had recently run out of sufficient funds to feed the patients. Furthermore participants reported there are few re sources remaining to fund psychosocial and rehabilitative interventions in th e hospitals such as occupational therapy. 103 At the regional and district levels there is no all ocated budget for mental health. Since the psychiatric hospitals are funded directly from the Mental Health Unit at the national level, the psychiatric hospitals are virtu ally autonomous from regional health administration. This means the psychiatric hospital s are not integrated into regional health structures. With the advent of psychiatric w ings in the regional hospitals, there is a need for closer collaboration between regional and district levels in the administration of mental health care. As revealed b y this respondent at one of the psychiatric hospitals, some level of integration be tween psychiatric and primary health care services is occurring, however this nee ds to be strengthened: '....our allocation comes direct from the Ministry of Health so it's like the regional level, they don't have control over us , so they stay away from us. But this time we should work together. We should participate in their activities that are important. Now that they are forming mental health units in all the regional hos pitals, there are CPNs at the regional level. So this management aspe ct of it has been reviewed. We are collaborating with the region al and the district directors and then participating in their activities.' (Respondent 12, psychiatric hospital) As mentioned above, psychiatric treatment, includin g psychotropic medication, is free in Ghana. However several respondents indicated tha t the supply of psychotropic drugs to inpatient and community facilities is ofte n insufficient, leading to shortages of essential medication: 'We get some shortages. We have only 22 drugs, 22 approved essential drugs. In most cases, we don't have even at least three- quarters of the drugs available in most cases. Last year for example, the government had to purchase about 12 billion [old Ghana Cedis] worth of drugs for us, they were able to purchase o nly 4.3 billion, the rest never came. So we kept on writing \"nil\" or sub stituting, making substitution of drugs. That is the problem, that we have... we never get self-sufficient in drugs supply.' (Respondent 7, pharmacist, psychiatric hospital) When medication is unavailable at the hospital phar macies and clinics, patients must purchase the necessary medication at their own expe nse: 104 '....the drug flow is low; with the rate at which we get the drugs is still the problem. Sometimes, it comes and the peop le keep on increasing, I think they have limited their rate of supply, so now the people are more than the drug that is usually reque sted for time code, so that is where we have the problem. And the drugs outside is quite expensive, so when it is like that the pat ients find it difficult to go outside to buy, some don't even have the mone y to go and buy' (Respondent 44, psychiatric nurse, regional level) '.....even drugs for our clients you don't get...So wha t happens? There is stigma attached to the condition already, and the poor patient suffers because you go to hospital, the dru g is not there. So it will be prescribed and if you can't afford to bu y it, what do you do? And our drugs too are expensive.' (Respondent 40, CPN) Therefore although psychotropic medication should b e free in principle, in reality patients often have to buy medication on the open m arket at prices they often cannot afford. The cost of the average maintenance dose per day of the cheapest anti-psychotic, 300mg Chlorpromazine is about 0.75 Ghana cedi. This represents 58% of the minimum daily wage of 1.3 Ghana cedi for the index year 2005. The cost of the average maintenance dose per day of the cheapest an ti-depressant, 75mg Amitriptyline, is about 0.3 Ghana cedi, which repre sents about 23% of the daily minimum wage. 3.6.3 Human rights protection There is no national body to oversee regular inspec tions in mental health facilities, to review involuntary admission and discharge procedur es, to review complaints investigation processes and to impose sanctions (e. g. withdraw accreditation, impose penalties, or close facilities that persistently vi olate human rights). 105 As a result, none of the mental hospitals nor the community-based inpatient psychiatric units and community residential facilit ies had any review or inspection of the human rights protection of patients in 2005. However in the following two years of 2006 and 2007 , there were inspections of the psychiatric hospitals by the Commission for Human R ights and Administrative Justice, and in 2008 the Parliamentary Sub-Committe e on Health also inspected two of the three state psychiatric hospitals. The psychiatric hospitals maintain data on the numb er of involuntary admissions. However there are no records on patients who are re strained or secluded. There was no training in the protection of the huma n rights of patients in the inpatient psychiatric units and community residential facilit ies in the year under review. 3.6.4 Mental health services In the following section information is drawn from WHO-AIMS with some additional data from the qualitative interviews and focus grou ps. For definitions of terms used, please see the glossary of terms from the WHO-AIMS in Appendix 1. Some of the data was not available, in which case, best estimat es were made where feasible. The completion of the WHO-AIMS revealed some of the wea knesses of the health information system employed within health services in Ghana which are highlighted through some of the inconsistencies and omissions i n the data. 3.6.4.1 Psychiatric outpatient facilities There are 68 outpatient mental health facilities av ailable in the country. This includes 56 clinics run by the CPNs, the outpatient departme nts of the 5 regional hospitals which have psychiatric units, and the outpatient de partments of the 3 psychiatric hospitals. In addition there are 4 outpatient depar tments in the private psychiatric hospitals. Outpatient attendance Data for attendance at outpatient facilities was on ly collected from the three state psychiatric hospitals and therefore represents a co nsiderably lower figure than total 106 outpatient attendance at psychiatric facilities. Th ere are some difficulties in collating statistics for outpatient attendance at the psychia tric hospitals due to differences in recording. Table 1: Outpatient attendance at psychiatric hospi tals 2005 Male Female Total Accra new cases who attended the outpatient department (OPD) at the Accra psychiatric hospital in 2005 was 4,154, of wh ich 2,139 were male and 2,015 were female. However in addition 40,057 old cases a ttended Accra psychiatric OPD, of which 18,323 were male and 21,677 were female. 1 2,885 psychological cases attended Pantang hospital as outpatients in 2005 fo r psychiatric treatment, of which 5,963 (44%) were female. At Ankaful Psychiatric Hos pital 28,907 psychological cases attended in 2005. There are no statistics on gender. There is some overlap in these statistics since som e patients attend more than one psychiatric hospital. Also despite distinguishing b etween old and new cases, it is possible that patients who make multiple attendance s may be recorded more than once. The average number of contacts per user is no t recorded. Diagnosis Data on diagnoses at outpatient departments was onl y available from two of the three government psychiatric hospitals. Diagnoses a re not recorded under ICD-10 categories, and diagnostic categories vary between the three hospitals. Therefore there is some potential for discrepancy and overlap . For example, 'cannabis psychosis' could also be recorded under 'psychotic disorders'. Among the 'other disorders' recorded at the hospitals, epilepsy represents by far the greatest single proportion and has therefore been separated from ' others'. Other disorders recorded in the 'others' category included febrile convulsio n and tension headache. 107 Table 2: Outpatient diagnoses at psychiatric hospit als 2005 Diagnosis Accra Pantang Ankaful Total % Mental and behavioural disorders due to psychoactive substance use (F10-F19) 1110 (substance/ alcohol abuse) 270 (anxiety disorder) 138 (somatization disorders) Disorders of adult personality and behaviour (F60-F69) 0 0 Epilepsy and adolescents At Accra psychiatric hospital 804 new cases were un der 19 years. 461 of these were male, and 343 were female. The number of children a nd adolescents under 17 years seen at Pantang in 2005 was 622. At Ankaful 1152 pa tients 19 years and younger were seen in outpatients. 599 were male, 553 were f emale. There are no dedicated outpatient facilities for child and adolescent ment al health. Table 3: Numbers of children and adolescents attend ing OPD at psychiatric hospitals 2005 Male Female Total Accra - New (under 19) 461 343 804 Pantang (under 17) N/A N/A 553 1152 TOTAL N/A N/A 2578 108 Table 3 reveals some of the weaknesses of the infor mation systems within psychiatric services as stated at the introduction to this section. The three psychiatric hospitals have no uniform age to distinguish betwee n children and adults, just as they do not employ standardised illness categories in their records. No records are collated on referrals from outpatien ts departments to community services. It is estimated that about 80% of outpati ent facilities provide follow-up care in the community through referral to CPNs. No outpa tient facility has a mental health mobile team. 3.6.4.2 Psychiatric day treatment facilities There are two known day treatment facilities in Gha na run by NGOs or church organisations. The Damien Centre at Takoradi in the southwest of the country is run by the Catholic Church. Two drop-in facilities for vagrants are provided in Tamale in the Northern region based on the club house model: Tsi-sampa run by the NGO Basic Needs, and Shekina, run by a private practiti oner. There are no day treatment facilities within GHS. 3.6.4.3 Community-based psychiatric inpatient units (Psychiatric inpatient units in regional hospitals) There are 5 community-based psychiatric in-patient units available in the country providing a total of 77 beds, that is 0.33 beds per 100,000. These are provided within 5 of the 10 regional hospitals. The breakdown of beds available in the psychiatric wings in the regional capitals is as follows: 109 Table 4: Number of psychiatric beds in regional hos pitals Town Region Number of beds Ho Volta 10 Kumasi Ashanti 15 Wa Upper West 10 Koforidua Eastern 20 Sunyani Brong-Ahafo 22 TOTAL 77 None of the beds in community-based inpatient units are reserved for children and adolescents only. No data was collected from the regional psychiatric units. The diagnoses of admissions to community-based psychiatric inpatient facilities, the average number of days that patients spend on admission, the numbe r of involuntary admissions, and the proportion of children and females admitted is therefore unknown. 3.6.4.4 Community residential facilities Cheshire Home in Kumasi provides rehabilitation for people with mental disorders. There are no other known community residential faci lities as defined by WHO-AIMS (but see Section 3.6.4.6 ). 3.6.4.5 Mental hospitals There are three government-owned psychiatric hospit als available in the country, providing 7.04 beds per 100,000 of the population. Accra Psychiatric Hospital located in Accra has 800 beds, Pantang Hospital jus t outside the capital has 500 beds, and Ankaful Psychiatric Hospital close to Cap e Coast in the Central region has 250 beds. The hospitals are organizationally integr ated with mental health outpatient facilities. The psychiatric hospitals are overcrowd ed and there are insufficient beds for the numbers of patients, with many sleeping on mats on the floor. Accra Psychiatric Hospital, for example, has 800 beds, bu t accommodates approximately 1,100 patients at any point in time. 110 There are 45 dedicated beds for children and adoles cents in the psychiatric hospitals, representing 4% of the total number of h ospital beds. In addition to the government hospitals, there are 4 private psychiatric institutions which provide outpatient clinics and inpatient care . Valley View hospital in Accra has approximately 30 beds. Pankronu and Adom clinics in Kumasi, the second city in Ghana, have 16-20 beds each. Alberto Clinic in Tem a, close to Accra Has an unknown number of beds. Admissions A total of 6,454 inpatients were admitted to the 3 state psychiatric hospitals in 2005. Approximately 50% of these were female. Table 5: Inpatient admissions to psychiatric hospit als 2005 Pantang 1,114 Ankaful 1,743 TOTAL 6,454 Diagnosis Diagnoses were collected only for admissions to the three government psychiatric hospitals. Again these represent some difficulties as there are variations in recording between the three hospitals and diagnoses are not r ecorded according to ICD-10 categories. 111 Table 6: Inpatient diagnoses at psychiatric hospit als 2005 Diagnosis Accra Pantang Ankaful Total % Mental and behavioural disorders due psychoactive substance use (F10-F19) 808 Neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders (F40-F48) 0 0 0 None recorded Disorders of adult personality and behaviour (F60-F69) 0 0 0 None recorded Others* 1232 86 57 1375 20.8% Total 6605 100% *includes epilepsy, dementia, other organic disorde rs, and unspecified The most frequently recorded diagnoses at the state psychiatric hospitals are psychotic disorders (37.4%), followed by substance abuse disorders (22.8%) and mood disorders (19.0%). Among the substance abuse d isorders the majority were recorded as due to cannabis use. The rest were alco hol-induced disorders. There are no recorded diagnoses of personality disorders nor neurotic, somatoform or stress- related disorders among inpatients. At Accra psychi atric hospital 639 cases (18% of inpatients) were recorded as 'other'. This contrast s with 25 cases at Pantang hospital (2.2% of inpatients). The reasons for this remain unexplored but may be due to the limited amount of time available for consult ation, incomplete record-keeping, deficiencies in clinical expertise with regards to the less common forms of mental illness, or for a few cases the limitations of diag nostic categories to reflect the presentation of some Ghanaian patients. 112 GRAPH 3: INPATIENTS TREATED IN MENTAL HOSPITALS BY DI DIS. 0% SCHIZOPHRENIA 37% SUBSTANCE ABUSE 23% MENTAL HOSPITALS There were 65 involuntary admissions to Pantang in 2005. There are no available figures for the other psychiatric hospitals. There were 205 long-stay patients at Pantang in 200 5. There are no figures for the other psychiatric hospitals. The average length of stay at Ankaful psychiatric hospital in 2005 varied depending on the ward ranging from 4 6.3 days to 364.1 days. The total average was 82.2 days. The average length of stay in Pantang hospital in 2005 was 285 days. There are no figures from Accra psych iatric hospital on length of stay. However it is known that all the state psychiatric hospitals have long-stay patients who are considered to be recovered, but who continu e to remain in hospital. In Accra Psychiatric Hospital in 2007, 520 patients were sai d to be ready for discharge. One of the reasons for this is due to the stigma attached to mental disorders, which can result in relatives or caregivers abandoning the pe rson at the psychiatric hospitals. In addition, so long as the individual is in the care of the hospital they receive free board and lodging, as well as treatment. This can prove a n attractive benefit for both the patient and the family, particularly those with lim ited financial means, as argued by this respondent: 113 'So in psychiatry now it is patients just coming i n, and then going out, and then coming back again. It's an expected t hing that happens. There are some of the patients even they h ave gone in, out, in, out, so much that they prefer to stay perm anently in the hospital. We've got patients who have been in the h ospital for over 20 years, occupying a single bed.' (Respondent 7, pharmacist, psychiatric hospital) In addition without the provision of secure hospita ls, some offenders who have been ordered by the courts to attend for psychiatric ass essment can remain in the psychiatric hospitals for many years. 3.6.4.6 Forensic and other residential facilities In Accra psychiatric hospital there is a dedicated forensic ward with 15 beds. However this is not used solely by forensic patient s. In Pantang hospital in 2005 there were 88 forensic patients. There are no figur es for forensic patients in Accra and Ankaful hospitals. There are 15 beds in an inpatient rehabilitation fa cility near Elmina which forms part of Ankaful Psychiatric hospital. There are 6 known community residential facilities run by voluntary and church organisations which provide drug rehabilitation. These are Remar, a faith-based organisation with facilities i n Accra, Aflao, Nsawam, Kumasi and Tema, and the Mercy Centre at Brafo-Yaw near Ca pe Coast. There are 10 residential facilities for children un der 17 with mental retardation, one in each of the regions. In addition, Operation Hand-in -Hand, an NGO provides residential care and rehabilitation in Nkoranza in the Brong Ahafo region for mentally retarded children There is also a private school, N ew Horizon, for children with learning disabilities in Accra. There are 2 private residential facilities for people with substance abuse. Valley View hospital in Accra has one detoxification unit. There are no residential facilities for people with dementia. However there are dedicated beds for male and female geriatric patien ts at the Accra Psychiatric Hospital. 114 3.6.4.7 Availability of psychosocial treatment It is estimated that between 1-20% of patients rece ived some form of psychosocial intervention within mental hospitals, community-bas ed psychiatric inpatient units, and outpatient mental health facilities in 2005. This is largely in the form of occupational therapy, psychotherapy, counselling and social wor k. 3.6.4.8 Availability of psychotropic medication All mental hospitals, community-based psychiatric i npatient units, and outpatient mental health facilities units had at least one psy chotropic medicine of each therapeutic class (anti-psychotic, antidepressant, mood stabilizer, anxiolytic, and antiepileptic medicines) available in the facility in the index year. However the range of psychotropic drugs available w ithin GHS is limited. The new generation of anti-psychotics or anti-depressants, as well as mood stabilising drugs such as Lithium and Sodium Valproate, are not widel y available, despite the inclusion of Sodium Valproate and Risperidone in the Essentia l Medicines List, and there is limited availability of depot anti-psychotic medica tion within GHS, especially outside the psychiatric hospitals. Whilst most drugs can be obtained privately, they are beyond the means of the great majority of those req uiring treatment. The side effects of the older anti-psychotics can also be an impedim ent to adherence on the part of patients. 3.6.4.8 Human rights and equity The numbers of patients who were admitted involunta rily to Pantang Hospital in 2005 is 65. The numbers of patients who were physically restrained and/or secluded in the government psychiatric hospitals in 2005 is unknown as no records are kept. The ratio of psychiatric beds in the mental hospita ls in or around Accra, the capital, to the total number of beds in the rest of the country is 6.28. Such a distribution of beds impedes access for rural users. 115 There are no specific strategies in place in health facilities to ensure that linguistic minorities in Ghana can access mental health care i n a language in which they are fluent. For example there are no official interpret ing services. Family members or staff who speak the patients' language will normall y act as interpreters. Patients who have received little education and do not speak Eng lish may be at some disadvantage since ward rounds and the provision of information, such as notices and signage in the psychiatric facilities, are all in English. The development of community radio stations which broadcast in local l anguages has provided a forum for the provision of health information in the vern acular and have been used, for example, in advertising the new health insurance sc heme. TV stations also broadcast in Akan languages, however many poorer households d o not have access to television nor electricity. 3.6.5 Mental health in primary health care Doctors working in the district hospitals provide p rimary mental health care through the outpatient departments of the hospitals. Most g overnment clinics in the sub- districts do not employ doctors, but are staffed by medical assistants or nurses, or by staff with lower levels of training such as communi ty health nurses or community midwives. Medical assistants provide assessment, di agnosis and treatment, including prescribing and administering medication, and effec tively work in a physician role. There are no specialist doctors in mental health in primary health care clinics in Ghana. In spite of the unavailability of physicians in pri mary health care clinics, there are assessment and treatment protocols in most of these clinics for health conditions. These are available in the standard treatment guide lines provided by the GHS, which include guidance on the treatment of the major psyc hiatric conditions including schizophrenia and depression (GHS 2004). The following information is approximate as detaile d data on mental health is not routinely collected in many primary health care fac ilities. However in 2005 data on psychiatric morbidity as recorded within outpatient consultations at district health facilities was collated at the regional level, This is based on four psychiatric categories: epilepsy, acute psychosis, neurosis and substance abuse (see Table 7). 116 However this is likely to be a significant underest imate of true incidence since many districts lack psychiatric professionals, and do no t collate data on psychiatric disorders. Differences between regions are therefor e more likely to be due to differences in recording of cases, than to true dif ferences in morbidity. Since 2007 this data has been disaggregated according to age-r ange and gender. However the same limited number of disease categories are retai ned and are problematic for recording cases since they do not reflect internati onally standardised diagnoses and omit a category for non-acute psychotic disorders a nd affective disorders. 117 Table 7: Outpatient psychiatric morbidity 2005 per region Disease WR CR GAR VR ER ASH BAR NR UER UWR Total Epilepsy 868 200 929 911 581 1,239 737 733 1,005 458 7,661 Acute Psychosis 194 1,612 755 1,044 1,065 221 645 184 7,450 524 304 431 4,101 660 108 332 103 7,127 Substance Abuse 443 139 739 269 482 1,452 261 84 333 by district l evel facilities). Key to regions: East, UWR= Upper West 118 It is estimated that between 80-100% of primary hea lth care doctors make on average at least one referral per month to a mental health professional. Between 21- 50% of primary health care clinics are estimated to refer patients presenting with mental health disorders to a higher level of care, such as the psychiatric units of the regional hospitals, or the psychiatric hospitals in Accra or Cape Coast. In terms of professional interaction between primar y health care staff and other care providers, it is estimated that between 1-20% of pr imary care doctors have interacted with a mental health professional at least once in the last year. This is mainly in the form of outreach services conducted by mental healt h professionals. However it was reported that communication and collaboration betwe en health care workers and psychiatric services is poor and that the physical health needs of the mentally ill are often neglected: '...these days the mortality for mental patients is ris ing because of the underlying physical factor, and the general hos pital, the moment they identify the psychological problems, they say : \"Oh take the patient to the mental hospital\", meanwhile they hav e failed to treat the underlying physical condition. When the person comes here, before we realize, because of inadequate staff, the re is very low observation, and before we realize, the person is o ff, and that is a very big problem. And now we are experiencing high trend of mortality in the mental hospitals, so there is a ne ed to collaborate so that others will know how to treat mental patient.' (Respondent 47, senior staff member, psychiatric ho spital) Between 1-20% of workers in the district hospitals and primary health care clinics are estimated to have had contact with a traditional or complementary practitioner, however no records of such contacts are maintained. 3.6.5.1 Training in mental health care for primary care staff Seven percent of the training for medical doctors is devoted to mental health. General nurses undertake six weeks affiliation at t he psychiatric hospitals as part of their training. Post-basic medical assistants recei ve only one week's training in mental health. 119 Some training of primary health care workers in men tal health has been facilitated by Basic Needs and an outreach team from Ankaful Psych iatric Hospital. In terms of refresher training, there was no data a vailable on how many primary health care doctors and non-doctor/non-nurse primar y health care workers had received at least two days of refresher training in mental health in the index year. However responses from the qualitative data indicat ed that in-service training in psychiatry is limited. Many of the primary health c are workers contacted stated that they have had no training in psychiatry since they completed their initial clinical training: '...with regards to mental health I can confidently s ay that, since I completed SRN, the basic courses, I have never.... I mean, a mental health workshop has never been organised for us. So every time you have to read whatever you come across and use that knowledge to share with other people. That is the n eglected aspect.' (Respondent 62, senior nursing officer, district le vel) 3.6.5.2 Prescription in primary health care Primary health care workers in charge of non-doctor /non-nurse facilities are allowed to prescribe psychotropic medications with some res trictions. Beyond this, they are required to refer to a higher level. It is estimated that 80% of the district hospitals have at least one form of psychotropic medicine of each therapeutic category (anti-psychot ic, antidepressant, mood stabilizer, anxiolytic, and antiepileptic), in comp arison to 20% of primary health care clinics. 3.6.6 Human resources in mental health care 3.6.6.1 Number of human resources in mental health care The breakdown of human resources working in mental health facilities in 2005 per 100,000 population is as follows: 0.068 psychiatris ts, 0.045 other medical doctors (not specialized in psychiatry), 2.58 nurses, 0.004 psychologists, 0.027 social 120 workers, and an unknown number of other health or mental health workers including auxiliary staff, health assistants, paramedics and medical assistants. There are 15 psychiatrists for a population of 22 million. GRAPH 4: HUMAN RESOURCES IN MENTAL HEALTH 2005 15 10 468 132 16110 050 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 PSYCHIATRISTS OTHER DOCTORS* NURSES CPNs PSYCHOLOGISTS SOCIAL WORKERS OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS MEDICAL ASSISTANTS * Doctors have one year's training in psychiatry NB: Psychiatrist, doctors, psychologists, social wo rkers and medical assistants also work within outpatient clinics within psychiatric h ospitals. CPNs work only with outpatients. The number of psychiatrists and docto rs includes those working within regional psychiatric units (community-based psychia tric inpatient units) The distribution of human resources between urban a nd rural areas is heavily weighted towards urban areas of the south. 10 out o f the 15 psychiatrists in Ghana work in or near the capital city. The vast majority of psychiatric nurses are also employed in the psychiatric hospitals of the south. The ratio of nurses to 100,000 of the population is 6.29 times greater in Accra than in the entire country. 121 Psychiatrists In 2005 there were 15 practising psychiatrists in G hana. However 9 of these were retired and working on contract for a limited numbe r of hours, and 2 were working in private practice. Only 4 psychiatrists of working a ge were employed within GHS in 2005. In addition there were 10 doctors with a dipl oma from the West African College of Physicians: 2 of these were also retired and 3 w ere close to retirement. No psychiatrists work in outpatient facilities alon e as all combine inpatient and outpatient work. In 2005 6 psychiatrists were worki ng within the 3 public psychiatric hospitals, and 3 psychiatrists were working in comm unity-based psychiatric inpatient units. In terms of staffing in mental health facilities, t here are 0.04 psychiatrists per bed in community-based psychiatric inpatient units and 0.0 3 psychiatrists per bed in the psychiatric hospitals. However the proportion of ps ychiatrists to beds in the mental health in-patient facilities in Ghana, especially t he psychiatric hospitals, does not represent the true patient to professional ratio du e to overcrowding (see Section 3.6.4.5). Psychiatric nurses In 2005 there were approximately 436 psychiatric nu rses working in the psychiatric hospitals in Ghana and 132 CPNs based in the ten re gions covering 69 of the 138 districts. Some of these CPNs provide outreach serv ices to neighbouring districts. Some CPNs work in clinics and others are attached t o district hospitals. However many CPNs are nearing retirement and there is no pr ogramme for their replacement. Psychiatric nurses in Ghana have also been subject to high rates of attrition from the GHS with many moving to work abroad. The number of nurses working in private psychiatric facilities is not known. Psychologists In 2005 there was only 1 psychologist working withi n mental health facilities within Ghana Health Service, with a further 6 based within the medical schools at Korle Bu teaching hospital in Accra and Komfo Anokye teachin g hospital in Kumasi. One of the reasons for the low numbers of psychologists is that there is no pay structure for psychologists to be employed within Ghana Health Se rvice. There are no community- 122 based psychologists. The number of psychologists wo rking in private psychiatric facilities is not known. Social workers There is no specialist training for psychiatric soc ial workers and no dedicated social worker for mental health working in the community. In 2005 there were 2 social workers working in each of the state psychiatric ho spitals. Occupational therapists There is only one occupational therapist employed a t Pantang hospital who is now retired and working on contact. The occupational th erapy units at the psychiatric hospitals are run by occupational therapy assistant s and artisans such as seamstresses and carpenters. In 2005 there were 18 occupational therapy assistants working within inpatient facilities. There are no c ommunity-based occupational therapists. Other 9 medical assistants were employed within the psych iatric hospitals in 2005. One other medical assistant works within a CPN clinic. There are also an unknown number of health assistan ts, some of which received 6 months training in mental health under an initiativ e at the Psychiatric Nurse Training Colleges. 3.6.6.2 Training professionals in mental health The number of health professionals who graduated fr om academic and educational institutions in 2005 is as follows: approximately 1 90 medical doctors (not specialized in psychiatry), 0 psychiatrists, 150 nurses with at least 1 year training in mental health care, approximately 7 psychologists with at least 1 year training in mental health care, and 35 medical assistants (not special ised in psychiatry). No occupational therapist has been trained within the period under review, as no training facilities for occupational therapists currently ex ist in Ghana. 123 *with at least one year's training in mental health care The two psychiatric nurse training colleges in Ghan a at Ankaful and Pantang hospitals have significantly increased their intake since 2005 in order to address the shortfall in psychiatric nurses. Both Pantang and A nkaful now have 200 places each for psychiatric nurse training. In 2005 the college s provided 6 months training for nursing aids to be employed in the psychiatric hosp itals, however this training is no longer running due to lack of resources. No psychiatrists emigrated to other countries withi n five years of the completion of their training within the year under review. The percentage of staff with at least two days of r efresher training in the rational use of psychotropic drugs, psychosocial interventions a nd the handling of mental health issues of adolescents and children is not known, as this data is not routinely collected. However staff indicated that due to reso urce constraints, in-service training was rarely available: '... some educational beef-up that we have to give to the nurses for them to perform very well, but because we are const rained, we don't have the money for it, that budgetary allocation to push our nurses to go and learn something. Even if there is somethi ng new..., even if 124 there is a new drug out, and then somebody has got the pamphlet or something to show, because of this financial constr aint we can't organize the nurses to teach them to upgrade themse lves into something. (Respondent 35.1, psychiatric nurse, focus group di scussion) 3.6.6.3 Consumer, family associations and other NGO s There is a family support group at Accra Psychiatri c Hospital. In 2005 there were approximately five mental health NGOs known to be o perating in the country, involved in activities such as counselling, vocatio nal rehabilitation, advocacy or support for people with mental illness. Basic Needs , which operates in Accra and in the north of the country, draws on a rights-based f ramework for mental health and is involved in strengthening the provision of communit y mental health care, advocacy, family support, and vocational rehabilitation. Basi c Needs provides outreach clinics to the Upper West, Upper East and Northern regions, an d in Greater Accra, and have trained volunteers to work alongside CPNs in the co mmunity to detect and refer cases of mental illness. The Psychomental Associati on was established by staff from Accra Psychiatric Hospital and mainly works to rais e awareness of drug abuse issues. The Friends of Accra Psychiatric Hospital is a coal ition of women's groups mainly from the Presbyterian and Methodist churches who en gage in fund-raising and provide some support for mental health, mainly in t he form of donations of food and clothing for the psychiatric hospitals. They also s ponsor the wards at Accra Psychiatric Hospital and pay for such things as ren ovation and redecoration. Mindfreedom, an NGO which was established in 2004, draws on the international mental health user movement to advocate for the rig hts of those with mental disorders. It works closely with Basic Needs to sup port users in the community. 3.6.7 Public education and links with other sectors 3.6.7.1 Public education and awareness campaigns on mental health There is no coordinating body to oversee publicatio ns and awareness campaigns regarding mental health. 125 Some mental health professionals and NGOs have cond ucted a few public education and awareness campaigns in mental health in the las t five years, such as World Mental Health Day and the 100 th anniversary of the Accra Psychiatric Hospital in 2006. Mindfreedom has held two 'Mad Pride' marches in Accra in 2006 and 2007 to raise awareness of mental health and promote the ri ghts of mental health service users. Several respondents reported conducting occa sional educational talks on mental health in schools and churches, as well as l ocal radio broadcasts. Others reported providing training in mental health for tr aditional healers and pastors. Participants reported that campaigns often target a dolescents who are at risk of drug abuse. In addition campaigns are targeted at women of maternal age who are at risk of depression and other disorders related to matern ity. No campaigns have been organised for children, trauma survivors, ethnic gr oups or other vulnerable minority groups. There is some coverage of mental health topics in t he national newspapers in Ghana. Between 1992 and 2005 the most popular natio nal newspaper, the Daily Graphic, published 191 articles on mental health. T he most commonly reported topics were suicides, drug abuse, charitable donati ons to psychiatric hospitals and overcrowding, understaffing and poor conditions in the state psychiatric hospitals. In the last two years there has been more coverage of the human rights of the mentally ill, including a review of mental health legislatio n, and calls for an improvement in psychiatric services (Doku et al. 2006). Newspaper articles are only accessible to those who read English. No private trusts or foundations have been involved in the promotion of mental health and awareness campaigns in Ghana. 3.6.7.2 Links with other sectors There are some formal collaborations between the Me ntal Health Unit and the departments and agencies responsible for primary he alth care/community health, reproductive health, child and adolescent h ealth, substance abuse, education, criminal justice and social welfare. However there is no collaboration with programmes for HIV/AIDS, child protection, employme nt, housing and the elderly. 126 In terms of support for child and adolescent health , no primary and secondary schools have either a part-time or full-time mental health professional. However, it is estimated that between 1-20% of primary and seconda ry schools have school-based activities to promote mental health and prevent men tal disorders in the form of talks and lay counselling. The percentage of prisoners with psychosis and ment al retardation in the prisons is not known. The percentage of prisons who have at le ast one prisoner per month in treatment contact with a mental health professional is not known as no records are kept of mental health cases within the prison servi ce. As regards training, the number of police officers, judges and lawyers who have participated in educational activities on mental he alth in the last five years is not known. Considering the responses provided in the qu alitative data it is probable that very little or no training programmes were conducte d. Police officers at the district level for example, reported receiving no training i n mental health. In terms of financial support for users, none of th e mental health facilities have access to governmental programmes outside the menta l health facility that provide employment for users with severe mental disorders. There are no social welfare benefits as such availa ble in Ghana. The District Poverty Alleviation fund is available for those facing seve re economic hardship. Since 2006, 5% of the District Assemblies' Common Fund is also dedicated for the 'physically challenged'. Social welfare departments can make di scretionary payments to the destitute, for example meeting their emergency medi cal costs. Some financial assistance is also provided by the psychiatric hosp ital social work departments to send discharged patients back to their communities. 3.6.8 Summary Ghana has limited psychiatric provision for the tre atment of mental illness with few specialist facilities and psychiatric health profes sionals. The vast majority of the national budget for mental health is absorbed by th e three psychiatric hospitals. There is no dedicated budget for mental health at t he regional and district levels. Specialised psychiatric care remains centralised. W hilst there is some integration of mental health within primary health care, there are very limited community-based 127 mental health services and many of the districts in the country are without a single mental health professional. Inpatient psychiatric c are is largely concentrated in the south of the country and only half of the country's regions have dedicated psychiatric units in the regional hospitals. Access to mental h ealth care is therefore severely restricted for the majority of the population. Psychotic disorders are the most frequent diagnosis in the psychiatric hospitals, representing almost 40% of inpatient admissions. Su bstance use disorders are the second most frequent diagnosis. Mood and affective disorders constitute the third most frequent diagnosis. Neurotic disorders are rar ely categorized and recorded as such and may form the bulk of the category denoted as 'others' together with personality disorder. There are also many undiagnos ed cases. The psychiatric hospitals have many long-stay patients who whilst r ecovered are unable to be discharged as many have been abandoned by their fam ilies. There is a lack of facilities for psychosocial rehabilitation to assis t such patients. Given the very limited number of qualified mental h ealth professionals such as psychologists, psychiatric social workers and occup ational therapists, treatment for mental illness within Ghana Health Service is large ly restricted to psychotropic medication with very little availability of psychos ocial therapies and interventions. Whilst psychotropic medication is provided free of charge at the hospitals and clinics there are problems in both the supply and distribut ion of psychotropic medication, particularly in remote areas. Training in mental health is limited at all levels, both for primary care workers and within other sectors, such as the police. Professio nals in mental health care reported receiving no refresher training. 128 3.7 Mental Health Policy Implementation at the Dist rict (Micro) Level: Case study of Kintampo North District 3.7.1 Overview of facilities, resources and service s 3.7.1.1 Structure of health services in Kintampo No rth district Table 8: Health facilities and resources in Kintamp o District (2005) Facilities Clinical Staff No of hospitals 1 Doctors 3 Fixed clinics 6 (2 private) Psychiatrists 0 Mobile clinics for PHC 0 Psychologists 0 Mobile clinics for MH 0 Medical Assistants 2 Dedicated beds 0 Nurses 45 Community residential 0 Nursing aids unknown Child and adolescent dedicated 0 Social Workers (community) 2 Outreach offices 2 (1 CHPS compound) Occupational Therapists 0 District management The Kintampo District Health Directorate represents GHS at the district level. The Directorate is responsible for the implementation o f health policies and interventional programmes at the community level, as well as provi ding clinical services through health centres and community clinics. For purposes of health service delivery, the district has been demarcated into 7 sub-districts w hich each have a health centre, rural clinic or outreach office. These are staffed by Community Health Midwives, Technical Officers and Field Technicians. 129 The District Health Management Team (DHMT) is respo nsible for supervising all the health care activities that take place in the healt h centres and clinics in Kintampo North district as well as overseeing the district h ospital at Kintampo. The DHMT is headed by the District Director of Health Services and has 16 staff including a public health nurse, an accountant, a biostatistician, a n utritionist and a disease control officer. The DMHT also includes the Medical Superin tendent, the District Director of Nursing Services and the administrator of the distr ict hospital. Data collated by the DHMT is reported to the Regional Health Directorate in the regional capital Sunyani, which provides support during strategic health plan ning and plays a supervisory role in the activities of the DHMT. In addition to supervising the clinical activities of the health facilities in the district, the DHMT has an important role in public health and hea lth promotion, including health education and outreach services to the communities in the district. The DHMT is also responsible for regulating the activities of the pr ivate clinics and maternity homes in the district. The DHMT was reported by respondents to face proble ms of staff shortages, inadequate funding and difficulties in accessing th e rural areas, particularly in the rainy season when many roads become impassable: 'The other problem is, the rural areas we have diff iculty having the people, especially when the rains start, they are c ut off. So for health services to reach them is a problem. And thi s year in particular the release of funds for our programme h as been very erratic and woefully inadequate. We also do not hav e enough staff. If you look at the whole of this district, communit y health nurses are only four. We only have two medical assistants in t he hospital, the rest of the hospital facilities do not have medical assistants.' (Respondent 62, senior public health nurse, distric t level) Mental health was generally seen as a neglected are a in the district. There are currently no staff dedicated to managing mental hea lth in the district. Participants at the district level suggested that mental health sho uld be included in the public health activities of the DHMT, and that there should be a mental health unit under the DHMT, responsible for supervising mental health car e and mental health promotion in the district. The DHMT is responsible for collat ing statistics on health problems in 130 the district, including mental health. Diagnoses of cases seen at the clinics in the sub-districts are sent to the bio-statistician. Dia gnostic categories on which data is collected are acute psychosis, substance abuse, epi lepsy, neurosis, depression, mania, bi-polar affective disorder and schizophreni a, however these are not systematically collated. One district health manager admitted that the true extent of mental health problems in the district is unknown, hence there is no data on which to base the planning of mental health services. She proposed a collaboratio n with the various stakeholders in the district from the District Health Directorate t o the religious leaders, to work together to identify the extent of mental health pr oblems in the district and to promote mental health: 'I think mental health in the district deserves a lot of attention. So I think at the district level maybe the District Heal th Directorate has to champion the course to establish the mental health unit that can function very vibrantly to be able to track a lot o f the mental health cases. Then also be able to give the necessary heal th education that is required for prevention purposes, just as o ther preventive campaigns that are going on. So I believe the Distr ict Health Directorate has to take that leading role, maybe th rough that, they can assist to get the hospital one established.' (Respondent 59, health manager, district level) District hospital The district hospital in Kintampo town has 64 beds and provides emergency services for all surgical and medical cases in the district. It also acts as a referral centre for cases from the community clinics and health centres and provides antenatal care and supervised delivery, paediatric care, some elective surgery and specialist outreach clinics e.g. ophthalmic services. The hospital func tions as a primary care facility since many people self-refer at the Outpatient Department for consultation with the doctors and medical assistants who hold daily clinics. Case s which require specialist assessment are referred to the Catholic hospital in Techiman or to the regional hospital in Sunyani. 131 There is one Ghanaian doctor working in the distric t hospital, who serves as the medical director, and two Cuban doctors provided un der a special agreement with the Cuban government, paid for by both governments. The hospital has close links with the adjacent health research centre and Rural Health Training School. Some doctors from the research centre provide clinics an d conduct trials using the hospital population, and medical assistants and other traine es from the training school, such as laboratory technicians, also undertake their pra ctical attachments at the hospital. There are no specialist mental health professionals working in the district hospital, however one of the medical assistants formerly work ed as a psychiatric nurse and psychiatric cases are usually referred to him for a ssessment and treatment. Staff at the district hospital try to manage those who prese nt at the hospital with mental health problems with the few available resources, i ncluding limited supplies of psychotropic medication: 'We try to manage when they come with the very litt le that we have.... Actually we don't have many of the drugs use d in managing mental health, we have very few of them available. Anti- depressants, they have to buy from outside. We do t ake care of people who are depressed, we do take care of people who have abnormal behaviours, acute psychosis, we try to han dle them, and then when we are not successful.... but actually we d on't have enough facilities, the human resource base, we don' t have enough to be able to handle psychiatric conditions.' (Respondent 74, senior health worker, district hos pital) Primary Health Care Clinics There are 2 health centres and 2 rural clinics in N orth Kintampo district, as well as 2 private clinics. The clinics are staffed by communi ty health nurses and community midwives. There are no doctors working in the clini cs. In addition there is one outreach office staffed by 2 technical officers, an d I CHPs compound staffed by a field technician. The adjacent Kintampo South District has 5 clinics, one of which is being upgraded into a district hospital. 132 Community Health Workers There are 4 Technical Officers and 9 Field Technici ans working in public health in Kintampo North district. They work predominantly in community surveillance, disease control and immunization. There are 2 volunteers wo rking under the CHPS programme and an unknown number of community-based surveillance volunteers (CBSVs). 3.7.1.2 Government sectors The district is divided into 6 town councils, 1 are a council and several unit committees for administration and governance. The a dministrative body is the District Assembly which comprises 69 members. Most assembly members are elected by the communities, but some are appointed by central gove rnment. They serve as a direct link between the chiefs and people of the communiti es. The District Assembly oversees the Community Water Supply, Civil Educatio n and Agricultural departments, as well as private health facilities, and thus plays a key role in public health and health promotion. 3.7.1.3 Other community health institutions. The Rural Health Training School The Rural Health Training School was established in 1969 and is currently the national training centre for middle level public he alth professionals such as technical officers and field technicians, who identify common diseases for referral and/or treatment, thus preventing disease complications an d mortality at the community level. The school also provides training for medica l assistants. Students and staff can serve as a resource in immunizations, disease case detection and health education through role-plays and health talks at the communit y level. Kintampo Health Research Centre Kintampo Health Research Centre (KHRC) is one of th e three health research centres under the Health Research Unit of the GHS. The research centre conducts operational and experimental studies that inform he alth policy and programmes within the Ministry of Health and GHS. Current rese arch is predominantly in the areas of malaria and maternal and child health. 133 A mental health research team has been established at KHRC led Dr. Victor Doku, a Ghanaian psychiatrist and epidemiologist who conduc ted an epidemiological study of psychosis in the area (2002-2005). Kintampo Demographic Surveillance System Kintampo DSS is a member of the international INDEP TH Network of field sites in developing countries employing the Demographic Surv eillance System (See chapter 2 ). 3.7.2 Knowledge of Mental Health Legislation and Po licy At the district level most respondents had very lim ited knowledge of the provisions of the mental health decree and mental health policy. As the following quotations reveal, many of the respondents within the health s ervice said they had no idea of the existence of these documents, let alone awarene ss of the provisions of mental health legislation and policy. 'They haven't even circulated it for us to see.' (Respondent 62, senior nursing officer, district le vel) 'I haven't even heard of the mental act.' (Respondent 80, medical doctor, district level) 'I haven't seen the policy, but it's likely that th e policy is there but its implementation is the problem.' (Respondent 62, senior nursing officer, district le vel) 'I think that policy must be made available for all of us.....' (Respondent 62, senior nursing officer, district le vel) Some respondents demonstrated some awareness of the provisions of the mental health decree regarding criminality and mental illn ess. However with virtually no knowledge about the existence and provisions of the mental health decree and policy, respondents were unable to provide informat ion about professional input, training in the provisions of the policy, the impac t of the decree and policy on work 134 performance, whether the legislation and policy are being implemented, and whether there is a need for change in some of the provision s of the legislation and policy. 3.7.3 Common and serious mental health problems 3.7.3.1 Training Staff in the district health facilities reported re ceiving no training in mental health other than what they had received during their basi c training. Health workers expressed a need for training to enable them to wor k more effectively with mental health patients who present at primary care facilit ies: 'I believe all the nurses require training, all the nurses, doctors, and medical assistants who mainly come into contact wit h these people require training to provide care to them, as well a s those at pharmacist level, they also have something to do wi th when it comes to administering drugs for mental health.' (Respondent 59, health manager, district level) 'It is a challenging area and if I have the opportu nity I think I would want to go into mental health, because we have to r efer so many people with mental illness to the regional hospital . Some end up not going,....some even ask us to discharge because they think is a spiritual.....That training, if I have the opportunit y to go through mental health education I will appreciate it.' (Respondent 74, medical doctor, district level) 3.7.3.2 Supervision and support There are no structures for supervision and support for those who work with cases of mental health in the district. One respondent attri buted this to the fact that mental health is not a priority in the district compared t o other health concerns: 'Actually mental health at the district is not bee n given the needed support, the needed recognition at the district lev el. So unlike antenatal, postnatal, children under five years, th ey are always 135 highlighted, mental health has not been seen as a p riority area in the health delivery, and because of that, support i s not... there is no such support in mental health.' (Respondent 74, medical doctor, district level) It was suggested that the regional psychiatric unit could provide support for mental health care in the form of outreach: 'I think regional support should come in the form o f the outreach services that the psychiatric units..... I believe th ere should be a programme like that even though we don't seem to se e much of that happening at the district level. But they are suppo sed to have an outreach plan for each district so that from time t o time the psychiatrist will visit maybe a community together with the psychiatric nurses, maybe, to see cases that exist in the district. So I believe that support should be in the form of outre ach services to areas that do not have this community psychiatric s ervice available.' (Respondent 59, health manager, district level) 3.7.3.3 Referral In Kintampo North and South Districts there are cur rently no practising psychiatric professionals. A doctor with a year's postgraduate training in psychiatry is based at the psychiatric unit at the regional hospital in Su nyani, about 3 hours' away by public transport. The unit has 22 short-stay inpatient bed s and 4 psychiatric nurses. There is also a volunteer with training in psychotherapy working at the unit. Two CPNs are based in Techiman at a distance of around 45 minute s by public transport. The CPNs have no funding for transport and so rarely conduct outreach visits to patients' homes. All psychiatric cases needing specialist assessment and treatment are supposed to be referred to the psychiatric wing at Sunyani regi onal hospital, however in practice some are referred directly to Ankaful psychiatric h ospital near Cape Coast, approximately 8 hours' journey from Kintampo. The h ealth care worker at the district facility is expected to provide a written referral letter to accompany the patient, outlining the patient's presentation and medical hi story and any tests or treatment 136 undertaken. This is given to the patient to take to the psychiatric facility. Whilst referrals can be made to the CPN in Techiman for co mmunity support and treatment of the mentally ill, this appears to be rare. Due t o lobbying by a mental health researcher there are plans for a CPN to be transfer red to Kintampo in the near future. 'At present we don't have a psychiatric nurse, so w e usually admit them briefly and then we try to find out the cause. Those that we can handle we give counselling and then we treat effect ive causes of mental illnesses, and then we refer to centres wher e they have psychiatric nurses [....] But we are planning to lobb y for psychiatric nurse because of late we are getting many of such c ases.' (Respondent 74, senior health worker, district hos pital) Agitated or violent patients who present to the cli nics and hospitals are given sedating medication, such as Largactil, and then re ferred to the hospitals: 'If someone is sick in the community, they will fir st report to the primary health worker at the health centre. So if t he person is very rowdy or very violent the worker may give Largactil to calm him down and then refer to the hospital. Then they brin g the person to the hospital, the doctor will look at the drug that was given, if it can still maintain the person calm then they will also refer to the next level.' (Respondent 62, senior public health nurse, distric t level) There is very little support for families to escort patients with mental illness to the psychiatric facilities once they are referred and t hey are usually reliant on public transport, even when the patient is very disturbed. An ambulance has recently been donated to the district hospital and hospital staff reported that this could be used to transport psychiatric patients to the regional hosp ital. However relatives were often unable to meet the cost and preferred to go by taxi . This means that a nurse was rarely able to accompany the patient to the regiona l hospital: 'The ambulance is available to any form of service, that is certain about it. The only problem is that when the relativ es are asked to give money for transportation, they would turn and go to town and 137 go to pick their own vehicle because the cost invol ved here is costing more than the other..., it will be expensive. So they rather prefer going to town to pick their own vehicle and go. And that you can't get a nurse to follow up to wherever they are going to because I don't think a taxi can accommodate more than six people to carry a mental patient to wherever he or she is referred to .' (Respondent 85.4, nurse, focus group discussion, di strict hospital) Although there is supposed to be a procedure for fe edback and back-referral to the district facilities for follow-up once the patient has been discharged from the psychiatric hospitals, it was reported that in prac tice this seldom occurs. It is generally left for the patient to return to the reg ional or psychiatric hospital for review or to attend the district hospital for medication: 'Ideally, we should always be given the feedback, but unfortunately, that is not the case for all the referrals we write . So far we don't give feedback.... I mean, we don't get feedback...... I think it is the workload.' (Respondent 74, medical doctor, district level) Health care workers expressed the need for the deve lopment of mental health services in the district. Several felt that Kintamp o should have its own psychiatric services and professionals, especially given its ge ographical position in the centre of Ghana: '....I think it will also be necessary that such faci lities or such trained personnel are also put here [Kintampo], [....] But Kintampo has grown and is very, very noted for medical instituti ons in Ghana and we also need such facilities here. We need such cal iber of personnel who will handle such issues. At least bei ng the centre too, people even from the north can also benefit. Those very close to us too can also benefit. So I think is very, very impo rtant that maybe the institutions or the government institutions sho uld do well to support even the training of such personnel.' (Respondent 66, senior police officer, district lev el) 138 3.7.3.4 Treatment protocols Staff at the hospital and clinics have access to th e Standard Treatment guidelines produced by GHS which include treatment guidelines for the major psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and depression (Gh ana Health Service 2004b). Staff also have access to the Ghana Essential Medic ines List (Ghana Health Service 2004a) and sometimes a copy of the British National Formulary. 3.7.3.5 Psychotropic medication Respondents indicated that there is some psychotrop ic medication available at the district hospital but supplies are often not suffic ient. Available psychotropic drugs at Kintampo Ami triptyline, Haloperidol, Diazepam and Carbamazepine. The medical store for the region is also located in Kintampo and CPNs from Techiman and Nkoranza requisition sup plies from here. The above mentioned drugs are available from the medical stor e as well as Olanzapine. However there are sometimes problems of supply, lea ding to shortages of some medication. Psychotropic drugs are provided free of charge. 3.7.3.6 Budget There is no dedicated budget for mental health at t he district level. This means that the ability to plan for the care of the mentally il l at the primary care level is severely constrained: 'We just do within our reach, whatever we can do to help the people. The budget is not enough and you cannot come out wi th specific programme. That is the limitation because we don't have an earmarked budget, even what we have, it is too smal l. So we cannot do more than we are doing now, and is even worse be cause there is no one who is responsible for that aspect on the te am.' (Respondent 62, senior public health nurse, distric t level) 139 This respondent also suggested as did others quoted above, that with greater resources, primary care staff could organise traini ng and provide educational programmes on mental disorders on local radio. It was also stressed that if more resources were ma de available, the quality of care rendered to psychiatric patients would be improved, and a psychiatric wing could even be attached to the district hospital. 3.7.3.7 Language All the Ghanaian health professionals in the distri ct speak at least one of the vernacular languages, including Twi, as well as Eng lish. The Cuban doctors at the district hospital speak English as a second languag e and communicate with non- English speakers via the nurses or nurse aids who p rovide interpretation. There are no specialist trained interpreters. When the clinic ian and the patient do not share a common language, family members are commonly used a s interpreters: '....most of the time we try to get relatives who can speak the same language with the victims; then they can interpret in other languages. If it's English or Akan language I think most of the times there are some relatives who are able to understand and they can interpret. If it is not even a close relative but i f the person's tribe is identified, there may be a way of getting somebody who speaks the same language to assist us..' (Respondent 59, health manager, district level) Language barriers were not generally seen to be a p roblem because of the ease of finding someone to translate, however one c linician admitted that: 'If you cannot speak the same language with the pe rson its difficult to get actually the correct history and development of how the illness starts. So it is a barrier even in diagnosing the p articular mental health.' (Respondent 74, medical doctor, district level) 140 The high levels of illiteracy in the area, particul arly among women, mean that access to health information is limited for those without the ability to speak and read English. Clinical notes and prescriptions are recorded in En glish in the clinical facilities and all notices and signage in the hospital and clinics is in English, including the Patient's Charter. Community radio provides some health infor mation in the vernacular languages. 3.7.3.8 Children and adolescents There are no specialist services for child and adol escent mental health at the district level. The DMHT sends workers into the schools in t he district to conduct physical examinations and sight and hearing tests. Health ed ucation is also conducted in the schools, and includes education on drug abuse. Chil dren who are suspected to have been sexually abused are referred to the police, wh o then request a medical examination and refer to Social Welfare and WAJU. P rimary health workers who encounter children with psychological problems or d evelopmental delay usually refer to the district hospital, who then refer to the psy chiatric hospitals if specialist assessment and treatment is deemed to be required. Parents will also bring children with developmental delay or abnormal behaviour to t he district hospital for consultation. 3.7.3.9 Programmes for mental health There are no specific programmes for mental health promotion in the district, although one participant suggested such programmes might be carried out as part of the general public health education through radio p rogrammes, durbars and talks at the schools, churches and mosques: 'I think there are educational programmes that go o n from time to time through the public health unit in the district . Usually they carry out health talks on the air, and when they go to th e communities, at durbars, sometimes they will talk about programmes to educate people, maybe substance abuse and other problems th at can lead to these mental health problems. So I think there a re programmes 141 like that as part of general public health educatio n that is carried out.' (Respondent 59, health manager, district level) Apart from occasional discussions related to substa nce abuse, there are no mental health programmes for vulnerable groups such as wom en or children and adolescents. However one public health nurse report ed that mental health promotion is included within antenatal classes for women. Thi s includes advice on marital relationships and childcare, especially for teenage mothers: '....mental health can be triggered off by marriage p roblems and things like that and when we talk to the women in g roups that we meet we talk about how they should cope, the relati onship between they and their husband, the type of food they shoul d eat for the children to grow well both in the tummy and when th ey are out and born, and all these we believe contribute to a succ essful marriage and some of them are able to cope. We don't tell th em like if your husband does these you have to also get annoyed, yo u have to be calm and then of course you should know the man is the head of the family and if you respect the man, the man will res pect you. If the man doesn't have money and you have money that day you also cook, and all these things, try to bring peace into the house and then less stress on the woman. Especially the teenager w ho has no husband, we visit them in the home, we try to let t heir parents accept the girl that way, they should try and suppo rt, these are some of the things that we are doing.' (Respondent 62, senior public health nurse, distric t level) 3.7.3.10 Explanations for Mental Health Problems The respondents at the district level showed varyin g degrees of knowledge about mental illness. Respondents saw mental illness as a disorder that has physical, spiritual and mental connotations. Some located men tal illness in the mind. One member of the police talked about the mind as 'the engine of the body': 142 'Yes, as he said, mental illness is when the mind...w hen somebody has developed a mental problem thus his normal beha viour, how he behaves, how it is has changed. When the mind has c hanged you see the whole body looks otherwise.' (Respondent 87.1, police officer, focus group discu ssion, district level) Other responses stated that mental illness has to d o with behaviour which is inconsistent with societal norms: 'Mental illness comprises all forms of psychiatric disorders characterized by abnormal behaviour, then social ineptitude...people behave differently from societal norms...' (Respondent 74, medical doctor, district level) 'Mental illness is simply behaving abnormally. Beha viour which is not related to normal accepted behaviour in the com munity.' (Respondent 82.1, teacher, focus group discussion, district level) 'A disease which affects the mental being of the in dividual when the person cannot analyse or perceive things the normal way'. (Respondent 80, medical doctor, district level) Some related mental illness to stress: 'I see it from a point like someone who is not able to withhold...has a very low threshold for events relating to stresse s in the environment.' (Respondent 85.3, nurse, focus group discussion, di strict level) Mental illness was classified by one teacher as a s piritual sickness: Respondent: 'I think some of the mental problem is not just mainly poverty but at times it can also be this spiritual kind of sickness, maybe spiritually you are been controlled by some k ind of spirits that forces you to do things that are abnormal you don't actually think of 143 doing but the spirits in you controls you to do wha t is not accepted in society.' Interviewer: 'What are you calling spirits?' Respondent: 'Looking at the mad people in town they see things that we don't see, they talk with things that...hear voices that we can not hear, so I think those things are spirits follo wing them.' (Respondent 82.5, teacher, focus group discussion) 3.7.3.11 Causes of Mental Illness Several causes of mental illness were described by respondents at the district level. These included poverty, unemployment, marital or fa mily problems, hereditary factors, accidents, early childhood physical and ps ychological maltreatment, and stress and frustration. The following were represen tative of such responses culled mainly from focus group discussions with various pr ofessional groups: 'Some of them when they lose their jobs it plunk th em into mental problem. Some of them too, maybe she has been raped and too much thinking on that can lead to mental problem. S ome of them too it is genetic, he was born with it. It means the il lness is in the family. Maybe somebody from the family has gone to seek the assistance of gods and did not fulfil the promise. So anybody born in that family is covered under that covenant.' (Respondent 75, Muslim healer, district level) 'Frustrations can also cause mental illness. Like f or instance I want to go outside and I invested a lot of money in my v isa and finally when I get to the airport or the ambassador then th ey disappointed me, or sometimes I can get to the country and then they deport me. That one when I come back I am going to be frustrat ed and that one can cause this thing.' (Respondent 83.9, teacher, focus group discussion) 'Sometimes too stress, too much stress on the body. Sometimes too you may...especially when you are at work your boss w ill be 144 expecting too much from you which you cannot do. In that case you will become so depressed and so depression can easi ly lead to mental illness.' (Respondent 83.2, teacher, focus group discussion, district level) Respondents also identified several 'cultural' or ' spiritual' causes for mental illness, including witchcraft, curses, flouting taboos and t raditional practices: '.....there is the belief that, sometimes when you go against certain people they can curse you. For a man has gone in fo r another man's wife, you can be cursed and you can be mad. If you steal certain things belonging to the family in our Akan area the re are some people who we hear they are mad because they had st olen gold belonging to a particular family, when you do that you are cursed and you become mad.' (Respondent 84.3, teacher, focus group discussion, district level) '..... culturally, we have our traditional festivals, shrines, stool houses, and it is believed that the young children during festivals, those who carry shrines and then the stools to shri ne houses, such children finally develop mental problems. When they have festivals, they have shrines, they carry them to stool houses and you see young, young girls are carrying these things. In th e end, such children who carry such stools and shrines, they de velop mental problems. The priestess, we have fetish priest, chi ldren take part in sacrifices at these shrines, in the end, they becom e mentally disturbed. So culturally yes, there is a link betwe en cultural practice and mental problems.' (Respondent 84.9, teacher, focus group discussion, district level) 'There are some people traditionally who are linked to a certain deity and for that matter they are supposed to behave in a certain way. So that when you deviate in that kind of behaviour after series of warnings you are punished, and most of the time the punishment takes the form of mental illness. You begin behavin g strangely, and at the end your condition has to be dug into for yo u to realize that 145 they are allegiance to this deity which you have so rt of broken. That can also cause mental problems.' (Respondent 84.6, teacher, focus group discussion, district level) Some attributed mental illness to alcohol abuse and the use of narcotic drugs, in particular 'wee' (cannabis): 'These days what do we see? Our youths, what do the y indulge in? They indulge in drugs, drug abuse and definitely th e cause might not be from the home but peer pressure. Through peer pr essure at the secondary school level, now even at the JSS [Junior Secondary School] level, we have children smoking 'wee' at the JSS le vel, and definitely they are leading themselves into mental difficulties.' (Respondent 60, education service, district level) 'Nowadays, the young men and women that are sufferi ng from mental illness are as a result of 'wee' smoking, us e of hard drugs, and alcoholism.' (Respondent 70, pastor, faith healing church, distr ict level) 3.7.3.12 Attributions of Users Few interviews were conducted with users of mental health services, therefore there is limited data on users' attributions of mental il lness. Those interviewed suggested a mixture of social and spiritual causes of their ill ness: Interviewer: 'So what do you think causes that? Wha t makes you to do that?' Respondent: 'It is a depression, depression or fru stration.' 'Why do you think you are frustrated?' Respondent: 'Because of my husband, the way he hand led me.' Interviewer: 'So you are thinking that it has been caused by the way your husband...?' Respondent: 'The way my husband treated me.' Interviewer: 'Do you think there is any other possi ble cause?' 146 Respondent: 'No, in my village they say they are wi th the stool [traditional seat of chiefs] , we are king makers, so we have to perform some customary rites. This is what the elders are saying, but to me, I know I have to take my medicine.' (Respondent 76, user of psychiatric services) Interviewer: 'What do you think is the source of y our illness?' Respondent: 'I believe it is from one pastor who ad ministered a nasal drop to me. I became drowsy and my mind becam e abnormal' (Respondent 77, user of psychiatric services) 3.7.3.13 Gender and mental health Gender correlates in mental illness were expressed by many of the respondents. Both male and female respondents felt that females were prone to mental illness due to marital conflicts, the domineering role of men i n society, the burden of childcare, and domestic violence: '....when you look at the gender perspective, women b y their make- up sometimes are easily prone to psychological tort ure than men. When it comes to issues about marriage problems, or inability to get husbands, some eventually go off as a result of int ense psychological trauma. So I think gender plays a par t because women are usually considered as a weaker sex, they are not empowered enough to be able to enjoy their rights i n most cases, and sometimes some are suppressed and out of frustr ations. So gender plays a part.' (Respondent 59, health manager, district level) '...some women become mentally disturbed as a result of marital problems. When they are with the men alright, and a ll of a sudden the men begin to jilt them, begin to see other wome n, and then forget about them, they think of them, and then the y develop mental problems..' (Respondent 84.3, teacher, focus group discussion, district level) 147 Interviewer: 'Now do you think there is any link be tween gender and mental illness?' Respondent: 'Yes, you see our African men, our trad itional way of marrying, sometimes, you marry about three women an d then yon may neglect the other one, then you will start thin king. Or she is the only wife but the husband may not pay good attentio n and may be moving with other women and that may lead to mental illness because majority of the cases come from this point. ' Interviewer: 'You think there are more women with m ental problems?' Respondent: 'Yes. You see the women needs love, so if you don't provide the love and you turn away from her, going from one woman to the other, then they will start thinking and the n hysteria will set in, and then it can lead to the mental problem.' (Respondent 67, health worker, district level) The burden of childcare was seen to fall on women p utting them at greater risk of poverty and mental health problems: ' You know normally when you talk of poverty, the w oman.... the children are on her side [under her care] , even though the man is supposed to be remitting, when the man is not havin g everyday [has no source of income] , he will go away and then because of the poverty, the children will be crying on their mothe r and see that she will not have a sound mind and as a result create m ental problem.' (Respondent 64, Social Welfare department, district level) Other respondents expressed the opinion that men ar e more at risk of mental disorders through the abuse of alcohol and drugs: 'But when it comes to men it originates from drugs. Very many of the men they become mad as a result of intake of hard d rugs.' (Respondent 84.3, teacher, focus group discussion, district level) Men were also perceived by some respondents to be a t risk of mental illness when they failed to succeed in their ambitions, such as emigrating abroad: 148 'They are a lot of them, when men travel to seek gr eener pastures and they don't succeed it brings about this mental problem.' (Respondent 75, Muslim healer, district level) Several respondents saw women as more vulnerable to stress and depression, and related this to disappointments in love and marriag e, a kind of folk diagnosis called \"broken heart\". Men were seen as more prone to obvi ous forms of madness like psychosis, often related to drug abuse. This percep tion of gendered forms of mental illness is exemplified by this police officer: 'Women too, when they are turned down in love, it l ands them a lot. So even when you go to this psychiatrist, they used to say it there, some of them is just \"broken heart\", many of them. But you see, when woman divorces a man suddenly it doesn't norma lly affect the man too much. But as for men before you see it is t he marijuana, that is the drug. Many of them ... so the drug render ing you to mental illness that one is different from other men tal illness. As for that one it's a drug, but normal mental illness is the women. They don't normally take drug, but many of them are in t he psychiatrist, immediately you fail them small then they become de jected.' (Respondent 87.2, police officer, district level) Respondents suggested that empowering and educating women and supporting them to exercise their rights was one way of helpin g to prevent mental health problems amongst women: 'I think women must be empowered and encouraged to enjoy their rights to the fullest maximum, and be given the nec essary assistance particularly to ensure that they are abl e to exercise their rights and stay away from maltreatment from their m ale counterparts. I think they also need to be educated especially when it comes to marriage issues, a lot of education wil l do, so people will understand each other and not get frustrated and ev entually grow mad.' (Respondent 59, health manager, district level) 149 3.7.3.14 Mental Health and Poverty There was a great deal of agreement among the respo ndents at the district level on the links that exist between mental ill-health and poverty. Many respondents indicated that poverty could induce all sorts of me ntal problems including stress, depression and anxiety: 'Yes, mental health and poverty, poverty can lead t o mental illness. That is, if you have no money on you, even now as y ou are sitting down now, if you have no money, you will be so depr essed, you will be worried, somebody will be talking somewhere, eve n you will be annoyed because you are depressed you don't want to hear that \"noise\".' (Respondent 85.1, nurse, focus group discussion, di strict level) '....when we look at mental illness as a form of il l adjustment to stresses, then you see that money or poverty has a problem there. Somebody cannot afford three square meals or just o ne meal and he sits depressed, is a form of mental illness. And so you can see a practical display of poverty there.' (Respondent 85.3, nurse, focus group discussion, di strict level) 'Picking from the cases that we had always had here , you try scoring from their background: they come from poor backgrounds, [the] few cases we had to refer, manage and they had to carry away or manage and failed. they always come from poor fa mily economic background. We have never had a case that comes fro m a well-to- do background. From the few circumstances they beco me wretched and dirty and you can just picture that they are fr om poor family background.' (Respondent 85.2, nurse, focus group discussion, di strict level) 'Poverty can make someone develop mental problem. I f you are very poor, whenever you are walking, you will be ta lking to yourself like a mad person. So it is very true that poverty and mental problem have some relationship. 150 (Respondent 86.5, traditional healer, focus group d iscussion, district level) Several respondents suggested that poverty resulted in the person 'thinking too much' or 'excessive thinking', and this could lead in turn to physical health problems such as hypertension as well as mental illness or m adness: '...poverty brings depression and other problems and yo u need to survive at all cost. You can't have the basic thing s, you get to worry, and too much of thinking brings in a lot of things like high tension and high blood pressure, all these. For if they con tinue, some of these conditions will lead to mental health problem .' (Respondent 84.1, teacher, focus group discussion, district level) 'You know if you can't meet certain basic requireme nt, you are not able to pay your bill and look at the family proper ly, okay, if you don't have a family, you look after yourself properly to settle, at least the basics, it sets you thinking, like madam said, the brain is designed to take some amount of pressure. If it exceeds it, it breaks it down and that will lead to mental problems. So a healthy bra in depends on a healthy pocket.' (Respondent 84.6, teacher, focus group discussion, district level) Poverty was also linked to poor nutrition which was seen to result in damage to the brain which could lead to mental illness: 'And too from infancy, we know that some foods are there when you take it gives us strong mental development. So because some families, they are so poor that even what to eat... e ven the nutrition that people need for mental development t hey don't have. So that one too you see, some one will grow up and develop a mental problem due to poverty. So poverty has a str ong influence on mental problems.' (Respondent 87.1, police officer, focus group discu ssion, district level) 151 Some suggested the effects of poverty such as hunge r and overcrowding, could lead people into abusing drugs or alcohol which in turn could lead to mental illness. 'People who are poor are likely to go into this alc ohol, these drugs. Is funny, I heard over the radio sometime ago that, we observe that those in the north, we those in the north or t he north, a lot of people are smoking these cigarette, a lot, and we k now that north is also a deprived area, people are poor and there is that report that, the north there is high alcohol intake too. S o sometimes people are taking those things to forget about thei r problems, or the stomach is making noise, oh you take a little, and then maybe it subsides for you. So there is that linkage betwe en poverty and mental health.' (Respondent 84.5, teacher, focus group discussion, district level) '....now if you go into our community, the people ar e poor, they are farmers, they want to produce more, and in their ef fort to produce more, they go about taking drugs that will enhance their strength to make them work harder, and what do we end up with? Cooking and drinking marijuana. Now people are poor, they are n ot able to accommodate their children properly because the per son is poor and hire only one room, the children are many, and so what happens is that, when the parents are at home and w ant to have sex, the children have to stay outside for some tim e before they are allowed in, and when they are outside other colleag ues are around and before you realize they have formed a gang and they are introduced to drug, if not alcohol, this drug they call like these \"volume ten\" and the 'wee'.' (Respondent 62, senior public health nurse, distric t level) Respondents had to be prompted to discuss the rever se process, of mental illness resulting in poverty. However respondents recognise d that mental illness affected the capacity to work, organise one's time and provide f or the family: 'Yes it is, in that, somebody is well to do and all of a sudden, he becomes mentally sick, now he cannot work, and he c annot think properly and cannot control the family, he doesn't recognize his 152 surroundings therefore he is going to be wretched b ecause how he put things in order to work and earn, or to work and gain that money is no more there. Therefore the entire family , I mean the nuclear family is going to be poor.' (Respondent 85.1, nurse, focus group discussion, di strict level) 'You need a sound mind to coordinate your daily eve nts, so once you develop a mental problem then it is certainly s ure that you can not coordinate your daily events. And so if the dai ly events brings in income to run the family's business and your own business and your normal life, then it tells you that there woul d a break in the flow of income and certainly once the breadwinner o f the family... then the family is certainly going to change in ter ms of economics placement.' (Respondent 85.3, nurse, focus group discussion, d istrict level) When the issue of breaking the link between mental ill-health and poverty was discussed, many of the respondents were of the view that government policies should address the root causes of poverty in the ru ral communities through supporting the poor in employment and income genera tion. Some respondents suggested that youth unemployment could lead young people into drug abuse with subsequent mental health problems and suggested ski lls and entrepreneurial training for young people in order to assist them into work: 'I think that this one, a lot will have to depend on the commitments of policy makers to come out with policies that wou ld be geared towards tackling the root courses of poverty in the society. So the government must come out with programmes that will encourage people to go into acquisition of skills that will m ake them employable. Support in terms of maybe loans and oth er schemes to engage people in economic activities and busines s ventures. The government can do a lot in that direction.' (Respondent 59, health manager, district level) 153 'After they have been healed, if the government as sists them to get jobs, it will help them a lot by not letting th em think so much, poverty is madness, so if they get jobs, it will he lp a lot.' (Respondent 70, faith healer, district level) 'Some become mentally ill because they are poor, so if they are given money to trade, to make a living, they can be sound.' (Respondent 87.2, teacher, focus group discussion, district level) 3.7.3.15 Stigma Many respondents at the district level spontaneousl y mentioned the stigma attached to mental illness. Respondents were almost unanimou s in the view that as soon as you develop mental illness, you no longer have any worth in society: 'When you are mentally ill in Kintampo district, I think it's also applied to other districts, you will become a socia l outcast. People point accusing fingers at you, you see, there is no gathering you will go and people will accept you. Immediately people p ronounce you that you are mad and you come there they fear that this person can be very dangerous to our health, we must do somethi ng, he can relapse. So they will say: \"Go, go, go, stay aside in that order\". So people perceive people who're mad as not part of th e society.' (Respondent 15 senior officer, mutual health insura nce scheme) 'And the stigma attached to mental illness now in o ur society is such that, no matter what you should be when you ar e said to have mental problem then the society attaches that tag to you and you can't be that important. Once you are coming in , people will start moving away, is like your contributions canno t be valid even if occasionally they are. They shun your company.' (Respondent 85.3, nurse, focus group discussion, di strict level) This is even the case for those who have recovered. The stigma is maintained by the belief that once you have developed a mental disord er there is always the tendency 154 to relapse. It is commonly believed that there is n o complete cure from mental illness, and that sufferers are left with residual symptoms for the rest of their lives: '...you see it is very rare cases that mental illnesses are actually cured completely. Most of the time people end up sp ending their whole life in the mental institution or on the stre ets, so that even if you're cured like he said, you can still come back to your previous condition' (Respondent 84.6, teacher, focus group discussion, district level) ' I think sometimes subjecting yourself to mental t reatment in public mental hospitals is sometimes not very accep ted because even after recovering from your mental illness, if you say something factual in society that the society is no t interested in, they subject you to your previous mental illness. S o certainly we are not treated the same, even those who recover st ill have the consequences to face.' (Respondent 84.2, teacher, focus group discussion, district level) This means that it is difficult for those who have or have had a mental health problem to marry or find employment: 'Then the brain is like the engine of the body and somebody who has a problem in the brain if you marry such a pers on, how can the person raise children? How can the person work and then take care of the house? So if you are in the society and you want to marry somebody with a mental problem I don't think your people will accept and I don't... .. I have never seen, I have never heard of somebody who has tried to marry somebody with menta l problem before because it will not work, you can't reason w ell, and if you can't reason well as a human being how do you raise a family? So I don't think it will work.....' (Respondent 83.7, teacher, district level) '....traditionally before you marry they have to stud y the family background, if they hear that there was madman in t he family, you will never... they couldn't allow the girl to marry f rom that family. 155 So there is discrimination. The family may want to get him a wife but they will investigate and find out that \"No, th is family there is danger\" .....So there is discrimination.' (Respondent 84.9, teacher, focus group discussion, district level) 'The fact is that, if the sickness prevails, or sti ll you are not fully recovered, definitely you yourself will not be able to do any work normally. Apart from that, if the patient recovers at all, there is a fear that there may be a relapse, and imagine, with a very serious document, and there is a relapse and he messes up t he whole thing, because of that..., and your output as well. T he productivity may be so low that if you have to be paid according to the productivity, you may not be willing to take up the job.' (Respondent 84.4, teacher, focus group discussion, district level) People with mental illness were also reported to be excluded from important aspects of family life in Ghana such as 'family meetings': '....and if you are in a family too and you develop s uch a... when even the family meet for some discussion at times e ven they don't call you. At times when you come there yourself, th ey persuade you: \"Okay, you go and sit down\", they always want to hide some important things from you.' (Respondent 87.2, police officer, focus group discu ssion, district level) Mental illness is often associated with violence an d unpredictability which was given as another reason why one would not want to marry o r employ someone with mental illness: 'I want to add that stigmatization and fear, the fe ar......Members fear stigmatization, and the work place, they fear that the mad person can explode at anytime. So for fear of emplo ying the person and family members, they don't want people t o know that their member is mad so they even don't want him to even go out of the house whether for employment or not, they wo uldn't want him to go for that employment for fear of social st igma, and at 156 work place, nobody want to employ a dangerous perso n, someone who can explode at any time.' (Respondent 84.9, teacher, focus group discussion, district level) 'Because of the nature of the sickness, when somebo dy is mentally ill the fellow can easily take a cutlass a nd kill you, so if you go and marry such a person, you are risking you r life, you can die out of that. So that is why they don't.' (Respondent 83.2 teacher, focus group discussion, d istrict level) Several respondents mentioned the extension of the stigma to those who work in mental health facilities. This perception stems fro m the belief that madness is \"contagious\" and that those working with people suf fering from mental disorders can themselves become \"tainted with madness\". This perc eption is not only held in the general population, but also by health professional s: 'In fact it has effect on them, because I know a ps ychiatric nurse who was my mate, he actually behaves like them. In the ward you see him pulling his tie and doing all sort of abnor mal things. They actually behave like them.' (Respondent 85.1, nurse, focus group discussion, di strict level) Respondents suggested that education both for famil ies and professionals who come into contact with the mentally ill was one way to r educe the stigmatization: 'I will wish for education for families to understa nd that when somebody is mentally handicap, that doesn't mean he is totally out of the family.' (Respondent 87.1, police officer, focus group discu ssion, district level) Another respondent talked of the need for 'sensitiz ation' to increase awareness of the rights of the mentally ill across all sectors of so ciety: '...we need to sensitize the public. Sensitization, b ecause people don't know even the right of the disabled or mental ly ill people. 157 There is also the need to address the target groups like school children because whenever they see them, they at ti mes shout at them and doing something which also annoys them. Th e market women and the police all need to be sensitized. Th en also if you want to go further the, GPRTU [Ghana Private Road Transport Union] for instance. So far as Social Welfare is concerned at times you may see those people, especially children with mental problem, and you like to help by sending them to th e psychiatric hospital. So in such a way the GPRTU have to come i n and help.' (Respondent 64, social welfare, district level) 3.7.4 Government sectors 3.7.4.1 Education Three focus groups were held with teachers from bot h private, religious and state schools, as well as interviews with two senior mana gers at the district office of Ghana Education Service (GES). The following analyses ill ustrate the perception that mental health and illness impacts on education and vice ve rsa. Causes of mental illness Several teachers mentioned poverty as a cause of be havioural or mental health problems in children: '....when you are poor, the family which you come fro m are poor. You are student - before you come to school you don 't eat anything, so you are hungry, and even what you wear sometimes is not good enough. When you come you will sit down whilst less ons are going on you will be thinking, you will think, and you se e the more you think the more you have problem in your brain. So p overty has a link.' (Respondent 83.7, teacher, focus group discussion, district level) Pupils who had little parental support, orphans, or those from 'broken homes' were identified as being particularly at risk: 158 '...maybe a child from a poor home who hadn't had muc h love or from a broken home who hadn't had that sort of affe ction at home, maybe through poverty the child has not been well n ourished, that child may not be able to adjust properly when it co mes to society. And therefore, in the school setting you will see t hat such children exhibit some sort of behaviours, first they don't w ant to share anything with anybody. Then secondly, they don't wa nt to associate themselves freely with others, you would need reall y to coerce them to associate themselves.' (Respondent 60, manager, GES, district level) 'So generally when we detect this thing there is a need for preferential treatment between that student who is mentally ill and the other pupil. For instance, in my class, I reali ze that, there is one girl and that girl, not that she is all that bad, w hen you look at the family background, her mother and father are all de ad. So when the girl comes to school, you find out that she would b e sleeping. And then when you are teaching in the classroom she doe sn't concentrate. So in this case it's not her problem [fault], when you find such problem, you have to find a way to counse l such a child and some treatment. For instance, when she comes to the classroom for instance, she has no money to pay for the class fee. So there is no need that you all the time punish he r for not paying, because naturally she is affected by the brain acco rding to the circumstance of the environment, and lack of the pa rents. So there is preferential treatment for that particular girl in the class.' (Respondent 82.1, teacher, focus group discussion, district level) ' When it comes to the broken home, let's say your parents are not staying together, maybe you may be attending school in this place and your father or your mother is staying maybe at xxxx. Sometimes one of the parents may be aware that the child is w ith the father, meanwhile the father also knows that the child has informed him that he was going to the mother, and on the way thi s guy can definitely involve him or herself with any of the s ocial vices which will generate in society madness and mental problem.' 159 (Respondent 82.1, teacher, focus group discussion, district level) The teachers also perceived drugs, particularly the smoking of cannabis ('wee'), to be a growing problem amongst students, especially b oys, with consequences for mental health: 'And the boys too their problem is smoking sometime s. When the parents are not able to take good care of them they become too hostile that, they do whatever that they want to do . So due to peer groups and other things they get into drugs and the n as they smoke and drink definitely their brains are affected.' (Respondent 83.7, teacher, focus group discussion, district level) '...normally you see more boys who are mentally derange d than girls because some boys...most of the boys go into dr ug abuse like smoking marijuana and drinking and all those things and that, leads to mental health problems.' (Respondent 69, headmaster, district level) One teacher suggested that the effects of poverty c ould lead a child to using drugs, in turn leading to mental illness: 'In our school system, when the child, a poor child cannot get dresses, he can't get shoes, even the exercise book s, he comes to the class others make fun of him, he becomes a drop -out, indulges in 'wee' smoking and finally he goes mad. So it is because of poverty.' (Respondent 84.9, teacher, focus group discussion, district level) Some teachers also talked about poverty leading the female students into taking boyfriends who could be a source of financial suppo rt. Girls who then got pregnant at a young age were also identified as being at risk o f developing mental health problems: 'And also the girls sometimes because of poverty th e girl goes out to take a boyfriend, and then probably after pregnancy the boy denies 160 you see, and because of the pregnancy the child may give birth and taking care of a child and herself becomes a proble m and it is a severe mental problem.' (Respondent 83.7, teacher, focus group discussion, district level) Some teachers expressed fears about the safety of w orking with students with mental health problems, particularly if this was as sociated with the use of drugs, because of the risk of unpredictable and violent be haviour: '..it is not safe to work with such people because the thing doesn't easily manifest itself sometimes. Something trigger s off and anything can happen at that moment because there ar e some, who's are mild, but something very little can spark it off and anything can happen. So as a counsellor not less than five, six of them has passed through me for the past six years that I hav e been here [......].So it is not safe to work with such people.' (Respondent 84.9, teacher/school counselor, focus g roup discussion, district level) 'Dealing with student who is expected to be taking, or believe in drugs is very dicey because of they way... because of the way... because of the effect of the said drugs on the pers on. So you might have sort of experienced such a situation before yo u can tackle the student. Now if you can't, you can refer to the sch ool counseling system or other appropriate quarters. Since such s tudents have violent tendencies, they can turn violent at anytim e, it is a sort of aversive thing, you got to be very careful about ho w you tackle it and who you refer to if you can't tackle it yoursel f.' (Respondent 84.6, teacher, focus group discussion, district level) Services for children with special needs Recently GES has begun to train experienced teacher s as school counsellors. Counsellors were reported to be in place in most st ate schools in the district. There is a district coordinator at the district office of GE S who identifies students with special needs, in particular mental retardation. The coordi nator provides peripatetic support 161 to teachers in working with children with special n eeds, and makes referrals to medical services for assessment if necessary. If th e child is found to be mentally retarded, the coordinator will refer the child to a special school if appropriate. It was reported that there are also occasional visits to t he schools by the school health coordinator. However one member of the education service highlig hted the gap between policies and implementation in supporting children with spec ial needs which means that some of the promised specialist support is not available : 'Government policies and actions, well policies are there but the actions are the problem. Because we have this const itution which gives the opportunity to everybody to be handled eq ually, but the actions sometimes...example: there should have been a good number of peripatetic teachers who should have been attach ed to the schools to help these children. Take them out during break and give them special tuition but this is not happening.' (Respondent 61, manager, GES, district level) Some reservations were also expressed about the qua lity of the training of school counsellors and whether they were really fulfilling their role in practice: Interviewer: '......has the Ghana education got maybe a ny regular programmes to update people on behavioural problems , because these problems are dynamic, they can change?' Respondent: 'The counseling unit is supposed to do that. That is exactly what the counseling unit is supposed to do, but as you know, \"no money syndrome\", they don't do it. They are sup posed to update the knowledge of teachers so that, they are able to identify some of the symptoms of deviant behaviour, symptoms of abnormal behaviour in class, the child may be too quiet, too aggressive, may be making noise, maybe not taking notice or sleepin g, any other behaviour that isn't the norm in the classroom. So the counseling unit actually is supposed to be updating our school s every year, if not every term, but they don't do it. They don't ac tually come out to update the knowledge of teachers as regards to thes e problems.' (Respondent 84.9, teacher, focus group discussion, district level) 162 Supporting students with mental health problems When asked about how they would deal with behaviour al problems or mental illness among their students, teachers identified three mai n courses of action. The first involved consulting the family to find out the caus e of the problem: 'I think the first step is to find out a little bit ... to find out a little bit more about the student in question and family backg round and things like that. These behaviors I believe don't j ust come out of the blue, something triggers them, either immediate or remote. So by digging into a bit of the student history you might come out with possible reasons for such behaviour, since, like I said, earlier they don't just happen, something triggers them to happe n.' (Respondent 84.6, teacher, focus group discussion, district level) 'When somebody is having a peculiar problem or atti tude in the class which is not accepted, sometimes we get the h eadmaster informed, and if there is the need, we invite the p arents to let the parents know the behaviour of the child in the clas s room. We compare the behaviour in the class room as to if th ere is some differences in his or her behaviour in the school a nd at the home so that the teacher will know if there is something wr ong with him.' (Respondent 82.2, teacher, focus group discussion, district level) The second course of action was referring the stude nt to the school counsellors: 'The Ghana school system now has a counseling depar tment, yes, so probably one of the first things you may do is t o examine the student critically and if you feel that he needs so me counseling, as a sort of first aid, you refer him to the counsellor. ' (Respondent 84.4, teacher, focus group discussion, district level) If teachers were unable to deal with the case throu gh these measures, they would refer on to the district hospital: ' I also think that, when as teachers we notice suc h behaviours, the first point of call is to contact the parents to fi nd out what is 163 happening, the way he child behaves, and to know th e group in which the child is moving. Sometimes, it could be t hat the child is on drugs, so when we contact the parents we will be ab le to know the sort of life the child lives in the house. If he ex hibits the same thing then we can advise, if it is beyond control, then h ospital has to take care of the child.' (Respondent 84.3, teacher, focus group discussion, district level) 'And what we do is that, we keep on monitoring. Any time the drug finish you see that the thing get worse, and they g et on to the drugs it subsides. So we do a lot of referral cases to th e hospital and also creating awareness, the parents together with the a ffected themselves.' (Respondent 84.9, teacher/school counsellor, focus group discussion, district level) Several teachers also mentioned making referrals to religious leaders such as pastors and imams. One school counsellor stated in the absence of support from central government, parents tended to seek the chea pest mode of treatment. As they may be required to pay for drug treatment at the ho spitals, they might prefer to send the child to a 'prayer camp' or other place for spi ritual treatment: 'I will say there is no support mechanism from the central government, we normally refer them. First of all we keep parents involved and we refer them ... let the parent either take them to the hospital or the pastors too...if the school has a cou nsellor, to the counsellor, in fact it will come either from right from the classroom to the counsellor, and the counsellor if he cannot sol ve the problem, get the parents involved, refer the person either t o the pastor, the Imam or the religious group, and the parents if the y can send the person for treatment at the psychiatric unit. Some times these days they find it the cheaper way by going to prayer cam ps. Most of the times they go to prayer camps because they find it difficult to go to the psychiatric units. Some will go but they tell y ou: \"They say the drugs are free, but you they say there are no drugs \". They say: \"When you go to Ankaful [psychiatric hospital] drugs are free, and I took my child there, no drugs. They say I have to g o and buy, so I 164 brought him back to the prayer camp.\" So there is n o support from either the counselling unit, the central government or whatever source, it is the parent who bears the cost. So in the school system there is no support from any quarters.' (Respondent 84.9, teacher/school counsellor, focus group discussion, district level) The teachers reported there were no special schools in the district. The nearest school for children with special needs is located a t Nkoranza. Supporting children with special needs within the mainstream schools wa s said to be very difficult because of the large class sizes and low numbers of teachers which are typical of Ghanaian schools: 'Because of the large class sizes, it is always a v ery big problem... They should have been handled and attended to indiv idually, but sometimes it is only few teachers who do that. For that reason we do not have them given the necessary attention.' (Respondent 61, manager, GES, district level) Whilst there are no formal programmes for mental he alth education for students, one teacher reported that the social studies syllabus w ithin the schools provides health education on some topics relevant to mental health such as teenage pregnancy, drug abuse and HIV/AIDS. Training Teachers reported receiving some training in child psychology within their basic teacher training. They did not mention receiving an y post-basic specialist training. However one education manager stated that the educa tion service provided training for teachers and parents in the causes of mental he alth problems: 'We try educating the teachers who are teaching the m and this we do it through workshops, seminars and we also move out to educate the parents about some of the causes of mental heal th problems.' (Respondent 61, manager, GES, district level) 165 Another manager mentioned that special education ha s been introduced within the curriculum of the teacher training colleges: '.... special education has been introduced so that t hey will know the causes of mental retardation, causes of deafness, c auses of blindness, and causes of maladjustment. All these s ocial issues, social vices and social mischief, they are trained to know that at the training colleges' (Respondent 60, manager, GES, district level) 3.7.4.2 Police A focus group was held with police officers from th e district, as well as interviews with a senior police officer at the district management level. Police officers defined the police role in mental h ealth as responding to three situations: a government request to detain a person , the request of the family for assistance in dealing with a mentally ill relative, or when a person with suspected mental disorder commits an offence. They were clear that outside of these eventualities they did not intervene: 'You see that one we don't get the specific powers. At times, it comes from the government, government can give the order that lunatics should be kept indoors, or let's say they should be confined. Then we go and do. Or when a family member of such a sickler [person who is frequently sick] comes in to say that in fact the brother or his relative is suffering from that and he want us to help him arrest him, chain him, cool him down, bring him to normal, to be sent to any of the psychiatric hospital. Or when he commits an offence, then he will be arrested because the law h as no respect that is what they say. So he will be arrested, and maybe when during his prosecution and it is learnt that his be haviour is not normal than they take him to hospital for examinati on. These are the three categories whereby police can come in. Apart from that when somebody is mad, he is mad. If he doesn't commit cr ime police we can't go in for the person unless government gives order or family 166 member brings him that he want to take him to asylu m or psychiatric then we assist or he commit crime.' (Respondent 87.2, police officer, focus group discu ssion, district level) 'The police, invariably we come into contact with m ental patients or people who have got mental derangement, or at least they are not able to think the normal way we expect everybody to think. Occasionally, it is either the families of persons who have such people in their family request for the police assis tance to send them to the mental hospitals because it is the request o f the family before such persons will be sent to mental hospital. The p olice cannot wake up and arrest anybody and send anybody to any place. It is based on the request of the family who knows that t hat person is being deranged. Maybe he is very violent and they c annot control him, and they request for the assistance of the pol ice and it is therefore their duty to ensure transportation from wherever it is to the mental hospital for the admission of that perso n for treatment. Then the second way one may come into police contac t will be maybe through criminal offences, maybe the person m ight have committed a crime, that crime the police may not kn ow that he is a mental patient but in the course of investigation y ou found that he is not normal. He is sent to court, the court will giv e an order that he should be sent to mental hospital for medical exami nation and report. Thereby the necessary treatment must... not just to be examined and report, but he has to be treated until he is to such a time that he is fit and qualify to stand trial, oth erwise he will remain in the mental hospital there until such a time that he is declared mentally fit. These are the means that through whic h we come... normally such persons come to our domain.' (Respondent 66, senior police officer, district lev el) The police stated that they supported families to a dmit a relative to hospital where the family require additional help. 167 '.... if the family see that they alone cannot do it without the help of the police and they need police assistance, well, t hat one, police assist them to send the person to the hospital.' (Respondent 87.1, police officer, focus group discu ssion) This respondent stressed that the decision to someo ne who had committed a crime to the psychiatric hospital rested with the courts, and not the police service: 'Any instruction for somebody to be sent to the psy chiatric hospital if he has committed offence is the court. I will not p ersonally instruct that he should be sent to the mental hospital strai ght away. He has committed offence we put him before court....,.' (Respondent 66, senior police officer, district lev el) Police officers reported having very limited knowle dge of current mental health legislation: 'A decree, you know we have not gone so much into i t, but yes I know there is a bill. But what we know so much is w hen somebody is mentally challenged in law, we can't prosecute t he person, so the appropriate thing to do is to advise the family to send the person to the appropriate quarters.' (Respondent 87.1, police officer, focus group discu ssion, district level) One senior police officer at the district level fra nkly reported having never seen the Mental Health Decree: Interviewer: 'There is a decree in Ghana that deals with mental health cases, that is the 1972 Mental Health Decree . Are you aware of the provisions of that decree?' Respondent: 'I'm yet to see a copy of it. I haven't seen a copy of it.' (Respondent 66, senior police officer, district lev el) One officer reported that the law allowed them to h andcuff those who were 'wild' when escorting them to hospital: 168 'When the person... you see that you can escort the p erson without handcuffing him you can do that, but if you notice that the person is so wild you can't escort him without handcuffing hi m, then that one, the law makes provisions that handling somebody you have to handcuff him.' (Respondent 87.1, police officer, focus group discu ssion) Police officers reported having no standard written guidelines on the management of people with mental disorders. They had received no training in mental health legislation, nor any training in identifying and ha ndling those with mental health problems. Rather they seemed to draw on experience in identifying and managing those they suspected of having mental illness: '....handling of mental patients and all these things is not our number one function, therefore you have just little knowledge about how... who is a mental patient, except that he comes and somebody identify him to you. The policeman cannot just on h is own identify him except maybe those who had been in the system f or a long period, that maybe knowing the mental psychology of human being, can know that this person is, physically or mentall y or spiritually, is not sane.' (Respondent 66, senior police officer, district lev el) '....we have not been trained like to identify people like that, but when here... or when somebody commits an offence and we are going for the person during maybe his interrogation here you may get to know psychologically that the person is ment ally ill or something like that.' (Respondent 87.1, police officer, focus group discu ssion, district level) 'You see there are no actual guidelines, all is usi ng your discretion.' (Respondent 87.2, police officer, focus group discu ssion, district level) 169 The police officers interviewed stated there is no dedicated budget within the police service for mental health. There are no allocated f unds for the police to send persons with mental illness for treatment. In this case the costs are met by the family: Respondent: 'For example if it is the family who ha s approached the police, it is the duty and responsibility of the fa mily to provide transportation. We are assisting, it is the respons ibility of the parents or the families who have identified that person to be a patient. He is wild, he is not able to be controlled by them, ther efore they seek police assistance. It is their responsibility to be ar the cost of transportation of the policeman together with the p erson involved to the mental hospital and bring the policeman back to his base. So this...except where is a criminal case and the court has given order then it means the police is responsible for transpo rting that person to the mental hospital.' Interviewer: 'So in that case it will be just part of the police resources that are there, there is nothing put specifically f or...?' Respondent: 'No, no, nothing is put in place that f or mental patients or people who are mentally sick or affected should be used in handling them or anything, there is nothing like th at, and I don't think I have heard of some in the system.' (Respondent 66, senior police officer, district lev el) Aside from the lack of funds, the distance of the p sychiatric hospitals from the district means that it is very difficult for the police to h elp people with mental health problems to access treatment: '...... if you are in the north or you are here and there is any such situation, you need to travel down south as you eve n mentioned earlier, and you know the cost of transportation an d other things. Those things and the... for example if every region t here were to be a psychiatric hospital, is easier. So such faciliti es actually don't exist, except you are very close to the south or where tho se things are. So it's difficult.' (Respondent 66, senior police officer,, district le vel) 170 Police officers reported that the difficulties in a rranging transfer to the psychiatric hospitals also lead to people with mental health pr oblems being detained in the police cells. They were aware this impinged on the person's constitutional rights, but felt they had little alternative, given the risk th at the person might offend if they discharged him back to the community: Respondent: 'You know some time when somebody is di sturbing in public, you have seen that he is mentally handicap, though the constitution provide for forty-eight hours for some body to be in cells, but when you see that he is so furious and even th e families agree that he is so furious, and maybe they are preparing to send the person to the psychiatric hospital, and maybe they are not having money at that short period, you can keep the person above that forty-eight hours. That one you are violating the p erson's right, yet there is no way out.' Interviewer: 'So assuming the person comes back nor mal and say that maybe you have kept him in prison for more tha n twenty-four hours. He is going to charge the police for that? W hat will you do?' Respondent: 'No, he can not, because it's the circu mstance that brought that, its the circumstance, you are mentall y... and when we leave you, when even you go, what about if he leave s here and he go and kill somebody in the family? If we are sayin g constitution allows for what and what, but you, your circumstanc e has make you..... that if we leave from here you could go and kill somebody. Should we allow that? We can't allow.' (Respondent 87.1, police officer, focus group discu ssion, district level) Police felt that a dedicated budget for mental heal th could help to improve the service for people with mental health problems: 'If we could have, have a budget for it, it could h elp us a lot because you know those people...it will help us by sending to the appropriate quarters for treatments, but because we don't have any budget for that, normally it becomes a burden. Even here when you keep such a person here you will have to feed the person with our own money' 171 (Respondent 87.1, police officer, focus group discu ssion, district level) One police officer also suggested that training in mental health should be provided as part of the training for police officers in Ghana: '.....if you want the police to play a major role the n it means the authorities responsible for health need to arrange with the police authorities to incorporate these type of training i nto our syllabus so that in the training schools they are given informa tion, they are given the necessary training as to how to maybe identify... .. and what measures even when you identify: how are you going to handle that person? Because where are the resources? Where are the facilities? Where will you take the person when eve n you identify? So that I think, that should be taken up by the aut horities' (Respondent 66, senior police officer, district lev el) 3.7.4.3 Social welfare Social Welfare was reported to cover three main are as: Justice and Administration, Child Protection and Community Based Rehabilitation (CBR). CBR included mental health within its remit. There are only two qualifi ed social workers in the district. The budget for social welfare comes from the District A ssembly. The social welfare department has a role in supporting those who are d estitute, however one worker reported that they struggled to meet their remit du e to the paucity of funds: 'But now we don't even have grants to the office, w e don't even have money. Even this papers we using, at times we buy them ourselves. There is no money, so nothing is being d one.' (Respondent 64, Social Welfare department, district level) Social workers estimated that between 10 and 15 cas es per month presented with mental health problems, and comprised about 25% of the caseload for disability. Social workers reported a complex process in access ing care and financing for those who presented with mental illness which involved li aison with a number of agencies from the police to transport services: 172 'The roles and services is not easy. What we normal ly do is, first, when we see any of such people and they are aggress ive, the first thing we do is we report to the police and we then leave with them, then we are able to administer the services. After that we report to the hospital for drugs. After that we have to...like I talk of the GPRTU [Ghana Private Road Transport Union], we have to contact them for vehicle, and then after that, that doesn't end, we have to contact the Assembly for financing because we will be ask to buy fuel whatever, whatever..... After that we have to co ntact the District Assembly if they will finance. After that the perso n is then sent to the psychiatric hospital. We trace for the parents if a child or the relatives if an adult.' (Respondent 64, Social Welfare department, district level) Patients who require inpatient care were reported t o be usually sent to Ankaful Psychiatric Hospital. In the case of children being brought with mental health problems, social workers would ask the parents to a ssist with medical expenses: 'If the child is brought here first, the first thin g to do is we take him to the hospital to find out whether there is something wrong with the mind. If we find out that there is something wrong with the mind, we then decide to see the parents because if the paren t is there and he is a child we ask him to bear all the medical expen ses. If we couldn't treat fine, then we know that we are taking the chi ld to the psychiatric hospital out of the district.' (Respondent 64, Social Welfare Department, district level) Social workers in Kintampo reported that there was a procedure for back referral from the psychiatric hospital when the patient was discharged. Social workers at the psychiatric hospital would inform them of the disch arge so that they could prepare the family for the person's return. Social workers identified a lack of funding and tra nsport, as well as poor intersectoral collaboration with the police for example, as const raining their ability to meet the needs of those with mental health problems: 173 'Okay here we put no.... because of financial constra ints and lack of means of transport, and we also lack information fl ow from intersectoral partners. Because at times the police have to feed us with some information but they will not do it, and if you ask them, they will not be willing to give you. Then also for example, I put health education and the police. There should be ef fective collaboration between the parties. Provisions of me ans of transport and modern technology where we have to source infor mation and adequate financing. So if we get all these it will go a long way to help.' (Respondent 64, Social Welfare department, district level) Social workers reported receiving training in ident ifying mental illness as part of their basic training. This respondent distinguished betwe en 'psychosomatic' cases, and 'wild' cases, which required seeking additional hel p: 'We have our own schools that teach us how to handl e clients of different kinds. Because we have those that have me ntal health problems, those who find difficulty in movement, di fficulty in seeing, and people have difficulty in maintenance and other things. So when you are in training that is where they will show yo u the kind of mental sickness. This man if psychosomatic patient you know he is not all that wild so you know how to handle him. Bu t when you get the wild ones you know the steps to take. So that i s the training they give to us.' (Respondent 64, social welfare, district level) However social workers had very limited knowledge o f mental health legislation and had received no training in this area. 3.7.4.4 Housing There is no government provision for specialist hou sing for people with mental health in Kintampo district. 174 3.7.4.5 NGOS There are no mental health NGOs operating in Kintam po North and South districts. 3.7.4.6 Traditional and faith healers There are many traditional and faith healers in Kin tampo North and South Districts. Among those who provide treatment for mental illnes s are ak\u00f4mfo\u00f4 (fetish priests or traditional healers), who are practitioners of the indigenous religion, and prophets or pastors of the Pentecostal or Charismatic churches (here described as faith healers). Some of these are known for their success in treati ng mental illness and have compounds in which individuals and their relatives may stay for several months. Interviews were conducted with two traditional heal ers, one Muslim healer, and two pastors who treat mental illness. In addition a foc us group was held with traditional healers. Causes of mental illness Many of the traditional healers saw the main cause of mental illness as being a result of a sin or a crime. In such cases confession was n ecessary for healing to take place: 'At times, it could happen that somebody might have gone in for another person's wife and then he will be struck by a juju, or somebody might steal another person's belonging, or it could happen that, as a result of some litigation, somebo dy may go mad. In all these, the person will have to tell what rea lly happened before we would be able to find the medicine for the cure. ' (Respondent 86.1, traditional healer, focus group d iscussion, district level) Faith healers also described spiritual causes for m ental health problems, though they also stated that some physical conditions such as c onvulsion, severe malaria and brain damage can cause mental illness. They identif ied the use of drugs and alcohol as another cause of madness: 'The smoking of 'wee', these days is also a factor. It is the most common cause. After smoking the 'wee', they drink akpeteshie in addition, why wouldn't they go crazy?' 175 (Respondent 86.7, traditional healer, focus group d iscussion, district level) Another possible cause was related to difficulties with emigrating: Respondent: 'Sometimes too some complain about loss of job, or especially, those who are bent on travelling abroad come here with difficulty of getting genuine papers. This can even make them mad.' Interviewer: 'Does it mean it is as a result of thi nking too much about the debt they may have incurred?' Respondent: 'Yes. They think about it. There is als o a situation whereby the person might have been repatriated back to Ghana. The person can go crazy by thinking too much about it.' (Respondent 70, pastor, healing church, district le vel) Initiation and Training Traditional healers usually receive their training through helping a parent, an uncle or a grandparent, or sometimes a non-relative, to harv est, prepare and administer medicinal herbs. In addition to this traditional he alers undergo an initiation ceremony with their mentor who gives them the mandate to pra ctice after their death. Such a person would continue to work under tutelage, and o nly assume independence after the death of the mentor. Most of the faith healers said they were inspired b y 'the spirit' or received a 'calling' to take up healing. Some reported that they became hea lers when they themselves fell ill, and after being healed through a church or a p articular pastor, they decided to take up healing and help those in similar situation s. These healers often trained under the pastors who treated them. This pastor des cribed his initiation thus: 'I was a Methodist by denomination and I became sic k. So I was roaming from one place to the other for healing up to the north. I went to a lot of spiritual churches seeking for hea ling. So when I heard about this church too I went there and the pa stor prophesized that one day I will become a pastor. Before I went to this church, I went to one fetish priest at xxx. When he carried h is gods he said 'A 176 man of God is here', and he mentioned my local name and told me that one day I will be a man of God.....' (Respondent 73, pastor, healing church) None of the healers interviewed specialised in ment al health problems; they all treated mental disorders as part of their general h ealing practices. Traditional and faith healers had no knowledge abou t the existence and provisions of mental health legislation and policy. There is a traditional healers' association in Kint ampo, although not all healers are members. Diagnosis of Mental Illness The diagnosis and treatment strategies differed con siderably among healers. Traditional healers would pour libation to invoke t he spirit of God and that of their deity of worship to guide them in the diagnosis and healing process. Many healers use observation to determine whether the person is suffering from mental illness, and they look out for dramatic symptoms of mental disor der such as hallucinations, delusions and extreme agitation as signs of the ill ness. Invariably, the healer would ask the patients to tell their story if they are ab le, as well as eliciting the history of the problem from the caregiver who usually accompanies the patient. The need for diagnosis is important, especially for those who ad minister herbs, so they can decide which herbs to use in treatment. One of the traditional healers uses a unique method of diagnosing mental illness by administering a herbal concoction to the patient on the first day of admission. If it is mental illness, the patient is sedated for three da ys and that enables the healer to make a definite diagnosis of mental illness. He is then confident to administer the herbal treatment. Faith healers would start with a prayer, and then l isten to the history of the patient's problem, either from the patient or their carer, be fore commencing healing activities such as prayer and fasting. 177 Treatment Strategies Traditional healers predominantly treat with herbs, usually introducing some unique strategies to distinguish their treatment. One trad itional healer for example treats patients with two different groups of herbs, depend ing on whether the patient is 'quiet' or 'aggressive': 'My grandfather taught me that when somebody comes with mental illness and he looks too quiet, there is a p articular root that we go to dig and cut it into pieces, boil it, administer as nasal drop and give him some to drink. Some too come here very aggressive, they too there are roots that we go for and administer it to him and he will sleep for a lo ng time and the aggressiveness will be cleared from his face an d before he wakes up he will be very calm.' (Respondent 75, traditional healer, district level) While some of the traditional healers stated that t hey learnt about the herbal preparations during their apprenticeship, some of t hem indicated that they need to consult the gods in respect of every patient that c omes for treatment in order to receive spiritual guidance for the correct treatmen t: 'Yes, we find out from the god and he in turn revea ls to us which medicine to use in curing a particular problem. The diseases are different so it is the god who reveals to us which medicine to use at every instance.' (Respondent 72, traditional healer, district level) 'The spirit can show how the person got the disease and also direct the type of medicine to be used to cure the disease . Every deity has its medicine that it uses to cure a particular dise ase. Apart from this medicine that is being used to treat this disease, the deity can show another medicine when a new disease is brought. The treatment depends on how you got the disease because we are g uided by it to treat the disease.' (Respondent 86.5, traditional healer, focus group d iscussion, district level) 178 Many of the Christian faith healers exclusively use d prayers and fasting for healing. The type of fasting prescribed depended on the seve rity of the condition and the modus operandi of the healer. Some involved moderat e fasting, which allowed users to break their fasts after midday. This type also a llowed the patients to drink water during fasting. At other times the patient may be p rescribed \"dry fasting\", which excludes the drinking of water during the fasting w hich often lasts from 6 am to 6 pm. The period of dry fasting could be for a few days, a week, or for 21 days. Fasting is normally done by the patient, or by both the patient and the caregiver. It can also be done vicariously by the caregiver alone , if the patient is not able to do the fasting. During these fasting periods, prayers are very intensive and emotional as the fasting periods are believed to be the peak periods for healing. Some of the Christian faith healers use items such as anointing oils and holy water to support the healing processes. Some healers also use herbs in combinati on with some of the above. Confessions of wrongdoing, whether recently or in t he past, is a key ingredient in healing for both traditional and faith healers. Som e healers insist on confessions as the first step, before they start the treatment: 'It happens that, someone may be a witch or has don e something wrong and as a result, has this problem. In that ca se, it is necessary for the person to tell the truth, before the right medicine to be given will be known.' (Respondent 86.5, traditional healer, focus group d iscussion, district level) Offerings of money and other items such as schnapps , and pledges made by patients to donate in cash or kind, are also believ ed to facilitate the healing process. Referrals Interviews with traditional and faith healers revea led that traditional and faith healers rarely refer patients to the orthodox practitioners . They gave three main reasons for this. The first reason is that they consider the un derlying cause of mental disorders to be spiritual. There was therefore no need to refer for orthodox treatment because the conditions are not medical conditions and will not respond to allopathic treatment. Another reason for non-referral to the hospitals wa s that in some cases the patient 179 had already visited the hospital before coming to t he shrine or prayer centre and had not responded to orthodox treatment. This confirmed the spiritual nature of the disorder and the need for spiritual treatment. The third reason given for non-referrals to orthodox medical practitioners was to do with so lidarity among traditional healers, who would prefer to refer to another healer than to a doctor: 'We the fetish priests, we are one, like the doctor s, and so when someone comes to me and I am unable to treat him/he r, I can direct the patient to another fetish.' (Respondent 86.2, traditional healer, focus group, district level) Many of the traditional healers said they would nor mally refer a patient to another healer when they found the condition very difficult to manage. Some said they would refer the person to a more powerful healer to take over the treatment process. Some said they would continue to treat the patient but w ould work alongside another healer who had more authority in an aspect of the patient' s problem. Others said they would combine spiritual forces with another healer for th e management of some patients especially in more complex cases. Some also stated that a deity may inform the healer to refer the patient specifically to another deity because that deity has the cure for that particular disorder. This may occur when t he healer is in trance: 'In the same way a doctor gives a referral note to a patient to take it to Techiman or Jema hospital, so can the deities also direct somebody to go to some places. For instance, it ma y say... if you take your illness to 'Akwatia Firi', it will tell y ou that, for that particular disease it does not have a cure and so t ake it to 'Kyiri Akyingye'''. (Respondent 86.5, traditional healer, focus group, district level) Some healers indicated that there were rituals that were performed to inquire from the deity whether they can cure the disorder or not , and the response should be affirmative before they start the healing process. One such means of identifying whether the healer can cure a particular disorder i s through slaughtering a chicken. The posture in which it dies indicates whether the healer is able to cure the disorder. If the healer is not able to cure the patient he ma y refer the patient elsewhere. There is a tendency for healers to consider that if a pat ient is not responding to treatment 180 the fault lies either with the patient or the heale r, and the healer will attempt to correct this rather than refer elsewhere. Some faith healers and traditional healers said the y sometimes advised patients to use orthodox medical treatment alongside spiritual treatment. One of the faith healers stated that he normally refers patients to the hosp ital to rule out physical conditions before he starts the healing process, and would enc ourage them to continue with their orthodox medication while he deals with the s piritual realm: 'Mental illness is spiritual illness. When somebody comes to me I first of all let him go to the hospital for treatme nt and when he comes back from the hospital I put him on fasting and pra yers. We fast and pray for him till he gets well.' (Respondent 73, pastor, healing church) A traditional healer stated that he would prescribe his treatment first, and then add the doctor's medication: 'When someone comes, the medicine that I first of a ll give to make the person sleep is not taken together with a docto r's prescription. After going through my initial medication, you can then add the doctor's prescription.' (Respondent 71, traditional healer) Traditional healers explained that whether a person could use traditional and biomedical treatment at the same time depended on t he type of medication prescribed by the doctor: Interviewer: 'Is there anybody who is on medication by the doctor and comes here for traditional medication and takin g both medications at the same time?' Respondent 86.7: 'Yes. We do allow them to take the medication at the same time.' Interviewer: 'Does this cause any problems?' Respondent 86.1: 'It depends on the medicine that t he doctor might have given to the patient. It could be a blood toni c or malaria drug. If you combine these drugs with that of traditional me dication, there is 181 that of traditional medication, there is no problem . If it is any other medication, then I will tell you to complete the do ctors' medication before taking the traditional medication.' Interviewer: 'Does it mean that, you believe that t he orthodox medication and traditional medicine can work togeth er?' Respondent 86.6: 'Yes, it can. Formerly, doctors di d not accept traditional medicine, but now, they have realized t hat traditional medicine can cure diseases. So we think that, the two can work together.' (Traditional healers, focus group discussion, dist rict level) However one healer stated that since 'white man's m edicine' and African medicine are completely different, they cannot be used simul taneously: 'I don't allow them to use the two medications at t he same time. When I give them medicine, I tell them to use mine alone at any point in time, and not to mix it with what the doct or gives them. The power in the Whiteman's medicine and the one in our s is totally different. So if you use mine and see no improvemen t, then you can go ahead and use the orthodox medicine.' (Respondent 72, traditional healer) Some religious healers expressed a willingness to c ollaborate with orthodox medical practitioners in meeting the spiritual and physical needs of patients: 'We do spiritual work and the doctors do the physic al work.....When someone comes here and the sickness is serious we r efer him to the hospital. So when we are working on the spiritu al aspect, the doctor will also be working on the physical. If the doctor fails then it is left with God.' (Respondent 73, pastor, healing church, district le vel) 'Those illness I try all possible means yet is not going, I advise them to go to the hospital so that the doctor can diagno se what is wrong with them. Because the medicines are the same so if someone comes here and is above my control I refer him to t he hospital.' (Respondent 75, Muslim healer, district level) 182 3.7.7 Summary There are very limited resources for meeting the ne eds of those with mental health problems in Kintampo North district aside from the district hospital. There is no dedicated budget for mental health and no mental he alth professionals in the district. Mental health was perceived to be neglected in heal th services in the district and there was very little data available on the extent of mental disorders. Health workers at the district level had virtually no knowledge of mental health policy and legislation, no specialist training in mental health, and no sup port from the regional or national level in supporting those with mental health proble ms. Nonetheless they attempted to manage the cases which came to health services usin g the limited resources available such as sedative medication, and referrin g to specialist services at the regional or national level. However they sometimes had problems with the supply of psychotropic medication and had no resources to ass ist families in escorting their relative to hospital. There was also limited commun ication with the psychiatric services which means that there is no effective fol low-up for patients once they are discharged. There is no programme for mental health promotion in the district. Low levels of literacy, particularly among women, and t he mixture of ethnicities and languages in the district means that some are exclu ded from access to information within health services. Health workers suggested that an outreach service f rom the psychiatric unit at the regional hospital could assist in developing the di strict capacity to work with those with mental health problems. Health professionals a lso expressed the desire for a CPN to be established in the district, or even an i npatient facility within the district hospital. Explanations for mental health problems at the dist rict level were similar to those elicited at the national level. They included physi cal, spiritual and psychosocial causes such as poverty, unemployment, stress and fr ustration, and the use of drugs and alcohol. 'Spiritual' causes such as curses or w itchcraft, were also seen as significant. Participants also highlighted perceive d gender differences in the experience of mental illness, with women seen as vu lnerable to stress and depression due to the inferior position of women in society, the burden of childcare, and marital problems. Men were seen as more suscept ible to peer pressure, and prone to madness or psychosis, both often linked to cannabis and other drug use. 183 Respondents saw an evident link between mental illn ess and poverty in the district. Poverty was seen to result in deprivation of the ba rest necessities of life, and thus to worrying or thinking too much which could in turn l ead to madness. Participants expressed a need to address the root causes of pove rty in order to reduce the impact on mental health. There was also an identified need for schemes to provide vocational rehabilitation and income generation. Th e mentally ill are reported to be heavily stigmatized in Kintampo district. They are seen to be violent and unpredictable and are often excluded from work, mar riage and family life. Participants suggested the need for education and s ensitization in order to tackle stigma in the district and enhance knowledge of men tal health. Interviews with participants from Ghana Education S ervice, the police and social welfare revealed a similar lack of resources for me ntal health within those services. In the education service, whilst national policy ha s introduced initiatives such as school counselors, these were seen to be of poor qu ality in practice. Teachers reported some training in psychology during their t eacher training. They addressed the needs of students with mental health or learnin g difficulties through engaging the family, referring to the school counselor and if ne cessary, to the district health services. They reported difficulties in meeting the needs of students with special needs, due to large class sizes and virtually no sp ecialist support. Police similarly reported restricted resources in d ealing with those with mental health problems. They were clear about their role and its limitations in supporting families in dealing with a disturbed relative or dealing with c riminal cases, however they had no training in mental health, and no guidelines in how to identify and manage those with mental disorders. They had virtually no knowledge o f current mental health law and no dedicated budget for mental health. The practica l difficulties in escorting patients the long distance to the psychiatric hospital means that there is often a delay in sending them. Police and teachers stated that in th e absence of resources for transportation, family members are most often left to escort their relative to hospital. Social workers treat those with mental illness as i ndigents or disabled. They also reported a paucity of funds to address the needs of those with mental illness. They described poor intersectoral collaboration, for exa mple in sending a patient to the psychiatric hospital. 184 Traditional and faith healers in Kintampo were fami liar with mental illness or madness which they described as the consequence of some imm oral behaviour, or as a result of physical causes such as malaria, and the use of drugs and alcohol. The main forms of treatment for mental illness involve the u se of herbs, ritual confession, and prayers and fasting. Healers receive training from other healers and pastors who serve as mentors, and rarely co-operate with health services in the treatment of mental illness. However some healers expressed a wi llingness to work in collaboration with biomedical treatment for mental disorder, with orthodox services addressing the physical problems, and traditional a nd faith healers treating the spiritual causes. 185 3.8 Service Users Unfortunately due to time constraints, no service u sers were interviewed at the district level in Kintampo North and South district . However data on the experiences of people living with mental illness in the distric ts is available from an anthropological study which is in progress. This includes interview s with people with mental illness and family members. Data from a preliminary study i s available which reveals a significant impact of mental illness on family life , financial circumstances, employment, marriage and child-bearing. Multiple he lp-seeking from traditional healers, churches as well as biomedical facilities is common (Read 2006). In 2007 a study was conducted with outpatients at A ccra Psychiatric Hospital on the effects of living with chronic mental illness (Depa rtment of Psychiatry, University of Ghana Medical School 2007). The study compared the experiences of patients living with chronic mental illness to those of patients li ving with chronic physical illness. Patients were interviewed by medical students as pa rt of their project work in psychiatry under the supervision of two psychologis ts, Drs Ofori-Atta and De-Graft Aikins, and the results presented at the Psychiatry Department's annual student conference. Out-patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, affectiv e disorder, and epilepsy were compared with out-patients living with diabetes and hypertension. The method was semi-structured interview focusing on the effect of the disorder on the individual's quality of life, his/her family, work and community relations. There were 10 patients for each diagnosis of mental illness, and 20 in eac h of the two groups with physical illness giving a total sample size of 70. There wer e 44 women and 36 men. The three groups living with mental illness were comparable i n age, level of education, and employment. 186 Table 9: Costs of Living with Illness Affective Disorder Schizo- phrenia Epilepsy Diabetes Hyper- tension Average number of hospital visits per year 11 9 9 6 10 Average time spent per visit 2 hrs 4 hrs 3 hrs 5hrs 3 hrs % admitted since illness started 40 100 40 25 10 Average number of admissions since illness started 3 3 9 1 2 Average duration of each admission 4wks 3months 17 days 10 days 5 wks Expenses on medication per year (GHC) (mode) and range 55 5 - 300 20 3 - 300 20 3 - 300 200 80 - 960 10 - 120 No formal statistical analysis was conducted to com pare the differences between the groups because of the small sample size. Patients visited the hospital almost once a month, except for those with epilepsy who visited 6 times a year on average. A greater percentage of those with mental illness had been admitted since the start of their illness than those with physical illness. Amo ng these, all those with schizophrenia had been admitted at least once. The average number of admissions since the start of the illness was highest among th ose with epilepsy and least for those with diabetes. Duration of admissions was not iceably less for epilepsy and diabetes. The cost of medication for diabetes was t he most expensive, followed by hypertension. Affective disorder, schizophrenia and epilepsy were less expensive due to the free treatment of mental illness in gove rnment hospitals. The experiences of more than half of those living w ith mental illness included poor self image as a result of stigmatization, poor soci al relationships leading to isolation, and lack of order in their life. They felt a financ ial burden from illness and all had been affected in terms of employment. 70% of those with schizophrenia were in blue collar jobs, mostly petty trading, and unable to wo rk all the time because of drowsiness from medication and symptoms of illness. They also experienced stigma. 187 They reported being mocked and looked at strangely. Among those with affective disorders, relationships had been adversely affecte d with two divorces among the group, and a report of disinterest in sex. They wer e accused of being lazy (in depression) or of witchcraft (in mania). Epileptics reported learning problems in school, and being mocked, insulted and ill-treated within their communities. People with diabetes and hypertension tended to be older and were supporting others financially. In general, for most of them, j ob performance had not been affected and there was no stigma associated with th e disease. For those with hypertension, physical constraints such as fatigue were reported by 50%. Chronic mental illness significantly affected the e ducation of patients as the illnesses started early in life, and lasted until adulthood. Patients with chronic mental illness also tended to be dependent on others. The study co ncluded that much stigma was associated with mental illnesses because these illn ess were viewed as mysterious and attributed to spiritual causes. A follow-up study in 2008 (Department of Psychiatry , University of Ghana Medical School, 2008), also conducted by final year medical students supervised by the same two psychologists, confirmed these findings. In thi s second study patients living with mental illness reported feeling stigmatized and als o said that their family members were stigmatized for having a relative with mental illness, with even their children suffering verbal abuse within the community. This s tudy concluded that it was more difficult to live with mental illness than with phy sical illness. 188 3.9 Key Issues in Mental Health Service Implementat ion in Ghana Respondents were almost unanimous in arguing for a move away from institutional care in the psychiatric hospitals, towards the prov ision of mental health services at the community level, alongside primary care. 3.9.1 Integration with primary care It was clear from both the WHO-AIMS and from the in terviews that despite some attempts to integrate mental health into primary he alth care delivery, the majority of mental health care in Ghana remains concentrated in the psychiatric hospitals: '...I am not sure how successful we have been in terms of trying to make mental health care delivery as part of the nor mal health delivery system. Because that is also one of the is sues that need to be addressed...... But the whole concept of having ment al diseases totally off the general hospital campus is in itsel f..... I mean in the past look at where our mental hospitals have being sited. Our mental hospitals are sited on the outskirts of town . I mean it gives the impression, you know, you must be out there. We ll now Accra has grown, so Accra psychiatric hospital is in the heart of the city, but the issue is that this used to be on the outski rt of Accra. Pantang is the same, Ankaful is the same, I mean, so that h as been the practice.' (Respondent 5, senior academic health researcher) Several respondents suggested the integration of me ntal health into existing public health initiatives in order to raise awareness at t he community level. It was reported that there had been efforts made to train non-menta l health workers such as Community Based Surveillance volunteers, and commun ity-based surveillance officers in mental health in order for them to be a ble to identify cases in the rural areas and refer them for treatment. In 1999 the Wor ld Health Organization piloted a scheme through the 'Nations for Mental Health' init iative to train volunteers to recognize signs and symptoms of mental illness and refer cases to the CPNs and 189 other mental health care providers. The scheme was piloted first in the Eastern region, and then extended to the Ashanti, Central a nd Greater Accra regions. The volunteers also provided follow-up for cases in the community to monitor relapse. Primary health care providers including medical ass istants, doctors, public health nurses and midwives, were trained in the management of psychiatric disorders (Asare 2003;WHO 2002). Whilst this project had some success in increasing the detection and treatment of mental disorders in the communities where it was implemented, the expected expansion of the scheme t o other districts did not take place due to lack of funding. One respondent suggested the use of CHPS volunteers to work in mental health: 'We are talking of CHPS and so CHPS, these people a re trained to be CHOs [Community Health Officers] . So what do they do? They stay in the community to provide health service at the doorstep of the rural folks and so if this person is trained in mental health nursing, then that person will be there to address that problem there.' (Respondent 31, senior academic psychologist) Another respondent suggested that public education campaigns on mental health could draw on lessons from campaigns on increasing community awareness and detection of HIV and AIDS: 'There must be a constant education like how they a re hammering on AIDS, the same thing too must be applied to ment al illness, the causes. And then people must be well educated: \"If you see a person behaving this way, report so, so and so, let or send the person to the hospital\". ...' (Respondent 21, programme director, MOH) Respondents recommended that effective treatment of mental disorders must be within the capacity of every doctor within district health services, rather than concentrated in the few specialists at the psychiat ric hospitals: '.... and at least every doctor must be able to help . It isn't necessary sending the person to the psychiatric hospital. If they are few as we 190 are saying, and someone is in Tamale and is involve d in that sort of thing and there is no vehicle or the parents cannot afford to send the person down to Accra to come and live here and get bored etcetera, then the person will be lost in society so every do ctor must be of help. Every single doctor must be able to help a m entally affected person to come out of the situation immediately. It is not the matter of sending the person to the psychiatric hospital.' (Respondent 21, programme director, MOH) Aside from increasing ease of access to treatment, the development of mental health within primary care would also remove some of the a ttendant stigma by preventing the need for patients to attend the psychiatric hos pitals: '...the moment you send somebody to the psychiatric h ospital and people see it that is the end. The person is stigma tized. That is what people say, he has been there before, and that can even worsen the case of the person. So my suggestion is that every doctor who is in the clinic or whatever can first, or let's say give first aid to suspected people who are about to have mental illness..... (Respondent 24, Ministry of Information) 3.9.2 De-centralisation and the need for community- based mental health services The need for a move away from institutionalised men tal health care and the development of community-based mental health servic es was widely recognised among participants. Previous attempts to develop de centralised systems of mental health care delivery have been implemented with add itional funding from external donors (as with Nations for Mental Health described above). These have shown some measure of success, but unfortunately were not sustained once external funding ceased, nor rolled out comprehensively to t he whole country. One of these initiatives took place between 1996 an d 1999 as part of a Health Sector Support Programme (HSSP) funded by the Danish Devel opment Agency (DANIDA). A programme was developed to integrate mental healt h services into primary health 191 care in the Upper West Region of Ghana. The first p art of the programme included the development of manuals (Ofori-Atta & Sefa-Dedeh & Ohene 1997) to train all senior and middle level health adminis trators in the region, as well as primary health care givers, such as doctors, nurses and psychiatric nurses. Following this there were workshops to introduce the concepts of community-based care, as well as the opening of a psychiatric wing in the re gional hospital. Community psychiatric nurses (CPNs) were employed in each dis trict who received quarterly supervisory visits from a psychiatrist and two clin ical psychologists from Accra. The final part of the programme included visits by the doctors, nurses and CPNs for further training and familiarization with psychiatr y at Accra Psychiatric Hospital. The programme lasted four years. During this time the v isits of CPNs into the communities ensured that many patients who had been chained to trees and walls were released as they were given medication which r educed agitation. However, epilepsy in both children and adults made up the hi ghest proportion of cases treated by CPNs. After the programme ended over the years many of th ose trained were gradually transferred to other parts of the country. For inst ance, the psychiatrist in charge of Ankaful was the general doctor in charge of Tumu di strict at the time and he had participated in the programme. However the regional hospital continues to be one of those in the country with a psychiatric unit, and t he concept of community psychiatric nursing is well established. The project also gene rated research into the use of alcohol in the region (Ofori-Atta et al. 2006), and patient-staff interaction as a measure of quality of care (Sefa-Dedeh et al. 2006) . Integrated primary and mental health care is thus a model which has been shown to operate well in different parts of the country at d ifferent times. However it has not always been sustained for long periods of time part ly because of insufficient funding, but also, as in the case of the HSSP, the lack of c ommitment to such a model of integration by the MOH. In this case, there was ded icated funding by DANIDA during the life of the project. However, after three years , the funds were placed in the common fund and MOH was expected to determine how t his budgetary support was to be spent according to its priorities. This model was allowed to continue but without the regular supervision of the consultants who had set it up and who had maintained the services and no replacements for these consulta nts were found to continue to provide support. Services in the Upper West Region then reverted to what pertains to 192 CPNs in the rest of country, that is no ongoing tra ining and support provided by psychiatrists and psychologists . Because of the demonstrated success of integrated p rimary and mental health care both globally and in such schemes within Ghana, som e policy makers and psychiatric professionals expressed their conviction that commu nity-based health care would facilitate the integration of those with mental ill ness into the community: '....we are saying that in this part of the world, we ll, we don't have... our health institutions are not that advanced, and things. Keeping people in institutions would only put more pressure on as it is, so whilst we can use the community system why don't we use that? Integrate them into society and then even support t hem because people are mentally ill really cannot work and then they are thrown out of jobs, and that really worsen it. So the comm unity mental health issue would look not only on their health, b ut even support them their well-being, their welfare, and that kind of thing and I think it is catching on.' (Respondent 16, World Health Organization) '.....what is actually the top priority is actually about decentralization and focusing on community mental h ealth, we want to actually look at mental health, not only in what I will call isolated institutions, we want to enter into the co mmunity and then what I will call de-boardinize the patients from th e psychiatric hospitals, settle them in their communities so that we can actually build the capacity of the carers to take care of th em in the community' (Respondent 10, programme director, MOH) This respondent talked about the need to 'take psyc hiatry to the people' through developing community-based services, rather than wa iting for patients and their families to approach the psychiatric hospitals: 'Now the idea of taking psychiatry to the people i n the village to my mind is the most important thing, because if you wait for them to come to the clinic for health they won't come be cause reaching 193 psychiatric hospital or mental hospital, Ankaful or Pantang or Accra they won't come because they think they are n ot sick. But if we take the psychiatry to them in the villages ther e are more places and explain to them some of the causes, some of the contributory factor to mental illness I think it wi ll be a very good policy in the mental health that we comes to what w e call the community psychiatry, in fact that is what I am tal king about, should be improved. Community psychiatry should be improved so that we take psychiatry to the people in the villag es and not wait for them to come to hospital.' (Respondent 56, psychiatrist) The development of community-based services it was suggested, might help to relieve the pressure on the psychiatric hospitals b y treating less severe mental illnesses in the community: '....we don't have enough counselling and treatment c entres in the country. I say so because most of the cases that co me to the hospital are not supposed to come if we have these centres around if we talk out of stress for instance to me, this s hould not be a problem that should be brought to the psychiatric h ospitals there is to me a minor case that can be handled at these cen tres if they are there.' (Respondent 22, accountant, psychiatric hospital) Whilst there have been some efforts to de-centralis e mental health into the regions, this was reported not to have been uniformly achiev ed across the country: 'We have over the years tried to decentralize menta l health which to some extent was successful in doing so. But the rec ognition of mental health in the various regions are not unifor m, they are not uniform, they don't accord them uniform status. You will find some regions where mental health is well embraced and ou r staffs there are integrated into the primary health care system, and you find places where mental health is not given the desired attention and leading to frustration among the personnel in those regions and districts' 194 (Respondent 26, senior psychiatrist). Respondents noted the unequal distribution of menta l health services between the north and south of the country. The absence of ment al health facilities and professionals in the north makes it very difficult for those outside of the southern part of Ghana to access specialized mental health care. This respondent in Kintampo, the demonstration district where at the time of researc h there was no CPN in post, argued for greater equity in the distribution of me ntal health services: 'Where are the mental health facilities in this co untry? They are all based in the south; Pantang hospital, Ankaful and t hen Accra, three okay? The whole of central Ghana, the whole of nort hern Ghana there is no facility. So when people are sick you n eed to...you can imagine, get them bundled, and then send them all t he way down to one of these facilities at the coast. They get ther e and they don't have families to support and life is... Why can't we decide as a country that in each of the ecological zones, the n orthern belt, the middle belt, the southern belt at least, such facil ities are sited? In this district, Kintampo district that we work, not even a nurse, a psychiatric nurse to care for any cases that come. So this clearly is telling you that there is lots of negligence agains t the mental cases' (Respondent 18, senior health researcher) Those community psychiatric services that exist are not efficiently run due to lack of qualified health professionals and material resourc es, such as the supply of medication and availability of transport. It was also observed that there was a lack of menta l health facilities outside the hospitals, such as 'half-way homes' and day centres , to provide rehabilitation for psychiatric patients to facilitate their return to the community and prevent relapse. Indeed there is little rehabilitation for inpatient s in the psychiatric hospitals to prepare them for returning home: 'Can you imagine? They just open the gates, psychia trists, open the gate, and say: \"You are free to go\". I don't think that is good enough, it is not good enough, they don't even have money t o take transport to wherever he is living. You don't expect the pers on to walk to 195 Nsawam. So certain prelims should take place, that is pre-discharge activities should take place. Is it going to be in the form of financial support or whatever? Find out what the person is i nterested in doing after leaving the premises. All that he proba bly has known for the past years is four walls, that the meals are re gular. Now you leave out of the gate he doesn't even know, is not sure of his next meals,. What do you expect him to do? ....... because t hese people are coming out to live with us in the communities a nd if you don't treat them right what is going to happen? They woul d definitely have relapse, they would be sent back to institutions, g overnment would pay more money for their upkeep when we could help to rehabilitate them and let them live decent lives' (Respondent 19, Department of Social Welfare) Several respondents suggested that more regional ce ntres for mental health care should be established, particularly in the north of the country: 'I'm suggesting that they open branch at every regi on, these psychiatric... if not a full a branch, a sub-station, because some of their family members, they want their family to be treated but at times, the whole house.... who is to bear the respons ibility? And even the transport from here to.... maybe as you sayi ng Ankaful, even they can't afford..' (Respondent 87.2, police officer, focus group discu ssion, district level) One respondent suggested that mental health units s hould be established within each regional health administration to oversee ment al health in the districts. One social worker cautioned that some families may be unwilling to receive back their relatives with mental illness due to stigma a nd suggested that this should be considered in developing community services. He sug gested a 'half-way home', where people could receive vocational rehabilitatio n in order to be able to support themselves in the community and reduce social exclu sion: 'They give wrong addresses most of the times and ev en where the addresses are accurate, you go there people are sti ll very 196 resistant, they are not willing to receive them bac k and that is very difficult to convince people that: \"Give this perso n a break. The person has been to hospital, this person is treated and is for you to further help with the rehabilitation process, we ar e doing our bit but the work is left to you because the person is come back to you to live with you in the community and the person must be treated with respect and love and affection let the person feel welcome back home, but the moment you start resisting, the momen t you start putting in rules again, they are going to have a re lapse\". And unfortunately many at times it happens they go ther e they are not welcome, nobody cares about their meals. I wish may be that is something we should be working on, both Ministry of Health and probably with this other ministry, talking about th e half-way home, half-way home, when people are about to leave they can probably go there and probably even learn a trade, a trade t hat they can go when they finally leave the scene they can make mon ey and live independent lives, because when they go back they h ave nothing to fall on, and you know the economic situation, pe ople are probably not just even willing, they said: \"Everyon e for himself, God for us all\". (Respondent 19, Department of Social Welfare) 3.9.3 Human resources for mental health Many respondents discussed the very low level of hu man resources in mental health, from psychiatrists to nurses and other health profe ssionals. Many psychiatrists, nurses and CPNs working in mental health services i n Ghana are nearing retirement, and there are no qualified staff to replace them. I n part the low level of psychiatric professionals was attributed to the 'brain drain' w hich was perceived to have particularly affected mental health, as well as sta ff attrition from mental health to general health care: 'In terms of service delivery I will say psychiatri c is lacking behind because most of our trained staff I think when you... is abroad they are paying more than what we are receiving here so most of our staff the brain drain is hitting us here I think ev en more than the 197 general side, and I think this one the human resour ces or the government should take this thing up, because it se ems if you go to the ward and you count the number of nurses and the number of patients the nurses are attending to it is woefully inadequate.....The skeletal staff itself - if we are supposed to have 10 nurses on the ward, you see, if we have 3 nurses and that is skel etal already. So where do we go? The skeletal is nothing. That means as for us if they are doing anything we don't enjoy because the nurses are limited, and then we have to kill ourselves to do a lot of work. Sometimes you have to forfeit your \"off\" because th e nurses are not sufficient, you have to stay in to help the patient s.' (Respondent 35.3, psychiatric nurse, psychiatric ho spital) The shortage of professionals within mental health services was seen to have serious consequences for the quality of patient car e: 'In the community and the institutions themselves, let me tell you, if you are caring for the mental patient, you must observe the behaviour of the patient, you must talk to the pati ent, talk to relatives, to be able to tap proper information to help you write best reports about the patient to the psychiatrist, to be able to know what type of treatment to be giving so the pat ient can recover early. Imagine a ward with about one hundre d and sixty patients with about four nurses, two nurses caring for such huge number of patients. What type of observation can yo u make? How many patients can you properly observe and write pr oper report about these patients so that it will help the psych iatrist or doctor to be able to determine what to do for this patient?' (Respondent 8, mental health NGO) The shortage of mental health staff is particularly acute within community psychiatric services, with no community-based psychiatrists and very few CPNs. This means that mental health care is largely curative rather than rehabilitative or preventative: '...the problem is that there are very few community psychiatric nurses, very, very few in the system. I know that w ith one areas their preventive aspect of mental health is the work of t he community 198 psychiatric nurses, apart from seeing to rehabilita tion after treatment, but they are in the community and they s hould be talking about educating people about drug abuse, and listin g of stress and things like that, but they're so few in the system. ' (Respondent 51, senior nurse educator, regional lev el) Only a handful of clinical psychologists, social wo rkers and occupational therapists and assistants are working in the mental health sys tem. Given the limited numbers of personnel, the ability to provide holistic care inc luding psychosocial interventions and rehabilitation is very limited: 'You see in psychiatry, psychiatry is a holistic th ing from the physical illness to the social aspect of it that is why our ancestors left us in tight link with occupational therapy, in tight link with rehabilitation, in tight link with social welfare department, all our institution have the social welfare department functioning in them, the interlinkage is so important but it is not functioning. Our own occupa tional therapy departments are functioning at very small percentag e. Our social welfare departments have been reduced to repatriati ng departments. Their duty is just to repatriate the p atient back home or we ask for fuel.' (Respondent 7, pharmacist, psychiatric hospital) Together with a lack of community services, this me ans that psychiatry is largely focused on inpatient care and the provision of psyc hotropic drugs. With no rehabilitation and few interventions to reduce the risk of relapse, the result is that many patients end up back in hospital: 'Our system is such that we are trying to use commu nity psychiatric nurses to trace the patient and try to see to their medication in the home, but that is not enough. The social aspect... ou r ancestors left us a system where we should have followed up with t he social aspect, rehabilitate the patient, see to the patien t that the patient is established in society. Now the whole system has fi zzled down to our use of the institution and drugs, stabilizing t he patient, sending the patient home and then we sit down and wait for the patient to come back. That is what we have been doing. So when you look at 199 our statistics we looked after about 46,000 patient s for the whole of last year, and out of this 46,000 patients about 4, 300 were new cases, the rest were all old cases, so that means t hey come go, come and go, that's all our psychiatric patients ar e doing.' (Respondent 7, pharmacist, psychiatric hospital) Respondents stressed the need to train more health professionals for mental health in order to reach those in the communities with men tal health problems: '....what I will like to plead to the government is a t least they should train more health professionals. So that all the di strict hospitals will have a psychiatric nurse like here what we do here when they come after now cooling them to a state which they can be referred to anywhere they can be treated. So if we have a psych iatric nurse or a health professional to take care of them at least the roaming on the streets will also be minimized.' (Respondent 85.4, nurse, focus group discussion, di strict level) It was reported that morale is low among workers in psychiatric services due to the lack of resources and the attendant stigma, and att rition is high. Indeed some respondents argued that it was difficult to attract doctors and nurses into psychiatry due to the negative attitudes of other health profe ssionals towards mental health: '....other doctors [....] they look down upon people wh o work in the mental health the way they do. It takes great... lots of courage to want to work in that field. So I just basically thi nk that is the attitude of the other health professionals, you know, they d iscourage anybody who thought about mental health from going to that field. The way they treated our nurses, is the case in poi nt, the way they talk about the psychiatric doctors is a case in poi nt. People come and they leave because some friends tell them: \"Why going to mental health?\", and they see the way hospital admi nistration, hospital authority treats mental health. Who wants to work with the area like that?' (Respondent 54, senior academic, regional level) 200 There was also a real fear of violence from the pat ients reported by some mental health professionals: 'You see people are not attracted to psychiatric be cause I have learnt from the students that when they come, these aggressive patients, how they attack even verbally and aggress ively, destructive, and all these things. When they come i n for their rotation they see this kind of action they fear, [... ...] and sometimes most of our patients have been maimed by these pati ent, whereby the labour organization doesn't give them enough co mpensation to keep them going, you see, so if you come to work an d somebody...I have a nurse who has got an eye defect because a pa tient slapped her and up till now the compensation the give her... ..and she is now squinting. So if you see such a thing and they tell you: \"This is what a patient did to the nurse\", do you thing she will come to psychiatry? It is a dangerous place, very, very dangerous place .\" (Respondent 35.3, psychiatric nurse, psychiatric ho spital) Community psychiatry was deemed to be particularly unable to attract staff due to the lack of resources, especially transport and the fea r of attack by patients: '....no transport nothing, rain or shine you are in i t, occupational hazard, a lot. Very, very risky. At times you are a ttacked by your clients. You see our clients are very good once the y know us, they accept us when we go, but occasionally one or two m ay relapse, you are not aware, you go home, the client has rela psed, you are not even aware so that you take precautionary measu res. So occasionally you can even be attacked you see' (Respondent 2, senior psychiatric nurse, regional l evel) In addition there is very little post-basic trainin g available for mental health professionals, and this means the standard of care continues to be compromised. The lack of resources, such as transport, also cons trains the capacity of mental health professionals to carry out their work effect ively: '....if you are talking in terms of knowledge, they n eed regular in- service training. They need to know much about the new drugs that 201 are coming into the system. They need more skills to handle.... and as I mentioned earlier, they need to be resourced i n terms of funds, vehicles, in terms of a lot of things, so that they can move out to reach people in the community who are having the pr oblems there.' (Respondent 31, senior academic psychologist) Specialist training in mental health is very limite d and mostly non-existent in primary care. Many nurses may complete their training witho ut having passed through any training in psychiatry at all, due to the scarcity of dedicated psychiatric units. This means that not only will they have received no prac tical experience in mental health care during their training, but that they will have received no exposure to mental health which might stimulate their interest in psyc hiatry as a specialisation: 'The issue is that when nurses are trained they are rotated. Now during their rotation they have to go through all t he programmes that take place in the health institution. I have alread y mentioned, apart from regional hospital no other hospital in this re gion does psychiatry. So if the person is not rotated at the regional hospital and he is rotated through a district, the person fi nishes his or her rotation without passing through the psychiatry. No w the idea is that when the person goes through all this rotation the person will be all round and then at a point in time the person will s ay: \"I love this place, I want to do further\", but if even the perso n wasn't taken through that place, the person has virtually no ide a. So the person may look at other specials, but not look at psychia try...' (Respondent 36, regional hospital administrator) One respondent suggested that the psychiatric hospi tals should be involved in training in mental health for general health care w orkers at the regional level: 'I think that, we should always collaborate with th e regional level, participate in their activities, and is even time t o ask them to organizing workshops so that the specialist here ca n go there to fellow doctors to talk to other health workers so t hat when they are receiving the mental patient they will know how to go about them because there are certain problems.' (Respondent 47, senior staff member, psychiatric ho spital) 202 Another pointed out the low number of psychiatric n urse training colleges in Ghana and suggested that training in mental health should be incorporated into nurse training schools in the regions: '...when we come to the psychiatric schools, we have Pantang and Ankaful. So the schools are not there. ...and even lo ok at the schools, the capacity, the infrastructure - inadequ ate. So even if now we can have within the schools in the regions, if we can have the number of schools we can't create, but we have some schools already. Then can we have some psychiatric courses there, you understand, or the courses we are doing now, can we have mental health taken broader aspect so that people can now come out as specialist in that area in the various schools in t he regions?' (Respondent 42, senior health educator) Another suggestion was that community psychiatric n urses should be trained 'hand- in-hand' with public health nurses. Nonetheless the numbers of training places within p sychiatric nurse training colleges and for medical assistants has increased considerab ly since 2005. The psychiatric nurse training colleges have also conducted some tr aining of cadres of mental health workers with shorter periods of training, such as n ursing aids. This has gone some way towards addressing the shortages of staff in th e last two years: 'In the past we were facing acute shortage of staff because staffs were running away to advanced countries for greener pastures. But thanks be to God, recently the nurses training coll ege here has started training mental health nurses and, luckily for us, come this September the first batch of about eighty will come out to augment the existing staff. And other paramedics are also b eing trained, like the health aids, which was recently trained about s eventy-five of them to help the existing run.' (Respondent 48, accountant, psychiatric hospital) However there are still challenges in retaining suc h staff, with high levels of attrition from mental health services, either abroad, or to o ther posts within general medical care in Ghana. Psychiatric nurses who train as medi cal assistants, for example, often 203 leave psychiatry to work in other areas of the heal th service after completing their training. 3.9.4 Intersectoral collaboration Respondents reported there is very little linkage b etween mental health and other related sectors, for example in education, the poli ce force and the judiciary. Even in the areas which were felt to be most closely affili ated to mental health, such as Social Welfare, respondents reported a lack of formal coll aboration, for example at the level of referrals and multi-disciplinary clinical work. It was recognised that without the collaboration of other sectors it would be difficult to implement mental health policy. Intersectoral colla boration, for example with the development sector, was seen to be essential in bro adening the mental health agenda to address not just the medical aspects of m ental disorders, but the socioeconomic consequences: 'I think the clearest deficiencies, or the most obv ious deficiency is the absence of an up-to-date mental health policy. Not just an up-to- date mental health policy, but a policy that demons trates linkages to socio-economic aspects of national development or n ational agenda.....But that notwithstanding, it is just at th e level of medical interventions, what happens and all that. So it nee ds to be extended to include issues of governance, to include issues of the GPRS [Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy] , to include issues of education and what types of life skills education that people need to know as part of their personal development and goals. ' (Respondent 57, director, mental health NGO) There is also a lack of intersectoral liaison of me ntal health with the treatment of other health disorders, despite the evident psychol ogical effects of many physical conditions: Interviewer: '.....what is the extent to which mental health is related to policies from other sectors like HIV, malaria, T B, do we have those intersectoral links?' 204 Respondent: 'That is one thing that I think cries f or help. Many the people who are going to have these illnesses will h ave psychological problems alongside. Yet the collabora tion, the liaison between us is minimal. So there is not that collabo ration, inter- sectoral means or links at all.' (Respondent 54, senior academic) Participants expressed the need for education and s ensitization on mental health for those working in sectors such as education and the police. Others suggested the need for mental health workers within schools. Since they are working in the grassroots communitie s, CPNs were seen to be key workers in developing collaborative ways of working across all sectors, from traditional and faith healers to the police: 'Now if you trained enough community psychiatric nu rses who will be able to assist churches or prayer camps wherever they are treating patients, who will be able to assist nativ e doctors who are treating mental patients, help them to see how best they can go about these things. From the grassroots we will be able to progress gradually and reduce the incidence of these conditi ons before they reach the regional level.....And if you are in the co mmunity too, the right of the patients is to be explained so that mo st of the patients will not be maltreated. If they are in a community they will be able to help even the police to know that: \"Yes this man ha s committed a crime but we know he is psychiatric patient so this what he needs, this will help him\".' (Respondent 55, senior psychiatric nurse, regional hospital) 3.9.5 Implementation of mental health policy and le gislation The initial findings from the WHO-AIMS data indicat e the existence of an outdated mental health policy as stated above. A new mental health bill has been drafted to replace outdated legislation. The new law is in lin e with WHO guidelines on best practice, however it is yet to be passed. Participa nts felt that the implementation of the law would be an important step forward in provi ding a mandate for quality mental 205 health care in Ghana and the protection of the huma n rights of those with mental health problems. However whilst several respondents felt that the new mental health bill addressed many of the deficits in mental healt h care in Ghana, including regulating traditional and faith healers, and addre ssing stigma and social exclusion, some expressed scepticism as to whether there were adequate resources, as well as the political will, to implement the bill once it w as passed. A repeated theme among participants is that there is often a gap between p olicy or legislation and its implementation in practice due to a lack of politic al commitment or resource constraints: 'The problem in Ghana, and it cuts across, the poli cies will be formulated but the implementation becomes always a problem in every sector. So I'm not surprised that in psychiat ry some of these policies they are very nice, nicely framed, but to implement them, some of them, the problems, you understand? There i s not much education on mental health nursing to the ordinary Ghanaian, you understand? And even policy implementers, people ar e not really well informed about mental health programmes. So yo u find out that even though the policy is there, people will find i t difficult to implement them.' (Respondent 38, psychiatric specialist) Several respondents indicated that even the current mental health legislation which has been in existence since 1972 is not being fully implemented, partly due to a lack of awareness of the law. Suggested barriers to policy implementation were a lack of financial and human resources, poorly defined policies, stigma, and the absence of logistical support to carry out policy directives: 'In the regional level, when the policies are out, from my experience what happens is, you will be there, and you are tol d, or you get a letter that new directive or new policy is being im plemented, and this is what you are expected to do. So before that impl ementation you will not be given any logistics.' (Respondent 55, senior psychiatric nurse, regional hospital) 206 'One is that the policies in mental health are not very clearly defined. In fact it is only recently that even the bill, mental health bill is being proposed to parliament. I don't even think it has moved from cabinet to parliament level and so that is the case . The absence of a framework for mental health service is definitely a barrier. The manpower resource available is obviously limited, b ecause not too many specialists are in that area. Very few people are interested in that. The stigma attached to the mental health defi nitely is also a barrier. And then for funding for various services is also a barrier.' (Respondent 12, programme director, GHS) Some respondents highlighted the need for intersect oral collaboration and education in implementing policies. They commented on the fai lure of policy makers to communicate policy decisions at the grassroots and to educate those responsible for implementing policy: 'The first barrier is actually finance, how to get the funds and carry out this activities is a problem, the second one is lack of education. At the community level they are not educated, we ne ed to educate them to understand. And then collaboration. At time s there are other sectors who provide health care but they don't work together, [.....] lack of communication is also a factor. So is about financing, and lack of education, and communication.' (Respondent 47, hospital administrator, regional le vel) '...most of the time policies do not get implemented because of sometimes vested interest [....]. Secondly, there cou ld also be a lack of consultation, a lack of consultation among key stakeholders such that one major block is left out and they feel very peeved and so even if it is a good policy they will make it seem bad so that everybody will know how important it was to have...do ne something about it. The third thing is communication. Sometim es the policies are not well communicated, the dialogue, the implem entation stage, the communication to go with it is so poor that peo ple do not even see the need for it. The final thing is also to do with ignorance. People actually do not know and so they don't even know that there is a need to do this, this way or that way, and in Ghana generally 207 there is lot of apathy, people do not willingly com mit themselves to a course unlike other places where people will say: \" We believe in this\". (Respondent 36, administrator, regional hospital) Respondents pointed out the need for training if po licies were to be implemented effectively: 'If you want to implement policies, if it is new, y ou must give the officers again some kind of re-orientation about th e whole policy, the officers must know what is expected of them. You ju st don't shove it down their throat if they don't know what the whole thing is all about. ' (Respondent 19, Department for Social Welfare) Others expressed fears that the stigmatization of m ental health might also present a barrier to implementing mental health policy and in tegrating mental health into public health: '....not all the people who are interested in mental health, especially most of the public health doctors, people who study public health, you mention mental health and you are just ignored because you're not dealing with good people or normal people, so t hey try to stigmatize the institution' (Respondent 13, Health Research Unit) It was suggested that there should be greater consu ltation with those responsible for implementing policy at the grassroots level in orde r to discuss any barriers to implementation, and gain greater cooperation in imp lementing them: 'So before this document comes in and given you the order that you should implement it, there should be some kind of w orkshops so that people will meet each other in a think tank si tuation where you know that this is what they are going to implement and from what I see this is the problem which we are going to face... ...Now if all those people who are part of the policy.... implement ation of the policy undergo such workshops over time and they ar e allowed to 208 express themselves freely: \"What do you see as a pr oblem? What do you see as the way forward?\", probably an amendm ent or modification could be done on the policy which is g oing to be implemented ' (Respondent 55, senior psychiatric nurse, regional hospital) However, despite the barriers to mental health poli cy implementation, it was acknowledged that some moves towards developing men tal health services in Ghana had already begun with the opening of regional psyc hiatric units and the drafting of the new legislation. Therefore structures are alrea dy in place onto which it is hoped the new services can be grafted: '....we are not taking off from zero, the structures are there already and we are only trying to improve upon it, and I th ink the government has also recognized mental health as a p riority in the next Programme of Work, so I think some resources w ill be put in the place.' (Respondent 16, World Health Organization, nationa l level) 3.9.6 Summary The potential benefits of moving mental health care away from the psychiatric hospitals and into community-based services was rec ognised by almost all participants. However it was felt that currently me ntal health was poorly integrated with primary care, and mental health service delive ry remained centralised within the psychiatric hospitals. It was suggested that mental health care could be incorporated into existing public health initiatives such as CBR (Community-Based Rehabilitation) and CHPS and that all primary care doctors should b e able to treat mental illness, particularly less severe conditions, such as modera te to mild depression. This would help to remove some of the stigma associated with a ttending the psychiatric hospitals. Some respondents supported the need for public education to promote mental health at the community level. Respondents commented on the value of community-bas ed mental health care in supporting the integration and rehabilitation of th ose with mental health problems. However the decentralisation of mental health care was acknowledged to be only 209 partially achieved, with an unequal distribution of regional psychiatric units across the country with the north remaining the most neglected area. Community mental health services which are in existence are often restricte d in the quality of the service they are able to deliver due to a lack of sufficient sta ff and resources. There are almost no facilities for rehabilitation in GHS in the form of rehabilitation units (half-way houses) or day centres. There are limited numbers of mental health professi onals, and many of those who are currently employed are due for retirement. Ther e are very few psychosocial health professionals such as psychologists and OTs. The 'brain drain' has also had a severe effect on the retention of health care worke rs in Ghana, particularly in psychiatry. Low morale, fear of violence from patie nts, and the stigma towards mental health means it is difficult to attract heal th workers into psychiatry. The lack of personnel and the limited amount of post-basic trai ning means the quality of mental health service provision is severely compromised. M ental health care remains largely curative with very little focus on rehabilitation o r relapse prevention. Participants identified the need to develop more re gional units for mental health as well as rehabilitation facilities to promote social inclusion. There is a need to train more health professionals, and to provide training for primary care workers in mental health. There is little intersectoral collaboration in ment al health between stakeholders such as the police force, the judiciary, social welfare and education. There is also limited liaison with those providing general health care to the mentally ill. Intersectoral collaboration was seen as essential for the success ful implementation of policy and to address the socioeconomic consequences of mental illness and participants identified a need for education and sensitization i n mental health across all disciplines. CPNs were seen to be crucial in develo ping intersectoral links at the community level. Many respondents expressed support for the draft me ntal health bill which it was felt promoted quality mental health services at the comm unity level, and the protection of the human rights of the mentally ill, and urged tha t it should be passed into law. However many also expressed some concern about how far the bill would be implemented once it was passed into law. Possible b arriers to policy implementation included a lack of human and financial resources, s tigma towards mental health, a 210 lack of political commitment, and a failure to comm unicate policies to those responsible for their implementation. In order to e nhance the implementation of policy, participants stressed the need for intersec toral collaboration and consultation, as well as education and training for health care w orkers and other stakeholders. 211 3.10 Research There is very little published research in mental h ealth in Ghana and no dedicated journals for mental health. Between 2000 and 2005, 3 articles were published on mental health in Ghana as identified on PubMed. The se were a survey of resource utilisation for mental disorders (Ferri et al. 2004 ), a survey of help-seeking behaviour for mental illness in Kumasi (Appiah-Poku et al. 20 04) and an overview of the mental health situation in Ghana (Roberts 2001). This repr esents about 1% of all articles on health in Ghana as identified on PubMed. Other arti cles on mental health were published in journals which are not part of PubMed, including the Ghana Medical Journal. These include a survey of the use of tradi tional healers for mental health (Osei A 2001a), a study of depression among those a ccused of witchcraft (Osei A 2001b), a study of the prevalence of psychiatric di sorders in an urban community (Osei A 2003), and a study of drug compliance among psychiatric patients (Mensah & Yeboah 2003). There was no research on biology an d genetics, policy and programmes in mental health, nor on financing and e conomics. Since 2005 there have been some research publications in indexed jou rnals on homelessness and mental health in Accra (De-Graft Aikins & Ofori-Att a 2007), and on family carers of people with mental health problems in rural and urb an areas of Ghana (Quinn 2007). Mental health is not a priority area for research i n the three health research institutions in Ghana. Currently only one out of th e three health research institutions in Ghana is involved in community-based mental heal th research. This includes risk factors for schizophrenia in rural Ghana (Doku 2005 ), validation of postnatal depression screening measures (Weobong et al. 2008) , psychiatric disorders in the elderly (Akpalu et al. 2007), and an anthropologica l study of living with mental illness (Read 2006). One respondent noted that the lack of research in m ental health constrained the capacity of research to influence policy. He noted the lack of research capacity within mental health in Ghana due to the lack of personnel : 'I'm afraid to say this but there is not a whole lo t of research going on in mental health. For one thing for lack of pers onnel we do not have the people who have the capacity to do the res earch in the area of mental health. So I'm sure the little that goes on makes some impact with us but is not the whole going on s o is hard to tell.' 212 (Respondent 54, senior academic researcher) Research priorities in Ghana may also be driven by external agencies who provide the majority of research funding: '.....I think for those in research without them [NGOs, donors] we don't exist because we don't get...we get very little support from our own governments. If you take this centre for instan ce we depend on donor money. So they are extremely important.' (Respondent 18, senior health researcher) Some respondents acknowledged the need for research in mental health in order to promote evidence-based practice. However one senior researcher highlighted that research within Ghana was only one method for gener ating evidence for health care policy. Health care policy could also be based on c omparable research from outside, as well as best practice: 'Evidence generation is not only through systematic research. Research is one form of generating evidence, but th ere are several things: anecdotal evidence can be made available th rough people's observations and all that. So as much as possible w e try to ensure that the policies that we formulate are based on ev idence. The evidence is not necessarily generated from in-count ry. If there is ample evidence from the literature from studies tha t have been done in several parts of the world that have a very simi lar situation that we have, we don't need another set of evidence before we can do that...... so the issue is: what is the best practice? And the best practice as we know historically, anecdotally and a lso from what do we call it.....from research as well, so it is combin ation of issues......I mean research in an ideal condition is di fferent from implementation. So these are the things that one ne eds to bear in mind when we are talking about evidence. But as muc h as possible we try to make up policies based on evidence that i s available.' (Respondent 5, senior health care researcher) Despite the presence of formally defined lists of i ndividual data items that ought to be collected by all mental health services, the extent of data collection is variable among 213 mental health facilities. The government health dep artment received data from the 3 psychiatric hospitals, 4 community-based psychiatri c inpatient units, and 64 mental health outpatient facilities. This participant noted the lack of efficiency and r eliability in gathering data on mental health in Ghana which impairs the ability to argue for greater priority for mental health: 'Evidence, the statistical collection of data itsel f has a problem, we don't have a statistical data bank that we use in c onvincing people because psychiatry in this country is about 100 yea rs old yet still it's always been sidelined. It has not been run at that meticulous efficient manner in which we have a database for ar guing our things out. We always use the obvious, observed, t hat is what we do. But we don't as yet see a database, our record department itself even is not on its feet. Figures coming out from those places can easily be challenged. We have the three institu tions. We don't have coordinated records department. The activities are not well coordinated, we have not built the base for making argument from that angle.' (Respondent 7, pharmacist, psychiatric hospital) However one participant pointed out that even when data was collected it did not seem to influence policy as resources remained far below what was indicated by the data: '....looking at our data, the number of patients th at pass through our hand every week, every month and quarterly, you can find out that if they have been using the evidence here they will give us more doctors, more psychologists.... (Respondent 1, senior nurse, psychiatric hospital)' One psychiatric health professional complained that although plenty of research may be done, few of the results were disseminated for t he development of mental health: '... sometimes this kind of research is done everywhe re, day in, day out, we do the research, but we don't find anything coming from it. It 214 is kept in the shelves and even no books come out f or people to know that this is such a kind of research has been done for the benefit of the patients and improve staff knowledge . I think this research something should be done about it and prin ted out, whether giving handouts for people to know what is happening, rather than keeping all that research that we do, k eeping under the shelf and nobody sees anything about it.' (Respondent 35.3, psychiatric nurse, focus group di scussion, psychiatric hospital) 3.10.1 Summary Whilst participants noted the need for research on mental health in Ghana, including the maintenance of accurate data within psychiatric services, it was evident from responses together with the Pubmed search that ther e is limited research activity on mental health in Ghana. Data collection within psyc hiatric services is neither systematic nor comprehensive. Therefore there is a lack of reliable data on mental health to inform the development of mental health s ervices. What research is done is not sufficiently disseminated and taken up in polic y. 215 4. Discussion 4.1 Context Participants situated mental health care within the context of current health policy emphasising the 'doorstep delivery' of health care at the community level. Public health provides a model for how mental health care might be delivered in Ghana, involving community stakeholders from local health care personnel, to traditional authorities and family members. Yet existing struct ures for public health initiatives often exclude mental health from their agenda. None theless the need for mental health promotion and education in improving the hea lth of the nation was acknowledged by many participants in this study. Participants also recognised the unequal distributi on of health care resources within the country. The rural areas of Ghana, particularly those in the north, are those which suffer from the highest levels of poverty. 45.4% of the population of the rural savannah areas of Ghana are estimated to be living in 'extreme poverty' as compared to 2% in the urban coastal areas (Governme nt of Ghana 2007b). Mental health service delivery is itself concentrated in t he urban areas of the south which have the highest number of facilities and health pr ofessionals. If mental health care is to reach the poorest sectors of the population then it is these regions outside of the cities which need the greatest concentration of res ources. The Ministry of Health has explicitly linked improv ing the health of the nation to economic development stating its commitment to impr oving human capital by \"creating wealth through health\" 2. However despite growing evidence of the link between poverty and mental illness, respondents obs erved that mental illness remains excluded from the development agenda. Given the high burden of disease in the country, mental health competes with conditions such as malaria, HIV, tuberculosis and other conditions with potentially high mortality and morbidity. Yet many of these conditions have potential consequence s for mental health, and mental health itself increases the likelihood of poor phys ical health (Prince et al. 2007). 2 Quotation taken from the website of GHS www.ghanahealthservice.org 216 WHO's mantra of \"no health without mental health\" d oes not appear to be widely acknowledged in the prioritising of health funding in Ghana. The need to promote and protect the human rights of the mentally ill was another topic discussed by many participants, who noted the widespread abuse of the mentally ill in Ghana. Unfortunately, this is not l imited to traditional or faith healers, but extends into the psychiatric hospitals themselv es. Yet as with development policy, mental health does not appear to be central in human rights promotion in Ghana. Current mental heath legislation does little to protect the rights of those with mental illness and existing human rights bodies in Ghana such as the Commission for Human Rights and Administrative Justice do not prioritise human rights abuses against the mentally ill in their activities. Whils t traditional and faith healers were acknowledged by participants to play a valuable rol e in psychosocial and spiritual treatment for mental disorder, the mentally ill are often subject to abuse whilst in the care of such healers. Many of these abuses remain u nreported and in the absence of any system for monitoring and regulating the activi ties of healers, the mentally ill continue to suffer in silence, many hidden away in prayer camps and shrines. Regulation of healers would not only help to protec t the mentally ill from abuse, but also open the way for collaboration between traditi onal and faith healers and biomedical practitioners, drawing on the respective skills of each. 4.2 Mental Health Situation in Ghana Responses indicated that mental illness in Ghana is widely associated with the abuse of drugs, in particular cannabis. This has implicat ions for the public perception of mental illness, since drug use is morally sanctione d and its association with mental illness can lead to the mentally ill being viewed a s criminal and morally suspect (Gureje et al. 2005). This perception is often rein forced by spiritual interpretations of mental illness in which it can be seen as retributi on for immoral behaviour. Mental illness is also associated with aggressive and viol ent behaviour and there is widespread fear of the mentally ill. This associati on of mental illness with madness and violence, means that 'quieter' forms of mental illness may be overlooked, whilst the more florid forms of psychosis are quickly take n to hospital. This has consequences for the mental health of women who are seen to suffer more from depression as a result of marital problems, the str esses of providing for children, 217 discrimination and domestic violence. The role of s ocial factors in the aetiology of depression in women (Turkson & Nortey Dua 1996) may mean that their mental health needs receive less attention within mental h ealth services, and it is likely that many of those suffering from depression and other c ommon mental disorders receive no treatment from mental health services. Respondents acknowledged that mental health is seen as a low-priority area within the health system in Ghana as compared to other are as of health care delivery in the country. Responses suggest that given the high dise ase burden in Ghana and the competing demands for resources, mental health stru ggles to be included in health care priorities. However policy makers recognised t hat mental health places a considerable burden on individuals, their families and society, and that there is a large unmet need for quality mental health care. Th e low priority of mental health has implications for the allocation of funding, and the provision of services. Raising the priority of mental health in the context of limited resources presents challenges to ensure that funds are directed towards those who ar e most in need. High quality mental health care would ultimately prove more effi cient through reducing the rates of readmission, preventing relapse, and addressing ris k factors for mental illness. The need to address the 'vicious cycle' of mental h ealth and poverty (Patel 2001) was recognised by participants. Several participant s suggested that poverty could lead to 'thinking too much' which could in turn lea d to mental illness, thus suggesting an association between poverty and depression and a nxiety. Tackling poverty and mental health go hand in hand, since the effects of mental illness can reduce productivity. Improving the person's ability to ret urn to supporting themselves and their families has economic benefits for the indivi dual and the community. As this study shows stigma towards mental illness i s pervasive in Ghana and has lead to the exclusion of those with mental illness at all levels of society. Many of the participants themselves showed stigmatizing attitud es towards the mentally ill, especially towards vagrants who were seen as making the streets dirty and unsightly. Stigma contributes to the continuing low priority o f mental health and to the morale of staff, who feel ostracized by fellow health profess ionals. Stigma impinges on the human rights of the mentally ill, yet tackling stig ma in mental health can be notoriously difficult (Crisp et al. 2000). However campaigns have already commenced through NGOs such as Basic Needs and Mind freedom to enhance the 218 acceptance of those with mental illness within thei r communities and to promote social inclusion. The involvement of users of mental health services in policy-formulation is key to creating policies which meet the needs of those aff ected. However such is the stigma towards mental illness that such consultation proce sses rarely occur. There is a need for advocacy organisations who can promote the invo lvement of those with mental illness and their families at all levels of mental health policy and planning. 4.3 Process of Mental Health Policy and Law Develop ment Responses indicated that the gap identified by part icipants between ideology and practice in policy-making was replicated in the dev elopment of mental health policy. Whilst the formulation of mental health policy rece ived a high level mandate from government, there has been a failure to conduct con sultations with grassroots stakeholders, in particular with users of mental he alth services and their carers. Consequently those responsible for implementation, particularly at the district level, felt excluded from the process of policy developmen t and so may be less likely to be committed to implementing policy directives. There was also a lack of intersectoral consultation at the ministerial level which comprom ises the involvement of other agencies in mental health care initiatives and may also make them less committed to their implementation. However the draft mental health bill was praised by participants for the extensive consultation process in its development and sets a standard for processes of consultation in the formulation of policy and legis lation that could work as a model for other countries in the region. 4.4 Appropriateness of Mental Health Policy and Law Current mental health policy and legislation were a cknowledged to be out of date and failing to meet standards for best practice in ment al health. Despite long-standing commitment in mental health policy to the principle s of decentralisation, the development of community-based mental health care, and the training of mental 219 health professionals, there has been only limited p rogress towards these goals. There appears to be have been insufficient attentio n to the sources of funding to meet the objectives of mental health policy. The Mental Health Decree which provides the current legal framework for mental health in Ghana has no provisions to promote the ri ghts of those with mental health problems and makes no reference to the provision of community-based services. The new mental health bill should be passed a matter of urgency as this would be a major step in providing the legal backing for mental heal th policy, and provide a mandate for the development of community-based services. It would also establish the necessary monitoring of mental health service provi sion to protect the rights of patients and their carers, particularly those under involuntary admission. In addition it would make provision for the regulation of traditio nal and faith healers. The passing of the mental health bill therefore should be the f irst step in enhancing mental health care delivery in Ghana, bringing mental health legi slation into line with international standards on human rights and best practice in ment al health. Several policies and pieces of legislation which ha ve recently been introduced in Ghana are directly relevant to mental health care i n Ghana such as the Domestic Violence Act and the Disability Act. However this l egislation makes very little explicit reference to mental health and mental health is not generally recognised as falling within the scope of terms such as 'disability', 'vu lnerability' and 'social exclusion'. Therefore existing policy and legislation which cou ld work to promote the human rights of the mentally ill is not implemented. Ment al health is also not included within poverty alleviation policy, despite the fact that t hose with mental illness can be some of the most excluded and impoverished members of so ciety. 4.5 Mental Health Implementation at National and Re gional Levels Mental health care provision in Ghana remains highl y centralised, with the majority of mental health expenditure being absorbed in the upk eep of the three psychiatric hospitals. The position of the Mental Health Unit w ithin the Institutional Care division, highlights the historical legacy of mental health c are in Ghana, where asylums still function in part as custodial institutions, as witn essed by the high number of long-stay 220 patients, including many detained by order of the c ourts. Community-based mental health services, such as rehabilitation or vocation al training centres, are unavailable to the majority of those with mental health problem s. There are insufficient numbers of mental health pro fessionals at all levels of the health care system, with most concentrated within t he psychiatric hospitals. This means there is limited availability of specialist m ental health care in much of the country, especially outside of the southern regions . The paucity of mental health professionals has implications for quality of care and the safety of staff and patients. The lack of professionals with training in psychoso cial interventions such as psychology, social work and occupational therapy, m eans that there is very limited provision of psychosocial care and rehabilitation. The high numbers of long-stay patients reflect the need for rehabilitation to ena ble some of these to return to the community. Psychotic disorders are reported to be the most com mon diagnosis in the psychiatric hospitals in Ghana, with substance abuse the second most common diagnosis. Common mental disorders such as depression and anxi ety, form a much smaller percentage of the caseload in the psychiatric hospi tals and it is probable that many of those with these disorders are unseen by mental hea lth services. As women and older people are more likely to suffer from these d isorders it is likely that the current mental health services are not equally reaching the se groups. There is a very limited range of psychotropic drugs available in Ghana, with few atypical anti-psychotics or SSRIs available at most mental health facilities. There are problems of supply with even the most standard drug s such as Chlorpromazine, both within the psychiatric hospitals and community serv ices. The problems of supply, coupled with the side effects of many anti-psychoti c drugs are likely to worsen the likelihood of continued adherence to psychotropic m edication on the part of patients, thus increasing the risk of relapse. 4.6 Mental Health Policy Implementation at the Dist rict Level The overview of mental health services within Kinta mpo district reveals the challenges for the provision of mental health care at the district level and the impact of centralisation of mental health care and the lim ited availability of community care. 221 The district is not untypical in Ghana in having no resident mental health professional, and no dedicated facilities or resour ces for mental health. Treatment for mental illness is therefore restricted to the distr ict hospital which has a limited supply of psychotropic drugs. Where necessary referrals ar e made to the regional or national psychiatric services. However there are no facilities for follow-up. Consequently the burden of care for those with ment al illness largely falls to the families. Attitudes to mental illness in Kintampo are represe ntative of attitudes throughout the country and reveal the social exclusion of the ment ally ill in all aspects of life, from work to marriage. In this example poverty and stigm a can be seen to work hand in hand, therefore resulting in a double burden of dis advantage for those with mental illness. Government sectors in the district such as schools, the police and social welfare lack the skills and resources to work effectively with t hose with mental illness, with mental health policy and legislation having virtually no i mpact at the district level. In the absence of psychiatric services in districts such as Kintampo, traditional and faith healers remain the major resource for the tre atment of mental illness at the district level. Some healers expressed their willin gness to collaborate with mental health professionals in the treatment of those with mental illness. The perception of mental illness as often spiritually caused, and the potential psychosocial benefits of traditional healing, suggest that traditional heale rs and faith healers may prove an important component in developing community-based t reatment for mental illness at the district level. Recent initiatives by Basic Nee ds to provide training in mental health for traditional healers and support their c ollaboration with CPNs have proved successful and could provide a model for more wides pread efforts in training and collaboration. 4.7 Key Issues in Mental Health Service Implementat ion in Ghana There was overwhelming support among participants f or the decentralization of mental health services. Many argued forcefully for the need for mental health care at the community level and the integration of mental h ealth into primary care. 222 Community-based services should help to reach more of those in need, as well as remove some of the stigma attached to the psychiatr ic hospitals. Community-based treatment also facilitates the reintegration of the individual into the community once he or she has recovered, rather than removing the p erson to the psychiatric hospitals for long periods of time. Over the years several at tempts have been made to train community level workers to recognize and refer case s of mental illness, and to train primary care workers in mental health. Most recentl y Basic Needs is involved in such programmes in the north of the country and in Accra . These initiatives have increased the detection and treatment of mental ill ness and suggest a need to expand such initiatives to all the districts and en sure their sustainability in the long term. Unfortunately such schemes are often dependen t on outside funding and therefore tend to come to an end when funding is no longer available. Participants acknowledged the difficulties of recru itment and retention of workers in psychiatry. Ghana has begun to address the shortage of nurses through expanding the intake of the psychiatric nurse training colleg es. However there is also a need to address problems with staff morale and retention. T here are high rates of attrition among mental health professionals, both internally and externally. Many community psychiatric nurses are nearing retirement and there is an urgent need to plan for their replacement 3. Post-basic training in order to enhance the skill s of psychiatric professionals is rarely available and there are lim ited opportunities for professional development within the country. An investment in th e ongoing training of mental health workers would help to maintain the standard of care as well as potentially enhance the morale of staff. Intersectoral collaboration was acknowledged to be poor and yet it was recognised that such collaboration was vital for the successfu l implementation of mental health policy and legislation. Workers in mental health at the community level, such as CPNs, can pay a pivotal role in developing intersec toral links at the community level. Without such community-based professionals to advoc ate for mental health, it is unlikely that other sectors will take the initiativ e in mental health as they are already over-stretched and are unlikely to wish to attract further work. Despite strong support for the ethos of the Mental Health Bill, many respondents expressed scepticism about whether there would be a sustained commitment to 3 Since 2005, the number of CPNs has decreased from 1 32 to 115. 223 implement it in practice. Participants identified m any barriers to the implementation of the Mental Health Bill including a lack of resource s, stigma, and the failure to train and educate those responsible for its implementatio n at the service delivery level. Participants' responses serve to caution that witho ut the necessary political will and a commitment in terms of human and material resources , there is a danger that even once passed, the Mental Health Bill could share the fate of many other valuable pieces of legislation which remain poorly implement ed in practice. 4.8 Research There is a lack of systematic and routine date coll ection on mental health at all levels of the health system, particularly within primary c are. The lack of reliable data on the numbers of cases presenting with mental health prob lems at the primary care level means that it is difficult to argue for mental heal th to be addressed in service planning. There is some amount of published research both in reviewed journals and in the grey literature, but very little research is suffic iently disseminated and the findings have rarely been taken up in policy. There have bee n few population-based epidemiological studies to reveal the true extent o f mental health problems in Ghana. Most of the psychiatric research in mental health h as utilised hospital-based samples where often only the most severely ill and more beh aviourally disturbed are admitted. Building research capacity in mental health could h elp to provide an accurate evidence base on which to develop future mental hea lth policy. 4.9 Areas for action The combined results of the WHO-AIMS, documentary a nalysis of mental health policy and legislation, and the qualitative intervi ews and focus groups suggest the following areas to be addressed in mental health po licy and service delivery in Ghana: 4.9.1 Mental health situation o Popular knowledge of mental illness in Ghana assoc iates mental illness with madness. Common mental disorders such as anxiety an d depression are much less recognised. Awareness campaigns should th erefore be mounted to 224 expand the knowledge of the general population and target groups who are likely to have contact with such disorders such as teachers, police officers, prison officers and magistrates, as well as those m ost at risk of common mental disorders, in particular women and older peo ple. o Women are at risk of mental illness due to discrim ination, the burden of childcare and domestic violence. Empowering women a nd tackling domestic violence through education and advocacy is therefor e important in addressing the mental health of women in Ghana. o Affirmative action is needed to raise the priority of mental health through public education and awareness campaigns. NGOs are well-placed to work alongside mental health services in promoting menta l health and public awareness, and lobbying for the inclusion of mental health in policy. o Stigma towards those with mental illness is pervas ive in Ghana and extends to all sectors of society. Anti-stigma campaigns sh ould therefore be extensive and regular to address discrimination against those with mental health problems and to foster social inclusion. These camp aigns should include users of mental health services in their planning a nd delivery, and could draw on the lessons of campaigns on HIV/AIDS and people with disabilities. o Human rights abuse of the mentally ill is not only seen in traditional and faith healing facilities where the most obvious abuses ar e the chaining of patients, but also in the psychiatric hospitals, for example in the use of unnecessary seclusion and restraint, and unsanitary and overcro wded conditions. There is a need for regular inspection and monitoring of all psychiatric facilities, public and private, to enforce the protection of the human rights and the dignity of those receiving treatment. Traditional and faith he alers should be registered and their healing practices regularly inspected and monitored. Sanctions should be in place for those healers who fail to pr otect the rights of their patients. 4.9.2 Mental health policy o Many of those with mental health problems in Ghana are recognised to be from among the poorest sectors of society. It is kn own that mental illness and 225 poverty are mutually reinforcing. Therefore mental health should be specifically incorporated into strategies for pover ty alleviation and development. Mental health care should go hand in h and with interventions to address poverty such as income generation schemes a nd vocational training. o There is a need to update mental health policy to bring it into line with draft mental health legislation. More extensive consultat ion should be conducted with stakeholders, particularly at the grassroots l evel, from the start of the policy-making process through to its implementation and evaluation. Consultation not only ensures that policies are rel evant and feasible, but helps in the effective implementation of policies a nd plans. o Barriers to the implementation of mental health po licy need to be addressed. Mental health policy should be widely disseminated within GHS and in other relevant sectors. Training in the content of mental health policy for all those affected by the policy should be provided in order to raise awareness and ensure policy is implemented. There is also a need to identify the sources of funding for planned initiatives and for a significa nt investment in mental health services if the objectives of mental health policy are to be fulfilled. o User participation is very limited in Ghana, and i s an important step in helping to combat stigma and protect the human rights of th ose with mental illness. There is a need to form user advocacy groups and fo r mental health service users to be consulted in mental health policy formu lation and in the monitoring of mental health services o It is crucial to lobby for the speedy passage of t he 2006 Mental Health Bill into law. The bill touches on many of the areas for acti on mentioned in this discussion, and its passage would provide a mandate to address some of these issues to improve mental health care delivery in Ghana. However there needs to be an equal commitment in terms of resourc es and political support if the bill is to be implemented once it is passed. o Mental health policy and legislation should not be viewed in isolation, but should be promoted in the context of other relevant legislation and policy in order to maximise the inclusion of mental health wi thin national policy. 226 4.9.3 Mental health service implementation o National health policy in Ghana emphasises de-cent ralisation and increasing access to care through an emphasis on primary care and health promotion at the community level. To facilitate mental health pr omotion and case detection at the community level, mental health could be inco rporated into existing structures for public health delivery, such as CHPS and Community-Based Surveillance Volunteers (CBSVs). Cadres of public h ealth workers such as Field Technicians, CBSVs and CHPs volunteers could serve as resources for identifying cases of mental illness at the communit y level drawing on previous experiences in the training of such personnel in ca se detection and referral. o Given the link between poverty and mental illness, and the concentration of mental health facilities and health professionals i n urban areas, there should be a focus on extending mental health services to r each those in the poorest sectors of society in rural areas, particularly in the north of Ghana. o There are problems of supply with essential psycho tropic drugs, both within hospital and community services. The number of drug s available to treat mental disorders are limited and largely restricted to older drugs with more severe side effects. There is a need to improve the supply of psychotropic drugs and to consider the purchase of newer drugs, such as atypical anti- psychotics, so as to provide a high standard of tre atment and optimise quality of life for those with mental illness. o There is a lack of intersectoral collaboration in the provision of mental health services. There is a need for closer collaboration among agencies involved in the care of the mentally ill, and for training in m ental health for those such as social workers, the police and teachers. o The quality and availability of mental health care is severely constrained by the low numbers of mental health professionals and the limited opportunities for professional development. There is a need to pr ovide effective support and supervision, as well as opportunities for ongoi ng training, in order to retain staff. Training of Psychiatric Clinical Offi cers has worked effectively in several African countries and should be considered in Ghana. More psychologists, social workers, occupational therapi sts and other health 227 professionals should be trained and employed in men tal health services in order to provide psychosocial interventions in ment al health care. o There is a need to improve the quality of inpatien t psychiatric care. The psychiatric hospitals are in need of renovation to provide a safe and comfortable environment for patients and staff. Mor e effective and comprehensive treatment for psychiatric patients, i ncluding rehabilitation and other psychosocial interventions, as well as the pr ovision of community mental health care, could assist in easing congesti on in the hospitals through limiting the length of admission and preparing pati ents for discharge. o The establishment of community-based mental health care is vital to reach those living in the districts and to provide follow -up on discharge from hospital. Community-based care should include psych osocial rehabilitation and vocational skills training to assist the person to acquire the skills to enable them to reintegrate into society and support themselves in the community where possible. Psychosocial rehabilitati on could also prevent the acquirement of disability from mental illness. o Mental health care should be integrated into prima ry health care delivery at the district level. Mental health should be incorpo rated into the training for all primary health workers, and training should include a practice placement within mental health services. o There is a need to develop effective mechanisms fo r the follow-up of patients once discharged to the community. Communication bet ween psychiatric hospitals and community-based services should be im proved with all patients being referred to local services for follow-up. o Psychiatric units should be opened in all the regi onal hospitals. There is a need for regional psychiatric units to develop grea ter integration and collaboration with services at the district level. The regional units could serve as resources for mental health training, both in te rms of practice placements for health care trainees, and in terms of outreach to other health services as well as other relevant sectors in the districts. 228 o There is a need for a dedicated budget for mental health at the regional and district levels in order to facilitate the delivery of mental health care within local communities. o Traditional and faith healers are an important res ource in the care of the mentally ill. There is a need for greater collabora tion and consultation between psychiatric services and traditional and fa ith healers in order to work together to provide effective mental health care. C onsultation on ways forward for collaborative working with traditional and faith healers should be initiated, drawing on lessons from previous co-oper ation between traditional healers and medical practitioners in Ghana and else where in Africa. o The burden of care of the mentally ill falls on fa milies who receive little support. Education and support is needed for family members as well as assistance for them to access mental health service s when needed, for example in providing assistance with transport to h ospital. 4.9.4 Research o There is a need for systematic and routine collect ion of essential data within mental health services. Much vital data is unavaila ble due to poor record- keeping and the lack of standardisation in recorded information. There are very few records collated for psychiatric cases see n in primary care or in general hospitals. Essential data on items such as numbers of patients seen, length of admission, and number of cases secluded o r restrained should be collected routinely to allow for audit and research to inform mental health plans and policy o There is a need to produce high quality research t o provide an evidence base for the development of mental health policy and ser vice delivery. 4.10 Challenges and Limitations of the Study This study presented a number of challenges and lim itations. There were considerable difficulties in obtaining interviews w ith all the relevant stakeholders, particularly at the more senior level where prospec tive interviewees had very busy 229 schedules. Some declined to be interviewed. This me ant that the team was unable to conduct interviews with some of the key stakeholder s at the macro level, for instance with the Minister of Health. Many of the respondent s at the meso and macro levels also granted limited times for interviews which mea nt that the interviewer was unable to ask all the questions on the interview schedule, and there was insufficient time to probe topics in depth and seek clarification. Given time, there may perhaps have been more in-depth information gathered as well as the broad overview in this report. Limitations in infrastructure impacted on the capac ity of the research team through difficulties such as obtaining reliable telephone c ontact, power failure, poor roads and irregular public transport. Whilst the district sit e has many advantages for a study of mental health policy implementation at the micro le vel, the distance from the capital meant that considerable time was expended in visiti ng the capital in order to conduct interviews with stake holders at the national level . The WHO-AIMS is a particularly lengthy document and given the resource limitations it proved impossible to gather information for all the domains within the specified time. In addition much quantitative data is simply unavailable because it is not routinely collected. Thus many important statistics were not available. There are also weaknesses in the current health information system which resulted in a number of difficulties such as inconsistencies in data collec tion between services, possible double collations of numbers from the district to r egional levels, different categories and labelling of the same data, and different defin itions for the same categories of information at different collection points. These m ade it difficult to interpret what little data existed. There were considerable difficulties in fitting loc al data into the categories of the WHO-AIMS. The service categories in particular refl ect service provision and structure within higher-income countries, and did n ot clearly reflect the situation within Ghana and may have led to some distortion of the data. The sampling of the respondents was drawn largely f rom the southern part of Ghana due to the location of the capital city and the thr ee state psychiatric hospitals in the south. This meant that fewer stakeholders were samp led from other regions in the country, including the three northern regions. This restricts the scope of the research, in particular in respect of those regions which are most remote from the centres of government and of psychiatric services. 230 The district level site selected, Kintampo district , may also have presented some limitations to the study. Although it is not untypi cal in having no dedicated mental health worker, other districts where there is more mental health provision would have inevitably produced different results at the micro level. Kintampo is also a DSS site and the location of a number of research projects c onducted by Kintampo Health Research Centre, therefore the population is over-r esearched which may have some impact on the findings. Unfortunately due to time and resource constraints very few users of mental health services were interviewed, nor their families. This is regrettable as their viewpoint is crucial to an understanding of the needs of those w ith mental illness and their families. It is hoped to conduct further interviews with users of mental health services in subsequent stages of the project. For the interviews and focus groups, the process of transcription and translation was time-consuming and required the recruitment of addi tional staff to assist with the process. Staff recruited to transcribe the Twi inte rviews were not trained in interview transcription and did not transcribe interviews ver batim which may have compromised the accuracy of the content. There was also the challenge of translating concepts into English that may have had no exact translation. This means that at times the meaning of participant's comments may not have been adequately conveyed. Unfortunately time did not permit a proce ss of rigorous translation and back-translation which may have helped to ensure gr eater accuracy in translation. 231 5. Conclusion 5.1 The Ghanaian Mental Health System: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats This overview of the mental health system in Ghana has highlighted the challenges facing the provision of quality mental health care to those living with mental illness in Ghana. The following strengths and weakness and opp ortunities and threats facing the mental health system in Ghana have been identif ied: 5.1.1 Strengths o Some moves towards de-centralization of mental hea lth care have begun with the opening of psychiatric units in the regional ho spitals and the establishment of community psychiatric nursing serv ices. Mental health has been integrated into all the Regional Health Manage ment Teams and into those District Health Management Teams where commun ity psychiatric nurses are in post. o Initiatives through NGOs and other agencies to enh ance the community detection of mental illness and provide treatment h ave met with some success and draw on the availability of public heal th workers at the sub- district level. o There are an increased number of training places a vailable for psychiatric nurses and other health professionals such as medic al assistants. 5.1.2 Weaknesses o Uneven distribution of mental health services thro ughout the country limiting access to treatment. o Lack of human resources at all levels, including i npatient hospitals and community services. It is difficult to attract heal th professionals into psychiatry due to stigma, low priority of mental health, and f ears of violence. 232 o Little opportunity for continuous professional dev elopment for mental health professionals. o No training and support for other sectors in conta ct with those with mental health problems, such as teachers and police. o Very few community-based mental health services an d mental health professionals, and little integration of mental hea lth within primary care. Poor communication between psychiatric services and prim ary care, leading to a lack of effective procedures for follow-up of disch arged patients within the community. o Very few rehabilitation facilities for mental heal th in Ghana. Treatment for mental health largely curative. Very few psychosoci al professionals in mental health care and a lack of rehabilitation and psycho social treatment for mental health. o Poor quality of care and human rights abuses in bo th government facilities and traditional and faith healing facilities. No re gulation and monitoring of traditional and faith healers and stigmatization t owards patients at the institutional level. o Services are focused on treatment for severe menta l disorders. There is little focus on treatment for common mental disorders at t he community level. o The majority of dedicated funding for mental healt h is absorbed by the psychiatric hospitals. o No consultation with users of mental health servic es, their families, and health professionals at the district level in the formulat ion of mental health policy. o Limited intersectoral collaboration with other age ncies such as the police and education, in the development of mental health poli cy. o Little implementation and dissemination of existin g mental health policy. o Little reliable data gathering and dissemination o f research to inform mental health policy and planning. 233 5.1.3 Opportunities o There is widespread acknowledgement at the macro l evel of the need for de-centralisation of mental health service provisio n and the development of community-based services. o A new mental health law has been drafted which dra ws on extensive consultation at all levels of society, including us ers of mental health services, and which is consistent with WHO best pra ctice guidelines. If passed, the law would signal a new standard for men tal health care in Ghana and provide a mandate for improved services o There has been considerable collaboration and supp ort for mental health in recent years from international agencies such as the Royal Netherlands Embassy and the World Health Organization. There ha s also been a growth in the number of both international and loca l NGOs in the field of mental health. o Large numbers of traditional and faith healers off er treatment for mental illness at the community level and are well-placed to provide psychosocial and spiritual support. Some have indicated their wi llingness to collaborate with biomedical services. o There has been renewed impetus to further the caus e of mental health in Ghana through research and advocacy. There is incre asing research in mental health in Ghana which could raise the profil e of mental health and provide an evidence base for further service develo pment. o Public concern regarding rising rates of drug abus e has drawn increased attention to mental health issues. 5.1.3 Threats o Pervasive stigma, both at the societal and institu tional levels, towards patients, their families and staff in psychiatric s ervices. o Low priority of mental health in government policy , with mental health often overlooked in other relevant policy and legis lation. 234 o Lack of government commitment in financing to meet the objectives of mental health policy, particularly at the regional and district levels. o Mental illness is not currently covered by health insurance which may impede access to treatment for the most impoverishe d. This means that patients have to bear the cost of treatment when th ey are treated outside of mental health services or if psychotropic drugs are unavailable within public health services. o Increased demand on mental health services will le ad to the need for more psychotropic medication. The cost of providing optimal treatment with new psychiatric drugs may be prohibitive. o Rising rates of drug abuse, particularly cannabis, with resulting mental health problems may put a further strain on existin g resources 5.2 Steps Needed to be Taken to Strengthen the Ment al Health System Some suggested steps to be taken to strengthen the mental health system are: o Pass the new mental health bill, and provide the n ecessary resources and training for its implementation. o Improve existing information systems for collating data on mental health, and monitoring and evaluation of services, and actively use this information for the purposes of policy and advocacy at all levels. o Promote mental health in the development agenda to address the links between poverty and mental health o Increase the commitment to de-centralisation throu gh opening psychiatric units in the remaining regional hospitals. Provide outreach from the regional hospitals to support mental health at the district level. 235 o Develop rehabilitation within mental health servic es, such as half-way houses or vocational rehabilitation, in order to facilitat e the social integration of people with mental illness and prevent relapse. o Draw on lessons from anti-stigma campaigns in HIV/ AIDS and disability in order to raise public awareness of mental health an d tackle stigma. o Integrate mental health into existing structures f or primary care provision and public health education and case detection. Train a ll health workers in mental health, including all workers in primary care. o Provide a comprehensive training programme for men tal health professionals to update their skills so as to continue to provide best practice in mental health care. o Develop retention strategies for mental health sta ff to address the attrition of mental health workers. o Develop new mental health policy in line with draf t mental health bill. This should be built on extensive consultation with all stakeholders. o Promote mental health policy in the context of oth er relevant policy, and increase collaboration with other relevant sectors in the treatment of the mentally ill. o Provide training for those whose work brings them into contact with the mental health problems, such as the police, teacher s and social workers. o Develop information systems for collating data on mental health, and monitoring and evaluation of services. o Disseminate mental health policy to all levels wit hin the health service, as well as other relevant sectors, and provide training and education to those responsible for policy implementation. 236 6.

It has been derived f rom the WHO manual on Mental Health Legislation, Mental Health Policy and Service Development Team, Department of Mental Health and Substance Dependence, World Health Organization, 2003. The checklist exercise on the Ghana mental health d ecree 1972 has been completed by Dr Dixon Chibanda, Department of Psychiatry, Unive rsity of Zimbabwe, Harare, Zimbabwe Professor Robert Dinerstein, Professor of Law & Associate Dean of Academic Affairs, American University, Washington College of Law, Washington D C, USA Professor Melvyn Freeman, Human Sciences Research C ouncil, Pretoria, South Africa Dr Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Agossou, Regional Adviser for Mental Hea lth, WHO Regional Office for Africa, Brazzaville, Congo Dr Michelle Funk, Coordinator, Mental Health Policy and Service Development, Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse, WHO Headquarters, Genev a, Switzerland Ms Natalie Drew, Technical officer, Mental Health P olicy and Service Development, Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse, WHO Headquarters , Geneva, Switzerland 248 Introduction and how to use this Checklist This Checklist is a companion to the WHO Manual on Mental Health Legislation. Its objectives are to a) assist countries in reviewing the comprehensiveness and adequacy of existing mental health legislation and b) help t hem in the process of drafting new law. By using this instrument countries can assess whether key components are included in legislation and ensure that the broad r ecommendations contained in the manual are carefully examined and considered. A committee to work through the checklist is recommended. Whil e an individual such as the focal point in the Ministry of Health may be able to complete the tool this has limitations. Firstly, a single person is unlikely t o have all the relevant information that a well selected team would. Secondly, different ind ividuals or representatives of different groups are likely to have differing views on various issues. An evaluation committee which allows critical debate to take plac e and for consensus to be developed is invaluable. While countries must decid e the composition of the committee it is advisable to include a legal practi tioner familiar with various country laws, the governmental mental health focal point, r epresentatives of consumer and family groups, representatives of mental health pro fessionals, non-governmental organisations and other government departments. It is recommended that the process be led and mediated by an independent human rights and/or legal expert. This tool should generally not be utilised without thoroughly working through the manual itself . A number of important items included in this tool are explained in the manual and the rationale and different options for legislation are discussed. The manual emphasises that countries should make their own decisions around various alternatives and ways of drafting legislation as we ll as around a number of content issues. The format of this Checklist allows for suc h flexibility and aims to encourage internal debate, thus permitting countries to make decisions based on their own unique situations. The tool covers issues from a broad perspective and many of the provisions will need to be fleshed out/elaborated upon with respect to details and country specifications. Moreover, not all provisions will b e equally relevant to all countries due to different social, economic, cultur al and political factors. For example not all countries will choose to have commu nity treatment orders; not all countries have provision for \"non-protesting pa tients\"; many countries do not have the death penalty and, in most countries, the use of sterilisation on people with mental disorders will not be relevant. Howeve r, while each country in their evaluative process may determine that a particular provision is not relevant, this determination should be made as a part of the Check list exercise. All provisions in the checklist should be considered and discussed carefully before it is decided that one or more provision is not relevant to a cou ntry's particular context. The manual points out that countries may have law s which affect mental health in a single or in numerous different legislations, for e xample general health, employment, housing, discrimination and criminal justice laws, among others. Moreover some countries utilise regulations, orders and other mec hanisms to complement an Act. When conducting this audit it is therefore essentia l to collect and collate all legal 249 provisions relating to mental health and to make de cisions based on comprehensive information. For each component included there are three options to be decided upon, a) has the issue been adequately covered in the legislation b) has it been covered, but not fully and comprehensively and c) has it not been covered at all. If the response is either (b) or (c) the committee conducting the assessment mus t decide the feasibility and local relevance of inclusion of the issue - leading to th e drafting of locally appropriate legislation. This Checklist does not cover each and every issue that could or should be included in legislation. This does not mean that other items ar e unimportant and that countries should not pursue them, however for the sake of sim plicity and easy use the scope of this Checklist has been limited. The manual is very clear that drawing up or changin g mental health legislation is a \"process\". Establishing what needs to be inclu ded in the legislation is an important element of this process and this Checklis t tool a useful aid to achieving this goal. Nonetheless, the objective of drafting a law which is implementable in a country must never be separated from the \"content\" and must always be a central consideration. 250 WHO Checklist on Mental Health Legislation 1 Legislative issue Extent to which covered in legislation (Tick one) a) Adequately covered b) Covered to some extent c) Not covered at all If (b) explain: Why it is not adequately covered What is missing or problematic about the existing provision If (c) explain why it is not covered in current legislation (Additional information may be added to new sheets of paper if required) If (b) or (c) explain how/whether it is to be included in new legislation (Additional information may be added to new sheets of paper if required) A. Preamble and objectives 1) Does the legislation have a preamble which emphasizes:- a) the human rights of people with mental disorders b) the importance of accessible mental health services for all 2) Does the legislation outline that the purpose and objectives to be achieved include:- a) b) c) a) b) c) a) The inclusion of a human rights component in mental health legislation would help address historical and present injustice s carried out against people with mental disorders. Ensuring equity between men tal and physical health remains a major problem in most African countries. Highlighting the human rights of people with mental disorders can help add ress this problem. The human rights aspects of mental health law can be au gmented by using international standards and other legal instruments . b) Because the legislation focuses almost solely on ca re and treatment in psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units, there is no emphasis on accessible mental health services in the community. The clos est the statute comes to discussing broader access to mental health services is in Part V, Para. 28, which provides that the commissioner may provide for aftercare services and rehabilitation centres. a) The statute does not contain any provisions requir ing non-discrimination against people with mental disorders. b) The statute does not explicitly provide for the pr omotion and protection of the rights of people with mental disorders. However, certain provisions implicitly promote rights by limiting the exercise of the state commitment po wer, albeit imperfectly. Other 1 NOTE: \"New\" scores (marked with a highlight) reflec t the following. (a) issue addressed adequately, ( b) issue well addressed, but not perfectly, (c) iss ue not addressed, or so badly addressed that, effectively, it is as if it was not addressed 251 a) non-discrimination against people with mental disorders b) promotion and protection of the rights of people with mental disorders c) improved access to mental health services d) a community based approach a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) provisions, such as those in Part I, Para. 2, regar ding the duty of the chief administrator to keep patients clean, adequately nourished, and a dequately clothed, could entail protection of patient rights, though there does not appear to be any way for patients to enforce these rights. There is no mention of the rights to confidentialit y of information, access to information, communication, autonomy or privacy. Nor does the s tatute address the rights of persons outside of the psychiatric hospital, such as civil and political rights. These rights are particularly important because of the stigma associ ated with mental illness . c) The statute does not address improved access to me ntal health services at all. Access to mental health care services can be improved by decentralization and integration of mental health services in genera l health care. The law should indicate that people with mental disorders have the right to receive treatment under the same conditions as individuals with gener al medical conditions. d) The statute does not emphasize a community-based ap proach to providing mental health services. The focus of the law is alm ost exclusively on institutional care, other than the provision in Par t V, Para. 28 permitting (but not requiring) the commissioner to provide for afte rcare services and rehabilitation centres. It would be useful to have an objective that addressed service organization and reform in the law. B. Definitions 1) Is there a clear definition of mental disorder/mental illness/mental disability/mental incapacity/unsoundness of mind? 2) Is it evident from the legislation why the particular term (above) has been chosen? 3) Is the legislation clear on whether or a) b) c) a) b) c) a) 1) The statute does not contain a definition of mental disorder/mental illness/ mental disability/mental incapacity and unsoundness of min d. The statute consistently uses the term \"mental illness\" but does not indicate why thi s term is preferred over \"mental disorder\" or the other terms. Part V, Para. 25 sta tes that \" The provisions of this Decree shall apply to persons suffering or believed to be suffering from any degree of mental disorder, psychopathic disorder, arrested or incomp lete development of mind, mental subnormality or any other disorder or disability of the mind , howsoever, called, as they apply to persons suffering or believed to be suffer ing from mental illness.\" The absence of clear (or any) definitions of these terms in the st atute presents opportunities for abuse. 2) It is not evident from the legislation why the ter m \"mental illness\" has been used. While that term is generally considered to be narrower th an the term \"mental disorder,\" and is thus preferred when dealing with issues concerning eligi bility for civil commitment, the broader \"mental disorder\" is recommended when focusing on i ssues related to the rights of patients. 3) Part V, Para. 25, states that persons with arrest ed or incomplete development of the mind or mental sub-normality are included in the statute . Presumably, these terms relate to people with mental retardation or developmental del ay, though the substantive provisions of the statute do not address the needs (or rights) of this population. People with 252 not mental retardation, personality disorders and substance abuse are being covered in the legislation? 4) Are all key terms in the legislation clearly defined? 5) Are all \"interpretable\" terms (that is, terms that may have several possible interpretations or meanings or may be ambiguous in terms of their meaning) in the legislation defined? b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) \"psychopathic disorder\" are also included in the la w, which presumably includes people with personality disorders. However, the statute ma kes no explicit mention of substance abuse; it is unclear whether Para. 25's use of the phrase \" any other disorder or disability of the mind\" includes substance abuse, as that term can be asso ciated with an alteration of cognition and general mental functioning. Again, t hough, there are no specific substantive provisions that would address the peculiar needs of substance abusers. The statute needs to be clear about such issues. 4) The statute defines few terms: the only explicit definitions are of the terms \"chief administrator\" and \"Commissioner\" in Part V, Para. 30. Key terms such as \"dangerous to self or others\" (Part IV, Para. 17), \"care and trea his case,\" \"practioner experienced in psychiatry,\" \"patient,\" and so on (P art I, Para. 2 (b)) are not defined in the Decree. 5) The statute does not provide clear definitions of \"interpretable terms.\" For example, under Part II, Para. 7 (2), the chief administrator shall discharge a voluntary patient \"when he is satisfied that the patient has recovered from his mental illness to justify discharge.\" This definition is circular at best. Other example s include Part II, Para. 8 (5) (magistrate must be satisfied there is \"good reason to believe\" the person requires temporary treatment of up to six months) and Part II, Para. 9 (1) (chie f administrator can apply for prolonged treatment of person with mental illness when he \"is of the opinion that, by reason of the severity or nature of the mental illness it is nece ssary for the welfare of such person or for the public safety\" ). Although there does not generally seem to be a conf usion of terms, as not all key terms are defined it is difficult to know what is meant by gi ven terms. For instance, the law generally uses the term \"mental illness\" but then in s. 17 (a )states \"the patient is not then suffering from mental illness or any other mental disorder \", without otherwise explaining how the terms relate to each other. C. Access to mental health care 1) Does the legislation make provision for the financing of mental health services? 2) Does the legislation state that mental health services should be provided on an equal basis with physical health care? 3) Does the legislation ensure allocation of resources to underserved populations a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) 1) The legislation does not provide for the financing of mental health services. In most African countries the mental health budget is less than 1% of the health budget, while in other countries a mental health budget appears not to exist at all (WHO Atlas 2001). In situations where it is not possible to specify fina ncing of mental health services, clauses within the legislation can help to direct existing funding, for example, by emphasizing that people with mental disorders be treated on an equit able basis with people with physical health problems, or by emphasizing community-based services over institutional care. Such statements can prompt the authorities to allocate r esources to appropriate mental health services. 2) The statute does not require or suggest that menta l health services be provided on an equal basis with physical health services. An empha sis on equity with physical health will help to improve access and availability of mental h ealth services. 3) The Decree does not address allocation of resources to under-served populations. Because most of Africa has a large rural population that is often marginalized, focus on these vulnerable and disadvantaged groups is critic al to improving access to and availability of services. Legislation can establish criteria fo r establishing the needs of communities. The statute also does not mention culturally approp riate services. Culture plays an 253 and that these services should be culturally appropriate? 4) Does the legislation promote mental health within primary health care? 5) Does the legislation promote access to psychotropic drugs? 6) Does the legislation promote a psycho-social rehabilitative approach? 7) Does the legislation promote access to health insurance for people with mental disorders in the private and public health sector? 8) Does the legislation promote community care and deinstitutionalisation? c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) important role in most African communities and cult ural values may need to be incorporated when dealing with certain issues such as confidentiality. 4) The legislation does not promote mental health with in primary health care. The statute is focused almost exclusively on care and treatment in tertiary institutions. By emphasizing decentralization, mental health would be put on an equal footing with general health benefits. Most developing countries have comprehens ive primary care services that are aimed at promoting physical health care with a focu s on conditions such as malaria, TB, HIV, and many others. Therefore, by emphasizing tha t mental health services be delivered through general health care services it is possible to increase the access of under-served populations to mental health services. 5) The legislation does not promote access to psychotr opic drugs. Because mental health services in Africa are often neglected, legislation can address this anomaly by stating that medication for mental disorders be as available and accessible as medication for other medical conditions. 6) The legislation does provide in Part V, Para. 28, t hat \" the commissioner may make such provision for after-care services (including superv ision) and rehabilitation centres for discharged patients as he may consider necessary or expedient. . . \" However, this provision is not mandatory (unlike the provision in Para. 22 of the 1990 proposal, which appears to be). There is a need for a clearly defi ned psycho-social rehabilitation procedure in the legislation with emphasis on community and f amily participation. 7) There is no mention of access to health insurance f or people with mental disorders. Legislation may contain provisions to prevent discr imination against people with mental disorders in their efforts to obtain health insuran ce coverage. 8) The legislation does not promote community-based ca re and de-institutionalization. Statutory language can provide that, if at all poss ible, patients should be treated in their communities and as voluntary patients, unless there are clearly-articulated reasons why hospital-based care is required. By emphasizing com munity-based care, services are more likely to be incorporated into the general health c are system, thus resulting in better access and availability of care for people with mental dis orders. D. Rights of users of mental health services 1) Are the rights to respect, dignity and to be treated in a humane way included a) b) 1) The statute does not fully address patients' right s to respect and dignity, and the right to be treated in a humane wa y. However, Part I, Para. 2, provides that it is the duty of the chief administrator of each hospital to ensure that every patient is kept b) \" adequately nourished and receives care and treatment adequate to his case; c). . . adequately clothed, and d) that every complaint is promptly in vestigated and 254 in the legislation? 2) Is the right to patient confidentiality regarding information about themselves, their illness and treatment included? a) Are there sanctions and penalties for people who contravene patient confidentiality? b) Does the legislation lay down exceptional circumstances when confidentiality may be legally breached? c) Does the legislation allow patients and their personal representatives the right to ask for judicial review of, or appeal against, decisions to release information? 3) Does the legislation provide patients free and full access to information about themselves (including access to their clinical records? a)Are circumstances in which such access can be denied outlined? c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) appropriate action taken.\" Arguably, Part V, Para. 22, protects personal dignity by permitting a magistrate to authorize pol ice intervention when a person who appears to be suffering from mental illn ess is subjected to ill- treatment or neglect . The use of the broad terms adequate and appropriate above may be problematic, especially against a background of alr eady existing injustices and misconceptions surrounding mental he alth. The rights of persons with mental disorders need to be clearly st ated. 2) The statute has no provisions for protecting patien t confidentiality regarding information about themselves, their illne ss and treatment is not included. Therefore, the statute neither provides for sanctions against contravention of this right nor allows for exceptio nal circumstances when confidentiality may be breached. Because of widespread violations of the rights of people with mental disorders, protecting information about their men tal health is critical. In many countries, information concerning patients has been used to deny them such basic rights such as the right to vote, t he right to work, the right to live in the community, the right to commun icate, and other civil and political rights. While protecting the rights of patients, legislatio n should also determine the special cases under which confidentiality may b e breached appropriately. Exceptional cases such as life-threa tening emergencies or substantial likelihood of imminent harm to others m ay be legitimate grounds for breaching confidentiality, but it is im portant that any such exceptions be narrowly drawn. Issues concerning the rights of families to confide ntial information regarding the patient need to be discussed and work ed through. See below.Section D - Rights of families or other carer s. 3) The legislation does not provide patients free and full access to information about themselves, nor does it set out t he circumstances in which it would be appropriate to deny such access. As a matter of equity, people with mental disorders should have as free 255b) Does the legislation allow patients and their personal representatives the right to ask for judicial review of, or appeal against, decisions to withhold information? 4) Does the law specify the right to be protected from cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment? 5) Does the legislation set out the minimal conditions to be maintained in mental health facilities for a safe, therapeutic and hygienic environment? 6) Does the law insist on privacy of people with mental disorders? a) Is the law clear on minimal levels of privacy to be respected? 7) Does the legislation outlaw forced or inadequately remunerated labour within mental health institutions? 8) Does the law make provision for: Educational activities Vocational training Leisure and recreational activities Religious or cultural needs a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) and full access to information concerning their hea lth as people with physical conditions do. Exceptions to access may b e legitimate, but must again be narrowly tailored. Legislation can outline the procedures for patients to exercise their right to gain access to information, and the circumstances where denial of access is appropriate . 4) The statute law does not provide for the right to b e protected from cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. Under Part I, Para. 2, the visiting committee can inquire into patient complai nts, which presumably could include claims regarding such treatment, but in the area of patient rights the statute should be more specific. Princip le 13, MI Principles, has a clear outline of these basic rights. 5) The statute does set out in a general way the requi rement that mental health facilities be maintained in a safe, therapeu tic and hygienic environment. Part I, Para. 2(a) states \" that every part of the hospital, including wards, kitchens (sic) washing facilities and toilets, are at all times kept in a clean and sanitary condition .\" Para. 2(b) provides in part that every patient receive \"care and treatment adequate to his case.\" However, these provisions do not set out the specif ic conditions that constitute a safe, therapeutic and humane environme nt. Moreover, while the language clearly addresses the requirement of a hygienic environment, there is no particular emphasis on saf ety, and the therapeutic requirement must be gleaned from the va gue language of \"care and treatment adequate to his case.\" 6) The statute does not insist on recognizing the priv acy of patients with mental disorders, except to the extent that it prov ides for female patients and children under the age of sixteen to be accommo dated separately. See Part V, Paras. 26 (1), (2), discussed below. In r esource-poor settings, where private rooms for every patient may not be fe asible, legislation can still require that patients admitted in mental heal th institutions be treated in the same manner as those admitted to general med ical wards. a) The statute is not clear on the minimal levels of privacy to be respected. The law can be precise in defining the c onditions of privacy in the institution, for example, by stipulating the mi nimum living space available for each patient, the maximum number of b eds in a ward, and the need for patients to have a private area where they can store their personal items. 256 of people with mental disorders? 9) Are health authorities compelled by the law to inform patients of their rights? 10) Does legislation ensure that users of mental health services are involved in mental health policy and legislation development and service planning? b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) 7) The statute does not address, and hence does not ma ke illegal, forced or inadequately remunerated patient labor. Labor th at is part of an occupational therapy program, or that is legitimate ly assigned for therapeutic purposes, is not equivalent to proscrib ed patient labor. The law may state that in circumstances where patients consent (without coercion) to perform a specific task, they should b e remunerated accordingly. 8) The law does not make provisions for educational, vocational training, leisure and recreational activities, and religious or cultural needs of people with mental disorders. If the environment wi thin a mental health facility is intended to be as close as possible to the patient's home environment, then the patient's needs should be vie wed in a holistic manner. These basic rights are enshrined in the MI Principles (Principle 13). 9) Health authorities are not compelled by law (in thi s legislation, at least) to inform patients of their rights. Because for a variety of reasons patients are sometimes not aware of their rights, l egislation should include a provision for informing patients of their rights when dealing with mental health services. This information shoul d be made available in a simple yet comprehensive manner. The law may a lso stipulate that this information be made available in a language, a nd at a level of complexity, that the patient understands. 10) There is no provision for users of mental health se rvices to be involved in the development and planning of mental health services. Including such a provision in the law encourages th e formation of user groups and makes their contribution to the developm ent of the mental health service system more transparent. E. Rights of families or other carers 1) Are families or other primary care givers entitled under the law to information about the person with mental disorder (unless the patient a) b) c) 1) There is no indication in the law that families and other primary care givers are entitled to information about the person with a mental disor der. Part V, Para. 27 states that families and friends may visit the patient but there is no m ention of them being entitled to information concerning the patient. Because familie s often carry the burden of care for people with mental disorders, legislation needs to recognize the role that they play. In most African cultures, the extended family system plays a crucial role in decision making, support and care, particularly where a member of th e family is ill. Therefore, it may become necessary for certain family members to be informed of the person's situation. While family members' access to information must be balanced aga inst the person's right to confidentiality, cultural and other traditional val ues may counsel more rather than less 257 refuses for such information to be divulged)? 2) Are family members or other primary care givers encouraged to be part of the treatment plan? 3) Do families or other primary care givers have the right to appeal involuntary admission and treatment decisions. 4) Do families or other primary care givers have the right to apply for the discharge of mentally ill offenders? 5) Does legislation ensure that family members or other carers are involved in mental health policy and legislation development and service planning? a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) information sharing. In all circumstances potentia l conflicts of interest need to be examined, the views of the person with the mental d isorder must be taken into account and only information relevant for the support and care of the person should be considered. 2) The statute has no provisions encouraging family me mbers or other primary care givers to be part of the treatment plan. (Indeed, the stat ute does not provide for treatment plans at all.) There is no real emphasis on care provided fo r the patient after leaving the hospital. Family members often take responsibility for ensuri ng that the patient takes his medication, attends review clinics, and participates in other r ehabilitation exercises in the community. By involving family members, the care provided outs ide of the hospital system may be more consistent and there is less likelihood of the family resorting to alternative treatments such as traditional medicines when they are involve d and understand the treatment plan. 3) Although neither family members nor other primary c are givers have an explicit right to appeal involuntary admission and treatment decision s, Part IV, Para. 16, establishing the Mental Health Review Tribunal, does provide that \" an application may be made to the Tribunal by or in respect of any person detained un der this decree...(a) requesting a review of the conditions under which he is detained; or (b ) requesting his discharge; or (c) requesting any other appropriate action to be taken with respect to the circumstances of his case.\" It is not clear whether this procedure is in the nature of an appeal or rather functions as a kind of habeas corpus procedure to test the le gality of continued confinement. In any event, families are not singled out in this process . Moreover, issues such as the nature of the Tribunal's procedures, the time frame within which it must make a response to an application, the nature of the decisions the Tribun al can make, and its overall authority are not clear. Furthermore, reviews of involuntary sta tus should not be limited to appeals. Reviews should be held on an automatic basis for al l cases at certain set time periods. 4) Families and other primary care givers do not have the right to apply for the discharge of mentally ill offenders under this statute. 5) The legislation does not encourage family members o r other care givers to be involved in mental health policy, legislation development, and service planning. F. Competence, capacity and guardianship 1) Does legislation make provision for the management of the affairs of people with mental disorders if they are unable to do so? 2) Does the law define \"competence\" and \"capacity\" a) b) c) a) b) c) 1) The legislation does not make provision for the man agement of the affairs of people with mental disorders if they are unable to do so, with one exception: under Part II, Para. 7 (3), the chief administrator can discharge a voluntary p atient who is \"incapable of expressing his intentions\" to the care of a relative or other suitable person. 2) The statute neither defines \"competence\" and \"capac ity\" nor does it use this terminology at all. The only references to lack of capacity or competence (though not stated in those terms) is the above reference to patients who are i ncapable of expressing their intentions and a later one, in Part V, Para. 22 (b), to people with apparent mental disorders in the community who are \"unable to care for\" themselves. \"Capacity\" and \"competence\" are useful terms for dealing with people with mental di sorders because the presence of mental illness in itself does not automatically mean that the individual lacks capacity (the ability to make decisions) or competence (legal consequences o f not having mental capacity). These terms are important when dealing with the judiciary , other branches of government, and civil society, and are distinct from a diagnosis of mental disorder. All persons are presumed to have capacity and be competent, even if suffering from a mental disorder, unless reliably determined otherwise. 258 3) Does the law lay down a procedure for determining a person's incapacity/incompetence with respect to issues such as treatment decisions, selection of a substitute decision maker, making financial decisions? 4) Are procedures laid down for appeals against decisions of incapacity/incompetence and for periodic reviews of decisions? 5) Does the law lay down procedures for the appointment, duration, duties and responsibilities of a guardian to act on behalf of a patient? 6) Does the law determine a process for establishing which areas a guardian may take decisions on behalf of a patient? 7) Does the law make provision for the systematic review of the need for a guardian? 8) Does the law make provision for a patient to appeal against the appointment of a guardian? a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) 3) through 8) The law does not set out a procedure for determinin g a person's incapacity/incompetence in any area, nor d oes it provide for guardianship or other forms of surrogate decision m aking. Guardianship may become necessary in the event that a patient is unable to make important decisions and is incapable of man aging his affairs. However, because guardianship takes away a person's right to make decisions (in whole or in part), it is a major limi tation on one's civil rights, which should only be used after less restri ctive alternatives have been exhausted and due process procedures have been followed (including notice, hearing, appeal, and periodic re view). G. Voluntary Admission and treatment 1) Part II deals with voluntary admission, however, th ere is no effort to promote this form of treatment over involuntary admission a nd treatment. The law does not emphasize that every effort should be made to a void involuntary admission. 259 1) Does the law promote voluntary admission and treatment? 2) Does the law state that all voluntary patients can only be treated after obtaining informed consent? 3) Does the law state that people admitted as voluntary mental health users should be cared for in a way that is equitable with patients with physical health problems 4) Does voluntary admission and treatment imply the right to voluntary discharge/refusal of treatment? 5) Does the law state that a voluntary patient is informed at the time of admission, that they may only be denied the right to leave if they meet the conditions for involuntary care? a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) 2) The statute does not provide for obtaining informe d consent from patients before treating them. Note that the unadopted 1990 proposed statute, Part III, Paras. 11. (2), (3), would have required prior cons ent for treatment of voluntary patients, and substituted consent (by a relative or responsible adult) for those unable to consent. 3) The law does not state that people admitted as vo luntary mental health users should be cared for in a way that is equitable with how people with physical health problems are treated. The law states that a voluntary patient \" may discharge himself at any time upon givingwritten no tice to the chief administrator of the hospital,\" Part II, Para. 7. (1) . After the giving of written notice, however (which under Part II, Para. 7. (4) must be at leas t 72 hours before the proposed discharge), it is presumably possible for the chief administrator to seek temporary or prolonged commitment of the person. Moreover, P art II, Para. 7. (2) states that the chief administrator \"may discharge a voluntary patient . . . where he i s satisfied that the patient has recovered from his m ental illness sufficiently to justify such discharge.\" It is not clear whether patients admitted for phy sical conditions are subjected to the same discharge hurd les. Any prevention of discharge must be on the basis of clearly set out c riteria 4) Voluntary admission /treatment does not seem to im ply the right to voluntary discharge/refusal of treatment. There is no provisi on in the law requiring that the voluntary patient be advised that under some circum stances his request for discharge can be denied. 5) The voluntary patient is not informed of the possi bility of being denied discharge only if he or she meets the criteria for involuntary admission at that time. H. Non-protesting patients 1) Does the law make provision for patients who are incapable of making informed decisions, but who do not refuse treatment? 2) Are the conditions under which a non- a) b) c) a) 1) The law does not make provision for patients who a re incapable of making informed decisions, but do not refuse treatment, so-called n on-protesting patients. Although Part II, Para. 5. (1) states that an application for volunta ry admission can be made on behalf of the patient by a \" responsible person,\" it is not clear under which circumstances this pro cedure may be used (for example, whether it is only availa ble when the person does not have the capacity to make the decision seeking treatment on his or her own). Therefore, it is not clear whether this provision applies to non-protest ing patients. With respect to release from the hospital, Part II, Para. 7. (3) provides that t he chief administrator may discharge to a relative or other suitable person \"a voluntary patient. . . incapable of expressing h is intentions.\" The issue of non-protesting patients refers primari ly to patients who do not meet the criteria for either voluntary or involuntary treatment, for example, patients with mental retardation. 260 protesting patient may be admitted and treated laid out? 3) Does the law state that if a user admitted/treated under this provision objects to their admission/treatment they must be discharged/treatment stopped unless the criteria for involuntary admission are met. b) c) a) b) c) In such cases, the need for hospitalization alone c an be sufficient to warrant such an admission. Although the criteria for admission as a non-protesting patient are generally considered to be not as rigid as for involuntary pa tients, non-protesting patients should nevertheless qualify for automatic review procedure s. 2), 3) The statute does not set out any conditions for th e admission or treatment of non- protesting patients. The inclusion of such language in the law would be helpful because the statute does include persons who could potentially meet this criterion in Part V, Para. 25 (\"persons suffering from. . . arrested or incomplete development of mind\" ). Presumably, the requirement in Part II, Para. 6. (1) permitting admission of a voluntary patient \"if adequate facilities for his treatment are available \" provides some protection against admitting a person with mental retardation to a fac ility that did not have appropriate habilitative services. However, the provisions for temporary (Part III, Para. 8) and prolonged commitment (Part III, Para. 9) do not hav e such a limitation, other than that the purpose of the temporary commitment, at least, is t o place the person under \"care, observation and treatment.\" I. Involuntary admission (when separate from treatment) and involuntary treatment (where admission and treatment are combined) 1) Does the law state that involuntary admission may only be allowed if:- a) there is evidence of mental disorder of specified severity b) there is likelihood of harm to self or others and/or deterioration in patient's a) b) c) a) b) 1a) The statute does not limit involuntary admission to people who have a mental disorder of specified severity. Part III, Para. 8. (1), prov ides for temporary commitment (for up to six months) of individuals where \"it is expedient for the welfare of any person beli eved to be suffering from mental illness, or for public safety , that such a person should be placed under care, observation and treatment in a psychiat ric hospital.\" Pursuant to Part III, Para. 9. (1), which provides for prolonged treatment (for up to 18 months, a period that can be renewed), a person with a mental disorder may be co mmitted where \"by reason of the severity or nature of the mental illness it is nece ssary for the welfare of such person or for the public safety that he should be placed under pr olonged treatment. . .\" These standards are vague and conclusory, though it is perhaps impl icit that prolonged treatment should only be used when the mental illness is reasonably severe. Having a mental illness in itself should not be use d to justify involuntary admission and treatment. The law needs to be specific regarding t he reasons for involuntary admission. Both Part III, Para. 8. (2)(a) and Part III, Para. 9. (3)(a) require the admitting doctor to \"specify in full details the reason why he consider s that person to be a proper subject for [care, observation and treatment ] [or] prolonged treatment.\" However, the statute provides no substantive guidance on what those reas ons should be. Because the reasons for admission can vary from one doctor to another, ther e is a need for consistency in the law. Therefore, it is necessary to stipulate specificall y the reasons that can lead to involuntary admission, such as: the presence of a diagnosable mental disorder coupled with i) dangerousness to self; ii) dangerousness to others; or iii) grave disability, such that there is a high risk of serious deterioration in his or her mental condition. Admisison criteria also needs to include reference to therapeutic purpose o f the admission. See below. 261 condition if treatment is not given c) admission requires a therapeutic purpose 2) Does the law state that two accredited mental health care practitioners must certify that the criteria for involuntary admission have been met? 3) Does the law insist on accreditation of a facility to admit involuntary patients? 4) Is the principle of the least restrictive environment applied to involuntary admissions? 5) Does the law make provision for an independent authority (e.g. Review Body or tribunal) to authorise all involuntary admissions? 6) Are speedy timeframes laid down within which the independent authority must make a decision? 7) Does the law insist that patients, families and legal representatives be c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) 1b) While concern for public safety can be a basis for both temporary and prolonged commitment, there are no provisions establishing th at there must be any likelihood of harm to self or others and/or deterioration in the patie nt's condition in the absence of treatment. In many societies, people with mental disorders are perceived to be threats to the public safety simply because they suffer from a mental dis order. Yet people with mental disorders are no more dangerous than the general population ( and for some mental disorders may be considerably less so). Within the category of pote ntial harm to self or others, there is no requirement that there be any recent overt act demo nstrating such dangerousness. 1c) The statute does not require that admission serve a therapeutic purpose. The requirement that the person be \"placed under care, observation and treatment,\" would still permit admission for custodial or other non-therapeutic purposes. If involuntary admission does not ultimately lead to a n improvement in the person's clinical conditions, the rationale for admission is called into question. 2) For temporary commitments, the statute provides, P art III, Par. 8. (1), that there must be two medical recommendations for admission, one of which must be from a practitioner experienced in psychiatry. Prolonged treatment under Part III, Par. 9. (1), (3) requires only one medical recommendation, thoug h it must be from a practitioner experienced in psychiatry. There is no definition of \"experienced in psychiatry\" and the statute is silent on accreditation of either of these two medical practitioners. 3) While the statute permits the Commissioner to est ablish psychiatric hospitals, Part I, Para. 1. (1), and requires him to ensure they me et certain standards of cleanliness, patient clothing, patient nourishment, receipt of a dequate care and treatment, and investigation of complaints, it does not establish any requirement that the hospital be accredited as such. 4) The principle of the least restrictive environmen t is not applied to involuntary admissions. 5) The statute provides that a magistrate must authori ze all temporary commitments of up to 6 months (Part III, Para. 8. (4)) and all pro longed commitments of up to 18 months (Part III, Para. 9. (7). In addition, while the Mental Health Review Tribunal established in Part IV does not \"authorize all invo luntary admissions,\" it does have authority, if requested, to review the conditions o f detention or to grant the person's discharge, pursuant to Part IV, Para. 16. 6) There are no time frames (speedy or otherwise) est ablished for either the magistrate to make the initial commitment decision nor for the Mental Health Review Tribunal to act. Given the lengthy time of \"temporary commitme nt\" (6 months) and \"prolonged commitment\" (18 months, renewable), the absence of time frames is especially problematic. 7) The law does not provide that patients' families and legal representatives be informed of the reasons for admission, and their ri ghts with respect to appeal. Although it might be possible through the Mental He alth Review Tribunal to apply for a review of admission, the statute does not require that the patient and his legal 262 informed of the reasons for admission and their rights with respect to appeals? 8) Does the law provide a right to appeal an involuntary admission? 9) Are there time-bound periodic reviews of involuntary (and long term 'voluntary') admission cases in the legislation? 10) Does the law specify that patients must be discharged from involuntary admission as soon as they no longer fulfil the criteria for involuntary admission? b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) representatives be informed of this right upon admi ssion. 8) Again, there is no specific right to appeal, thoug h review of the initial involuntary commitment may be possible through the Mental Health Review Tribunal. It is not clear what procedures the Trib unal applies to requests that people submit to it. 9) There are no time-bound periodic reviews of involun tary admissions. Temporary admissions are limited to 6 months, and p rolonged admissions to 18 months, but the latter are renewable. (Note: in the 1990 proposed statute, the 18- month commitment would not have been renewable.) It is not clear who bears the burden of persuasion on renewals of prolonged commi tment. 10) The statute does not provide for discharge from inv oluntary admission as soon as the patient no longer meets the criteria fo r involuntary admission. While the chief administrator may discharge a voluntary p atient \"where he is satisfied that the patient has recovered from his mental illn ess sufficiently to justify such discharge,\" Part II, Para. 7. (2), there is no comparable prov ision in the involuntary commitment sections (and even in the vo luntary context, such discharge is not mandatory and is based on vague cr iteria.) The patient or interested person on his behalf can apply to the Me ntal Health Review Tribunal for discharge pursuant to Part III, Para. 16. (b), but the law is silent on what the standards for discharge are. A provision requiring discharge as soon as the person no longer meets admission criteria is import ant to ensure that patients do not experience the \"massive curtailment of liberty\" entailed in involuntary commitment any longer than is necessary. J. Involuntary treatment (when separated from involuntary admission) 1) Does the law set out the criteria that must be met for involuntary treatment including: Patient suffers from a mental disorder Patient lacks capacity to make informed treatment decisions a) b) c) a) b) 1)-7) Because the statute does not separate out involunt ary treatment from involuntary admission (and, indeed, does not even address the issue of involuntary treatment at all), we do not separately analyze the issues in this section. Suffice it to say that the statute does not provide for consent t o treatment, treatment plans, for time-limited use of involuntar y treatment, or for independent or periodic review of any such treatment. 263 Treatment is necessary to bring about an improvement in the patient's condition and/or restore capacity to make treatment decisions and/or prevent serious deterioration and/or prevent injury or harm to self or others. 2) Does the law ensure that a treatment plan is proposed by an accredited practioner with expertise and knowledge to undertake treatment? 3) Does the law make provision for a second practitioner to agree on the treatment plan? 4) Is an independent body set up to authorise involuntary treatment? 5) Does the law ensure that treatment is for a time limited period only? 6) Does the law provide a right to appeal an involuntary treatment? 7) Are there speedy time-bound periodic reviews of involuntary treatment in the c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) 264 legislation? b) c) K. Proxy consent for treatment 1) Does the law make provision for a person to consent to treatment on a patient's behalf if they have been found incapable of consenting? 2) Are patient's given the right to appeal in circumstances of proxy consent? 3) Is provision made in legislation for an \"Advance Directive\"? a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) 1)\u20143) The statute does not provide for proxy decision making or advance directives for patients incapable of consenting to treatment. Not having provisions for proxy decision making means either that patients are cons enting to treatment even though they are incapable of making decisions, or else are being denied treatment becau se of that incapacity. Although many persons with mental diso rders have capacity to make decisions, for those who do n ot, surrogate or proxy decision making can provide an alternative way of proceeding that respects the per son's autonomy and interests to the maximum extent possib le. L. Involuntary treatment in community settings 1) Does the law provide for involuntary treatment in the community as a \"less restrictive\" alternative to an in-patient mental health facility? 2) Are all the criteria and safeguards required for involuntary inpatient treatment included for involuntary community treatment? a) b) c) a) b) c) 1), 2) The statute does not provide for involuntary trea tment in the community as a \"less restrictive\" alternative to in -patient care. Other than mentioning that voluntary patients may be treated e ither as in-patients or out-patients (Part II, Para. 6 (2)), the statute is silent on community-based care, however provided. In accordance with Princip le 9 (1) of the MI Principles, every patient shall have the right to b e treated in the least restrictive environment and with the least restrict ive or intrusive treatment appropriate to the patient's health nee ds and the need to protect the physical safety of others. Examples of less restrictive environments could include home-based care, day hos pital treatment and out-patient treatment. Community supervised orders can also be used where patients are required to reside at a specific location and attend regular treatment programmes in the community. M. Emergency situations 1) Is the criteria for emergency a) 1) Although Part III, Para. 10., provides criteria fo r emergency or urgent care, those criteria are quite vague and present a seriou s opportunity for abuse. Para. 10. (1), permits detention \"in a case of urgency,\" when a medical officer determines \"it is expedient either for the welfare of the pers on suspected. . . to be 265 admission/treatment limited to situations where there is a high likelihood of immediate and imminent danger or harm to self and/or others? 2) Is there a clear procedure in the law for admission and treatment of emergencies? 3) Does the law allow any qualified and accredited medical or mental health practitioner to admit and treat emergency cases? 4) Does the law specify a time-limitation for emergency admission (usually not longer than 72 hours)? 5) Does the law specify the need to initiate the procedures for involuntary admission and treatment, if needed, as soon as possible after the emergency situation? 6) Are treatments such as ECT and psychosurgery as well as participation in clinical or experimental trials outlawed for people held as emergency cases? b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) suffering from a mental illness, or for the public safety, that such person should be forthwith placed under care, observation, or tre atment.\" Admitting a person simply because he or she has a mental disorder cann ot be regarded as an emergency, and would constitute a violation of huma n rights. The public safety prong of the definition is not limited to cases whe re there is a high likelihood of immediate and imminent danger to self or others. 2) There seems to be a clearly defined procedure for a dmission in urgent cases. Part V, Para. 10. (1), provides that a \"registered medical practitioner\" (not defined in the statute, however) must certify the c ase as one of urgency. Urgent cases can be immediately admitted to a psychiatric hospital, but Part V, Para.10. (2) provides that if immediate admission to a psych iatric hospital is impracticable, a patient can be moved to a place of safe custody before transfer to a hospital. If the person is admitted to the place of public safety, he or she must be transferred to a psychiatric hospital within 5 d ays, whereupon he can be held for up to another 14 days. 3) As discussed in the previous section, a \"registere d medical practitioner\" must certify admission of an urgent case. The statute is silent on whether there is any special qualification or accreditation needed to tr eat a patient so admitted, but presumably anyone can do so. 4) As discussed in section 2 above, the statute does specify a time limit for emergency admission. However, the time limit is muc h longer than 72 hours. Rather, it is 14 days or, if the person is transfer red from a place of public safety, 19 days. Such a lengthy period of \"emergency\" dete ntion raises serious human rights issues. 5) While the statute requires that procedures for in itiating involuntary admission must be started before the end of the 14 (or 19) da y period of urgent admissions, there is no requirement that such procedures be act ivated as soon as possible after the emergency admission. While scarce resources mi ght make a 72-hour limitation on emergency admissions difficult to mee t, a 14- or 19-day waiting period is an excessive time to wait before starting longer-term commitment procedures. 6) Because treatments such as ECT, psychosurgery and participation in clinical research trials are not mentioned in the law (see s ection O, below), there are no provisions limiting such modalities for emergency p atients or in fact any other voluntary or involuntary patient. 7) According to Part IV, Para. 16, any person (presum ably including patients, their families and personal representatives) has th e right to apply to the Mental 266 7) Do patients, family members and personal representatives have the right to appeal against emergency admissions/treatments? a) b) c) Health Review Tribunal to review, among other thing s, the conditions under which a person is detained. Presumably, this langu age is broad enough to include challenging emergency treatments or admissions. Ho wever, this right of application is not an appeal as such, but rather re lief in the nature of habeas corpus in which current conditions of confinement m ay be challenged (as opposed to the original decision being appealed). N. Determinations of Mental Disorder 1) Does the legislation a) define the level of skills required to determine mental disorder? b) specify the categories of professionals who may assess a person to determine the existence of a mental disorder? 2) Codify the accreditation of practitioners in law and ensure that it is operated by an independent body? a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) 1) a) The legislation in part defines the level of skil l required to determine a mental disorder. Under Part III, Para. 8. (1), \"two medical recommendations\" must support a request for the magistrate to order temporary treat ment of the patient (for up to six months). Pursuant to Para.8. (2), one of these med ical recommendations \" shall be from a practitioner experienced in psychiatry.\" For prolonged treatment under Part III, Para. 9. (2), (3), the statute requires one me dical recommendation from a practitioner experienced in psychiatry. The above references to \"medical recommendations\" do not set out the level of medica l expertise required to make the recommendation. The \"practitioner experienced in ps ychiatry\" provides important additional language, but the statute might go furth er by stating the level of experience in terms of years worked in psychiatry or mental he alth qualifications. b) The categories of professionals who may assess a person to determine the existence of a mental disorder are not well-defined . The statute does not define the category of professional empowered to make the \"med ical recommendation\" described above. The \"practitioner experienced in psychiatry\" provides additional clarification but is still ambiguous. The law needs to be clear on the different categories of mental health /health professionals w ho may determine mental disorder. In many African countries, primary health care is p redominantly provided by trained general nurses (there is no mention of nurses in th e legislation). If decentralization is to be effective, the role of the primary health car e provider should be defined. It is not possible in resource poor settings to expect only m ental health professionals to provide this service. It may become necessary to em power the primary health care worker with skills in simple identification of ment al disorders through training programmes at the community level. 2) The law does not codify the accreditation of pract itioners. O. Special treatments 1) Does the law prohibit sterilisation as a treatment for mental disorder? a) Does the law specify that the mere fact of having a mental a) b) c) a) b) 1)--4) The statute does not refer to any special treatments; thus, it is silent regarding whether in formed consent is needed for sterilization, abortion, majo r medical and surgical procedures, psychosurgery, and ECT (whether or not unmodified). It is not clear how many of these special treatments are in fact used i n Ghana. For example, in many African countries, abor tion 267 disorder should not be a reason for sterilisation or abortion without informed consent 2) Does the law require informed consent for major medical and surgical procedures on persons with mental disorder? a) Does the law allow medical and surgical procedures without informed consent if waiting for informed consent would put the patient's life at risk? b) In cases where inability to consent is likely to be long term does the law allow authorisation for medical and surgical procedures from an independent review body or by proxy consent of a guardian? 3) Is psychosurgery and other irrever- sible treatments outlawed on involuntary patients? a)Is there a independent body that ensures that there is indeed informed consent for psychosurgery or other irreversible treatments on involuntary patients? 4) Does the law specify the need for informed consent when using ECT? c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) is illegal, although the rights of people with ment al disorders have been known to have been violated sim ply because society perceived sterilization of these individuals to be appropriate. Part V, Para. 19, au thorizes transfer of a patient of a psychiatric hospital to another hospital where necessary, but does not set out any procedures for performing treatment there (includin g the need for informed consent, as well as any exception s, such as in emergencies). 268 a) Are adequate procedures laid down in legislation for exceptional cases of using ECT without informed consent but with the approval of a court , tribunal or other review body? b) Does the law prohibit use of unmodified ECT? a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) P. Seclusion and Restraint 1) Does the law state that seclusion and restraint should only be utilised in exceptional cases to prevent immediate or imminent harm to self or others? 2) Does the law specify a restricted maximum time period for which seclusion and restraints can be used? 3) Does the law encourage the development of appropriate structural and human resource requirements that minimise the need to use seclusion and restraints in mental health facilities? 4) Does the law lay down adequate a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) 1)- 3) The statute does not address seclusion and restrain t. The law needs to be clear on issues of restraint an d seclusion because these practices lead to some of the most co mmon forms of human rights violations regarding people w ith mental disorders. Seclusion and restraint should on ly be used, if at all, when they are the only means avail able to prevent immediate or imminent harm to self and othe rs, and then for the shortest period of time necessary (for minutes or at most a few hours). Seclusion and restraint are never appropriate as me ans of punishment or for the convenience of staff. 269 procedures for the use of seclusion and restraint including: Who should authorise it That the facility should be accredited that the reasons and duration of each incident be recorded in a database and made available to a review board that family members/carers and personal representatives be immediately informed when the patient is subject to seclusion and restraint a) b) c) 4) Because the statute does not address seclusion and restraint, it does not set out any procedures for t heir use. The statute must address who can authorize seclusion an d restraint; whether only accredited facilities can a vail themselves of these options; limitations on the per missible purposes and duration of seclusion and restraint, w ith documentation of such, available for independent ou tside review; and immediate notice to family members, car ers, and personal representatives of the patient when these procedures are used. Q. Clinical and Experimental Research 1) Does the law state that informed consent must be obtained for participation in clinical or experimental research from both voluntary and involuntary patients who have the ability to consent? 2) Where a person is unable to give informed consent (and where a decision has been made that research can be a) b) c) 1) The statute does not address clinical or experime ntal research. Thus, it does not provide for obtaining informed consent from voluntary and involuntary patients wit h the ability to consent for participation in clinical or experimental research. 2 a) The statute does not provide for proxy consent f or participation in research by patients unable to giv e informed consent. 270 conducted) a) Does the law ensure that proxy consent is obtained from either the legally appointed guardian/family member or from an independent authority constituted for this purpose? b) Does the law state that the research cannot be conducted if the same research could be conducted on people capable of consenting and that the research is necessary to promote the health of the individual him/herself and that of the population represented? a) b) c) a) b) c) The statute does not address the requirement that r esearch be conducted on people capable of giving informed cons ent or that any research on people incapable of giving con sent be justified as necessary to promote the health of the individual and the population the individual represents. The statute only addresses informed consent in Part II, Para. 7 (3), Voluntary Admission, when it provides that i f a patient cannot express his intentions regarding discharge, the chief administrator may discharge the person to a relativ e or other suitable person, subject to certain conditions. R. Oversight and Review Mechanisms 1. Does the law set-up a Judicial or quasi-judicial body to review processes related to involuntary admission/treatment and other restrictions of rights 1a. Does the above body: (i). Assess each involuntary admission/ treatment (ii). Entertain appeals against involuntary admission and/or a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) 1) The statute establishes a Mental Health Review Trib unal in Part IV, Paras. 15-17. The Tribunal comprises five members, with a legal practitioner as chairman, a psychiatrist, a medical practitioner, and two other persons appointed by th e Commissioner. The Tribunal, however, does not appe ar explicitly to review \"processes related to involuntary admissi on/treatment and other restrictions of rights.\" 1a. (i) This body does not assess each involuntary admission/treatment. However, a person (or someone on his behalf) can request the Tribunal to \"review the conditions under which he is detained; or request. . . his discharge ; or request. . . any other appropriate action.\" (Part IV, Para. 16). 1a. (ii) This body does not explicitly entertain appeals fr om involuntary admission or treatment, but has the lan guage quoted in the previous section. 271 involuntary treatment; (iii). Review the cases of patients admitted on an involuntary basis (and long term voluntary patients); (iv). Regularly monitor patients receiving treatments against their will; (v). Authorize intrusive and irreversible treatments 1b. Does the composition of this body include an experienced legal and experienced health and a \"wise person reflecting a \"community\" perspective. 1c. Does the law allow for appeal of this bodies decisions to a higher court? 2) Does the law set up a regulation and oversight body to protect the rights of people with mental disorders within and outside mental health facilities? 2a) Does the above body c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) 1a. (iii) This body does not systematically review the case s of patients admitted on an involuntary basis (and long -term voluntary patients), though, presumably, it can be asked to r eview such cases pursuant to the language quoted in 1a.(i) above. 1a. (iv) The body does not appear to regularly monitor pati ents receiving treatment against their will. 1a. (v) The body does not appear to authorize or address th e implementation of intrusive and irreversible treatm ents (which are not discussed in the statute). 1 b. The Tribunal includes a legal practitioner (as ch airman), a psychiatrist, and another medical practitioner. Th ere is no requirement that these individuals have any particu lar level of experience. The Commissioner appoints two addition al people to the Tribunal, but there is no requirement that they necessarily reflect a \"community perspective.\" There is no app arent role for self- advocates on the Tribunal. 1 c . The statute does not provide for appeal of the Tr ibunal's decisions to a higher court. 2) The statute creates visiting committees for each p sychiatric hospital (Part I, Para. 4). The Commissioner must appoint committees of three or more visitors. The visiting committees do not appear to operate \"outside mental health facili ties.\" 2a)(i) The visiting committee does conduct regular inspe ctions of 272 (i) Conduct regular inspections of mental health facilities; (ii) Provide guidance on minimising intrusive treatments (iii) Maintain statistics, for example use of intrusive and irreversible treatments, seclusion and restraints. (iv) Maintain registers of accredited facilities and professionals (v) Report and make recommendations directly to the appropriate government minister. (vi) Publish findings on a regular basis 2b) Does the composition of the body include professionals (mental health, legal, social work), representatives of users of mental health facilities, members representing families of people with mental disorders, advocates, and b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) psychiatric hospitals. Under Part I, Para. 4, the visiting committee meets at the hospital at least quarterly and conducts ins pections, examines books and accounts, and investigates any complaints . 2a)(ii) The visiting committee does not appear to have the authority to provide guidance on minimizing intrusive treatments (though it could presumably receive complaints about such treatments ). 2a)(iii) The visiting committee does not appear to maintain statistics on intrusive and irreversible treatments or other matt ers, though it is required to submit a written report to the Commissi oner after each quarterly visit, indicating places visited and whet her or not conditions were satisfactory, and making any recommendations i t deems appropriate (Part I, Para. 4 (3)). 2a)(iv) The visiting committee dos not maintain registers o f accredited facilities and professionals. 2a)(v) The visiting committees, as indicated above, are r equired to make quarterly reports to the Commissioner, through the Director of Medical Services. 2a)(vi ) It does not appear that the visiting committees publish their findings on a regular basis, or at all. Public reports on conditions in psychiatric facilit ies, with appropriate protections for patient privacy and confidentiality , can provide an important check on abuses within institutions and c reate an avenue for public focus on institutional conditions. 2b) As noted, the visiting committees have three prof essionals (a legal practitioner, a psychiatrist, and a medical p ractitioner) and two additional people. While these people can pres umably be drawn from family members, advocates, and mental he alth system users, there is no requirement that they represent these groups or their interests. 273 lay persons depending on the resources available. 2c) Is the authority this body has clearly stated in the legislation 3) Does the legislation outline procedures for submissions, investigations and resolutions of complaints? 3b) Does the law stipulate The time period from the occurrence of the incident within which the complaint should be made? A maximum time period within which the complain should be responded to, by whom and how? The right of patients to choose and appoint a personal representative and/or legal counsel to represent them in any appeals or complaints procedures? The right of patients to an interpreter during the proceedings, if necessary? The right of patients and their counsel to a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) 2c) The visiting committee's authority is clearly sta ted in the statute, though its powers are mostly in the nature of observing and reporting to the Commissioner rather than actin g on their own. 3) The statute does not outline procedures for visiti ng committees for submission, investigation, and resolution of co mplaints, though, as noted, these committees are authorized t o receive complaints \"preferred by or against any officer, staff or pati ent.\" Part I, Para. 4 (2) (c). 274 access copies of their medical records and any other relevant reports and documents during the complaints or appeals procedures? The right of patients and their counsel to attend and participate in complaints and appeals procedures? a) b) c) a) b) c) S. Police Responsibilities 1) Does the law place restrictions on the activities of the police to ensure that persons with mental disorders are protected against unlawful arrest and detention and are directed towards health care services? 2) Does the legislation allow family members, carers or health professionals to get police assistance in situations where a patient is highly aggressive or is showing out of control behaviour 3) Does the law allow for persons arrested for criminal acts and in police custody to be promptly assessed for mental disorder if there is suspicion of mental disorder? 4) Does the law make provision for the police to assist in removing a person a) b) c) a) b) c) a) b) c) a) 1) The statute gives the police broad power, pursuant to a warrant issued by a magistrate, to seek out a person believed to be suffering from mental illness who is either being ill- treated or neglected or is living alone and unable to care for himself, and \"to enter, if need be by force, any premises specified in the warrant in which that person is believed to be, and, if thought fit, to remove him to a place of sa fety with a view to [applying for temporary commitment for up to six months or making] other ar rangements for his treatment or care.\" Part V, Para. 22 (1). The police officer, where pr acticable, should be accompanied by a mental welfare officer and by a medical practitione r. The individual may be detained for no more than 72 hours. Under Part V, Para. 23 (1), th e police may detain without a warrant (also for up to 72 hours) a person in a public plac e \"who appears to him to be suffering from mental illness and to be in immediate need of care or control.\" While these provisions could serve to protect the rights of peo ple with mental disorders, and do entail transferring the individual to the mental health sy stem within a relatively brief period, they also present opportunities for mischief, in that th e standard for intervention is vague and subject to varying interpretations. It also is not clear how these two provisions relate to the urgent commitment provisions referred to in Part II , Para. 10. Police officers are often the first professionals t o come into contact with persons who may be suffering from a mental disorder. It is critica l that the police receive training in mental health and related areas to permit them to carry ou t their responsibilities in an appropriate manner. 2) The above provisions, especially Para. 22 (1), might permit a family member, carer or health professional to contact the police and get a ssistance in dealing with a patient who is highly aggressive or out of control, though they ap pear oriented more toward protecting the person who is being ill-treated or neglected by his caregivers. 3) The statute does not provide for prompt assessment of arrestees for the presence of a mental disorder when there is a suspicion that such disorder exists. The only provision addressing the intersection between the mental heal th system and the criminal justice system is in Part V, Para. 20, which permits (but d oes not require) the Commissioner to establish (a) state psychiatric hospital(s) for tre atment of persons facing criminal proceedings or currently in prison.

Introduction Once a policy/draft policy has been drawn up in a c ountry, it is important to conduct an assessment of whether certain processes have bee n followed that are likely to lead to the success of the policy; and whether various c ontent issues have been addressed and appropriate actions included in the policy. Thi s checklist is intended to assist with this evaluation. While the checklist is limited in that it does not enable assessment of the quality of the processes or contents of the policy, evaluators are encouraged, when completing the checklist, to consider the adequacy of both the process and content. Particularly where a response is \"no\" or \"to some extent\", it is sugge sted that they provide either an action plan to remedy the situation or a comment.. (In some instances the comment may, for example, merely be that a particular actio n is covered in a different policy, or that it is not possible to implement given the curr ent resources available). The different modules in the WHO Mental Health Policy and Service Guidance Package can be consulted for more guidance on how to addres s relevant sections and for a better understanding of the policy issues mentioned in the checklist. This checklist may usefully be completed by those w ho drafted the policy and/or by employees in the government itself. However, it is also important to have independent reviewers. Those involved in drawing up the policy may have pe rsonal or political interests or may be \"too close\" to the po licy to see anomalies or provide critical input. Ideally, therefore, an independent multidisciplinary team should be convened to conduct an evaluation. A team is also a dvantageous as no single person is likely to have all the relevant information require d, and debate is crucial for arriving at an optimal policy for the country. Furthermore, when relevant interest groups have been involved in the process of the development of the policy and/or in their evaluation, which leads to changes being made to th e policy, it is likely that they will be more effectively implemented. It would be usefu l to include consumer organizations, family organizations, service provid ers, professional organizations and NGOs, as well as representatives of other governmen t departments affected by the policy. Finally, although the checklist should be \"scored\" in terms of the mental health policy document, it is important to have, or be familiar w ith, other relevant and related documentation. Often items are not covered in the m ental health policy because they are comprehensively covered elsewhere. For example, policies on health information systems or human resources may include mental healt h and are therefore deliberately not repeated in the mental health policy. This expl anation should then be noted in the relevant section. \u00a9 World Health Organisation. This checklist has been developed by Dr Michelle Fu nk, Ms Natalie Drew and Dr Faydi, Mental Health Policy and Service Development, Department of Menta l Health and Substance Abuse, World Health 283 Organisation, Prof Melvyn Freeman, Human Sciences R esearch Council, Pretoria, South Africa and Dr Sheila Ndyanabangi, Ministry of Health Uganda. 284 CCHHEECCKKLLIISSTT FFOORR EEVVAALLUUAATTIINNGG AA MMEENNTTAALL HHEEAALLTTHH PPOOLLIICCYY Please use the following rating scale to rate each item: 1 = yes/ to great degree 3 = no/not at all 2 = to some extent 4 = unknown Rating If \"yes\" or \"to some extent\" please state how.

Have policies relating to mental health that hav e been utilized within the country and in other countries with similar cultural and demograph ic patterns been examined and integrated where relevant? 2 Not all the policies are fully implementd. Consultation with other countries was not extensive More re3esources to be allocated to improve the implementation 4. Has a thorough consultation process taken place with the following groups: -- Representatives from the Health Sector, includi ng planning, pharmaceutical , human resource development, child health, HIV/AIDs, epidemiology and surveillance, epidemic and disaster preparedness divisions. 2 Planning Officer, Medical Directors of the psychiatric hospitals, in consultation with the Ministry, PPME and Health Research Directorate were involved but not the others People were working independently.

Mental health is a priority only on paper. In real ity it is very poorly resourced. The policy documen t is well-formulated. However, since it is the Mini stry of Health which has to decide on the priorities, and for now mental health is not one of the priorities. For this reason the resources req uired for the implementation of mental health servi ces are very limited. There is a lot of lip service in terms of commitmen t to implement the mental health strategies and pla ns. Mental health appears too expensive for the pol icy makers to implement 293 CHECKLIST FOR EVALUATING A MENTAL HEALTH PLAN. Introduction Once a Plan/draft plan has been drawn up in a count ry, it is important to conduct an assessment of whether certain processes have been f ollowed that could lead to the success of the plan, and whether various content is sues have been addressed and appropriate actions included in the plan. This chec klist is intended to assist with this. While the checklist is limited in that it does not enable assessment of the quality of the processes or contents of the plan, evaluators are e ncouraged, when completing it, to consider the adequacy of both the process and content. Particularly where a response is \"no\" or \"to some extent\", it is suggested that t hey provide either an action plan to remedy the situation or a comment.. (In some instan ces the comment may, for example, merely be that a particular action is cove red elsewhere, or that it is not possible to implement given the current resources a vailable). The different modules in the WHO Mental Health Policy and Service Guidance Package can be consulted for more guidance on how to address relevant sections a nd for a better understanding of the issues mentioned in the checklist. This checklist may usefully be completed by those w ho drafted the plan and/or by employees in the government itself. However, it is also important to have independent reviewers. Those involved in drawing up the plan may have pers onal or political interests or may be \"too close\" to the pl an to see anomalies or provide critical input.
