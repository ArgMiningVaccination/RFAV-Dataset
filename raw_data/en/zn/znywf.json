About Maryville College Maryville College is a four -year, co -educational, liberal arts college. Founded in 1819 as the Southern and Western The ological Seminary, it was originally intended as a seminary. Quickly realizing that most students were unprepared for graduate study in theology, its founder, Dr. Isaac Anderson, began to offer preparatory \"literary\" courses. In 1842, the charter from the state of Tennessee was granted for \"Maryville College.\" Following the disruption of the Civil War, the College reopened and moved to its present location. Through almost two hundred years, the College has withstood major wars, economic upheavals and chan ging social realities. By adapting to its shifting environments, the College has remained a strong and vibrant academic community respected for academic excellence and sincerity in implementing its purpose. As the 12th oldest institution of higher learni ng in the South, the College maintains an affiliation with the Presbyterian Church (USA). Known for its academic rigor and its focus on the liberal arts, Maryville is where students come to stretch their minds , stretch themselves and learn how to make a di fference in the world . 2016-2017 Academic Calendar FALL SEMESTER 201 6 Date Event Thu, Aug 2 5 Orientation classes begin for first -year students Fri, Aug 26 Classes continue for first -year students Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 4 Date Event Sat-Sun, Aug 27 -28 Classes continue for first -year students Mon, Aug 29 Orientation classes begin for all new transfer students Mon, Aug 29 Registration - All students Mon -Tue, Aug 29 -30 Classes continue for all new students Wed, Aug 31 Fall semester classes begin for returning students Thu, Sep 1 Opening Convocation Mon, Sept 5 Labor Day Holiday Fri-Sun, Oct 14-15 Long Weekend Fri, Nov 3 Last day to withdraw from a course and receive a \"W\" Wed -Sun, Nov 2 3-27 Thanksgiving Break Fri, Dec 9 Classes End Mon -Thu, Dec 7 -10 Examination Period Fri, Dec 1 6 - Sun, Jan 8 Christmas Break JANUARY TERM 201 7 Date Event Mon, Jan 9 January Term c lasses begin Mon, Jan 16 Martin Luther King Day* Fri, Jan 2 7 January Term c lasses end Sat, Jan 2 8 January Term snow m ake-up day (Morning class es recess at 10:30 a.m. Afternoon classes meet normal schedule) SPRING SEMESTER 201 7 Date Event Mon, Jan 30 Registration Wed, Feb 1 Spring semester c lasses begin Sat-Sun, Mar 18-26 Spring Break Wed, Apr 11 Last day to withdraw from a course and recei ve a \"W\" Fri, Apr 14 Good Friday - College Closed Sat, Apr 22 Academic Award Ceremony Fri, May 12 Classes end Mon -Thu, May 15-18 Examination period Sun, May 21 Baccalaureate & Commencement SUMMER SESSION 2017 Date Event Thu, Jun 1 First 3 -week , 5-week, & 11 -week terms begin Wed , Jun 21 First 3 -week term ends Tue, Jul 4 Fourth of July Holiday - College Closed Thu, Jul 6 First 5 -week term ends Fri, Jul 7 Second 5 -week term begins Fri, Aug 11 Fri, Aug 18 Second 5 -week term ends 11-week term ends Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 5 A Church -Related College for the 21st Century Maryville College proudly claims its Presbyterian heritage; from the time the Rev. Isaac Anderson founded the college in 1819 to train ministers for the frontier of the United States until today, when w e enjoy a rich diversity of students. While holding strongly to its Presbyterian connection, the College honors and welcomes students from all backgrounds and religious traditions. The practice of faith and learning at Maryville College connects scholarshi p, worship, and community, by giving each student a place to explore, a place to grow and a place to commit. The whole community is invited to worship at the Center for Campus Ministry each Tuesday at 1:15. Faith and Learning Statement Maryville College , related by voluntary covenant to the Presbyterian Church (USA), seeks to provide a quality liberal arts education that encourages the search for truth in all areas of life. One of sixty -five colleges related to the PC (USA), Maryville College is a part o f the wider mission and witness of the Presbyterian Church in the world. The Presbyterian tradition, with its historical emphasis on both an educated clergy and an educated laity, provides the theological framework for such an institution of higher educat ion. Reformed theology places all reality in relationship to God and thus finds all subject matters worthy of study, while acknowledging, in an attitude of humility, that all human answers are at best provisional. The church \"Reformed and always reforming\" encourages the sort of ongoing openness to revisiting the questions and revising the answers that a true liberal arts education invites. As a church -related liberal arts college, Maryville College strives to provide a quality education in a spiritually r eflective and ethically responsible manner by creating an environment that: Challenges students to think carefully and critically about all matters in life, including religious, spiritual and ethical matters, Equips students to examine and reflect on ques tions of faith, meaning and value, Provides students with a wide -ranging literacy about the Christian tradition, including knowledge of the diversity of world cultures and religions, and Offers students opportunities for worship, service and fellowship in a community of integrity, respect and scholarship. \"Church -relatedness\" does not presume that all members of the community must share the institution's Presbyterian or even Christian convictions, but asks that they respect that church - related identity whi le thoughtfully giving voice to their own convictions. As the College's Statement of Purpose says, \"the College believes that it must listen attentively and humbly to all human voices so that it may hear the call of God no matter how God may speak.\" A genu ine church -related liberal arts college must ensure that both diversity and Christian identity are present on campus in a creative balance. The goal of a Maryville education is not simply the adoption of a particular stance or worldview, but rather the sea rch for truth, wherever it may be found, and the ability to recognize and take seriously life's basic questions of faith, meaning and value. Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 6 Maryville College takes its church -relatedness seriously, as it recognizes and affirms its role in the formative e ndeavor of spiritual, intellectual and moral development. By engaging students both inside and outside the classroom, and by providing them with a nurturing community and environment, Maryville College seeks to equip students with the tools that will help them build a mature and credible faith for an increasingly complex world.

This contract delineates the financial obligation that is incurred by attending the College, and ensures that students read, understand, and accept this commitment. Students with cred it account balances will receive a check from the Business Office. Maryville College follows Federal guidelines for the issuance of checks to students with Title IV credit balances. The staff members in the Business and Financial Aid Offices are available to assist students in financial planning. COSTS For 2016-17, the basic annual costs are: Tuition $32,746 Fees $778 Room $5,450 Board $5,418 A schedule of miscellaneous fees is available upon request in the Business Office. Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 12 *Premium room and additional meal plans will change these basic costs; check with the Business Office for details. CHARGE REDUCTION POL ICY Registration in the College is considered a contract binding students for charges for the entire semester. However, it is the policy of Maryville College to give pro -rata charge reductions through 60% of the enrollment period in the event a student officially withdraws from school. Students must complete and return a withdrawal form to the Registrar's Office in order t o be officially withdrawn. Students who are unable to withdraw in person may do so by notifying the Registrar's office and the Dean of Students. The withdrawal date is defined as follows: In general, in this section, the day the term `day the student with drew' is the date that the institution determines: the student began the withdrawal process prescribed by the institution; the student otherwise provided official notification to the institution of the intent to withdraw; or in the case of a student who does not begin the withdrawal process or otherwise notify the institution of the intent to withdraw, the date that is the mid -point of the payment period for which assistance under this title was disbursed or a later date documented by the institution; or Notwithstanding the paragraph above, if the institution determines that a student did not begin the withdrawal process, or otherwise notify the institution of the intent to withdraw, due to illness, accident, grievous personal loss, or other such circumst ances beyond the student's control, the institution may determine the appropriate withdrawal date. Reductions will be computed on total charges for tuition, fees, room, and board. Students are expected to vacate the residence halls immediately upon withd rawal from College. Students leaving school for disciplinary reasons will not be eligible for any reduction and will be liable for the entire semester's charges. Full -time students who withdraw from individual classes after the drop/add period will receive no charge reduction. Students who withdraw prior to the 60% period during the spring semester and ha ve attended J -Term will be charged for J -Term retroactively. For purposes of interpreting this policy the pro -rata charge reduction percentage is determin ed by the Federal Financial Aid policy and the percentage is calculated by the Business Office based on the withdrawal date. No charge reduction will be given after the 60% period of enrollment for the semester or term. When student charges are reduced, Fe deral, State, Institutional and Non -Institutional Aid will be adjusted in accordance with the regulations governing the respective programs. Students may contact the Financial Aid Office for current regulations concerning these programs. Leaving the Colleg e without officially withdrawing may result in a student forfeiting all financial aid and, thus, becoming responsible for the entire balance. FINANCIAL AID The majority of Maryville College students receive scholarship and/or need based assistance. Maryv ille College scholarships are renewable provided the student maintains an appropriate minimum grade point average (GPA) and/or participation in a particular program or performance group. GPA renewal requirements are on the student's \"Your Messages\" Tab of the Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 13 MC Online Financial Aid System. Other program requirements can be clarified by the coordinator of the program in which the student participates. Eligibility for need based aid (i.e. Federal Pell Grants, Tennessee Student Assistance Awards [TSAA], Fede ral Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants [SEOG] and/or MC Grant) or student loans is determined by the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Students must complete the FAFSA as soon as possible after January 1. TSAA is awarded on a first -come - first served basis. MC students who file late for the FAFSA may miss out on valuable grant assistance from the state. Students may view their personal financial aid information and accept their financial aid awards on the MC Online Financial Aid Sys tem at http://finaid.maryvillecollege.edu/NetPartnerStudent . Students who have questions about financial aid awards or the HOPE/TELS scholarship program should visit the Financial Aid Of fice, Fayerweather Hall, Office 141. TELS (TENNESSEE EDUCATIONAL LOTTERY PROGRAM) Tennessee residents who receive scholarship assistance through the Tennessee Education Lottery Scholarship program (e.g. HOPE/TELS Scholarship) need to be aware of the rene wal criteria. Eligibility shall be reviewed by the institution at the end of the semester in which the student has attempted credit hours of 24, 48, 72, 96, and any subsequent multiples of 24 semester credit hours thereafter. In order to maintain eligibili ty students must adhere to the following criteria: Earn a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.75 after 24 and 48 attempted semester credit hours; AND Earn a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.00 after total attempted credit hours 72, 96, and any subsequent multiples of 24 thereafter; OR Earn between a 2.75 - 2.99 cumulative GPA after attempted credit hours of 72, 96, and any subsequent multiples of 24 thereafter and have a semester GPA of at least a 3.0 in the semester in which the student attempts 72, 96, and any subseq uent multiples of 24 attempted semester hours thereafter (Students will be reviewed on a semester -by semester basis and must maintain full -time enrol lment). Know that if they cease to be academically eligible for the HOPE Scholarship, they may regain the a ward once. The award may be re -established once the student meets any of the above criteria and continues to meet non -academic requirements. Is continuously enrolled at an eligible postsecondary institution in the fall and spring semesters and maintains sa tisfactory academic progress. All course grades are included in the calculation of the cumulative TELS GPA . Attempted hours include courses in which students enroll but withdraw after the official drop/add date, remedial coursework, and any courses taken at another higher education institution that were completed after students ' graduation from high school. The TELS program provides a Repeat Provision that offers students the ability to repeat one course to improve their TELS GPA. A Regain Provision exists that allows students to regain their HOPE /TELS at subsequent benchmarks. Each of these provisions may be used once. Students should consult the Financial Aid or Registrar 's Office staff for more detailed explanation or assistance in interpreting the rules of the programs. Students must submit a FAFSA based on the \"prior prior year,\" as defined by federal Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 14 methodology, as soon as possible after October 1 in order to renew their HOPE/TELS scholarship for the next year. Tennessee HOPE Scholarship Terminatio n Criteria Students may receive the HOPE Scholarship until the first of the following terminating events: Student has earned a baccalaureate degree; or Five years have passed from the date of initial enrollment at any postsecondary institution; or Student has received the award for eight full-time equivalent semesters ; or Student has attempted at any postsecondary institution the lesser of the number of semester hours required to earn the baccalaureate degree or a total of 136 semester hours. Maryville Col lege requires 128 credit hours for a baccalaureate degree; therefore, the HOPE Scholarship ends after 128 attempted hours at MC. Students with a documented medical condition , certified by a licensed physician that restricts their ability to maintain a full -time schedule , may appeal to the Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation (TSAC) for an extension to the five-year limit. However, they must continue to meet all applicable academic and nonacademic requirements for the HOPE Scholarship. Such students hav e ten years from initial enrollment in which they can maintain eligibility. WITHDRAWAL PROCEDURE Should a student decide during the year or at the close of the year to terminate enrollment at Maryville College, the withdrawal procedure is as follows: 1.Report to the Student Development Office, Bartlett Hall and obtain a Student Withdrawal Form 2.Have form signed by each area listed on the Student Withdrawal Form 3.Take the completed Withdrawal Form to the Business Office, Fayerweather Hall Students are respon sible for any balances due after the withdrawal is processed. Students are responsible for any costs incurred by the College, including collection and litigation costs. Refunds, when appropriate, will be processed as promptly as possible. Students who do n ot follow official withdrawal procedures may forfeit their deposit. Withdrawal from the College, voluntarily or involuntarily, requires resident students to abide by the official check -out procedures. Failure to do this will result in an \"improper check -out fee.\" Resident students should vacate the room and leave campus within a twenty -four hour period. CALCULATING WITHDRAWAL REFUNDS When students register for courses, the College assumes full -year enrollment, provides facilities, and executes contracts to provide educational services for the entire year. Federally mandated refund calculations apply when students withdraw. When recipients of student financial aid withdraw, refunds must be returned to various financial aid programs as well as the individu al student. The actual cash refund students receive is pro -rated by the amount actually paid or owed. Students who receive financial aid, and are subject to a refund, might not be eligible for a cash refund. At times, refunds may be reapplied to a loan, th us reducing student indebtedness. Upon withdrawal, any cash refunds due will be processed as quickly as possible, but requires a Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 15 minimum of 14 days. Refunds are only calculated and based on charges for tuition, fees, room, and board. No refunds will be m ade to students unless they withdraw from all courses in which they are registered. For refund purposes, the date of withdrawal is the date that the withdrawal process is initiated or College personnel are provided with notification of intent to withdraw. The withdrawal date for students who quit without formally withdrawing is will be based on the last date an academic function was attended. The act of attending any class for a given semester prior to withdrawing is considered to constitute a requirement for withdrawal calculations. Students who withdraw from all classes or who stop attending classes, but who receives permission to live in the residence hall, will be charged room and board for the time they remain in the residence hall and on a meal plan. Charges and financial aid for students who change from full -time to part -time status during the drop/add period at the beginning of the semester will be revised on that basis. Students may use the first week of the semester to finalize registered courses without incurring additional fees. No refund is given for students who change from full -time to part -time status after the first ten days of the semester. Students defined as part -time who withdraw after the drop/add period will receive refunds under the same policy as full -time students. Classes dropped after this time will be considered as withdrawn and may impact a student's satisfactory progress evaluation or academic standing (see Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy on the Financial Aid webpage). Federal guidelines assume that students earn financial aid based on the period of time enrolled. Unearned Title IV funds, other than federal work study, must be returned to the federal government. During the first 60 percent of the enrollment period, stud ents earn Title IV funds in direct proportion to the length of time enrolled. Students who remain enrolled beyond the 60 percent point earn all of their aid for the period. Students who give notice to withdraw from the College before the end of the term w ill have charges and refunds calculated on the basis of the percentages as outlined in the following paragraphs. The amount of Title IV and other aid that must be returned to a program source will be calculated and charges will be adjusted by the aid ear ned in order to determine the total amount for which a student is responsible for payment to the College. Return of Title IV Funds Calculation The percentage of aid earned by Title IV recipients is determined by calculating the percentage of the term co mpleted. Scheduled breaks of at least five days in length are excluded in the calculation. Beyond the 60% period students are charged for the entire semester with no reduction of charges. The percentage of the term completed is calculated as follows: ( Days completed in period) / (Total days in period) = % of period completed. The amount of earned Title IV aid is determined by applying the earned percentage to the total Title IV aid that was or could have been disbursed to a student. (% of period completed) x (Title IV aid that was or could have been disbursed) = Earned Aid. The amount of Title IV aid to be returned is determined by subtracting the earned aid from awarded Title IV aid (disbursed or could have been disbursed, excluding Federal Work Study). Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 16 The responsibility to repay unearned aid is shared by the College and its students in proportion to the aid each is assumed to possess. The institution's share is the lesser of the total amount of unearned aid or the institutional charges multiplied by th e percentage of aid that was earned. The student share is the difference between the total unearned amount and the institution's share. All unearned Title IV funds for which the institution is responsible will be returned to the Department of Education w ithin 45 days from the date the College determines a student to have withdrawn. The College's share of funds related to unearned aid is allocated among the Title IV programs, in an order specified by statute, before the student's share is calculated. Aft er the student share is fully allocated among the Title IV programs, students will only owe grant overpayments if the overpayment exceeds 50% of the Title IV grant aid received ; however, students are not required to return grant overpayments of $50 or less . Refunds and repayments will be distributed to the appropriate Title IV, HEA programs in the following order: Federal Parent Plus Loan Federal Perkins Loan Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan Federal SEOG Grant Federal Pel l Grant Other Title IV grant or loan assistance if applicable Earned Title IV funds are administered according to the calculation below that determines the amount to be returned and application of the total charges. Institutional, State and Outside Funds Refund Calculation Maryville College follows the Federal refund calculation guidelines for all other aid including institutional, State and outside funds. The 60% point of the enrollment period is determined by dividing the date of withdrawal by the total number of days in the enrollment period. The amount of unearned aid is determined by subtracting the earned aid from aid that either has been , or could have been disbursed. The unearned aid is allocated back to other programs using the same Federal per centage calculations. Institutional Grants and Scholarships Institutional Loans Outside or Private Loans Outside or Private Grants or Scholarships State Grants The amount a student must pay for the percentage of the payment period completed is determined by subtracting the Earned Title IV Aid and Other Earned Aid from the Pro Rata Charge for the period completed. If the amount owed is greater than the amount actually paid, the student is responsible for paying the difference. If the amount owed by the s tudent is less than the amount actually paid, the student is due a refund. Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 17 After the refund calculations have been completed, any remaining outstanding charges will be added to the final bill. A copy of the Final Return to Title IV Refund Calculation for m may be obtained from the Financial Aid Office for review.

Disregarding the following regulations is sufficient grounds for severe disciplinary action: A student shall not disregard a fire alarm or refuse to evacuate a building dur ing a drill or an actual fire. Tampering with fire equipment on campus constitutes a serious threat to the safety and welfare of the community. Any person(s) responsible for tampering with fire equipment, exit signs, smoke detectors or fire alarms will be subject to fines, dismissal and/or prosecution under all municipal and state laws. The minimum penalty for violations of campus safety will be a $1000 fine. When violators cannot be identified, the residents will share equally in the damage assessment for the public areas in their residence hall. Passageways and fire exits must remain clear at all times. Fire regulations require that fire doors remain closed at all times. Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 20 Candles may not be burned in the residence halls. Candles with wicks that have nev er been burned are allowed. Incense is not allowed in the halls. Any prank involving flame or fire in a College building is prohibited. Students violating this regulation will be subject to suspension or dismissal. Setting off smoke bombs, which result i n the activation of a building's fire or smoke alarm, will result in a minimum fine of $1,000 and disciplinary action.

Below are some available resources: www.nssinc.com www.csiprotection.com www.haylor.com/student Each student should maintain a personal inventory of items (TVs, DVD players, etc) including serial numbers. This is helpful in recovering lost or stolen items. On campus vehicles and residence hall room doors should be locked whenever the student is not present. In the event of theft, notify Campus Security at 865.981.8112. MARYVILLE COLLEGE PA RKING AND TRAFFIC REG ULATIONS The traffic and parking regulations of Maryville College are designed to provide a safe flow of traffic and to make the best use of parking facilities. To accomplish these goals, it is necessary for the entire College communit y to become familiar with the regulations and abide by them. The Maryville College campus is located on 320 acres of land, much of which is wooded. The College community and the surrounding community use the College Woods for quiet walks, bicycling, picnic s, and cross -country running trails. Motor vehicles are not permitted in the College Woods off of paved roads. Students found to be in violation of this policy will be subject to disciplinary action. The following Traffic and Parking Regulations are posted on the College's website and are also available in the Campus Security Office. A parking map is located at http://maryvillecollege.edu/media/dsx/manage r/Documents/About/InsideMC/CampusParkin g.pdf Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 21 Vehicle Registration Persons who use or park vehicles on campus are subject to the following regulations: All faculty, staff, and students (full - or part -time), who operate a vehicle on College property, r egularly or occasionally, are required to obtain a parking decal. Vehicles may be registered online during the summer, during class registration, at the Security Office, Bartlett Hall 116, and at the Student Development Office, Bartlett Hall 327, between 8 :00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. The registration of all vehicles parked on campus is required, but registration is no guarantee of a convenient parking space near the place where one works, resides, or attends classes. The responsibility of finding a legal parking space rests with the vehicle operator and lack of a parking space is not a valid excuse for violation of any parking regulations. Students must obtain a parking decal for each academic year or portion thereof. Parking decals for faculty and staff may be obtained at the time of employment or any time during the academic year. A parking decal must be displayed on the vehicle no later than the first day of classes of the new semester. The parking decal must be completely attached a nd displayed on the outside of the rear window in the lower left hand corner (driver's side) of the registered vehicle. The parking decal must be permanently affixed to the outside of the vehicle and not taped to the inside of the window. The parking decal must be able to be read from the rear of the vehicle. Vehicles owned or driven by students may not be registered in the name of a faculty or staff member. Should a parking decal become mutilated or obliterated in any way, a new decal must be obtained at the Security Office in Bartlett Hall 116. When the remnants of the old decal are presented, a replacement decal will be issued free of cost. The parking decal holder is held responsible for all citations issued against the vehicle. Citations will not be excused on the plea that another person was driving the vehicle. The College assumes no financial responsibility for the theft of or damage to motor vehicles or their contents when the vehicle is parked or operated on campus or elsewhere. A change of lic ense plates must be reported to Security within 48 hours of such change. In the event of a new vehicle, students must bring the old parking decal and register the new vehicle with the Director of Security within 48 hours. There is no charge for the new decal. Fees for vehicle registration: Campus Resident Parking: Full Year/$60 - After Jan 1/$30 Commuter Parking: Full Year/$60 - After Jan 1/$30 Parking Permits and Parking Zones The campus parking system is divided into zones.

General Information The President of Maryville College approves these regulations. The College Security Department has the responsibility and the legal authority for the enforcement of the Traffic and Parking Regulations. The use, possession, and parking of an automobile while a student, employee, or visitor of Maryville College is considered a privilege. The abuse of that privilege will result in the denial of automobile use on Mary ville College property. The College considers the use of a vehicle on campus a convenience and is not obligated to furnish unlimited parking space to accommodate all vehicles. The College will, however, attempt to provide a reasonable number of parking sp aces in keeping with available resources. The purchase/possession of a parking permit in no way guarantees an individual a parking space on campus. Every person operating a motor vehicle on College property is held responsible for obeying all College traf fic and parking regulations as well as all city and state parking and traffic regulations. The term \"College property\" is interpreted to include all properties under the control and jurisdiction of the Board of Directors of Maryville College. The term \"V isitor\" is interpreted to mean an individual with no official connections with the College as a student, faculty, staff member, or employee of private contractors assigned to Maryville College. Individually assigned visitor parking places are set aside fo r special interest areas of the College. College personnel, students, or employees of private contractors assigned to Maryville College may not utilize these spaces. These spaces are reserved for official visitors to the College. Handicapped parking is pr ovided in many parking lots on campus. These spaces are reserved 24 -hours a day, seven days a week for the holders of handicapped parking permits. If a vehicle becomes temporarily disabled and cannot be parked in its assigned area, it must be reported to Security. The fact that the vehicle is temporarily disabled will be Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 26 recorded and an officer will either render assistance or authorize temporary parking. Temporary parking will only be authorized for 24 -hours or less. If parking for a longer period is nece ssary, it must be renewed at 24 -hour intervals. Temporary parking will not be authorized in areas that are not parking spaces (tow away or no parking zones, etc.) or in handicap parking. A permit may not be purchased for display on a disabled vehicle. For these purposes, a disabled vehicle is a vehicle that has been disabled for more than two weeks. Services such as \"jump starts\" are offered by Security as time permits. Security does not change flats, unlock cars, push or tow cars, or perform any major au tomotive service. Security officers will help find assistance when possible. The speed limit on campus roadways and thoroughfares is 20 mph; the speed limit within the parking lots is 10 mph. Vehicles are not to be operated in any manner so as to constit ute vehicular/pedestrian traffic hazards or to impede the flow of vehicular or pedestrian traffic. Pedestrians on campus have the right of way at all times. Students, faculty and staff are expected to be familiar with and abide by these regulations at al l times. The fact that a certain citation is not issued when a vehicle illegally parks does not mean or imply that the regulation or law is no longer in effect. Vehicles parked on campus, which are considered to be abandoned, will be towed. The responsib ility for obtaining knowledge of all laws and regulations in force rests with the motor vehicle operator. Always lock vehicles and drive safely. MARYVILLE COLLEGE WO ODS (MCW) Please respect the following when visiting the MCW: Please stay on existing trails.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERT Y Introduction The faculty, staff, and Board of Directors at Maryville College encourage scholarship, creativity, and innovation that may result in the creation of intellect ual property. The purpose of this Intellectual Property Policy is to establish mutual understanding of ownership, rights, and responsibilities related to the development, production, dissemination and sale of intellectual property created by full -time and part -time Maryville College faculty, staff, and students. Definition of Intellectual Property For the purpose of this policy, the term \"intellectual property\" includes, but is not limited to, works of authorship inclusive of all mediums of expression (re lated to copyrights) and inventions and discoveries (related to patents). Ownership of Intellectual Property In most circumstances, the faculty member, student or staff member who creates the intellectual property has sole and exclusive ownership rights r elated to its sale, transfer, or use. In the development of intellectual property, the author/creator is responsible for obtaining permission or authorization for any use of copyrighted material or trademark (including that of the College) that may be incl uded within the work itself. Following AAUP guidelines, there are certain situations in which Maryville College may claim ownership of intellectual property created by faculty, students, or staff. These situations include: Works that are \"made for hire,\" created as a specific requirement of employment, as an assigned job duty, or in completion of a course assignment. (Note that a work is not necessarily classified as \"made for hire\" on the basis of use of College resources, facilities, or materials that a re traditionally and commonly available to faculty and other members of the College community). Negotiated contracts in which the author/creator has transferred or specified, in writing, a portion of ownership to the College, and \"Joint works\" as describe d in the Copyright Act, where the institution can be considered a co-author.\" The College is entitled to joint ownership in situations where it has contributed specialized services and facilities to the production of the work that goes beyond what is tradi tionally provided to faculty members generally. College resources include but are not limited to: College funds, supplies, computer resources, learning resources, equipment, software, the College name, personal position or status within the College, course enrollment, and/or College personnel. Such arrangements for joint ownership should be agreed to in writing, in advance of the creation of the intellectual property, and are in full conformance with other provisions of this agreement. To avoid conflicts r elated to ownership of intellectual property, faculty, staff and students should be aware that intellectual property issues may arise as a result of their work and should meet with the appropriate Vice President to establish a mutually agreeable understand ing of ownership issues prior to its creation. This understanding is to be set forth in writing and signed by all parties who may have reason to believe that they would have some rights of ownership. Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 29 This agreement should clearly set out the specific owner ship or co -ownership arrangements between the creator and the College and is to be signed by the appropriate Vice President. In situations where an external party provides support or sponsorship in the form of a grant, contract, or other agreement, owne rship of the intellectual property should be clearly negotiated prior to initiating the work. In such cases, the College may be allocated some rights of ownership. Responsibility for exploring procedural rules and ownership guidelines of granting agencies or individuals lies with the person or persons who will be creating the intellectual property. In situations where the individual or granting agency does not address the ownership issue, the guidelines and rules set forth in this document will prevail. Copyrights, patents, and other documents and contracts related to ownership of intellectual property are filed in the Maryville College Business Office. Written agreements of individual arrangements made between faculty, students and or staff members who cr eate intellectual property and the Vice President under whose direction the activity or intellectual property is associated are to be completed and filed in the office of the appropriate Vice President and in the Business Office. The College will be primar ily responsible for oversight and protection of intellectual property that is jointly owned by the College and its faculty, staff or students. Use of Intellectual Property Much of the creative work at Maryville College that has the potential for being de signated as intellectual property relates to material utilized by the College for educational and administrative purposes. As members of the College community, faculty, student, and staff creators agree that the College is allowed to use the works without charge in its ongoing operations. Such arrangements enable the College to operate efficiently without undue infringement on the creators' right of ownership. It is understood that this use will be limited to non-revenue purposes. Departures from this use a greement are to be incorporated into any agreement that transfers copyright/ownership to a publisher or other entity. Materials such as course syllabi, assignments, and examinations etc. that are created for ordinary use in Maryville College classrooms r emain the intellectual property of the faculty creator. However, ongoing permission for the College to use these materials for internal use is assumed unless prior limitations for their use by the College are made in writing. Students, likewise, remain the owner of intellectual property they create as a part of their educational productivity (term papers, senior study, projects, etc.). It is also assumed that the College has ongoing permission to use these materials as examples of its students' work and for curricular or program assessment unless prior limitations for their use are made in writing. Distribution of Revenue The sole owner of intellectual property, whether faculty member, student, staff member, or the College, is entitled to any proceeds of th e sale of the property and is entitled to distribute or expend funds associated with those proceeds at will. In situations where there are multiple creators or owners, proceeds are to be distributed in accordance with the allocations as negotiated by the p arties at the inception of the project. Should conflict arise from situations where allocations are unclear, or were never negotiated, the allocation will be decided upon according to the dispute resolution process outlined below. Future Negotiations and Dispute Resolution Due to the changing nature of intellectual property rights, contracts, and policies within higher education, the College recognizes the need to create processes for review and renegotiation of Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 30 the intellectual property policy as well as the need to designate a process whereby disputes related to intellectual property can be resolved. Because faculty members are most closely associated with activities that can result in creation of intellectual property, responsibility for intellectual property policy review and revision rests with the Academic Dean (or designee) in consultation with the Faculty Personnel Standards Committee. Disputes related to ownership of intellectual property are referred to the Faculty Hearing and Appeals Committe e who, upon receipt of an appeal, will create an Ad Hoc Committee to hear the dispute and to render a decision. The composition of the Ad Hoc Committee will consist of three members of the Faculty Hearing and Appeals Committee chosen by vote of that commit tee and two staff members or administrators appointed by the President of the College. None of the three faculty members of the Ad Hoc Committee should be a member of the same academic division as any faculty member included in the dispute. In situations w here there are claims of ownership that affect multiple academic divisions such that there are not three faculty from unrelated divisions elected to the Faculty Hearing and Appeals Committee, the Dean of the College will appoint the needed number of facult y members to serve on the Ad Hoc Committee. The Ad Hoc Committee will elect its own convener and recorder and will follow the hearing procedures for the Faculty Hearing and Appeals Committee as published in the Faculty Handbook. The committee will gather i nformation, hear arguments, review materials, and may consult legal counsel. Ultimately it will make a decision regarding the rights, ownership, management, and other aspects associated with the intellectual property in dispute. Full consideration will be given by the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiating an acceptable compromise among the parties throughout the dispute procedure. In cases where the parties disagree with the Ad Hoc Committee decision, they may pursue external legal remedy. Any portion of the Intellectual Property Policy that is prohibited or deemed unlawful will be invalidated without effect on the remaining provisions set forth in the policy. Approved 2009 STUDENT GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE In the spirit of the Maryville College Statement of Pu rpose, the College sees itself as a \"community of learning that includes persons with a variety of interests, backgrounds, beliefs and nationalities.\" Such differences in attitude and perspective may, at times, result in problems or situations that warrant further institutional review and intervention. Procedures are in place for appeals of various College policies. Students should refer to the appropriate section of this catalog related to specific appeal processes related to grades, suspension, financial aid, disability service, judicial sanctions, and sexual grievances. Filing a Formal Complaint In an effort to provide students with an appropriate and effective response to situations not otherwise addressed in specific appeal processes, students should send a written explanation of their concern/complaint to the appropriate College official for review and resolution. Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 31 Concerns/complaints related to academic matters Most academic issues can be resolved informally through conversation with the faculty m ember or staff person involved or through consultation with the appropriate division chair. In situations where this has not provided adequate resolution, the concern/complaint should be directed in writing to the Academic Dean or Associate Academic Dean. Concerns/complaints related to another student(s) or a student development activity Students are encouraged to discuss concerns with the other student(s)/staff member involved with the problem. In situations where this has not provided adequate resolution , the concern/complaint should be directed in writing to the Dean of Students or to the Assistant Dean of Students. Concerns/complaints related to a financial matter Most financial issues can be resolved through discussion with the appropriate College st aff member. In situations where this has not provided adequate resolution, the concern/complaint should be directed in writing to the Vice President and Treasurer. College Response Upon receiving a written concern/complaint, the appropriate Vice President or designee will initiate an investigation of the student concern/complaint within 10 working days. The student filing the concern/complaint will receive timely written notification of the College response to the concern/complaint. Records of written stud ent concerns/complaints will be maintained in the Office of the Associate Academic Dean for five years. Further protocol guidance regarding the complaint process may be found at http://www.ticua.org/abou t/complaint STUDENT RECORDS Maryville College maintains institutional records relating to each student.

Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 34 STUDENT RESOURCES ACADEMIC SUPPORT CENTER Maryville College offers an effective and wide array of academic support for its students. The mission of the Maryville College Academic Support Center is to provide academic enhancement and support to students wh ile encouraging independent learning. All students are encouraged to avail themselves of the services offered. The office is located in the lower level of Thaw Hall and is open 8:00 -5:00 Monday through Friday. Students may drop in the office, contact sta ff by email, or dial the main office number 865 -981-8124. ACADEMIC SUPPORT SERVICES Individualized Learning Strategies Academic Support Center staff offer consultations to individuals throughout the semester, focusing on individual learning styles, text book reading, note -taking, test preparation, and test taking. Other topics include academic goal setting, organization, and time management. Students may meet with either the Academic Support Coordinator , Learning Support Specialist, or the Academic Suppor t Center Director located in the lower level of Thaw Hall for consultations on individual learning strategies. Group Study Sessions Group Study is the largest component of the College's academic support system and focuses on collaborative learning through weekly peer -led sessions. Sharing opinions, class notes, reflections, ideas and theories in preparation for exams, assignments, and class projects are just a few of the beneficial reasons to utilize group study sessions on campus. Group Study sessions are led by Academic Mentors who are either Dean or Presidential Scholars enrolled in the particular course and whose placements in Group Study are centered on specific skill sets, academic interests and ability, and chosen majors. Each semester, the Academi c Support Center schedules group study sessions for many of MC's classes. The times and locations can be found on the Academic Support Schedule which is available in the Academic Support Center, on -line on the Academic Support Center webpage, and is poste d in Thaw Hall and Cooper Athletic Center. Most study sessions are held in the Lamar Memorial Library and in the Cooper Success Center. Supplemental Instruction Supplemental Instruction (SI) sessions are weekly informal review sessions in which Supplemen tal Instruction Leaders guide student review and learning through regular practice of course material. The sessions are facilitated by SI leaders, students who have previously done well in the course, have specific SI training in group facilitation and le arning strategies, and who come back into the class weekly attending all class lectures, taking notes, and acting as model students. SI Leaders work closely with the faculty teaching the particular course to create sessions that integrate how -to-learn with what -to-learn. During each weekly review session, SI Leaders guide students through class material in a collaborative environment where students work together to discuss important concepts, develop strategies for studying the subject, practice content and material, and test each other. The Academic Support Center currently offers SI sessions in BIO 113, BIO 115, CHM 111, CHM 121, CHM 122, CHM 223, CHM 224 , and PHY 102 . A schedule of weekly sessions and locations are available each semester. Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 35 Cooper Succes s Center Located in the Cooper Athletic Building, the Cooper Success Center (CSC) is a student -led and College staff -supervised tutoring center, as well as a staff -supervised study hall. Focusing on the specific and demanding needs of the Maryville College student -athlete, the CSC provides assistance with a variety of courses. The center, as a direct extension of the Maryville College Academic Support Center, is well -equipped to provide assistance in crucial study, test -taking, and writing skills for all st udents. All student -athletes are encouraged to attend weekly CSC study sessions. Student -athletes can locate the schedule either online or within the Cooper Athletic Center. DISABILITY SERVICES The Academic Support Center's Disability Services offers a wide variety of services to students with disabilities or chronic medical conditions. The office is located in lower level of Thaw Hall . Regular office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday. The staff is available to answer questions du ring these hours and may be reached by calling (865) 981 -8124. Students may also email the office at academicsupportcenter@maryvillecollege.edu . Mission Statement Disability Services se eks to collaborate with and empower students who have disabilities in order to coordinate support services, classroom and residential accommodations that enable equal access to the academic and residential campus life. Disability Services is committed to working with students, staff, and faculty in developing and implementing the most appropriate strategies for a successful learning experience while maintaining the academic standards and integrity of the mission of the College. Disability Services Procedur es The steps to obtain services through Disability Services are described below: 1. Admission to Maryville College Students must meet all prerequisites for admission to Maryville College before receiving services through Disability Services. See the current Maryville College catalog for required admission standards. Before selecting and finalizing courses, students with disabilities may want to consult with Disability Services staff to review any disability -related factors that could come into account in dete rmining a final course schedule after admission to the College. 2. Registration for Services Students are responsible for disclosing a disability and requesting accommodations. Students must complete the registration for services and provide current docume ntation which documents the disability and supports the request for accommodations. Contact Disability Services to request the Registration of Services form. Students should meet with a Disability Services advisor in the Academic Support Center prior to the student's initial semester at Maryville College to determine reasonable accommodations. Additional time may be needed for some modifications, so ample time must be allowed for accommodations to be activated. Students may not receive any accommodatio n services until they are registered with Disability Services. This ensures that Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 36 the student is qualified as defined by the ADAA as having a disability and that the accommodations are reasonable for the disability. 3. Documentation Students are responsible f or disclosing the disability and requesting reasonable accommodations. Documentation is required specifying the disability, its impact, and severity, as well as substantiating the need for accommodations. A licensed clinical professional, familiar with the history and functional implications of the disability, must provide the required documentation. If the initial documentation is incomplete or inadequate to determine the extent or needs of the student, Disability Services has the discretion to require add itional documentation. Current documentation is required for permanent and/or temporary disabilities. In addition, students requesting accommodations for multiple disabilities must provide documentation of all such conditions. The documentation must subst antiate current functional limitations. It is the student's responsibility for the financial cost involved in obtaining documentation of a disability. Any additional documentation required or any re - evaluation to substantiate the nature of the disability i s also the financial responsibility of the student. Disability Services can refer a student to a diagnostician; however, Disability Services may not pay any fees for documentation purposes. 4. Intake Meeting and Accommodation Determination After completing t he Registration for Services and acquiring the necessary documentation, students should contact the Disability Services office and set -up an appointment with a disability services advisor to determine reasonable accommodations. Together the student and the disability services advisor will determine what accommodations are reasonable based on the severity and functional limitations of the documented disability. A reasonable accommodation is a modification or academic adjustment to a course, program, servic e, activity, or facility, which allows students with disabilities to achieve the same level of functioning as a student without a disability. There are three primary concerns when determining reasonable accommodations. First, the academic accommodation can not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others. Second, an accommodation is not reasonable if it substantially alters an essential element of the course or program. Lastly, an accommodation is not reasonable if it poses an undue hardship on the institution. Accommodations are not required if it is found that a direct threat to the safety of others exists. A direct threat is a significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated or reduced to an acceptable level by any mo difications of policies, practices, or procedures or by the provision of auxiliary aids or services. Disability Services staff believe that the student is the most valuable resource for determining effective accommodations. Disability Services assists stu dents in becoming self - advocates while supporting their essential needs. Disability Services assists faculty by providing information, validating, and providing necessary accommodations. Students who feel that they are experiencing problems in the College setting should contact the office as soon as possible to resolve any difficulties they may be experiencing regarding accommodations or access on campus. Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 37 Important Notes Based on Maryville College's educational philosophy, the value of faculty -student in teraction and small class size, requests for an accommodation for any class attendance policy will be considered on an individual basis, but may not always be granted. Students who believe that their medical or psychological condition may necessitate excus ed absences from class should discuss this with a Disability Services staff member. It is the student's responsibility to arrange for certain services that are outside the scope of Disability Services and Maryville College. These services include, but may not be limited to, attendant care, mobility training, items/services of a personal nature, and sources of financial aid. Disability Services staff are available to consult with students regarding special needs and possible local resources. Based on requi rements for graduation and completion of specific majors, Maryville College does not waive or substitute a course or major requirement that is considered fundamental to the academic program.

Participation in student organizations is an effective way to become involved in the life of the College, develop friendships, expand learning opportunities, and promote school spirit. In addition to clubs and organizati ons, the Student Government Association offers important opportunities for students to participate in college governance.

Student organization leaders are expected to work closely with faculty and staff advisors to develop and maintain appropriate organizational goals that are consistent with the mission and purpose of the College. Since organizations affect the College's culture, sense of community, image, and learning enviro nment, Maryville College holds every organization accountable for its actions and may sanction those that do not support the College's mission. With that in mind, the College has adopted the following guidelines for chartering and maintaining a student org anization. MC STUDENT ORGANIZAT ION GUIDELINES Maryville College student organizations in good standing will adhere to the following expectations. Constitutions and Statements of Purpose Any defining documents, such as constitutions or statements of pur pose, should be consistent with Maryville College's Mission Statement, Statement of Purpose, College Covenant, Non -Discrimination Statement, and Faith and Learning Document.

Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 62 LIVING IN COMMUNITY THE MARYVILLE COLLEGE COVENANT Preamble As members of the Maryville College community, we strive to grow in wisdom, spiritual understanding, and service to others. We honor the diversity of individuals while affirming values we can all share. As scholars, we strive to maintain a high level of academic integrity. As learners, we aspire to be responsible men and women of mutual appreciation and respect. We pledge, then, our ded ication to the community tenets of scholarship, respect, and integrity. Scholarship We commit ourselves to lifelong curiosity and learning, to the search for knowledge, and to intellectual creativity. Respect We commit ourselves to honor the worth, digni ty, and freedom of ourselves and all creation, and to treat others as we wish to be treated. Integrity We commit ourselves to truth, honesty, dependability, and responsibility in all our actions and relationships. Affirmation I affirm these standards as vital to my continued growth as a person. I realize that nothing is achieved by those from whom nothing is expected. I also recognize that constantly challenging myself to become a better person is the only way to achieve that end. I therefore join this covenant with the Maryville College community and vow to uphold the principles of scholarship, respect, and integrity. Revised, 2005 History of the Maryville College Covenant The Maryville College community, following the example of Jesus Christ, seeks to c hallenge all human beings to search for truth, to work for justice, to grow in wisdom, and to become loving persons. In 1990, Maryville College students adopted these ideals from the College's Statement of Purpose and created the Maryville College Covenant . This document sought to fuse and represent basic shared values and ideals in order to strengthen and affirm the College community. As the community has evolved, so has the expression of the Covenant. In 1996, staff and students instituted an annual cerem ony during which new students join the Covenant. In 2001, a Covenant Stone inscribed with the three principles of scholarship, respect, and integrity was erected in the center of campus. This touchstone serves as a constant reminder of the Covenant. The Ke epers of the Covenant, established by the College President in 2000, promote awareness of the Covenant and ensure its vitality. Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 63 COMMUNITY STANDARDS Community Standards provide a framework designed to support the Maryville College Covenant by encourag ing each person in the community to: Focus first on academics. Respect the rights of others, be they property, privacy, opinion or expression. Act with integrity in all interactions - academic, personal and beyond. Within this context student s assume the responsibility to: Abide by College, local, state, and federal laws and regulations Assist in creating and maintaining a learning atmosphere that affirms the rights, dignity and worth of all persons Conduct themselves in a moral and ethical manner regard ing academic pursuits, co - curricular activities, social customs, and personal behavior. The following Community Standards are of prime importance in building a campus community characterized by trust, respect and security. Violations may subject student s to judicial sanctions (see \"Judicial Sanctions\" in this Catalog) and/or separation from the College. Situations may arise that are not specifically covered by College regulations, but which adversely affect the welfare of the College community. In these instances, the Vice President and Dean of Students or his/her designee will evaluate the situation and take appropriate action. Off-campus student behavior that adversely affects the College community may also lead to disciplinary action. Students in violat ion of local, state, or federal laws may also be subject to disciplinary action by the College.

The College also notifies parents on the first drug offense. The College is allowed to contact parents concerning drug and alcohol vio lations, for students under 21 years of age, based on the 1998 Congressional revisions to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. Letters are normally sent to the student's home address and may be followed up with a phone call. It is our hope that t he student will notify their guardian of the violation before notification is received from the College. We hope that parent's knowledge of this type of violation will help deter students from future violation of these policies. Any questions concerning pa rental notification should be directed to the Assistant Dean of Students at 865.981.8215.

SOCIAL FRATERNITIES, SORORITIES, AND SEC RET SOCIETIES Maryville College believes tha t an inclusive, open community is fundamental to its mission as a residential institution of higher learning committed to the liberal arts tradition. It is for this reason that Maryville College has maintained a long history and tradition of not including fraternities and sororities in its campus life. Following ongoing community conversation through forums with all College constituencies, the Student Government Association (SGA) voted not to approve a fraternity at Maryville College. In consideration of th ese actions and beliefs, the Maryville College Board of Directors established a policy prohibiting all Maryville College students from joining or participating in fraternities or sororities, or similar selective membership social organizations, within the Maryville College campus community. Students involved in activities related to such organizations, including, but not limited to, rushing, pledging, perpetuating and initiating, are subject to disciplinary action.

The destruction or unauthorized use of property (including telephone access codes) or equipment belonging to the College or any person is prohibited. This includes all cam pus building, grounds, campus woods, ropes course, and athletic facilities. This also includes damage due to disorderly conduct or drunkenness.

JUDICIAL PROCESSES AND STUDENT RIGHTS Search and Seizure The College affirms and defends students' right of privacy yet must balance those rights with the students' responsibilities to operate within establishe d policy and with consideration for the rights of others. College personnel may enter a resident student's room in the event of an emergency or while conducting routine room inspections, maintenance inspections, and fire drills. College personnel may inspe ct student vehicles in the course of enforcing institutional traffic and parking regulations as well as in the event of an emergency. If reasonable cause exists to indicate a violation of College policy, College personnel may search the on -campus room, vehicle, or personal property of an individual with the expressed permission of the Vice President and Dean of Students or his/her designee. Rumor, speculation, or information provided anonymously is not considered reasonable cause for a search. Reasonable ca use is defined as a ground of action based on the good judgment of the College staff ascertained on the presence of tangible or physical evidence (sight, smell, sound) of the violation. In the event of a non-search oriented visit, where a violation is foun d to be occurring, the person(s) found in violation may be subject to disciplinary action. Preventive Action The College, through its designated officers, may suspend or restrict the campus activity of any individual whose behavior, emotional state, or ph ysical health constitutes a disruptive force on campus, poses a threat to the individual's well -being, or threatens the well -being of the College community or any of its members. Preventive suspension may be invoked temporarily by the Vice President and De an of Students or his/her designee for persons for whom disciplinary hearings, appeals, or criminal charges are pending. Any student suspended under such circumstances may be considered for readmission only with the expressed permission of the Vice -Preside nt and Dean of Students. The Vice President and Dean of Students can impose suspension or campus restriction when there is reason to believe that preventive action is necessary to maintain College activities or to protect the property and safety of indivi duals on the campus. Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 72 Suspension may require that the individual leave campus immediately. A decision of the Vice - President to suspend a student may be appealed to the President of the College. Students serving a preventative suspension may be required to submit to a psychological or medical evaluation, at their own expense, before they are allowed to return to campus. Information from these evaluations will be used to determine whether the student is safe to return to campus. Maryville College will not e xclude persons with contagious illnesses from access to College facilities or services unless a medically based judgment by the consulting physician and the College Medical Advisory Team establishes that exclusion or restriction is necessary to the welfare of the individual or other member of the College community. Any individual made aware of a contagious illness on campus is to consult with the Assistant Dean of Students at 981.8215 regarding College procedures and proper health care. Confidentiality will be strictly observed. Behavioral Contracts College officials may develop behavioral contracts with individuals when such action is deemed necessary to guide and support student success at the College.

Failure to fulfill the terms of a behavioral contract may subject the student to suspension from the College. Student Complaints Compl aints regarding students are handled as stated in the following judicial procedures. Complaints regarding faculty and staff are handled in accordance with policies and procedures as stated in the Faculty and Staff handbooks. Copies of these handbooks are a vailable in the Human Resources Office. Rights of the Accused Student In formal judicial hearings, any student may be assisted by an advocate from the College community. This advocate may confer with the accused but has no speaking rights in the hearing. Judicial hearings are not formal legal proceedings; therefore, legal counsel is not permitted to attend. Decisions of the Judicial Board are based on the evidence presented at the hearings and official College documents and correspondence contained in the student's record. The accused student may testify personally or decline to do so, present witnesses, and examine all evidence. Judicial Board decisions will be made based on a preponderance of the evidence. Accused student(s) may challenge for bias any mem ber of the Judicial Board. The Judicial Board rules on such challenges. All judicial hearings are closed unless all the complainants and accused students request otherwise in writing to the Chief Justice 24 -hours prior to the hearing. All persons present, excluding Judicial Board members and the advisor are excused from the hearing during the deliberation. Any student who is charged with a judicial infraction can choose to meet with the Assistant Dean of Students. During this meeting, the student will be g iven the option to accept responsibility for their actions and waive the Formal Judicial Process. The student and Assistant Dean will then come to an agreement on appropriate sanctions. Judicial Process 1. An incident report is filed with the Assistant Dean of Students by a Residence Assistant, Security, other College official, or campus community member. 2. The Assistant Dean of Students reviews the incident, determines violations, and meets with the accused student. Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 73 3. The student has an opportunity to accept res ponsibility, agree to sanctions set forth by the Assistant Dean of Students, and signs a waiver. (If the student signs the waiver form, the case is closed and recorded. If the student does not sign the waiver form, the case is referred to a judicial board. ) If the student does not meet with the Assistant Dean of Students, the student's case will be decided by the Assistant Dean. 4. If the case is referred to the Judicial Board, J -Board members are notified, and a hearing is scheduled. The student can present w itnesses and evidence on their behalf at the hearing. The accused student is notified of the Judicial Board decision. If the student accepts the decision of Judicial Board, the case is closed and recorded. If the student does not accept the Judicial Board decision, the student may appeal the decision based on a procedural error or a problem with the evidence presented. Appeals must take place within two (2) business days of the J -Board decision. If the case is appealed, it is sent to the Appeals Board. 5. The chairman of the Appeals Board is notified and a meeting is scheduled. The accused student is notified of the Appeals Board decision. 6. An appeal may be made to the College President only in cases of suspension or expulsion. STUDENT JUDICIAL BOA RD The Stude nt Judicial Board hears cases referred to it by the Assistant Dean of Students. The Judicial Board determines responsibility or no responsibility regarding a violation of College policies and imposes appropriate sanctions if an individual is found responsi ble for a violation. In cases resulting in suspension, expulsion, or campus restriction, the Judicial Board recommends the sanction to the Vice President and Dean of Students who takes final action. If the Student Judicial Board is unable to convene within two weeks of student notification for any reason, the case may be heard by the Vice President and Dean of Students or his/her designee in consultation with the Judicial Board. In its hearings, the Judicial Board consistently follows a protocol for procee dings established by the Judicial Board. A unanimous decision is required for any offense resulting in expulsion. A three -quarters majority vote is required for the sanction of suspension. Hearings may be open to the campus if both the complainant(s) and t he accused student(s) agree. The Chief Justice will generate a complete record of all proceedings. Student disciplinary records are maintained by the Student Development Office as stated in the Student Records Policy (see Student Records , \"Location of Stud ent Records\" in this Catalog) . The Student Judicial Board is composed of sixteen (16) members. A quorum requires the presence of seven (7) voting members. If a quorum is not present, the accused student and the complainant can agree to continue with the h earing or the hearing will be rescheduled. The Chief Justice serves as the administrator of the Judicial Board hearing. This individual does not have a vote, except to break a tie, but rather serves an administrative function to convene the Judicial Board, assure that hearing procedures are followed consistently, generate proper records and facilitate the work of the Judicial Board. The Chief Justice is selected in the spring of each year by the Student Government Association. The Vice President and Dean o f the College selects a member of the faculty to serve, along with the A ssistant Dean of Students, as Advisor to the Judicial Board. This person is a non -voting member who attends all hearings and advises the Judicial Board on legal and procedural matters. If the advisor is unable to attend, the Chief Justice may select an alternate from among the faculty and staff. A member of the Student Development Staff attends hearings involving potential suspension or expulsion to advise the Judicial Board as needed. Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 74 CAMPUS APPEALS BOARD The Campus Appeals Board hears all appeals beyond the Student Judicial Board. Reasons for appeal may include but are not limited to procedural matters, suspected bias, inappropriate or excessive sanctions, and new evidence.

After the review, the Appeals Board may: Uphold the decision of the Judicial Board, or Remand the case back to the Judicial Boa rd with an explanation and recommendations for further hearing. A student may make a final appeal to the College President only in cases involving suspension or expulsion from the College. Such an appeal must be presented to the President in writing withi n 24-hours of the Appeals Board decision. The Appeals Board is comprised of two resident students, one commuting student and one faculty member appointed by the Vice President and Dean of the College with the approval of the College President.

The Assistant Dean of Students convenes the first meeting of the Board to provide orientation and facilitate the selection of the Chairperson. Subsequent meetings are convened by the Chairperson. If the Appeals Board is unable to convene for any reason, the case is heard by the President of the College or his/her designee.

SEXUAL HARASSMENT & SEXUAL MISCONDUCT POLICY OVERVIEW Maryville College is committed to providing all individuals with an environment free of sexual harassment and misconduct. Maryville College prohibits all forms of sex discrimination including, but not limited to, dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, sex -based intimidation and/or harassment, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, sexual violence, and stalking. Instances of sex discrimination, in any form, will not be tolerated. Should such issues arise, the College has established policies and procedures which are intended to handle these situations thoroughly, effectively, and in a tim ely manner. These policies are not and should not be construed to be a replacement or alternative for the criminal justice system. Rather, they provide avenues through which the campus community may work to create a better environment. The College will: Seek to respond to and investigate every reported complaint in a timely manner. Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 76 Provide involved parties with resources such as a connection to legal, mental and physical health care providers as well as campus policies on sexual harassment and/or sexual misconduct. Provide remedies when misconduct is discovered. Impose sanctions in a case -by-case manner. Protect the privacy of all those involved to the extent it is possible and where protecting that privacy does not put the individual or others at risk. Maryville College is committed to addressing all forms of sexual misconduct though enacting preventative measures, educating the campus community, and the establishment of thorough grievance procedures. Maryville College employees at all levels are respon sible for taking reasonable and necessary action to prevent, address and respond to sexual misconduct as permissible by their professional guidelines, which are based on the capacity in which they were hired by the College. For example, those hired as men tal health counselors may be exempt from reporting instances of sexual assault if the individual does not pose a threat to themselves or the campus community. However, a faculty member who may hold a degree in counseling would still be required to report as he/she was hired by the College in the capacity of faculty rather than a mental health counselor. Confidentiality If a victim or are aware of an instance of sexual misconduct, the College encourages that a report be made. It has reso urces to offer and may be able to help. There are several options for reporting with different levels of confidentiality. Every effort is made to keep the report as private as reporters wish. Certain employees can maintain complete confidentiality (unless there is a conce rn for personal safety or the safety of others) and are not required to share the details of the incident with anyone else. Other employees are required to share certain details of your report with specific professional staff on campus. Likewise, in cert ain situations the College has Federal reporting requirements which must be followed. In these cases information will be shared with as few people as possible and every effort will be made to maintain individual privacy. If unsure of a staff or faculty me mber's reporting requirement, please ask. This policy is intended to make individuals aware of the various reporting and confidential disclosure options available so that individuals can make informed choices about where to turn should they become a victi m of or are aware of sexual misconduct. All individuals involved in an investigation or adjudication will be informed of the importance of confidentiality and asked to sign a confidentiality statement. Definitions There are many terms used in the issues of sexual misconduct. The following will provide some common definitions and examples. Accused : The alleged perpetrator of any form of sexual misconduct. Awareness Programs: Community -wide or audience -specific programming, initiatives, and strategies tha t increase audience knowledge and share information and resources to prevent violence, promote safety, and reduce perpetration. Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 77 Bystander Intervention : Positive options that may be carried out by an individual or individuals to prevent harm or intervene when there is a risk of dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking.

Consent can be withdrawn at any time. Consent cannot be given under pressure, force, threats, intimidation, coercion or while incapacitated due to the influence of alcohol and/or drugs. In order to give consent one must be of legal age and in incapac itate mentally or physically.

OPTIONS FOR ASSISTANC E Assistance immediately after an incident of sexual misconduct If a student or someone a student knows is a victim of sexual assault, the following proce dures are encouraged: Go to a safe place. Call someone whom the student trust s and/or one of the individuals/organization cited below. Seek medical care at an emergency room or hospital of choice. It is important to have a medical exam to check for physic al injuries and disease, to dispense pregnancy information and prophylaxis if necessary, and to collect evident should the student decide to prosecute. If the student is planning on filing a criminal complaint, the medical exam must be done within 72 hour s of the assault. The student may have the exam and then decide not to prosecute. It may be helpful for the student to ask for someone they trust, or a Maryville College staff member to go with them . Preserve evidence. If the student want s to prosecute t here are steps they can take to help preserve evidence. If possible the student should avoid changing clothes, bathing, douching, urinating or defecating before arriving to the emergency room .

Educat ing the campus community on reporting requirements for sex based offenses including when and how to report instances of sexual misconduct. Coordinat ing training for the campus community (students and employees) on issues of sexual misconduc t. REPORTING SEXUAL MIS CONDUCT Overview Maryville College encourages all members of the campus community to report instances of sexual misconduct. Individuals may report if they are a victim or if they are a third party who is aware of an issue of sexu al misconduct. There are various avenues for reporting with varying levels of confidentiality and services available. Certain employees can maintain complete confidentiality and are not required to share the details of the incidents with anyone else, unl ess there is concern for your safety or the safety of others. Other employees are defined as \"responsible employee\" as they are required to share report s with the Title IX Coordinator so that Maryville College may take any necessary steps to offer individ uals with support services and to prevent the recurrent of sexual misconduct. In these cases information will be shared with as few people as possible and every effort will be made to maintain privacy. Regardless of the reporting avenue chosen , College p ersonnel will make every effort to keep the report as private as possible. If an individual is u nsure of a staff or faculty members' reporting requirement, they should ask. This policy is intended to make individuals aware of the various reporting and c onfidential disclosure options available so that they can make informed choices about where to turn should Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 84 they become a victim of or aware of sexual misconduct. The reporting avenue, levels of confidentiality and other College reporting requirements are outlined below. Retaliation against any individual who makes a complaint or participates in the complainant process is strictly prohibited. What to Expect When a Report is Made Should a member of Residence Life (resident assistant or resident director), Campus Safety personnel , faculty or professional staff (not including those hired by Maryville College as a physical health provider) be contacted, the following actions are taken : The employee will notify the Title IX Coordinator of the incident. The rep orter may be contacted by the Title IX Coordinator regarding the incident. An investigation by a campus employee trained as a Title IX investigator may begin if the individual chooses or if the incident suggests there is an ongoing threat to the campus com munity. An investigation does not mean that the personal identity of the reporter will be revealed to the campus community nor does it mean that they would ever have to come face to face with the accused. The Title IX Coordinator will offer to connect the victim with local police, mental and physical health care providers and legal resources if desire d. If the accused is a member of the campus community, the Title IX Coordinator can order the accused to cease and desist from any intentional contact, direct or indirect, with the victim . The College may also be able to offer housing and/or classroom accommodations so that the complainant need not face the accused. The victim will also be given the opportunity to contact the Maryville College Counseling Cente r or another agency in the community such as a rape crisis center. The nature of the report (i.e. sexual assault) may be included in the College's crime log. The crime log does not include personally identifiable information, just that a report of an iss ue such as sexual assault was taken. Likewise, should the nature of the report pose a threat to the campus community, general information may need to be shared. This is further explained in the Federal Reporting Obligations section. If the victim choose s to move forward with a campus judicial process, the individuals who facilitate that process will be notified, as well as the accused. Should a member of the Student Counseling Center be contacted : A counselor will meet with the reporter on campus and pr ovide support. The counselor will not share any information of the incident with law enforcement or a member of the Maryville College Community without consent unless there is a clear threat to other members of the Maryville College Community or the indivi dual makes statements of a suicidal/homicidal nature. The counselor will explain the options and support the reporter in whatever decisions they make regarding reporting or not reporting. If the reporter chooses to file a report with the Title IX Coordinat or or law enforcement, a grievance counselor may accompany them and support them through the process if they so desire. When the Maryville Police Department is contacted : Maryville police will either meet the reporter on campus, or request that they meet at their office to discuss the incident and create a report. Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 85 The police will ask for details of sexual misconduct and explain the legal rights associated with the report . They may contact a victim advocacy service or the alleged perpetrator. Their action s will depend on what is report ed and how the reporter want s to proceed. The police may contact the Campus Safety and Security Office to let them know they are on campus (if they choose to meet someone on campus). If the individual goes the hospital for a n exam: The individual may ask that a sexual assault exam be completed. A police officer may be contacted and the victim may be asked to make a report. The officer is there to collect any evident obtained during the exam. Parents will not be notified wit hout consent for individuals who are 18 or older . Making a report and completing an exam preserves the option to prosecute, but does not commit an individual to pressing charges. Investigation Procedures and Protocols The College will investigate all rep orts of sexual misconduct. However, the level and scope of the investigation may in some cases be decided by the reporting individual. Responsibility for the investigation model is assigned to the Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator oversees the training and implementation of the investigator team. Formal Investigations Formal investigations with willing participants provide the most thorough and effective process. They are also necessary for campus disciplinary proceedings. Formal investi gations of sexual misconduct will be handled using an investigator model. In this model an invest igator(s) serve as neutral fact -finder who will interview the complainant, the accused, witnesses and gather any other evidence as necessary. The lead investi gator will be assigned by the Title IX Coordinator and will be trained in issue of sexual misconduct. Issues such as impartiality, appropriateness based on involved parties, etc. will be considered in appointing the lead investigator on any case. The lead investigator may interview the complainant, the accused, witnesses, any parties with potentially relevant information, review video footage, and investigate any other appropriate avenues that may provide pertinent information. The investigator will keep both the complainant and the accused appraised of their rights and the status of the process. The investigator will compile all the investigation material into a report. The report will be submitted to the chair of the Sexual Grievance Committee who will make a determination of charges. Should a hearing be deemed necessary, the report will be given to the Sexual Grievance Committee for adjudication. Informal Investigations and Requests for Confidentiality If a complainant discloses an incident to a r esponsible employee but wishes to maintain confidentiality or requests that no investigation into a particular incident be conducted or disciplinary action taken, the College must weigh that request against the College's obligation to provide a safe, non -discriminatory environment for all students, including the complainant. Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 86 If the College honors the request for confidentiality, a complainant must understand the College's ability to meaningfully investigate the incident and pursue disciplinary actions again st the alleged perpetrator(s) may be limited. Although rare, there are times when the College may not be able to honor a complainant's request not to investigate in order to provide a safe, non -discriminatory environment for all students. When weighing a complainant's request for confidentiality or that no investigation or discipline be pursued, the College will consider a range of factors, such as the increased risk that the accused will commit additional acts of sexual or other violence. Factors to be used in making this determination include: Whether there have been other sexual violence complaints about the same accused; Whether the accused has a history of arrests or records from a prior school indicting a history of violence; Whether the sexual vio lence was committed by multiple perpetrators; Whether the sexual violence was perpetrated with a weapon; Whether the complainant is a minor; Whether the College possesses other means to obtain relevant evidence of sexual violence (e.g., security camera or personal, physical evidence); and Whether the complainant's report reveals a pattern of perpetration (e.g., via illicit use of drugs or alcohol) at a given location by a particular group. The presence of one or more of these factors could lead the College to investigate and, if appropriate, pursue disciplinary actions. If none of these factors is present, the College will likely respect the complainant's request for confidentiality. If the College determines that it cannot maintain a complainant's confid entiality, the College will inform the complainant prior to starting an investigation and will, to the extent possible, only share information with the people responsible for handing the College's response. The College may not require a victim to participa te in any investigation or disciplinary proceeding. Because the College is under continuing obligation to address the issue of sexual violence campus -wide, reports of sexual violence (including non -identifying reports) will also prompt the College to cons ider broader remedial action such as increased monitoring, supervision or security at locations where the reported sexual violence occurred, increasing educations and prevention efforts, conducting climate assessments/victimization surveys and/or revisitin g its policies and practices. If the College determines that it can respect a complainant's request for confidentiality, the College will also take immediate action as necessary to protect and assist the complainant. The College will offer remedies and/o r accommodations for the complainant. No formal complaint or investigation, campus or criminal, need occur before these option are available. Confidentiality All individuals involved in an investigation and/or adjudication process will be informed of th e importance of confidentiality and will be asked to sign a confidentiality statement. Conversations and information that result from an investigation or disciplinary proceeding are private and should not be shared. Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 87 Time Frames Investigations will be con ducted in reasonable and prompt timeframes with a goal for resolution of any sexual misconduct complainant being 60 days. Certain issues, such as the point in the semester when the incident is reported may result in prolonged investigations. For example, conducting interviews during semester breaks may be more challenging as students, faculty, and staff may be away. Every effort will be made to find resolution with the 60 day time frame. If the incident is also being investigated by the local law enforc ement, the campus process need not wait for the outcome of the criminal justice system process before making a final determination. GRIEVANCE/ADJUDICATI ON PROCEDURES Sexual Grievance Committee Mediation is never an appropriate means for handing issues of sexual misconduct. Sexual misconduct hearings will be heard by the Sexual Grievance Committee. The Sexual Grievance Committee is comprised of a chair, three faculty members and three staff members. Each case will be heard and investigated by a subcommitt ee of the Sexual Grievance Committee, which will be referred to as the Hearing Panel. The Hearing Panel will consist of two faculty, and two staff members. Disciplinary action for students found responsible for violating the College's Sexual Assault polic y may include suspension or expulsion from the College. College officials shall take precautions to ensure that a complainant and individuals testifying on behalf of a complainant are not subjected to any form of retaliation. In cases of alleged retaliati on, a College official or any person at whom the retaliatory action is directed may file a complaint against the individual(s) who participated in the retaliation. Such cases fall under the jurisdiction of the College's Harassment Policy. Violations of con fidentiality can constitute a form of retaliation. Standard of Proof The standard of proof used for hearing cases sexual misconduct will be preponderance of the evidence or \"more likely than not.\" Findings of responsible or not responsible for sexual misconduct cases will be made based on this standard proof in determining if a violation occurred. Rights of Complainant: Prompt access to appropriate College services Self-determination concerning their medical, psychological and legal support Complainants have the right and are encouraged to seek counseling and support services, inter nal and external to the College To request a change of academic or housing situations and to be notifie d of what options are available The College will make all reasonable eff orts to ensure the preservation of confidentiality, restricting information to those wh o have a legitimate need for it The right not to have irrelevant prior sexual history admitted as evidence in a campus hearing The right to appeal the finding and sancti on of the Sexual Grievance Committee in accordanc e with the standards for appeal Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 88 The right to report incidents of sexual assault to a law enforcement agency, regardless of whether or not he/she is pursuing disciplinary optio ns within the College community Be informed in writing of the outcome of any disciplinary proceeding Rights of Accused Student: Prompt access to appropriate College services Self-determination concerning their p sychological and legal support The right for and encouragement to seek coun seling and support services, inter nal and external to the College The right to request a change of academic or housing situations and to be notifie d of what options are available Reasonable efforts on the part of the College to ensure the preservation of confidentiality, restricting information to those wh o have a legitimate need for it The right not to have irrelevant prior sexual history admitted as evidence in a campus hearing The right to appeal the finding and sanction of the Sexual Grievance Committee in accordance with the standards for appeal Accused students can expect a presumption of innocence throughout the disciplinary process until found responsible and will be treated with respect throughout the process Be informed in writing of the outcome of any disciplinary proceeding Hearings If any party is uncomfortable being in the same room for the hearing, accommodations will be made such as using Skype, thereby allowing the hearing to take place without direct confrontation. Notification of Hearing All parties whose presence is requested at the hearing will be notified in writing five calendar days prior to the hearing. Notifications will be made via campus email by the Title IX Coordinator and include: The date, time and location of the hearing Notice of the alleged violations within the complaint The names of the members of the Sexual Grievance Committee assigned to the case. Neither the accused nor the complainant may directly or indirectly contact any member of the Sexual Grievance Committee. The names of all witnesses who will be called at the hearing, except in cases where a witness's identity may not be revealed for compelling safety reasons. Upon review of the witnesses called either the accused or the complainant may request additional witnesses be called. Witnesses may be added no later than 48 hours prior to the hearing. A list or description of all documentary evidence to be presented at the hearing (subject to confidentiality limitations imposed by state and federal law). Both the complainant and the accused have the opportunity to review this evidence at least 48 hours prior to the hearing. Requests to review this evidence should be made to the Title IX Coordinator. Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 89 Hearing Steps The investigator report will be given to the Sexua l Grievance Committee Chair who will make a determination of charges and if necessary, schedule a hearing with the Sexual Grievance Committee. The steps for a hearing are as follows: Introductions : The hearing will be facilitated by the Sexual Grievance Committee Chair and begin with introductions. Presentation of the Investigator Report : The lead investigator will present the report to the Sexual Grievance Committee. Questioning : Members of the Sexual Grievance Committee will be given the opportunity t o ask questions of the accused, the complainant and/or investigator. The accused and complainant may not directly ask questions of each other or any witnesses. Should a question arise, the complainant will in writing submit the question to the committee c hair. The committee chair will determine the appropriateness and/or usefulness of the question and then present the question or deny it. Questions about prior sexual conduct with any individual other than the alleged perpetrator are prohibited. Evidence o f a previous consensual dating or sexual relationship between the accused and complainant does not imply consent or preclude a finding of sexual misconduct. Witnesses : Any witnesses or individuals with relevant information will then be called. Video foo tage and other types of evidence will be reviewed. The Sexual Grievance Committee will first be allowed to ask questions of witnesses. The complainant and accused will then be permitted to ask questions of witnesses. Witnesses will be called as needed, questioned and dismissed. Witnesses will be present only for the portion of the questioning that applies to them directly. Statements : The complainant and the accused will then both be given a chance to make a statement after all questioning is finished. Dismissal : At this point the complainant, accused, investigator, advocates, witnesses and any other individuals will then all be dismissed, leaving only the Sexual Grievance Committee.

The Sexual Grievance Committee Chair and the Title IX Coordinator will appoint an appellate committee. Membership of the appellate committee will be determined based on the status of the involved individuals. The Appellate Committee will decide within seven calendar days of an appeal request if the appeal will be heard.

The appellate will then be dismissed and the committee will deliberate and make a determination. Should an appeal be granted and heard, both parties will be informed of the outcome in writing via campus email wit hin 48 hours of the decision. PREVENTION AND EDUCA TION Maryville College has several avenues for preventing issues of sexual misconduct and educating the campus community. Some of the highlights are listed below: Bystander Intervention Training: The As sistant Dean of Students receives annual training in Step Up Bystander Intervention and facilitates yearly programming Awareness and Educational Campaigns: Several Campus Life offices such as Residence Life, Maryville College Student Programming Board, St udent Government Association, and other student organizations under faculty/staff supervision conduct programs throughout the year on topics such as consent, dating violence, sexual assault myths, making healthy choices, sexual violence awareness, etc. Orientation programming includes education for new students every fall on issues of sexual misconduct and Maryville College's sexual misconduct policies and procedures. The Title IX Coordinator educates the campus employees on issues of sexual misconduct and to report these issues. Likewise, the Title IX Coordinator trains campus employees on how to sensitively handle such reports. Maryville College provides ongoing prevention and awareness programs in the area of sexual misconduct, including dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking. Maryville College provides a training program through EverFi called Haven, for Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 91 all new students. Haven used a population -level approach to educate all students on the issues associated with sexual assault and relationship violence. Maryville College is committed to ensuring all employees are trained in a trauma -informed approach to issues of sexual misconduct. Training for faculty and staff on issues of sexual misconduct is the responsibility of the Titl e IX Coordinator. Employees are trained annually on what constitutes sexual misconduct, their reporting responsibilities, and how to handle reports of sexual misconduct. Likewise, any individual involved in investigating or adjudicating issues of sexual misconduct undergoes training prior to engaging in such responsibilities. Trainings are conducted by the Title IX Coordinator, in collaboration with other experts versed in sexual misconduct issues.

Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 100 LEARNING BY EXPERIEN CE Every student's p rogram of study centers on the familiar work of the classroom , laboratory, library , and studio. Yet important learning also takes place in less familiar settings where the student s are called upon to adapt to a new environment, to act without their customa ry support system, and to develop trust in their own resources of intelligence and discipline. It is to encourage that kind of learning, so critical to personal maturity, that the College makes available a variety of special programs. EXPERIENTIAL LEARNIN G Experiential education emphasizes guided activity as a primary mode of learning. It often takes place outside the conventional setting of a classroom, library, or laboratory and typically does not take place at a study desk. While mastery of information , understanding of expert opinion and cognitive learning are not ignored, effective change and growth is stressed . By exposing student s to unfamiliar tasks and environments, experiential learning encourages mental and emotional adjustments and promotes the development of new skills and attitudes. It has as a principal goal the creation of sense of achievement, personal competence, and self -reliance. Experiential learning begins with concrete experience, but it does not stop there. It also involves an impor tant element of reflection, an effort to develop a clear view of what one is doing and to assess its value. These observations and reflections should lead learner s to new generalizations and concepts, fresh understandings of the world and oneself, and some enhancement of ability. Subsequently, new learning should be tested and refined in a different situation or additional experiences. At its best, experiential learning deepens the learner s' sensitivity to social and physical surroundings and encourages them to use senses and wits more fully. Thus it affords powerful opportunities for holistic learning. An \"experiential education\" course has the following characteristics: I. It involves active and sustained participation by student s. II. It is a kind of ex perience that student s have not had before. III. It requires student s not only to do something new but to stand back from the activity, assess its significance, and draw conclusions about it. IV. It provides opportunities to test these conclusions (or in t he case of a skill -oriented course, to demonstrate increased mastery.) V. It has as a major goal some modification in attitude or outlook, some change in personal perspective, and some deepening of insight regarding oneself and others or oneself and the world. Within the guidelines, experiential education courses are quite diverse in type. They include exploring a creative process, developing new physical skills, living for a time in an alien setting, or trying out a field through a \"hands -on\" approach. Co urses having to do with service projects, life-enhancing activities, or new leisure skills and interests are especially appropriate. Some experiential learning courses assess fees that vary with particular offerings each year. COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT SERVICE S Maryville College offers numerous opportunities for students to become involved in service. The Director of Community Engagement facilitates placement for students with a variety of Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 101 nonprofit agencies in the East Tennessee region. Service opportunities include tutoring, adult literacy, work in social service agencies, environmental projects, and many other possibilities depending on student interests and passions. For assistance in finding community engagement activities and projects, please visit the C enter for Campus Ministry. Further information about community engagement at Maryville College can be found in the Student Life section of the catalog. INTERNS HIPS Internships are available in all major fields and provide excellent opportunities to gain practical experience in field settings. Details on internships may be found in the section of this catalog headed Academic Procedures and Regulations and under the course listings for academic fields. MOUNTAIN CHALLENGE The Mountain Challenge program tak es students outdoors. Area mountains, lakes, rivers, and woods provide the setting. The seasons, each one distinct in its own right, provide the agenda. In the fall and winter it may be panoramic views of changing leaves high in the mountains or cold mount ain mornings shared with fellow travelers. Spring and summer may bring trips to appreciate the wildlife and beautiful plant life of the mountains. The agenda might include hiking, rock climbing canoeing on one of the beautiful area lakes, or climbing the A lpine Tower. Whatever the situation, the Mountain Challenge program is a chance to face challenges head on, to struggle through some difficult and unfamiliar tasks, and to experience the thrill of achievement. The Mountain Challenge program is an opportuni ty for people to explore the self while exploring the outdoors. Many of the events in the Mountain Challenge program require neither experience nor special equipment. The only requirements for these events are a willingness to try new experiences and a commitment to do ones best. Some events in the program do require experience and/or proper equipment. Experience can be gained through participation in other program events, and the College will supply needed equipment. Interested persons may sign up for Mou ntain Challenge trips at Crawford House. Students who participate in five different Mountain Challenge events may register to receive one (1) hour of PHR activity credit. Up to three (3) hours of PHR credit can be earned through Mountain Challenge. Various Mountain Challenge activities include: Alpine Tower Mountain Trips and Expeditions Bicycle Trips Canoe Trips Caving Hiking Map and Compass Outdoor or Environmental Related Service Projects Rafting Ropes Courses Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 102 NONPROFIT LEADERSHIP ALLIANCE The Nonprofit Leadership Alliance program affords opportunities for a variety of internships in nonprofit organizations such as YWCA and YMCA, Habitat for Humanity, the Urban League, organizations that focus on environmental interests, and international non-governmental organizations.

OAK RIDGE ASSOCIATED UNIVERSITIES Since 1990, students and faculty of Maryville College have benefited from its membership in Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU). ORAU is a consortium of 1 14 colleges a nd universities and a contractor for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) located at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. ORAU works with its member institutions to help their students and faculty gain access to federal research facilities throughout the country; to keep its members informed about opportunities for fellowship, scholarship and research appointments; and to organize research alliances among its members. Through the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), the DOE facility that ORAU operates, u ndergraduates, graduates, postgraduates, as well as faculty enjoy access to a multitude of opportunities for study and research. Students can participate in programs covering a wide variety of disciplines including business, earth sciences, epidemiology, engineering, physics, geological sciences, pharmacology, ocean sciences, biomedical sciences, nuclear chemistry, and mathematics. Many of these programs are especially designed to increase the numbers of underrepresented minority students pursuing degrees i n the science - and engineering -related disciplines. A comprehensive listing of these programs and other opportunities, their disciplines, and details on locations and benefits can be found in the ORISE Catalog of Education and Training Programs, which is a vailable at www.orau.gov/orise/educ.htm . Further information is available in the Division of Natural Sciences. PROGRAM FOR INTERNAT IONAL AND CIVIC LEAD ERSHIP The Program for International and Civic Lead ership emanates from the mission of Maryville College by preparing students to fulfill their potential in citizenship, leadership and service to the peoples of the world. The program directly serves students with majors in International Studies, Internatio nal Business, Environmental Studies, and Political Science, or minors in International Studies and Political Science, but resources and services are available to all students with interests in international and civic leadership. The program facilitates a coherent learning experience by connecting students to a broad range of resources and opportunities across the College such as the Model United Nations, pre -law, language and area studies, field research, and study abroad. Our network of program alumni connects current and prospective students to Maryville College graduates with work and graduate school experience in a wide range of opportunities. The program also includes strong relationships with organizations, corporations, agencies, and educational ins titutions that provide career, graduate school, and internship opportunities after graduation. In addition, the program partners with middle and high schools to provide enrichment and college preparation in the areas of international and civic affairs.

Tutor site placements include the Adult Basic Education Center, the Tennessee Department of Education, and local foundations, agencies, and religious organizations. Arrangements for the granting of credit may be found un der Academic Procedures and Regulations. STUDY ABROAD Mark Twain once wrote that \"Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry and narrow -mindedness - all foes to real understanding.\" Recognizing the validity of that statement, Maryville College believes a peri od of travel and study outside the United States should be a part of one's education whenever possible. Confronting other cultures and viewpoints, learning about the customs and practices in other societies, coping with unfamiliar surroundings in a languag e not fully one's own can do much to deepen insights and broaden perspectives. Such experience can also foster remarkable personal growth. Study abroad programs are offered through the Center for International Education. Detailed information on study abr oad is found at http://www.maryvillecollege.edu/studyabroad or by meeting with the Director of International Education at the Center for International Education in International House. Travel S tudy Programs Short -term possibilities come through experiential travel with a small group of students and faculty. In recent years, groups of students and faculty have used our January three -week class Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 104 terms for study travel to locales in Europe, Asia, th e Middle East, Africa, Central and South America. Students may apply for financial assistance. Semester and Academic Year Study Abroad Programs For more extended periods, Maryville College has partnered with other foreign institutions. Through such associ ations Maryville students can experience life and study on a university or college campus in many areas of the globe. Maryville College maintains bilateral exchange partnerships and International Student Exchange Program (ISEP) exchange programs in 51 co untries to over 160 overseas institutions. Program stipulations vary, but in most cases regular tuition and fees, and usually room and board are paid to Maryville College. Under these reciprocal agreements, when a Maryville student studies at a related ins titution, a student from that institution may study at Maryville for an equal time period. Through ISEP, students also have access to ISEP -Direct semester or summer programs. These are affordable fee -paid programs in a number of countries that do not offe r the option to do an exchange. The majority of programs offer instruction in English; however, many programs also offer language study or full -immersion study in another language. Summer Abroad Summer Abroad programs (3 -6 credits on average) give student s the opportunity to study in a foreign country for a short period, often focusing on intensive language study or one field of study or one aspect of a country or culture. This is also a good option for students who are not able to study abroad during the regular academic year. Internships Abroad Maryville College works with several international organizations to place students in internship abroad programs. These programs are generally between 6 -10 weeks in length and are offered in locations around the world during the summer. Internships abroad are generally unpaid, and are offered for academic credit. Students pay a program fee that covers placement, tuition and housing costs. Planning, Eligibility & Application Process A period of study is possible at any time after the first year, but most students find the third year, or the preceding summer, the most convenient time. Planning needs to start well in advance and is best done in close consultation with one's advisor and the Director of International Education. Approval for study abroad is required. Students apply to the Center for International Education (CIE), must meet minimum G.P.A. standards, and must follow the application procedures set by the CIE. Students also may choose to study at foreign institutions with which Maryville College does not have a relationship; however, different policies and practices may apply. Further, the College will scrutinize carefully, and may reject, credits earned at institutions overseas. The programs at institut ions described in this catalog have been screened for academic quality and attention to the needs of students studying abroad. More information on programs can be found on the Maryville College study abroad website http://www.maryvillecollege.edu/studyabroad and through the Center for International Education at International House. Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 105 Study Abroad Scholarships & Aid Students on any Maryville College affiliated study abroad program are eligible to u se FAFSA aid for periods abroad. Students are also eligible to use their merit aid for semester of year -long exchange programs, but not for ISEP -Direct or non -affiliated programs. In addition to a student's regular financial aid package, Maryville students studying abroad on an affiliated program may apply for additional scholarship support through the Ragsdale International Scholarship or the Tuck International Study Award. Deadlines for each award occur each semester or each academic year for Maryville Co llege sponsored trips scheduled for the following year. Study Abroad Transfer Credit and Grades The Center for International Education facilitates the pre -approval process for all study abroad programs and coursework. Credits earned through Bilateral exch ange or International Student Exchange Program (ISEP) Exchange of ISEP -Direct semester and summer programs will appear on the Maryville College transcript as transfer credit, and grades earned will be calculated into the Maryville College GPA according to internationally recognized guidelines. Transfer credits earned through non -affiliated study abroad programs will appear on the Maryville College transcript, but grades will not calculate into the Maryville College GPA. Maryville College is accredited by t he Southern Association of Colleges and Schools' Commission on Colleges to award Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees. The College's partner institutions are not accredited by the Commission on Colleges, and the accreditation of Maryville Colle ge does not extend to nor include the partner institutions or their students. Although Maryville College accepts certain coursework from the partner institutions as transfer credit towards its degrees, or collaborates in other ways for generation of course credits or program credentials, other colleges and universities may or may not accept this work in transfer; even if it appears on a transcript from the partner institutions. This decision is made by the institution subsequently considering acceptance of such credits. WASHINGTON EXPERIENC ES For the student who wishes to study or work in the nation's capital, many options are available. Maryville College's Career Center assists students in exploring a range of possibilities, including semester -long progr ams, summer internships, and work opportunities. Career Center staff members are available and experienced in working with students to identify programs related to their interests, regardless of major. Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 106 ACADEMIC PROCEDURES AND REGULATIONS STATEMENT O F STUDENT RESPONSIBILI TY Each student is expected to be thoroughly familiar with the academic requirements of the College, as sta ted in the Catalog . The responsibility for meeting all requirements for graduation rests entirely upon the student. Faculty ad visers, academic division chairs, the Registrar, the Associate Dean, and the Vice President and Dean of the College welcome the opportunity to provide assistance, but the basic responsibility remains with the student personally. ACADEMIC ADVISING Every s tudent has a faculty advisor at all times. The instructor in the First -Year Seminar (FYS 110) serves as the student's advisor for most of the first year. When a major is declared, usually in March of the first year, advising shifts to a disciplinary facult y advisor who often remains the student's advisor until graduation. Students who do not declare a major in the first year remain with their first year advisor until a major is declared. Frequent contact between advisor and student is essential. Faculty ad visors initiate some contacts, but students are strongly encouraged to make every effort to maintain a close relationship with their advisors. Because students hold full responsibility for ensuring that specific disciplinary requirements for graduation are completed, frequent and careful review of the College Catalog in consultation with advisors is helpful. ACADEMIC INTEGRITY Academic Integrity Policy Truth and justice should be hallmarks of the academic community. Academic study involves a search for truth through critical evaluation of previous academic work. Effective teaching requires that the teacher be able to see the materials with which a student starts and, on the basis of the student's results, judge the quality of the student's effort and th ought. Academic honesty is thus essential to effective learning. Any compromise of these moral cornerstones prevents an academic community and all of its members from being true seekers of wisdom. It is therefore very important for all members of the com munity to clearly understand the standards that define this collective search for wisdom. As the Maryville College Covenant declares, it is important for all students \"to act with integrity in all interactions . . . to encourage and support . . . fellow s tudents as they aspire to be honest in their academic endeavors .\" Violations of Academic Integrity Breaches of academic integrity include, but are not limited to, the following: 1. Cheating \u2014this includes copying, or claiming as one's own, the work of another student with or without his or her knowledge, and with or without subsequent revision; and the use of any unauthorized notes, crib sheets, or other written or electronic aids in exams or Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 107 quizzes. Cheating includes ghost writing, submitting under t he name of one author written work that was done by another author. 2. Plagiarism \u2014inadequately acknowledging intellectual debts, either intentionally or unintentionally, in written work. This includes failure to document facts, ideas, wording, or organi zation taken from a source. It includes what some people call \"mosaic plagiarism \" which involves paraphrasing too closely to the original wording , that is, providing documentation of the source but either not using quotation marks to indicate borrowing of the author's wording, or altering the source's wording but not its sentence structure. It also includes failure to acknowledge informal debts for helpful suggestions \u2014acknowledgement such as professional scholars often make in a footnote or a prefatory st atement (e.g. \"I am gratefully indebted to Rita Johnson for suggesting this overall direction of inquiry \"). The basic principle governing documentation is that anything \u2014facts, ideas, wording, or organization \u2014that is not common knowledge and is not origina l to the author should be documented. In doubtful cases, providing too much documentation is better than providing too little. 3. Unauthorized collaboration \u2014any academic work on a specific assignment by more than one student without the prior approval o f the instructor. Acceptable collaboration varies widely from professor to professor and from one assignment to another. Students must take responsibility to determine whether or not a collaborative effort is appropriate. 4. Fabrication \u2014knowingly prese nting false information in oral, written or artistic work, such as faked data in lab reports, falsified bibliographic citations, etc. It includes misrepresentation of academic records or credentials. 5. Unauthorized multiple submission \u2014this includes si multaneous submission of the same piece of work in two courses without the prior approval of both instructors, as well as turning in any assignment for which one has already received credit, without the prior approval of the later instructor. The instructo r receiving the later submission should have the opportunity to confer with the earlier instructor about the assignment and to determine whether the multiple submissions are appropriate. 6. Abuse of academic materials \u2014destroying, losing, defacing or dama ging intellectual resources that belong to someone else. Examples include defacing library materials; introducing viruses to college computers or erasing operational files from them; and abusing instructional tools, equipment, or materials. 7. Electron ic dishonesty \u2014this goes beyond plagiarism or fabrication from electronic sources. It includes inappropriate access to network files, accounts, or resources; knowingly spreading viruses; disabling computer hardware or software; software piracy; etc. 8. Unauthorized alteration or forgery of documents and records \u2014this includes such things as forging an advisor's signature or altering the information to which the signature is appended, altering an exam response and then requesting a review of the grade, or altering academic records. 9. Facilitation of academic dishonesty \u2014knowingly helping someone else commit an act of academic dishonesty. This includes knowing of an instance of academic dishonesty and not disclosing it. Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 108 10. Failure to secure IRB and/or I ACUC approval for human and animal research \u2014research projects involving human participants and animal subjects are required by federal law to undergo review and approval by the Institutional Research Board (for human participants, including questionnaire s urveys) and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (for animal subjects). It is the responsibility of all members of the Maryville College community \u2014students, faculty, staff, and administration \u2014to familiarize themselves with the violations defin ed above. Students should understand that they have a special responsibility to the community to uphold the standard of conduct for themselves and for their classmates. This includes a responsibility to help ensure that breaches of academic integrity do not remain undiscovered. Faculty must accept the unique responsibility that they have for clearly defining, in course syllabi and assignments, the parameters of legitimate collaboration and any other areas in which the boundaries of academic integrity may be unclear. The administration has a responsibility to assist in the fair and timely implementation of standards and sanctions. Procedure If a teacher has information leading to a reasonable opinion that there has been an incident of academic dishones ty, the following procedures shall be followed: 1. The teacher should confer with his or her academic division chair (or some other trusted colleague if the teach er is also the division chair); 2. If both agree that the evidence establishes with certain ty that academic integrity standards have been violated and if they agree on the extent of the offense, the teacher may proceed to assign without further process a grade penalty on the assignment, a penalty proportioned to the severity of the offense and n ot exceeding a grade of zero on the assignment. The teacher will place on file in the Registrar's Office a letter of censure recording the offense along with relevant documentation. Such a letter will not become part of the student's permanent academic r ecord, but will be available during the student's time at the college to any faculty member who may later inquire whether the student has previously been found guilty of academic dishonesty. Before assigning a penalty, the teacher should check to see whet her any prior letter of censure exists. If there is one letter of censure already on file, action is at the discretion of the faculty member who may either assign penalty or refer the case to the Academic Integrity Board (AIB). If two letters are already on file, the teacher must refer the case to the AIB . At such time, the Registrar will initiate the preliminary procedures specified below. The teacher must discuss with the student the offense and the penalty, informing the student of his or her right to appeal the decision and the penalty to the AIB. If the student does appeal to the AIB, the student should notify the Registrar's Office of the appeal, and the Registrar's Office should withhold the letter of censure from the file pen ding the outcome of th e appeal; 3. If the teacher and the academic division chair (or other trusted colleague) finds that either the severity of the offense calls for a penalty greater than a zero on the assignment, or the evidence fails to establish with certainty the suspect ed student's guilt or the extent of the offense, then the teacher must confer with the student, who will be confronted with the charge. If the student admits guilt, the teacher will place a letter of censure with Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 109 relevant documentation on file in the Regi strar's Office and may assign without further process one or more penalties from among the following: 1) a grade penalty on the assignment 2) zero on the assignment 3) a failing grade in the course. The teacher should inform the student of his or her right to appeal the sanction to the Academic Integrity Board. If the student does not admit guilt, the teacher may drop the matter or may refer the case to the AIB. Any case in which the teacher seeks a penalty beyond a letter of censure and a failing grade in t he course (e.g. community service, suspension, or expulsion) should be referred to the AIB; 4. In a case of plagiarism or faulty documentation involving a student who has not yet taken Composition and Speech II (ENG120 ) with its discussions of plagiarism and documentation, the teacher may, upon adequate establishment of the student's guilt as outlined above, opt to provide the student an opportunity to correct or to redo the assignment either with or without penalty for the sake of the student's learning t he requirements of correct documentation. This leniency of procedure applies only to students who have not been informed of the requirements of academic integrity as taught in ENG120 . 5. If the academic division chair (or colleague) does not believe tha t the evidence warrants pursuit of the case, the teacher is still free to discuss the matter with the student and to refer the case to the Academic Integrity Board, but the teacher must not peremptorily assign a penalty; 6. Any member of the College commu nity wishing to refer a case to the Academic Integrity Board must notify the Registrar, who will notify the other parties involved, request from them for safekeeping any physical evidence connected with the case, and notify the AIB chair. Academic Integri ty Board Purpose and Jurisdiction The Academic Integrity Board (AIB) investigates and adjudicates cases of alleged academic dishonesty involving college courses or library use. Membership The Board will be composed of three faculty members and two students, and is to be constituted early in the fall term each year. The Vice President and Dean of the College will call an organizational meeting. The faculty members will be those who have completed a term on the Academic Life Council (ALC) in the pr evious two years. If there are four such persons, three will be selected by lot and the fourth will serve as an alternate who will replace a faculty member who is unable to serve on a particular case. If an additional alternate is needed, priority will b e given to the current ALC member representing the same constituency as the person to be replaced. If Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 110 that person cannot serve, or is otherwise disqualified, another faculty member of ALC will be selected by lot. The student members will be the two stud ents with the longest service on ALC. The third student will serve as alternate. The Board's tenure shall be from the beginning of the academic year up to the beginning of the next academic year. Cases held over from the previous academic year become t he responsibility of the newly constituted Board. For hearings, a quorum will consist of three faculty and two student members. Officers Chair: When the Board is convened in the fall, one of the faculty members will be chosen as chair. Investigator /presenter: The Board will appoint one of its members as an investigator/presenter (non -voting) for each case. An appropriate alternate member of the AIB, either student or faculty, will substitute for the presenter in hearing the case. Secretary: The B oard will appoint a secretary who will prepare a written record of the proceedings in each case, and prepare written notices of charges, hearings, verdicts, sanctions, appeals, etc. The secretary may not simultaneously serve as investigator/presenter in a ny case. Preliminary Procedures If alleged academic dishonesty is referred by a teacher to the Academic Integrity Board, the teacher shall notify the Registrar, who will notify the accused student, request from both parties for safekeeping any physical evidence connected with the case, and notify the AIB chair. If academic dishonesty is detected by someone other than the teacher, the following procedures will be followed: 1. The person will notify the Registrar and pass on all physical evidence for safekeeping. 2. The Registrar will notify the chair and the teacher involved. 3. The chair will meet with the person reporting the alleged academic dishonesty to obtain information about the charge. On receiving notification of the case from the Registrar and fol lowing conference with the teacher or person reporting the case, the chair will take the following actions: 1. Appoint one member of the AIB to serve as investigator/prese nter (non -voting) for the case 2. Schedule a hearing and inform the accused and the accus er of the charge and the time and place of the hearing 3. Schedule the hearing as soon as possible after the offense is detected, unless mitigating circumstances (e.g., study abroad) require a delay. In no case should an initial hearing take place more than one year after the offense is detected Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 111 4. Notify appropriate parties at least 24 hours prior to the hearing. Conduct of the Board Every member of the Board has the right and responsibility to speak and vote freely. It is the responsibility of each voting member to vote \"aye\" or \"nay \" on a motion of verdict or sanction. It is the responsibility of all parties involved in the proceedings to maintain confidentiality of the proceedings. A member of the Board shall disqualify himself or herself in a particular case if he or she is unable to maintain impartiality. Any member who so disqualifies himself or herself shall not be present in any capacity other than that of witness, accuser, accused, or advisor to the accused. No member will disclose to anyone other than members of the Board the degree of harmony or unanimity of the Board or the opinions or votes of any members of the Board. The record of Board meetings will be available only to: 1. The accused and his or her advisor 2. Members of the Academic Integri ty Board 3. Vice President and Dean of the College 4. President of the College 5. Vice President and Dean of Students The secretary will report in writing the results of a hearing to the campus newspaper editor, including only: 1. Charge (excluding the name of the accused) 2. Nature of the evidence 3. Sentence 4. Rationale for the sentence Rights of the Accused Student 1. Notice of charges will be received by the accused as soon as possible after the offense is detected 2. The student may be assisted by any advisor of his or her choice from the College community. At the hearing said advisor acts only as a consultant a nd may not address the hearing 3. The student may decline to testify and may have witnesses in hi s or her behalf at the hearing 4. The student may challenge for bias any member of the AIB. The AIB (excluding the challenged memb er) will rule on any challenge 5. The student may request an open hearing from the AIB chair no less than 24 hours in advance 6. During the appeal period, the student may read the record of the hearing. Hearing Procedures Only AIB members, the accuser, the accused, and the advisor to the accused will be present at the hearings, unless an open hearing has been scheduled. Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 112 Any student referred to the Board must appear at the time set for the h earing. If a student fails to appear without justifiable reason, the case will be heard in absentia. The AIB chair may recess the hearing at any time for any reasonable purpose. The Order of Hearing will be as follows: 1. The chair will introduce the a ccus ed student and the AIB members 2. AIB members may be challenged by the student for bias. Any challenge is deliberated by the AIB in private, and either sustained or denied. If the challenge is sustained, the hearing will be reconvened when an alt ernate AIB member is available 3. The presenter st ates the charge 4. The accused enters a plea 5. Evidence in support of the charge is presented in the pre sence of the accused 6. Witnesses in support of the charge testify in the presence of the accused and answer questions b y the accused 7. The accused presents a statement in the presence of the accuser 8. Evidence in support of the accused is presented in the presence of the accuser; 9. Witnesses in support of the accused testify in the presence of the accuser and answer questions by the accuser 10. The accused, the accuser, or Board members may seek clarification of evi dence or reexamine any witness 11. Board members will deliberate. The Board shall u tilize the concept of precedent however, the specific circumstances of the case shall also b ear on the outcome. The Board determines a verdict (guilty, not guilty, or insufficient evidence) and any sanction(s) to be imposed 12. The chair informs the accused of the verdict and sanctions. If the student is deemed guilty, the chair advises the accused o f the right to appeal. Written notice of verdicts and sanctions are prepared by the Secretary 13. Sanctions are reported to the Vice President and Dean of the College. Sanctions A student found guilty of academic dishonesty shall receive a sanction or sanc tions deemed appropriate to the offense. Sanctions may include, but are not limited to, a formal letter of censure, a requirement to perform community service on or off the campus, a grade of \"F\" on the assignment in question, dismissal from the course wi th a grade of \"F,\" suspension, or expulsion from the College. The AIB will be guided by precedent in determining sanctions. When a verdict of guilty is reached, a record of the offense, the sanctions, and the proceedings shall be kept permanently in the Registrar's office in a file that must remain separate from the Permanent Academic Record. Appeals The Vice President and Dean of the College shall have the responsibility to hear appeals of decisions of the Academic Integrity Board. Appeals must be made in writing to the Office of the Vice President and Dean of the College not more than 10 days after the conclusion of the hearing. Bases for appeal include the following: Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 113 1. Faulty procedure 2. Lack of sufficient evidence 3. Excessive sanctions 4. New evide nce AUDITING A COURSE A full -time student is permitted to audit one course each semester without additional charge. Adding a course as an audit or changing enrollment from credit to audit must take place within the first week of the semester and permiss ion of the instructor is necessary. The audit does not count toward graduation requirements, but does appear on the permanent academic record if attendance is satisfactory. Students should note that credit by examination cannot be earned for courses that h ave been taken as an audit at Maryville College. CLASS ATTENDANCE Regular attendance at classes is expected of all students, though each instructor is free to set whatever attendance requirements for an individual course are deemed suitable. These requir ements are printed in the course syllabus . Students should pay close attention to the attendance policy for each of their classes. The College recognizes as legitimate reasons for occasional absence such difficulties as illness, accident, family grief, or pressing personal responsibility. If absences for these or other reasons are excessive in terms of the stated attendance policy for the class, the student should explain the problem to the instructor, or the instructor may initiate such a discussion. If e xcessive absences persist, the student may be assigned a grade of \"F\" for the course. Occasionally students who represent the College in off -campus activities find it necessary to miss classes. The number of such absences, however, may not exceed 10% of t he class meetings without the permission of the instructor. Students should notify the professor in advance to reschedule course work where necessary. CLASS SCHEDULE During the regular semester, most classes are scheduled Monday through Friday in Monday - Wednesday -Friday and Tuesday -Thursday formats. Evening courses normally meet one or two evenings each week. Some courses, many of them four credit hour courses, meet more often and may include laboratory periods. January term classes usually meet for thre e hours Monday through Friday during the three -week session. Summer classes meet on a varied schedule during the three week session, a five week session, or the full 11 week session. CONFERRAL OF DEGREES Commencement exercises are held annually at the cl ose of the spring semester. Degrees are conferred at the May commencement only for students who have completed all graduation requirements. Students who do not complete all requirements by the close of the spring semester may participate in the Commence ment exercises only if they present a written graduation plan, approved by the advisor and the Registrar, to complete all requirements during the summer or Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 114 fall semester of that calendar year. Degrees will be conferred upon completion of all requirements in either August or December. Any student who does not complete the degree requirements according to these criteria will become a member of the next graduating class and will be eligible to participate in the Commencement exercises at the c lose of the ne xt academic year. COURSE LOAD To complete a degree in four years, students must earn an average of 32 credits each year. In the typical pattern, a student carries 14 or 15 credit hours in each of the semesters and three credit hours during the January t erm. No more than four credit hours may be taken in any one of the three -week periods, whether January or summer session. A course load of 12 hours is required for full -time status and the maximum load is 18 hours in a semester. Within the semester, ove rload charges will be assessed for each credit hour over 18 (See the section Admissions and Financial Aid in this Catalog) . CREDIT BY EXAMINATIO N Recognizing that college -level learning occurs in places other than the college classroom, Maryville Coll ege accepts credits earned through several testing programs that include proficiency exams offered by Maryville College faculty, the Advanced Placement program, the International Baccalaureate program, the American College Testing Program Proficiency Exami nation program , the College Level Examination Program (CLEP), and the DSST (Dantes) Examination Program. Students may prepare for credit by examination in a variety of ways but may not use the course audit option for this purpose as credit by examination is not available for courses audited at Maryville College.

International Baccalaureate (IB) IB credit may be earned in a variety of subjects. In order to receive college credit for IB courses completed in high school, students must score a four on the IB examination. Questions about credit should be referred to the College Registrar. American College Testing Program Proficiency Examinations The American College Testing Program Proficiency Examinations are offered in many areas. College credit is available when a score of 50 is attained. Information on these examinations is available in the Maryville College Registrar's Office . College Level Examination Program The College Level Examination Program (CLEP) offers examinations in the areas listed below. If a student's score is equal to the CLEP mean scaled score for a grade of \"C,\" credit may be granted.

Expected academic activity is extrapolated from full semester expectations for academic pursuits that take place in January, summer, and other compressed terms. Credit hours are based on the following considerations : Regular classroom courses - One credit hour for each 50-minute class session throughout the semester - most commonly, three credit hour courses meet 150 minutes each week throughout the semester . Laboratory courses - One additional credit hour for each course related, weekly laboratory session throughout the semester Private music lessons - One credit hour for each 30-minute private music lesson /5 hours practice time weekly throughout the semester - additional credit hours are associated with appropriate incremental lesson/practice expectations Fine arts ensembles/thea tre production - One credit hour for participation in music ensemble or theatre production throughout the semester (may vary according to ensemble expectations) Internships - One credit hour for every 3 hours spent in internship site weekly throughout the semester Physical activity courses - One credit hour for two 50 minute sessions weekly throughout the semester Individualized study - One meeting weekly throughout the semester with faculty supervisor. The extent of related individualized assignments is ba sed on credit hours enrolled Senior study - One meeting weekly with faculty supervisor throughout the semester with required individualized student research activity related to topic Honors - An additional credit hour option added to regular course based o n significant and advanced work beyond the normal scope of the course - Permission required Maryville College Life Enrichment Program (Portfolio) - One credit hour for completion of each approved activity - Restrictions apply (See this Catalog for a full d escription of this program) Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 118 DEAN'S LIST The Dean's List is composed of those students whose academic performance was distinguished in the previous semester. To qualify, a grade point average of at least 3.60 in all work undertaken must be earned, with no grade below \"C.\" Only full -time students are considered. A notation appears on the transcript each semester the Dean's List is achieved. EXAMINATION POLICY Grading and assessment procedures for individual courses are stated in the course syllabus. Indiv idual faculty member s are free to decide what means are appropriate for assessing student achievement during a semester that may include : quizzes scheduled whenever useful, term papers, written and oral reports, discussion assignments, course projects, exa minations, etc. Instructor s may also weigh the se measuring devices in any fashion that is fair and clearly communicated to students in the course syllab us. The last week of each semester is the final examination period. During this period, the usual daily schedule is not followed; instead, each course meets at one of three exam times on the day designated by the Registrar: 9:00 a.m., 1:00 p.m., or 3:30 p.m. If a final examination is to be given it must be held at the assigned time. How much of that two-hour block of time is used and the method of the end -of-term evaluation is left to the discretion of individual instructor s, but students should be informed on these matters well in advance, preferably in the course syllabus. Students who have three final exa minations scheduled on the same day may request and arrangements may be made with one of the instructors for one examination to be rescheduled. Arrangements are made with the course instructors with the assistance of the Associate Dean if necessary. The s chedule for the examination period is prepared with an eye to avoiding conflicts for students. Since using any time other than that designated for a particular class is likely to create such conflicts, close adherence to the schedule is expected. GRADE DISAGREEMENTS In the event a student and a professor disagree about the quality of the student's academic work and the final course grade, the disagreement should be resolved in discussion between the parties involved. If this discussion does not resolve the matter, the student may appeal to the Academic Division Chair. If no agreement is reached as a result of this effort, either of the disputers may request the Associate Dean to act as mediator. The mediator may aid decision making, but may not arbitrat e. As a last step, a request may be filed with the Associate Academic Dean for the formation of a committee composed of the Associate Dean, two other faculty members, and two students acceptable to both parties involved in the grade dispute. This committ ee will initially mediate with the power to ultimately arbitrate. The majority decision of the committee is final. Grades are not open for dispute more than one year after the end of the term in which the grade is assigned. GRADE POINT AVERAGE (GPA) The grade point average (GPA) for a semester is computed by dividing the total number of quality points earned by the number of credit hours for which quality points are earned during the Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 119 semester. The cumulative GPA is based on all quality points earned and all credit hours for which quality points are earned at Maryville College. A course may be repeated once to replace a previous grade. A second course repeat may replace a grade only with permission of the Dean or Associate Dean of the College. Course gra des earned in repeated attempts beyond these limits may not replace previously earned grades and the grade earned in each repeat is included in the GPA calculation. Courses completed satisfactorily at other institutions may count toward graduation require ments, but they are not counted in computing the GPA. The three -credit entry for Fundamentals of Mathematics 105 does not count in the minimum needed for graduation and is not included in the graduation GPA. This course is treated as a three credit hour e quivalent only in the determination of full - or part -time status. GRADE NOTIFICATION Grades are available to students at the end of each term via Self Service. Grades are normally posted by noon on the Wednesday following the examination week at which t ime they become part of the student's permanent academic record on file in the Registrar's office. Students may have grades mailed to them by request to the Registrar's Office. In accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, grades are no t sent to parents or guardians unless (1) the student requests that this be done, or (2) the parent or guardian makes such a request, certifying that the student is dependent as defined by the Internal Revenue Service. Such requests must be written and fil ed with the Registrar. GRADING AND ACADEMIC STANDARDS Faculty members determine grading standards for all grades within individual courses. This information can be found on the course syllabus. The grading system at Maryville is as follows: A - Excelle nt B - Good C - Satisfactory D - Passing F - Failed Quality points for calculation of the grade point average (GPA) are assigned as follows: Grade # of Quality Points A+ 4.00 A 4.00 A- 3.70 B+ 3.30 B C 2.00 C- 1.70 D+ 1.30 D 1.00 D- 0.70 F 0.00 Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 120 Students are graded under this system in all required general education courses, most electives, and unless stated otherwise, all courses taken to meet major requi rements. In some situations, grades of \"S\" (Satisfactory) and \"U\" (Unsatisfactory) are used. The \"S\" grade is understood to be the equivalent of at least a \"C.\" Most experiential education courses, Maryville College Life Enrichment Program projects, and most internships are graded on this basis. At the student's option, one elective course each year may be graded \"S\" or \"U.\" Students must notify the course instructor and Registrar in writing within the first week of class meetings if they elect to take a course for an \"S\" or \"U.\" In the following exceptional circumstances these grades are given: I Incomplete - Given as a temporary grade when a course cannot be completed due to reasons beyond the student's control; becomes an \"F\" unless the work is carr ied to completion by the end of the next semester. W Withdrew - Given when a course is dropped during the first 45 days of classes and does not affect grade point average. GRADUATION HONORS To qualify for graduation with honors, a student must have comp leted at least 64 hours at Maryville College. The cumulative grade point average determines the level of honors. The three levels of honors and the minimum grade point averages required are: Summa cum laude: 3.95 Magna cum laude: 3.75 Cum laude: 3.50 Graduation honors are based on grades earned at the time of graduation and are not recalculated as a result of any course work completed after graduation. JANUARY TERM All first year students are required to be enrolled during January Term. Course s are offered in most majors and in many other courses that meet general education or \"core curriculum\" requirements. Upperclassmen are encouraged to attend classes during this term in order to complete their undergraduate program in four years. January Te rm also offers opportunities for students to participate in experiential education options and/or participate in a travel study course. Students are referred to the study -abroad section of this catalog. LATE ENROLLMENT Students are expected to attend t he first class meeting of each course. After the first meeting, enrollment in the course is possible with the permission of the adviser. Students and advisors should communicate with the course instructor to ensure that a late enrollment is feasible consid ering what may have already been covered in the class. After the first week of classes, enrollment is possible only with the permission of the adviser, the instructor, and the Associate Dean. Permission to enter a course after five class meetings is given only in rare circumstances. Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 121 NON -TRADITIONAL MODE S OF LEARNING No more than 32 credit hours may be counted toward graduation requirements for any combination of credit by examination, internships, military coursework, or online courses. Credit for courses offered through non -traditional modes of learning will be granted only for courses offered by accredited institutions and, before credit is granted, each course will be evaluated to ensure it meets requirements of Maryville College course work. PROBATION AND SUSPENSION It is the responsibility of individual student s to maintain good academic standing and to make normal progress toward a degree. The record of each student is regularly reviewed by the Registrar. Student s whose cumulative grade point averag e falls below 2.00 is placed on academic probation. To continue enrollment in probationary status, student s must show steady improvement in academic performance. Full-time, first -year -in-college student s who are placed on academic probation following the first fall semester must successfully complete a Maryville College Life Enrichment Program Portfolio Project in self -management through the Academic Support Center during the first spring semester . Student s who fail to complete the project successfully are subject to suspen sion from the College. At the end of each term careful consideration is given to the record of each student. Students who fall below minimum standards for credit hours and cumulative grade point average are not considered to be making n ormal progress toward a degree and are subject to suspension from the College or to a change from degree candidacy to special student status. These minimum standards are listed below. Following a suspension, student s may apply for readmission after at lea st a semester of satisfactory academic work at another institution or successful work experience. Student s placed in special student status by action of the College may continue enrollment and, when the cumulative GPA is raised to at least 2.00, petition for readmission to degree candidacy. A decision to suspend may be appealed to the College's Committee on Academic Standing. In such an appeal, the obligation rests with the student to explain the special considerations that support continued enrollment. GPA Requirements to Avoid Suspension Credit Hours Attempted Minimum GPA 0 - 32 1.00 33 - 64 1.60 65 - 96 1.92 97 and above 2.00 PROFICIENCY EXAMS Proficiency exams are permitted in lieu of Maryville College coursework in special circumstances. There is an examination fee of $75, and permission of the academic division chair is required. Maryville College faculty prepare examinations covering the content of a specific catalog course. Proficiency exams are not given for experiential learning courses, Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 122 inter nships , physical education activities courses, studio art, applied music , or the Life Enrichment Program. PROGRESS REPORTS - THREE AND SIX -WEE K During the third week of the semester for all 100 level courses and the sixth week of the semester for all c lasses, the Academic Support Center staff members invite faculty members to submit a progress report for student s who are having academic difficulty in a particular class. The report is sent to faculty adviser s and other appropriate College staff. These re ports are used to inform and counsel student s and are not recorded on student s' official transcript s. Students are expected to keep up with their progress in each course and to contact the professor at any time that they have questions about their progress in a course. The six -week progress report should not be seen as an interim grade report. Although early course success often is associated with a positive end of the semester grade, students should keep in mind that the majority of course grades are earne d after the six week reporting period. STUDENT CLASSIFICATI ON Students are classified as full -time or part -time, as degree candidates or special students, and according to class standing. Students registered for a minimum of 12 hours a semester are classified as full -time. Those registered for fewer than 12 credit hours are classified as part -time. Degree candidates are those recognized by the College as pursuing studies leading to a baccalaureate degree at Maryville College. Special students are not r ecognized as degree candidates, though they do receive full credit for academic work completed with passing grades. The status of special student may be chosen by any student who does not plan to apply for a Maryville degree, or it may result from action o f the College if the academic record does not warrant degree candidacy. Class standing is determined by the number of credit hours earned. The minimum requirements for class standings above the first year level are as follows: For soph omore standing, 29 credit hours For j unior standing, 59 credit hours For senior standing, 9 4 credit hours WITHDRAWAL Withdrawal from a course during the first eight days of classes requires approval of the advisor. After that time, approval of both the adviser and course i nstructor is required. Students are responsible for filing a completed Schedule Adjustment Form with the Registrar. A course may be dropped with a notation of \"W\" (withdrew) during the first 45 class days of the semester. Course withdrawals after the 45th day of classes result in a grade of \"F\" for the course. After the first eight days of classes, the hours for courses dropped are included in the total hours attempted. A decision to cease attending classes does not constitute withdrawal from a course. Wi thdrawal is official on the day the Schedule Adjustment Form, properly signed is returned by the student to the Registrar. Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 123 Medical Withdrawals Requests for medical withdrawal from the College are made to the Vice President and Dean of Students (Student De velopment Office, Bartlett Hall, Rm. 327). For a request to be considered, the following conditions must be satisfied: 1. The student's medical condition developed or became more serious during the semester in question. 2. The medical condition is significant to the point that it is the primary reason the student cannot attend classes and/or complete required work. 3. The student provides documentation that he/she is under the care of a licensed physician or licensed mental health professional. The grade of \"W\" i s recorded for each course affected. Students withdrawing from the College under this policy are subject to the Refund Policy as described in this Catalog . Requests for medical withdrawal from individual classes are made to the Vice President and Dean of the College (Fayerweather Hall, Suite 309). This action is taken in only extreme cases and is viewed as a \"last resort measure.\" For a request to be considered, the following conditions must be satisfied: 1. The request is made before the last day of classe s (before the examination period) in a given semester. 2. The student provides evidence that the medical condition has a singular and isolated effect in the individual class to the point that attendance and completion of requirements are not possible. The gr ade of \"W\" is recorded for each course affected. SPECIALIZED AND INDI VIDUALIZED PROGRAMS OF INSTRUCTION Maryville College offers many opportunities for students to tailor their learning experiences to their own needs and interests. The regulations gove rning these opportunities are set out below. HONORS STUDY Honors study at Maryville College may be pursued in three ways. Participation in any honors program is reserved for those students with a cumulative grade point average of 3.25 or higher and who h ave attained sophomore standing. However, first year Presidential and Dean's scholars enroll in Honors Tutorial Training. Honors work is voluntary, except for Presidential Scholars and Dean's Scholars, who are required to participate in a prescribed number of honors activities. Honors study is distinct from and in no way related to honors designations for graduating seniors (cum laude, magna cum laude, and summa cum laude). Honors study is noted on College transcripts. Honors Seminars are offered occasiona lly by members of the Maryville College faculty. Honors seminars may be special sections of regular course offerings, or they may cover topics not Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 124 regularly a part of the College curriculum. Honors seminars may be electives, major courses (if approved by t he academic division chair), or general education courses (if approved by the Chair of the Core Curriculum). Honors seminars are listed in the Schedule of Courses with enrollment normally limited to 15 students. Honors Study within Existing Courses permit s students of superior ability to pursue honors study in courses in which they are registered. The honors work goes beyond basic course requirements and may take the form of additional reading, writing, experimentation or creative work, performance or any combination of these. For successful completion of honors study in a n existing course, students receive one additional credit hour beyond the regular credit allotment for the course. Arrangements for honors study are negotiated with the course instructor a nd require the approval of the relevant academic division chair (s). The arrangements must be reported to the Registrar not later than the first week of the course. Honors Tutorial Practica are programs of tutoring and/or other appropriate academic work wi th faculty under the coordination of the Academic Support Center staff. Each practicum in this special program is awarded one credit hour and the course may be repeated to a maximum of four credit hours. With the permission of the instructor, the practicum may be taken on a non - credit basis. Satisfactory completion of Honors Tutorial Training is a prerequisite to all Honors Tutorial Practica. INDIVIDUALIZED MAJOR S Students pursuing either a B.A. or B. S. degree may design a Major. A formal application and approval of the Committee on Individualized Instruction are required. Individualized majors must include: One primary subject area 18 credit hours Related subject area 12 credit hours Senior Study 6 credit hours An individualized major must be ap proved by the second semester of the sophomore year and a faculty sponsor in each subject area is required. Application forms are available in the Registrar's Office. INDIVIDUALIZED STUDY COURSES Students who wish to pursue a topic in their major that is not available through a regular catalog course may request a program of individualized reading or experimental work. The academic division chair will consider request s on the basis of the appropriateness of the topic and availability of faculty for superv ision. Such a course may be an additional course in the major or, when appropriate, may substitute for a major course. Such coursework carries a 350 number, and students may not earn more than three credit hours through individualized study courses. Studen ts must have at least junior standing. Such a program is pursued under the guidance of a faculty member, who confers regularly with the student and assesses the program. Approval by the academic division chair is required, and an additional fee of $50 per credit hour is charged. Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 125 INTERNSHIPS Students gain practical experience in their major field of study through an internship. These supervised experiences provide students opportunities to apply knowledge and skills in an operational setting, while testin g interest in a particular profession. Settings for professional opportunities include academic institutions, government agencies, private companies , com mercial and philanthropic organizations, and opportunities abroad. Though internships are typically pursued for academic credit, the Career Center and the Center for International Education may also arrange non-credit opportunities. All academic divisions are required to follow guidelines as published in this Catalog and division al guidelines that more spe cifically define the experiences. Students and supervisors must follow procedures related to application and approval of the experience, the range of accepted experiences, methods of reporting and verifying experiences, and the duties of the faculty superv isor and the internship site supervisor. Students may enroll in internships in the fall, spring, or summer terms. Although tuition or a fee is required for all such experiences to be listed on the transcript, summer internship tuition is discounted. Stude nts must register for the courses prior to the internship experience and the activity must take place in the term for which the students are registered for them. Internship experiences ( courses numbered 337) are allotted 0 to 15 credit hours and are inten ded to give students significant practical experiences in a work, service, or research setting. Credit earned for internships is allocated in proportion to the scope and duration of the experience. Divisional guidelines for internships vary, but for each c redit hour granted students are expected to be involved in at least 45 hours of approved activity. The duration should normally occur over a minimum of three weeks. Internships done for 0 credit hours can only be done once and must be done for the sake of completing the significant practical experience as part of Maryville College Works. Furthermore, the 0 credit option requires a minimum of at least 45 hours of approved activity and the duration should normally occur over a minimum of three weeks. Internsh ips are graded on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory basis and those that complete a major requirement must meet the required credit hours specified for that major. While all majors offer internships, some major fields restrict enrollment in internships to students majoring in the field; therefore, special qualifications or circumstances may warrant application to the appropriate academic division chair for a waiver permitting enrollment by a non-major. Remuneration may be permitted insofar as Catalog and Divi sional guidelines for the learning experience are followed and faculty supervisors work closely with organizations and internship site supervisors to protect student s and ensure the quality of the experience as an extension of the College curriculum. Appl ication and Approval Process A. Internship applications, approval processes, supervisory, and evaluation forms are available through MC Connect although department/divisions may have additional required paperwork. B. The initial application for an intern ship is to be submitted to and approved by the designated internship supervisor prior to the proposed experience. Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 126 C. The application is to include: 1. The credit hour va lue proposed for the experience 2. The name of the Maryv ille College faculty supervisor 3. The name, work address and phone number of the internship site supervisor 4. The site address of the experience 5. An explanation of the content of the internship , objectives of the experience, and relevance to the student's degree program and professio nal goals 6. A description of the types of experiences likely to be encountered, and the specific methods and materials to be used in the evaluation of performance, (e.g., journa l, paper, seminar, exam) 7. The signed approval of the faculty supervisor 8. A learning agreement f orm signed by the internship site supervisor that outlines the proposed internship arrangement, evaluation processes, and proposed list of the student's duties. Student Responsibilities 1. Regularly reports progress to the faculty supervisor, 2. Follows all gu idelines of the internship site supervisor, 3. Adheres to all other guidelines and stipulations specified in the approved application. Supervisor Responsibilities The Faculty Supervisor: 1. Assists in the application process; 2. Communicates regularly with the s tudent regarding progress, difficulties, successes and the evaluation criteria; 3. Contacts the internship site supervisor periodica lly to monitor student progress; 4. Evaluates performance and materials based on the evaluation criteria and on the assessment of the site supervisor, and assigns the final grade. Internship Site Supervisor: 1. Signs the learning agreement containing a list of the student's proposed duties and agrees to the supervisory role and evaluation process; 2. Ensures learning experiences congruen t with those outlined in the approved application; 3. Responds to inquiries from the faculty supervisor regarding the student's progress; 4. Completes mid -term and final evaluation forms provided through MC Connect. Method(s) of Evaluation Methods and materia ls to be used for evaluation are proposed in the original application along with the final date due. Typically, these will consist of the evaluation of the site supervisor. Once the internship is completed, the faculty supervisor reviews all required mater ials and issues the grade. Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 127 Termination The internship can be immediately terminated for cause upon request of either the site or faculty supervisor with the approval of the division chair. LIFE ENRICHMENT PROG RAM The Maryville College Life Enrichment Program (MCLEP or \"portfolio\") is a means to enrich and diversify student s' educational experience through a combination of curricular and co - curricular activities. In the program student s work closely with a faculty or staff mentor to identify or design projects appropriate for their personal growth. Through completion of an individually designed project, student s earn one credit hour. The projects must fall into one of the following categories: wellness leadership creative/aesthetic works cross -cultural experience, or citizenship (e.g., service and community involvement) Expected outcomes include some of the following: an enriched life, an integration of experiences, discovery, deeper development, and transformation. A central feature of each project i s the maintenance of a personal journal, the purposes of which are to encourage careful observation and reflection and to deepen knowledge of oneself. Ordinarily, only one credit hour may be earned in any category, and no more than three credit hours may b e earned in the program. One project may be taken for credit in a semester. The program is available only during the fall and spring semesters, except for portfolios related to cross -cultural experience with permission of the International Programming Comm ittee. Contact Bruce Guillaume at 981 - 8126. Under certain circumstances and conditions, it is possible to earn more than one study abroad - related portfolio credit in a cross -cultural experience. These circumstances include credit for an embedded study abr oad program or a cross -cultural project that takes place during any academic session that students study abroad. Contact Kirsten Sheppard at 273 -8991. A special portfolio project in self -management is required of first year -in-college students placed on a cademic probation following the first fall semester (See section on Probation and Suspension). First -year students admitted through the Academic Success Program must satisfactorily complete a portfolio in academic self -management during the first two semes ters (0.5 credit hours each semester). Contact the Director of the Academic Support Center for more information. SENIOR STUDY The Senior Study: The Undergraduate Research and Creative Expression Program at Maryville College is described under Degree Req uirements in this catalog. In addition to prerequisites specified for the major, a student must hold at least junior standing and have passed English 120 and the English Proficiency Examination before beginning the Senior Study. The full project receives 6 credit hours, 3 hours in each of two semester -long courses, 351 and 352. Failure in the 351 or 352 course requires that the course be repeated. A second failure in 352 requires that both 351 and 352 be repeated with a new project; the original 351 becomes an elective. Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 128 STUDENT LITERACY COR PS A description of the Student Literacy Corps may be found under Learning by Experience in this Catalog. There are two credit options : For two credit hours, the student completes one campus - based class hour (orientation and training) and three hours of community -based tutoring per week . For three credit hours, the student completes one class hour and six tutoring hours per week . Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 129 DEGREE REQUIREMENTS DEGREES OFFERED: BAC HELOR OF ARTS, BACHE LOR OF MUSIC, BACHELOR OF S CIE NCE BASIC REQUIREMENTS Maryville College is committed to liberal learning in order to prepare students for a satisfying and successful life. Thus, recipients of any of the College's degrees have been immersed in the breadth of the Maryville Curriculum, experiencing the interconnectedness of knowledge and exploration. At Maryville College, the Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree offers a broad -based program, which is well suited for persons seeking a high degree of flexibility and greater interdisciplinar y exploration. The Bachelor of Science (B.S.) and Bachelor of Music (B.M.) degrees are designed to give students deeper experience in a particular discipline or field. For specific careers or graduate programs, there may be a preference for the B.A., B.M., or the B.S. degree. Students should choose which degree to pursue based on their particular circumstances and goals. To receive the Bachelor of Arts , Bachelor of Music or the Bachelor of Science degree, the student must complete all requirements for that degree specified in the catalog in effect at the time of initial enrollment. For any of the three degrees, a minimum of 128 semester -hours of credit must be earned with a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.00. The courses taken must satisfy all core, major, and major -related requirements. In addition, students must complete the Maryville College Works program as well as pass the English proficiency examination and a comprehensive examination i n the major field . Every candidate for a degree is e xpected to pursue his or her program of studies in residence at Maryville, especially in meeting general education and major requirements. If circumstances warrant, permission may be granted for non -resident credit. Approval of the appropriate academic div ision chairperson, Chair of Core Curriculum and the Registrar is required in advance. With rare exceptions, the following core curriculum domains must be completed by means of credit earned through Maryville College: U.S. Pluralism, Culture and Intercultur al Dynamics, and Ethical Citizenship in the World. In addition, a s a minimum, each degree candidate must complete at Maryville College 45 credit hours, including 20 in the senior year and nine in the major field. These credit hours must be earned in regul ar courses taught at the College and may not include internships, student teaching, or credit by examination. An exception to the senior year requirement is made for students in cooperative degree programs, who spend the senior year in residence at the coo perating institution. THE MARYVILLE CURRIC ULUM A broadly based educational experience defines the liberal arts college. All students, regardless of major field, are required to complete the requirements described in a separate section of this Catalog he aded The Maryville Curriculum, General Education. Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 130 MARYVILLE COLLEGE WO RKS Maryville College is committed to enhancing student learning through implementation of Maryville College Works: Bridging College to Career. The goal of the program is to prepare students for lives of engaged professionalism by challenging them to investigate and explore future professional opportunities within the framework of the liberal arts tradition. Prominent features of the program are its emphasis on vocational discernment and career development and preparation as well as completion of a significant practical experience. These planned experiences may take the form of an internship, an approved semester of study abroad, an appropriate Senior Study, a semester of student teach ing or another approved format. The program focuses on three over -arching student learning outcomes: 1. Students will acquire the knowledge to complete a personal vocation and career preparation and completion plan 2. Students will participate in a significan t practical experience 3. Students will articulate how their educational experience and their significant practical experience apply to their professional opportunities Students who transfer at least 45 credit hours are exempt from the requirement as are stu dents completing dual degree programs in Biopharmaceutical Sciences, Biological Sciences with a Pre - Veterinary Tract, Nursing, and Engineering. These students may voluntarily participate in any or all program elements. The means by which the student learn ing outcomes are addressed and achieved are integrated into an incremental and cohesive program spanning four years that includes first -year seminars, disciplinary professional development courses, academic and career advising, learning modules related to career preparation, and a final reflection. Specific requirements for the program include: Completion of a career -related career assessment and discussion of results with academic advisor Planning and engaging in a significant practical experience Comple tion of a career readiness educational program Submission of a final reflection Upon satisfactory completion of all elements students are awarded one credit hour toward graduation requirements. COMPREHENSIVE EXAMIN ATION In the senior year every student takes a comprehensive examination in the major field. The examination is designed to test the breadth and depth of understanding of the field, and to assess how well material from individual courses has been integrated. The nature of the examinations var ies from department to department. Some are developed entirely by the department, while others may consist of a national standardized test supplemented by locally developed questions. Some exams include an oral or laboratory component or a recital. Both ge neral and department specific guidelines for comprehensive exams are available from all academic division chairs. Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 131 The grade received on the comprehensive examination becomes part of the total academic record, appears on transcripts and figures into the ca lculation of grade point average (GPA) as a one credit -hour course added to the student record. The credit hour associated with the comprehensive examination does not count in the total credit hours needed for graduation in any of the degree fields, nor do es it count in the number of enrolled credit hours enrolled for any term. Students may appeal their comprehensive examination grades using the procedures outlined in the Grade Disagreement Policy published in this Catalog. SENIOR STUDY One of the distin ctive features of a Maryville education is the Senior Study: The Undergraduate Research and Creative Expression Program of Maryville College. Every degree candidate completes such a project in the major field, under the guidance of a faculty supervisor. Th e Senior Study facilitates the scholarship of discovery within the major field and integrates those methods with the educational goals fostered through the Maryville Curriculum. Within guidelines established by the academic divisions and in consultation wi th division faculty, the subject of the project is of the student's choosing and can take various forms, such as literary, scientific, or historical investigation; laboratory, studio or field work; an interpretive effort; or a creative activity. The Senior Study requirement allows student s to exercise initiative, plan and complete a substantial piece of work, and gain the confidence and pride that comes from accomplishment. Regulations governing the Senior Study may be found in the Academic Procedures and R egulations section of this catalog. PLACEMENT ASSESSMENT S First time, first year, and many transfer students take one or more placement assessments to ensure appropriate placing in course sequences. 1. Initial placement in mathematics is based on student s' ACT/SAT Math score and/or transcript. Students may choose to review appropriate mathematical material (study resources are provided upon request) and complete a math placement assessment to improve their placement. The assessment may indicate the need for required remedial work in Fundamentals of Mathematics (MTH 105) before continuing in college -level mathematics or statistics. This course prepares students for college -level work and offers three institutional credits for satisfactory completion; the credits do not count toward the minimum needed for graduation. Regardless of the results of the math assessment, Maryville College accepts for credit those courses in the mathematical sciences taken through dual enrollment, AP, or IB (An AP exam score of 4 or 5 grants three credit hours). Dual enrollment courses must be passed with a grade of C or higher. 2. Students will receive a preliminary placement in composition based on their ACT English score or SAT Writing score. This placement may be adjusted in t he following ways: Students with a score of 4 or 5 on the AP Examination in either English Language and Composition or English Literature and Composition earn credit for English 110: Composition and Speech I. Students with a n AP score of 4 or 5 on both English Language and Composition and English Literature and Composition earn credit for ENG 110 : Composition and Speech and ENG 160: Early Western Literature Tradition . Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 132 Credit earned through dual enrollment or transfer from an accredited institution in Comp osition I or the equivalent course, with a grade of C or higher, is accepted for English 110: Composition and Speech Credit earned through d ual enrollment or transfer from an accredited institution for both Composition II (and the equivalent) and a course in public speaking, with grades of C or higher, is accepted for English 120: Composition and Speech II. Credit earned through d ual enrollment or transfer from an accredited institution with a grade of C or higher for Composition II is accepted for Englis h 120: Composition and Speech II. Students with this credit who do not have course credit in public speaking must take English 150: Oral Rhetoric. Credit earned through dual enrollment or transfer from an accredited institution with a grade of C or higher for a course in public speaking (without a course in Composition II), is accepted for English 150 : Oral Rhetoric, but students must take English 120 : Composition and Speech II . Students whose ACT English scores or SAT Writing scores fall within selected ranges may take a challenge exam to attempt to place into the next higher level. Students who by means of the written challenge exam successfully place out of the writing portion of English 120 will be given the further opportunity to demonstrate proficien cy in giving a five-minute speech (informative or argumentative) with oral citation of sources; passing this public speaking exam will result in exemption from English 120 (but not credit hours for it). 3. All students are required to take a foreign language placement assessment unless fewer than 2 years (3 -4 semesters) of the chosen language was completed in high school. In this case, the student may enroll in an introductory foreign language course ( SPN, FRN, GER, JPN, CHN, or ASL). Students with language p roficiency developed through other means, including native proficiency, are encouraged to complete the assessment. The results of the placement assessment may qualify a student from exemption from the foreign language requirement. However, placements are b inding and students may not enroll in a level lower than that into which they are placed unless an exception is approved by the language coordinator or the division chair. Regardless of the results of the placement assessment, Maryville College accepts for elective credit those courses in a foreign language taken through dual enrollment, AP, or IB (An AP exam score of 4 or 5 grants three credit hours). Dual enrollment courses must be passed with a grade of C or higher. 4. Students desiring to enroll in Chemist ry will initially be placed in Chemistry 111: Fundamentals of Chemistry or C hemistry 121: General Chemistry according to ACT math scores or other Chemistry readiness assessment. Students may appeal their placement with Dr. Mary Turner, Chemistry Coordinato r. ENGLISH PROFICIENCY EXAMINATION In coursework and personal relations, each student is steadily encouraged to develop the capacity to communicate effectively in written and spoken English. That capacity must also be demonstrated through satisfactory p erformance on an English proficiency examination, required of every student. The examination consists of an essay on a topic either chosen from a group of topics of current interest or assigned by the English 120 instructor in connection with the student's research on a topic for debate. The essay is evaluated by two or more members of the English faculty, who consider its organization, grammatical correctness, clarity, and overall quality. Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 133 The examination is given in English 120. Incoming students bringin g transfer or dual enrollment credit for the equivalent of Composition II, and therefore exempted from English 120, will be enrolled in English 121: Syntax for Writing, at the start of which the English Proficiency Exam will be administered. Students earni ng a grade of Satisfactory in that sitting of the exam will be exempted from the course, and the passing grade of Satisfactory on the English Proficiency Exam will be recorded on the transcript. Students earning a grade of Unsatisfactory on that sitting of the exam will continue in the course, with an opportunity to retake the exam within the course. A student who fails the English Proficiency Exam within the course must repeat the course in subsequent semesters until the exam is passed. All students must p ass the exam before enrolling in Senior Study, the culmination of work in the major field. MAJORS As a degree requirement, each student completes an approved program of concentrated study in a major field. The major is commonly taken in a single discipli ne, along with several courses in related subjects. Some majors are interdisciplinary. An individualized major may be designed, however, to meet particular educational needs. A disciplinary major consists of a minimum of 30 semester hours in a single dis cipline, including six hours devoted to a Senior Study. In the B.A. and the B.S., the major may not require more than 50 hours in a single discipline (i.e. a single three -letter course designation). The B.A. involves a maximum of 56 hours in all major an d related subjects. The teacher licensure track within some majors may exceed the 56 -hour limit because of the addition of professional courses. The B.S. involves a maximum of 70 hours in major and related courses. For an individualized major, possible on ly with the B.A. and B.S. degrees, at least 18 hours in one subject, 12 hours in a related subject, and six hours in Senior Study are required; approval of the Committee on Individualized Instruction must also be obtained. Student s may select a major by the end of the first college year, but the selection may wait until the sophomore year in some fields. Postponement of the choice beyond the sophomore year, or a subsequent change of field, is likely to delay graduation beyond the normal four years. Studen ts planning to pursue a major in a highly structured program, where the sequence of courses is an important consideration, are encouraged to confer with the appropriate academic division chair early in the first year of enrollment. Such fields include the foreign languages, natural sciences, mathematics, teacher education, physical education, and the cooperative programs in engineering and nursing. Permission of the academic division chair must be se cured in order to major in any field. Approval must be re gistered on the proper form filed by the adviser with the College Registrar. Continuation in the major is contingent upon satisfactory academic performance. Substitutions for required major courses are granted only in rare instances and require the written approval of the division chair. For all courses taken to satisfy major requirements for all degrees, a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.00 (2.70 for all teacher licensure majors), must be earned with no more than four semester hours below the grade of \"C -.\" Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 134 MAJOR FIELDS The fields from which majors may be selected are: BACHELOR OF ARTS American Sign Language and Deaf Studies American Sign Language -English Interpreting Art Biochemistry Biological Sciences with a Pre -Veterinary Sciences T rack/Veterinary Medicine Biology* Biopharmaceutical Science s Business & Organization Management Chemistry* Child Development and Learning* Computer Science Computer Science/Business Counseling (See Track in Psychology) Criminal Justice Design Economics* Engineering English* Environmental Studies Finance/Accounting Health Care (Nursing) History* Human Resource Management International Business International Studies Management Marketing Mathematics* Music Outdoor Recreation Philosophy Physical Education* Poli tical Science* Psychology Religion Sign Language Interpreting (See American Sign Language -English Interpreting) Sociology Spanish* Teaching English as a Second Language* Theatre Studies* Writing Communication *Teacher Licensure Track available Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 135 BACHELOR OF MUSIC Music Education (Vocal -General and Instrumental) * Performance (Piano and Vocal) Theory -Composition *Teacher Licensure Track available BACHELOR OF SCIENCE Biology Biochemistry Chemistry Exercise Science Neuroscience COOPERATIVE, DUAL DE GREE MAJOR PROGRAMS - THE SENIOR YEAR IN ABSENTIA B.A . /B.S. - Engineering The cooperative, dual -degree in engineering program normally involves three years at Maryville College before transfer to the cooperating institution.

Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 136 MINORS While there is no requirement to do so, any student may elect to complete one o r more minor fields. The minor option allows students to study an area o f secondary interest in some depth, and to have that study listed on the academic record . The secondary field may be of a vocational or cultural inte rest, or may serve to diversify preparation and enhance career opportunities. A minor consists of at least 15 credit hours in a subject, including 12 hours in courses over the 100-level. Only courses in which a grade of \"C -\" or better is earned are counted toward minor requirements. If a minor is desired, students should make early plans to schedule the approp riate courses. Because minors are not required and the demand for courses is uncertain, regular offerings of all courses for every minor cannot be guaranteed. Specific requirements for each minor are found in departmental listings. In certain fields, a m inor may serve as an additional endorsement for teacher licensure. Minor requirements for additional endorsements are available from academic advisors in the subject areas and may vary from the requirement for a standard minor. Minors may be taken in mos t fields in which a major in offered. In addition, minors are also available in the following areas in which majors are not offered: Accounting American Studies Appalachian Studies Business German* Japanese Medieval Studies Outdoor Studies and Tourism Statistics Sustainability Studies *Teacher licensure track available. Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 137 PROGRAMS OF STUDY The College's major and minor programs and subject listings are described on the following pages . Courses numbered 101 -199 are primarily for first year students , 201 -299 for sophomores, and 300 -399 for juniors and seniors.

W hile many aspects of the college experience, including major -field requirements, allow students to prepare for a variety of careers and professions, general education emphasizes the cultivation of th e intellectual and personal qualities that mark the educa ted person. Through the enhancement of skills and knowledge, the deepening of sensitivities, and the clarification of personal purpose, students learn to deal responsibly in a world of uncertainty and accelerating change. General education is the centerpi ece of any liberal arts degree and provides curricular definition to the mission of a liberal arts college. The Maryville Curriculum follows directly and consciously from the College's Statement of Purpose and Educational Goals. Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 139 The Maryville Curriculum, o ften called the \"core\" curriculum, consists of 51 credit hours. Some general education requirements are met by virtue of the student's major; others may be met by demonstration of competence. Course Descriptions for courses in the Maryville Curriculum are described in the Course Listings section of this Catalog. Distinctive Features of the Maryville Curriculum: Course groupings that are closely aligned with specified educational goals of the College An integrated and sequenced set of foundational courses designed to assist in adjustment to college life, to attend to the developmental and learning issues unique to first year students, and to develop the basic communication, quantitative, and critical thinking skills needed for success in college A range of coursework that provides grounding in the various modes of inquiry and all aspects of the liberal arts A range of choices for students among courses that fulfill common curricular goals Required groupings of courses designed to extend the college learning experience beyond the major and provide integration of liberal learning using various modes of inquiry Recognition that knowledge in certain domains is fulfilled by courses within the major A strong global and cross -cultural dimension Attention to values and ethical decision -making throughout the curriculum, with a capstone course focusing on these matters A curricular structure built upon groups of courses focusing on shared student learning outcomes that result in a broad liberal arts experience An integ rated and sequenced set of vocational development activities and experiences GENERAL EDUCATION RE QUIREMENTS Requirements in General Education are based on the four overarching educational goals of Maryville College. Each student must satisfy requirements for courses in each of the following instructional categories.

American Sign L anguage & Deaf Studies Professor Kathie Shiba, Chair, Division of Behavioral Sciences Associate Professor April Haggard, Coordinator Two majors offered at Maryville College draw on American Sign Language, the Major in American Sign Language and Deaf Stud ies and the major in American Sign Language -English Interpreting. Courses and major requirements for the major in American Sign Language -English Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 142 Interpreting are listed under American Sign Language -English Interpreting in this catalog. Success in America n Sign Language (ASL) and Deaf Studies require s being able to perceive signers' faces, hand movements and body movements and being able to convey and receive ASL through these channels quickly at the natural pace of language. Also essential is the ability to perceive and process visual information and eye -hand coordination that allow effective communication. A good foundation in basic ASL is critical to advancing successfully in the major in ASL and Deaf Studies. The Major in American Sign Language and Dea f Studies is intended for those desiring to pursue studies in the areas of linguistics or anthropology at the graduate level or communication skills/cultural knowledge for use in counseling, social work, teaching, working in schools for the Deaf, or other service fields. Audio -visual materials are accessible for individual study of a broad cross -section of communication methods. Interactions with D/deaf and hard -of-hearing persons and regular practice using video equipment are principal means for the develo pment of skills. Successful graduates of the ASL studies major will be able to comfortably communicate in ASL receptively and expressively and to interact comfortably and appropriately in the Deaf community at entry level. The Major in American Sign Langua ge and Deaf Studies requires 4 6 hours . Students successfully completing the program of study will have achieved the following learning outcomes: 1. Develop a language foundation that promotes growth and flexibility through courses taught by Deaf, native A SL users 2. Incorporate facial signals to convey grammatical information while signing 3. Demonstrate conversational skills, such as turn taking, discussion of culturally -appropriate topics, and leave taking, while relating simple experiences and events 4.

One of the following courses: SOC 202: Social Problems (3 hrs.) SOC 211: Cultural Anthropology (3 hrs.) PSY/SOC 221: Social Psychology (3 hrs.) The Minor in American Sign Language and Deaf Studies requires t he following courses : ASL 203: American Sign Language III (3 hrs.) ASL 307: History and Culture of the American Deaf Community (3 hrs.) Nine additional hours above the 100 -level The Minor in American Sign Language and Deaf Studies is not open to America n Sign Language -English Interpreting majors. American Sign Language -English Interpreting Professor Kathie Shiba, Chair, Division of Behavioral Sciences Associate Professor Margaret Maher, Coordinator The Major in American Sign Language -English Interpr eting prepares students to work as professional interpreters and transliterators with Deaf and with hard -of-hearing persons in a variety of situations. While American Sign Language serves as a foundation, several other modes of communication used by the De af community are introduced as well. Audio -visual materials are accessible for individual study of a broad cross -section of communication methods. Interactions with Deaf and hard -of-hearing persons and regular practice using video equipment are principal m eans for the development of skills. The curriculum prepares students to interpret between spoken English and American Sign Language and to transliterate between conceptually accurate signed English and spoken English. Success in American Sign Language (A SL) and Deaf Studies or American Sign Language -English Interpreting requires being able to perceive signers' faces, hand movements and body movements and being able to convey and receive ASL through these channels quickly at the natural pace of language. A lso essential are ability to perceive and process visual information and eye -hand coordination that allow effective communication. A good foundation in basic ASL is critical to advancing successfully in the ASL and Deaf Studies major as well as the Ameri can Sign Language -English Interpreting major. American Sign Language -English Interpreting majors require good auditory perceptual skills as well as good visual skills when working between auditory and signed communications quickly and in real time. One exc eption is that Deaf people who want to become Deaf interpreters are encouraged to apply to the American Sign Language -English Interpreting program. Such interpreters are often intermediary interpreters who work between signed communications. The major go al of the program is to prepare graduates for entry -level professional interpretation and transliteration assignments between ASL and spoken English, contact varieties, and English -influenced sign forms and Spoken English, respectively. Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 144 Students successfu lly completing the program of study will have achieved the following learning outcomes: 1.

Education Professor Terry Simpson, Director, Teacher Education and Coordinator , Teacher Education Professional Courses Teacher education at Maryville College is an interdepartmental function, the responsibility of the College as a whole rather than a sing le department. The program of preparation combines broad study in the liberal arts, specialized courses in a major field of study, and a professional education component. For all teacher licensure programs, careful planning of one's course of study is ne cessary to ensure that all general education, major, and professional requirements are met in a timely manner. It is particularly important to complete Psychology 101 : Introductory Psychology in the first year. Students should meet with the adviser for tea cher licensure in their major area as soon as possible. Student teach ing consists of 15 weeks of full -day responsibilities. Students are encouraged to pass the Praxis Subject Assessments before they are assigned to student teaching. Teacher Education Lea rning Outcomes The Maryville College faculty and administration believe that the teacher education program should provide students with the skills, dispositions, and knowledge needed to be successful first-year teachers. Our coordinated efforts are dedic ated to provide a teacher education program that will develop teachers who demonstrate: 1.The influence of a broad liberal arts education 2.An understanding of the learning process and the skills to design instruction appropriate for diverse student populatio ns 3.The skills needed to analyze and implement the instructional process Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 170 4. The ability to solve the many theoretical, practical, and ethical problems associated with who to teach, what to teach, and how to teach 5. The ability to effectively integrate technology into the instructional process 6. A thorough, comprehensive understanding of the assessment process as it relates to student learning and professional development 7. A commitment to personal and professional growth Screening Admission to into the Teacher Educ ation Program and progression thereafter is not automatic and occurs only after certain qualifications are met. Teacher education candidacy is determined at three points within the curriculum. Level I Screening meetings are held in September and February each year. Candidates are asked to provide a writing sample, professional recommendations, a self -evaluation, and a personal health report. The following are required for admission: Minimum 2.75 GPA Minimum 2 1 ACT or minimum 1020 SAT Satisfactory FBI/ TBI background check Satisfactory interview with a screening team Level II Screening takes place the year prior to student teaching and serves as a mid -point check of competencies and dispositions required of pre -service teachers. Level III screening takes p lace at the end of education coursework and determines r eadiness for Student Teaching. The process includes a written reflection of professional preparation followed by an interview with Teacher Education faculty. The Teacher Education Screening Team co nsiders all information gathered and determines each candidate's admission and continuation status. An individual meeting is held with candidate s to share screening decision s.

Maryville College Percentage Maryville College website: maryvillecollege.edu. Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 174 Engineering B.A./B.S.: Senior Year in Absentia Associate Professor Maria Siopsis, Coordinator Maryville College cooperates with several un iversities in a way that enables a student to combine extensive preparation in the liberal arts with professional training in engineering. This arrangement allows the student to earn two degrees, one from Maryville College and one from the engineering scho ol. The first three years are spent at Maryville, completing Maryville College's general education requirements and the courses necessary for further study in engineering or applied science; the remaining time, normally two years, is spent at an accredited school of engineering. Maryville College has formal dual -degree arrangements with Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, Tennessee Technological University in Cookeville, Tennessee, the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, Tennessee, and Auburn University in Auburn, Alabama. Maryville College will honor the dual -degree arrangement with other regionally accredited institutions if the student is able to make transfer arrangements. After approximately four years of study, which include 96 semester hours from Maryville College and 32 semester hours (with grades of \"C\" or better) from the engineering school, the student will receive the Bachelor of Arts degree from the College. When all requirements for the engineering degree have been met, usually b y the end of the fifth year of study, the engineering school will award the Bachelor of Science degree in the area of specialization. The second degree may be earned in over a dozen engineering fields, as well as in the applied sciences, depending on th e university that the student attends. Maryville students enroll in the engineering school as transfer students. The College's Dual - Degree program coordinator assists the students in both selecting an engineering school and in the transfer process. The de cision to admit rests with the cooperating university, not with Maryville College. Admission to some engineering fields is very competitive, reflecting high demand for places in an entering class. Students successfully completing the program of study will have achieved the following learning outcomes: 1. Communicate mathematical ideas with precision and clarity in both written and oral form. 2. Develop expertise in appropriate technology for desired career path 3. Understand and apply mathematical concepts in both theoretical and applied areas 4. Model real -world problems, abstract real-world problems into the appropriate math world, solve problems mathematically, and translate the math answers into real -world terms, and evaluate the correctness and validity of the an swers 5. Experience the application of mathematics to other disciplines through appropriate related courses Any student interested in pursuing the dual -degree option is urged to consult the Dual -Degree Coordinator in the Division of Mathematics and Computer Science as early in the first year as possible. The program is highly structured, and most of the courses are part of a sequence. For that reason, the course of study must be carefully planned to ensure that all general education Maryville College Catalog 2016-2017 Page 175 and major requirements ar e met during the three years spent at Maryville.

Mathematics Professor Jeff Bay, Chair, Division of Mathematics and C omputer Science and Coordinator The importance of mathematics to the educated person has been established since the Middle Ages, when arithmetic and geometry were recognized as two of the seven liberal arts constituting the traditional course of study at a university. Mathematics is even more vital to liberal education today, when every citizen must be equipped with the quantitative skills needed to navigate our technological and data -driven world. The increasing demand for well -trained professionals in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields is well - documented, and all of these require knowledge of mathematics. The curriculum in mathematics develops a student's ability to think analytically and construct logical arguments, build ing a foundation to support advanced study in mathematics, but also providing a gateway to the expansive, diverse career opportunities in the mathematical sciences. The program provides students a range of experiences in both abstract and applied mathemat ics, as well as in the partner disciplines of computer science and physics. Two distinct major programs are offered. The Major in Mathematics provides a broad curriculum for students planning careers which require mathematical skill and problem -solving ability. Students may enter graduate school programs in mathematics, statistics, or related disciplines, or pursue careers in a variety of fields such as actuarial science, biomathematics, operations research, teaching, or finance.

The credential is recognized as evidence of outstanding preparation for entry -level professional positions by a number of nonprofit organizations, such as the YMCA and YWCA , Big Brothers and Big Sisters, Catholic Charities, the Urban League, the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, Habitat for Humanity, Junior Achievement, organizations serving environmental interests, and international non - governmental organizations. Growth in the d emand for professional management and leadership by nonprofit organizations is expected to continue. The program is managed by an Executive Director, and governed by an Advisory Board that includes faculty of the College, as well as representatives from area nonprofit organizations. All program elements are part of the academic program of the College. Students work with the Director of the Nonprofit Leadership Program and their academic advisors to establish individualized curricular and co -curricular pr ograms that fulfill the requirements for the credential. Students will also participate in a student association related to the program. The director of the program provides assistance and guidance to the student association, coordinates internships, and assists students in finding post -graduate employment.

Philosophy Professor Dan Klingensmith , Chair, Division of Humanities Associate Professor Andrew Irvine, Coordinator A liberal arts education is literally about the \"arts of freedom.\" To be truly free, requires one to question and to think for oneself. Philosophy, which literally means the \"love of wisdom,\" lies at the heart of a liberal arts education because it asks students to question, explore, and pursue truth wherever it may lead. In philosophy, rigor, honesty, an d humility are requisite to exploring questions about reality and truth, justice and morality, life and death, language and culture, society and politics, and God and the meaning of existence.

Nevertheless, the study of Spanish does not simply involve language acquisition vis -\u00e0-vis classroom instruction; the acquisition of a language requires intellectual engagement through the study of the various cultures and histories of the peoples who claim Spanish as their native tongue. The Spanish faculty are dedicated to facilitating t he acquisition and understanding of this modern language in a practical fashion and in a variety of settings such as serving in a n internship in the general community and via a semester -long study abroad experience in a Spanish -speaking country. In additio n, students of Spanish are expected to increase second language proficiency \u2014oral, aural, and written \u2014via exposure to and academic engagement with a variety of media be it literary, film, historical, or professional (journalism, business, etc.). These media challenge students to question their perception of the various Hispanic cultures and to engage in critical inquiry that leads to a wider understanding of the world. Given the international and domestic influence of Spanish and Hispanic cultures in all aspects of daily life, the Major in Spanish provides a holistic academic, cultural, and linguistic preparation that enables the student to compete in a professional market increasingly needful of bilingual employees.
