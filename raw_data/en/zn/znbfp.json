[ View our latest analysis for NovoCure ](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/healthcare/nasdaq-nvcr/novocure?utm_medium=finance_user&utm_source=yahoo&utm_campaign=CTA_ticker&blueprint=282412) Was NVCR's weak performance lately a part of a long-term decline? NVCR is loss-making, with the most recent trailing twelve-month earnings of -US$63.6m (from 31 December 2018), which compared to last year has become more negative. However, the company's loss seem to be contracting over the medium term, with the five-year earnings average of -US$93.0m. Each year, for the past five years NVCR has seen an annual increase in operating expense growth, outpacing revenue growth of 55%, on average. This adverse movement is a driver of the company's inability to reach breakeven. Viewing growth from a sector-level, the US medical equipment industry has been growing its average earnings by double-digit 31% in the prior year, Although NovoCure is loss-making, it has a sufficient cash cushion (US$246m) to pay for its upcoming operating expenses over the next year. This is a strong indication of good cash management. What does this mean? While past data is useful, it doesn't tell the whole story. Companies that incur net loss is always hard to envisage what will happen in the future and when. The most valuable step is to examine company-specific issues NovoCure may be facing and whether management guidance has consistently been met in the past.
