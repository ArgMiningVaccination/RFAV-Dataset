Well, to answer your queries and put your mind to rest, the [American ](https://www.healthshots.com/health-news/wear-your-masks-even-when-you-are-indoors-says-the-cdc/)Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has released its first set of guidelines on activities that people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 can safely resume. On Monday 8th March 2021, the American [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/p0308-vaccinated-guidelines.html) released recommendations entailing how vaccinated people can take the first step toward returning to everyday activities in their respective communities. Broadly, these guidelines highlight that fully vaccinated people are at liberty to visit with other fully vaccinated people indoors without wearing masks or staying 6 feet apart. They may also visit unvaccinated people from one other household indoors without wearing masks or staying 6 feet apart if everyone in the other household is at low risk for severe disease. Moreover, fully vaccinated people may refrain from quarantine and testing if they do not have symptoms of COVID-19 after contact with someone who has COVID-19. As per CDC, the said guidance is based on [latest science](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/fully-vaccinated-people.html), keeping in mind the efficacy and effectiveness of the approved vaccines. The guidance aims to propagate the message though prevention measures such as masks and social distancing will continue to be necessary regardless of [vaccination status](https://www.healthshots.com/preventive-care/family-care/how-to-register-your-parents-for-the-covid-19-vaccine-and-is-it-safe-for-them/), fully vaccinated persons may resume certain social activities with low or reduced risk of acquiring or [transmitting COVID-19](https://www.healthshots.com/health-news/experts-suggest-covid-19-infection-rates-might-spike-due-to-the-harsh-summer-in-india/). The CDC Director Rochelle P. Walensky, MD, MPH said, \"we know that people want to get vaccinated so they can get back to doing the things they enjoy with the people they love\". She further adds that, \"There are some activities that fully vaccinated people can begin to resume now in their own homes. Everyone\u2014even those who are vaccinated\u2014should continue with all mitigation strategies when in public settings.\" Guidelines also include that a person is considered being fully vaccinated two weeks after receiving the last required dose of vaccination against COVID-19. The data provided by the guidelines clarified that approximately 31 million Americans or 9.2% of the US population are fully vaccinated with an approved [COVID-19](https://www.healthshots.com/health-news/this-105-year-old-woman-beat-covid-19-and-credits-gin-soaked-raisins-for-her-immunity/) vaccine. Since a large population is yet to receive the COVID-19 vaccine doses, people are generally advised to be cautious until the vaccination program has reached a certain threshold of coverage. Moreover, it is important to note that CDC will update these recommendations as more people get vaccinated, rates of COVID-19 in the community change and additional scientific evidence becomes available.
