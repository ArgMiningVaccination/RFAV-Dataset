If you have fully recovered or know of someone who has, please share your experience. Also, how much time did it take to fully recover from it and what were the symptoms. This will help a lot of us who are anxious. Its better to discuss the positive side than focus on the negative. PLEASE ONLY REPLY ON THIS TOPIC IF YOU HAVE RECOVERED FOR THE SIDE EFFECTS. PLEASE DON'T SPAM! Great idea for a thread. I got my first pfizer on 8/8 and developed dizziness, pressure headaches, fatigue, brain fog, tingling, twitching, internal tremors, numb patches, electric sensations, blurry vision etc. The symptoms started at day 3 (dizziness) and lasted just over 3 months. The twitching, tingling etc were the first symptoms to dissipate and fatigue, headaches the last. I still get the very occasional headache or tingle but basically I feel pretty good. The problem is that now I have to decide whether to get the second jab. New Zealand has just brought in mandates so without the 2nd one i cant work, go to a hairdresser, cafe and a million other things. I have been following a couple of people here who had their second with the help of anti-histamines and prednisone and am trying to build up the courage to do the same. Hi everyone, I've had the same symptoms as you all. I recently shared my experiences. This is just an update. I'm a currently not doing as bad as I was after 3 weeks. I have been taking curcumin, B complex, omega 3. In addition to these I've been taking a shot of apple cider vinegar with ginger and tumeric (this I bought organic on Amazon). I also prepare Seamoss and mix it with pineapple just to make it more palatable (though the moss is kinda flavourless). Seamoss is great for inflammation. I realise that since taking these my body has felt much better. However, I have recently started to experience more itching over my body at one point I had pain in both legs which was after having a pain at the side of my feet (instep) burnt like hell. Then I had pain on the top of my feet in the ankle area. Felt like it was a vein. It was after that pain my legs hurt. I still have brain fog but I must say I have been either more accommodating or a lot better. It's not over yet and it been 2 months. I've had 2 MRI one normal waiting on the other which was of my back and neck. I'm happy to talk with anyone who needs to talk. It's my first name Cassandrab39 and I use Hotmail dot com. Don't know if this is allowed .. I just want to add I am a Christian woman and I pray alot, that's my main source of treatment. I don't know what's been put on these vaccines but I really want to know what's the difference with us from those who had no reactions. [Thisistoomuch](https://vestibular.org/participant/margaret2022/), [Buzzgirl](https://vestibular.org/participant/buzzgirl/), [KISWA](https://vestibular.org/participant/kimausti/)and 4 people reacted Cassandra, thank you for your post I did send you an email. I have been suffering from strong dizziness and numbness of leg for 2 months as of today Dec 04. I don't know what they put this in the vaccines either. And why some people get side effects and others don't. I hope with third, 4th and subsequent doses more people don't experience symptoms like ours. I pray for the kids too who are now receiving shots as young as 5 years old. I hope as Christians our faith keeps us fighting and that God who knows everything has created us with the power to overcome this genetically and spiritually. May you have a Merry Christmas. on june 12th 21 I had my one and only dose of pfizer even though I had helppessly gone through the disease a year before. Covid was miserable as I was coughing constantly, had a foggy brain, muscle pain, photophobia, no taste and no appetite and I was feverish for 2 weeks and on top of that I had a kidney stone stuck in my ureter. Recovery took 5-6 weeks and all I took was vitamin d as I was deficient at the time and paracetamol with caffeine just because I couldn't stop my coughing fits. I had an oximeter and a thermometer on hand and thankfully my oxygen lvl never dropped below 96 and I kept my temp in check. I have since then been exposed countless times to other ppl who either had kids who had it or customers at work who would be coughing everywhere and thankfully I didn'tt get reinfected. At any rate I decided ro have the pfizer vax cuz my boyfriend decided to do it and was like I'm gonna send you all my money if sth happens to me. so I had it as well the second day after his. He got away with arm pain and a mild fever that lasted a few hours. I on the other hand was fine the first day, no fever no nothing. second night in I was watching a movie and suddenly my body starts twitching uncontrollably.I could feel my muscles contract in my thighs and my teeth were shaking and I couldn't stop it for an hour. A few days after I start feeling dizzy at random times, mostly at night and I had to lay down and wait for it to pass. By the end of first week I started having pins and needles in my whole body, I had palpitations whenever I would lay down and try to get some rest and I was constantly feeling impending doom. There was this weird abdominal pain that would move around but was mostly felt in the stomach that eventually got so bad I could feel it puncturing my back. I called my gp at this point to express my concern especially for dizziness and palpitations which were instantly dismissed as vaccine side effects. But the worst of all was severe dehydration, I couldn't sleep for 2 months because of it and when it got better the stomach pain exacerbated which lasted another 2-3 months up until recently. I had undergone an endoscopy and had a course of antibiotics and all the antacids available in different combos for helicobacter pilori which I had 4 years ago but there was no sign of stomach ulcers or anything. only now in December I can say I am somewhat free of symptoms. my gerd improved and I'm not on antacids anymore, I'm still dehydrated constantly but nowhere near as bad as before. But I didn't have my second shot and I probably won't do it no matter if I lose workplace or anything. I can't be going through this shit again with no clear indication of what immunity I am actually gaining from this and guarantee I will be safe against omicron and other upcoming variants. Idk if I'm just prone to having these symptoms because I'm lacking vitamins or I'm obese or because the shot somehow entered in a vein as I wasn't aware about aspiration. I had a rough time but nowhere near what other stories I've seen.I hope everyone who was unlucky and affected can recover soon.Take care! Great idea for a thread.

I hope you get rid of the remaining issues as well. I am having a hard time and don't have the strength to carry on with life anymore. I am 2 months in post my 1st jab and don't think I can manage to live with this for a long time. I miss my old self and I cannot wrap my head around the fact that a substance that had to protect me has put me in so much trouble. How do I carry on with my life being scared, worried and tensed 24\u00d77. Think what is wrong with it and how to recover knowing the fact that no medicines can heal us nor there is any explanation to what we're going through. Have constant bouts of ending my life but, I am scared. I have a family to take care and they have no where to go. Only a miracle can save me. I don't think I can be so patient or accept to live the rest of my life with so many unexplained illnesses. [@medee](https://vestibular.org/participant/medee/) It gets better. for me, month 2 was the worst and I had many days where I didn't want to leave my room. Find a naturopath or a functional doctor. Ordinary doctors have no idea. Then spend time meditating, deep breathing or hypnotherapy or anything you find relaxing. At the time I didn't know it was helping but bit by bit I realised that I was improving. It does get better.

Could you please resend? [@kim-h](https://vestibular.org/participant/kim-h/) I did as well besides drinking litres of water each day. It was a pretty hot summer tho and that didn't make it any easier I'm sorry to hear you're in so much pain. Clearly there are more aspects to life that are being overlooked and it's affecting our mental and emotional ballance. I would suggest just postponing having other jabs until you recover and regain some hope and are able to make better decisions that are not influenced by fear. Don't let bad politics break your spirit, it's not easy to manage huge infection numbers and of course there will be casualties. We all know vaccines can only mitigate symptoms and not break transmission/ stop infection and sometimes create even more harm. There are no guarantees and the best thing anyone can do is prepare their terrain with supplements, healthy diet and exercise and where appropriate vaccines. I lived for 2 years in fear that I am going to get reinfected and die and so far it didn't happen. The actual survival rate is 99.67% or sth and the mass hysteria is not being backed up by science. The most tragic part is that hospitals are overwhelmed, doctor appointment s cancelled because they are being ran under the premise they can take the pressure and that ppl will either give up on seaking help or just vaccinate and hope for the best outcome. Lockdown s are still necessary to flatten out the curve, despite high vaccine uptake. If you feel hesitant and concerned after experiencing nasty side effects I would suggest not doing it. Doctors, world leaders need to start acknowledging the self inflicted damage and come up with better solutions, refocus on the overlooked health issues, draw up some hopeful way out of it. If we just comply and allow ourselves to be lab rats they won't complain. I'm sorry for the rant but it kills me to see how broken and helpless everyone feels despite following gov guidelines.

The fact that we've all got symptoms which the covid long haulers get that too from a vaccine makes it so disturbing for us. I am certainly not going for further jabs but, the fact that my life has almost come to a standstill make me regret my decision. I agree C is dangerous but, what's the point of injecting a substance which is mimicking C symptoms in non C people. I am not a person who's stepped out of the house since all of this began and probably would've never got infected. But the fact that I am now suffering from injuries makes me wonder if this will "}
