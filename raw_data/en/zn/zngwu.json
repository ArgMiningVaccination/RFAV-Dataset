What seemed to many in 1981 to be a virus af - fecting primarily gay men in the United States is now a pandemic affecting tens of millions of men, women, and children worldwide. Today, more than a million people in the U.S. are living with HIV/AIDS, and it is estimated another 40,000 will become infected this year \u2014 a rate that has not decreased in 15 years. Globally, an estimated 40 million people are living with HIV/AIDS, and more than 25 million have died.1 Today, most Americans know the basics about AIDS \u2014 that HIV can be transmitted through unprotected intercourse and sharing needles for injection drug use, and that there are drugs that can extend the lives of those living with HIV \u2014 yet stigma, discrimination, and fear still endure. As of 2006, one in five Americans (21%) say they would be \"very\" or \"somewhat\" uncomfortable working with someone with HIV/AIDS, and more than a third (39%) would be uncomfortable living with some - one with HIV/AIDS.2 When it comes to where Americans get information about HIV/AIDS, the media is a frequently named resource. Six in ten people (61%) in a national survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2006 report that the media \u2014 including televi - sion, radio, newspapers, and the Internet \u2014 is their primary source of informa - tion about HIV/AIDS.3 While news coverage is certainly a major resource, public education campaigns on HIV/AIDS emerged in the early years of the epidemic, and increasingly entertainment media is playing a more significant role informing Americans about a range of health and social issues, including HIV/AIDS. This report focuses primarily on how national media campaigns about HIV/AIDS have evolved over the last 25 years in the U.S. reflecting the changing nature of the disease as awareness and treatment have progressed. The campaigns operate alongside the work of activists, health care providers, policy makers, and others who are involved in addressing HIV/AIDS. A review of national media campaigns over time, in fact, yields several important observations about the changing nature of the epidemic in the U.S. During the early years of the epidemic, people were fearful and there was limited information about HIV/AIDS. There were also no widespread, coordinated public education efforts. The first national campaigns using television and print advertising emerged in the late 1980s after the U.S. Surgeon General had outlined a set of HIV prevention guide -lines and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had approved the first treatment for people with AIDS. These early advertising campaigns debuted after widely covered press stories, including the death of Rock Hudson and the story of Ryan White, a 13-year old hemophiliac who was barred from school in 1985 and became a public symbol of AIDS-related stigma. During the 1990s, the shock of Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson's announcement that he was HIV-positive defied the public's sense at the time of who was at risk. In the mid 1990s, the rate of new HIV infections slowed in the U.S., and national government-sponsored campaigns were ending. As treatment became more effec - tive, new complexities emerged around prevention and testing messages. Public education campaigns faced the challenge of balancing the success of the new treat - ments without implying a cure or inadvertently leading to increased risk-taking. Pharmaceutical companies faced controversy for portraying HIV/AIDS as a treatable, chronic condition in ads for anti-retroviral therapies. Some in the AIDS community were concerned that this misrepresented the reality that treatment is not a cure.4 More recently, the global epidemic has gained a higher profile, with public edu - cation campaigns to raise awareness, raise money and motivate political interests becoming prominent. Popular culture icons, such as Bono and Angelina Jolie, have taken up the cause. This report offers a snapshot of some of the public education campaigns in the U.S. over the last 25 years and brings together insights on their approaches, historical context, and impact. It also documents some of the shifting organizations and in - terests behind advertising related to HIV/AIDS, from government-sponsored efforts to campaigns developed by non-profit and non-governmental groups to messages developed by or through partnerships with the media industry itself. This is not an exhaustive inventory of all the public education efforts since 1981, but rather a collection of some of the largest and most prominent national campaigns that employed public service advertising directed primarily at U.S. audiences between 1981 through to date. It is organized by chronological eras representing fluid peri - ods in the history of the epidemic defined by epidemiology, government policy, and public opinion. Where available, this document outlines assessment and evaluation results, and short summaries of each campaign profile can be found in the report's appendix.k a i s e r f a m i l y f o u n d a t i o n / \u0018k a i s e r f a m i l y f o u n d a t i o n / \u0018On June 5, 1981, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) introduced the world to the disease that eventu - ally became known as AIDS. On that date, the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) reported on five cases of young homosexual men who had developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, a type of pneumonia that was \"almost exclusively limited to severely immuno-suppressed patients\" such as those receiving cancer chemotherapy. Although the report noted that the \"patients did not know each other and had no known common contacts or knowledge of sexual partners who had had similar illnesses,\" it stated, \"the fact that these patients were all homosexuals suggests an association between some aspect of a homosexual lifestyle or disease acquired through sexual contact...in this population.\"5 Whereas the disease had most certainly been present earlier in the U.S. and elsewhere, the CDC's report marked a defining moment in public recognition and response to the emerging epidemic. Labeled initially a \"gay disease,\" the new illness seemed to be a concern for scientists and the gay community, but not for \"mainstream\" America. In 1982, the CDC formally established the term \"Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).\" The dominant form of public communication about the disease was in news reporting. During these early years, activists took the lead in responding to AIDS, especially in major urban areas like New York City and San Francisco, through community education projects and local campaigns that employed informational materials and advertising including billboards, broadsides, buttons and leaflets. New organizations emerged to fill the gap in information and services for communities impacted by AIDS. The Gay Men's Health Crisis, the first community-based AIDS service provider in the U.S., was established in New York City in 1982. In 1983, the National Association of People with AIDS was founded. That same year, a group of HIV-positive activists disrupted a U.S. public health conference to issue a statement, referred to as The Denver Principles , on the rights of people living with AIDS. Americans \u2014 and indeed the world \u2014 saw some of the earliest images of AIDS in 1985 with the very public death of film star Rock Hudson. That same year, designer Kenneth Cole allocated his company's entire advertising budget to a campaign featur - ing an Annie Leibowitz photo of eight well-known models posing barefoot with a group of children. The message was \"For the future of our children...support the American Foundation for AIDS Research.\" It was Kenneth Cole's first ad for the organization known more commonly as amfAR, kicking off a two-decade long and ongoing collaboration. By mid-decade, it was clear that the public was listening. Some of the earliest public opinion data from the Gallup Organization in June 1985 found that 95 percent of the U.S. population had heard of AIDS.6 1981 \u2014 1985 / A New Threat and the Activist Responsek a i s e r f a m i l y f o u n d a t i o n / \u0018K A I S E R F A M I L Y F O U N D A T I O N / 9On October 22, 1986, U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop issued the Surgeon General's Report on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome . Within a year of its release twelve million copies had been distributed by members of Congress to their constitu - ents.7 The same year, the American Red Cross partnered with the Ad Council to launch the first national campaign to address AIDS-related stigma and misinformation about the disease. Public opinion data from 1985 revealed that many Americans were afraid of people living with HIV/AIDS. Nearly half (47%) said they would \"avoid\" someone who had tested positive.8 Many Americans were concerned and often confused about how the disease was transmitted. A series of television public service announcements (PSAs) were created using celebrities and other personalities, including Meryl Streep and Robert De Niro, to deliver messages debunking some of these commonly held myths. The tagline of the campaign was: \"Rumors are spreading faster than AIDS.\" The 1986-1987 Rumors television campaign directly challenged beliefs held by many Americans and encouraged viewers to seek out the facts by writing to the Red Cross for more information. The spots were developed by the J. Walter Thompson agency and placed by the Ad Council with network-level and local television ailiates. Select Rumors Television PSAs Robert De Niro is incredulous that people still believe you can get AIDS from shaking hands or sharing telephones. He says, wagging his finger, that there has never been a single documented case of AIDS being spread through casual contact. Meryl Streep talks about how rumors are almost always not true, such as the rumors about AIDS. She says many people think you can get the disease from swimming pools or a mosquito bite. They are wrong. Elizabeth McGovern stresses that AIDS is sexually transmitted, so you have be aware and selective when it comes to sex. She says you're sleeping with every person your partner has been with for the last 10 years. Ahmad Rashad stresses that you can't get AIDS from donating blood. When you give blood it is the first and the last time that needle was used, he says. In 1987, President Ronald Reagan gave his first speech about AIDS, establishing the Presidential Commission on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Epidemic. Later it was renamed the Watkins Commission, after its chairperson James D. Watkins. The same year, the CDC launched America Responds to AIDS , the first government-sponsored, national public education cam - paign to address HIV/AIDS. Mandated initially by Congress in 1985, the campaign was an initiative of the CDC, developed by a team at the Ogilvy & Mather Public Relations Group. It ran until 1996, rolling out waves of advertising throughout those years. Around this same time, advocacy groups, such as ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power), were using provocative images and bold slogans to raise awareness, reduce stigma, and expand access to the newly FDA-approved treatment \u2014 Azidothymidine (AZT). Perhaps the most iconic image from ACT UP was the pink triangle with the words \"SILENCE=DEATH\" below it, which became a defining symbol of activism in the U.S. RUMORS CAMPAIGN \\ MERYL STREEP RUMORS CAMPAIGN \\ ROBERT DENIRO ('%\u000f\u00bf\u000f ('(\u000f\u000f CWT\u000f78E 083B\u000f?B0\u000fXb\u000f1^a]1 0 / EV O L U T I O N O F A N EP I D E M I C :25YE A R S O F H I V/A I D S ME D I A CA M P A I G N S I N T HE U.S.The public education challenge facing America Responds to AIDS was Herculean. At the time, only seven percent of Americans reported \"personally\" knowing someone with HIV/AIDS, and many supported eorts to segregate and punish infected people.9 More than half (54%) thought that \"people with the AIDS virus should be made to carry a card to this eect,\" and a similar percentage considered it \"people's own fault if they get AIDS.\" A quarter of the U.S. public approved of employers dismissing workers with AIDS.10 The America Responds to AIDS campaign took a long-view approach to the issue and relied on a combina - tion of communications strategies, including media relations, organizational relationship development, and direct-to consumer materials, as well as traditional advertising to get out information about HIV/AIDS. The goal was to initiate a public dialogue about HIV/AIDS to reduce fear and dispel myths. The first phase of America Responds to AIDS , titled \"General Awareness: Humanizing AIDS,\" targeted the general population. The advertising focused on real people aected by the disease. The ads included a multi-racial cast of AIDS counselors and vol - unteers, people living with HIV/AIDS, and those who had a family member aected by the disease. They spoke from everyday settings: the park, their homes and offices. The call to action was \"Know the facts about AIDS. Know how to protect yourself and your family. Tell others.\" The campaign promoted the CDC's national AIDS Hotline, stating \"For answers to your questions, call 1-800-342-AIDS.\" \"Minneapolis\" A white woman, Elizabeth O'Brien, who is introduced as an \"AIDS Volunteer,\" says she learned about AIDS when her brother was diagnosed. She says she had to learn a lot very quickly and it was a harsh reality. A young white man, Bill Travis, who the screen says \"has AIDS\" tells viewers, \"If I, the son of a Baptist minister, from basically a rural area can acquire AIDS, anybody can.\" A Latina, Carole LaFavor, who also has AIDS, says, \"Obviously, women can get AIDS. I'm certainly here a witness to that. It's not a 'we / they' disease. It's an 'us' disease.\" The narrator concludes with the statement, \"AIDS is not a problem that aects other people. AIDS aects us all.\" In 1989, America Responds to AIDS began rolling out a series of more targeted ads directed at some of those at higher risk: minorities, sexually active young, adults, and injection drug users. Additional waves of advertising followed over the next seven years. \"Five People\" Five dierent African Americans discuss HIV/AIDS and their community. A minister walks out of his church, speaking about how they have been trying to do something about AIDS. \"A solution isn't going to turn up tomorrow,\" he says. An elderly male doctor talks about injection drug use, which he says is responsible for many of the AIDS cases in his community. \"Sharing drug implements can be lethal,\" he says. A middle-aged male doctor speaking from his lab says, \"It's important that everyone find out the facts about AIDS.\" A male barber tells viewers, \"AIDS has had its eect on the community. You've got to learn how to deal with it. Tell your friends and neighbors to get the facts. It's important.\" A female doctor says there is no cure for AIDS, but \"It's everyone's job to work out prevention.\" The ad ends with the min - ister, who says, \"AIDS is calling on all of us to help each other. Spread the word and we can stop the spread of AIDS.\" The next year, the campaign complemented its PSA strategy with a direct mailing to millions of Americans. In an unprecedent - ed eort, the Surgeon General's Understanding AIDS pamphlet was sent to every household in the U.S. The guide, developed by then-Surgeon General Dr. C. Everett Koop, provided information about the risks of unprotected sex and injection drug use. ARTA CAMPAIGN / 1987 / M INNEAPOLIS ARTA CAMPAIGN / 1987 / NYC ARTA CAMPAIGN / 1987 / LAK A I S E R F A M I L Y F O U N D A T I O N / 1 1By 1992, the federal government had spent $7.36 million developing America Responds to AIDS . Between the launch of the campaign, in October 1987, and January 1992, the television PSAs aired more than 59,000 times at the network and affili - ate levels across broadcast television channels. According to a 1991 report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the value of commercial airtime for the campaign was estimated at $67.8 million. The CDC reported that, on average, American adults between the age of 18 and 54 saw campaign television PSAs at least 56 times over that 33-month period.11 All radio, television, and print advertisements were distributed by Ogilvy on a public service basis. No funds were used to purchase advertising time; the campaign relied entirely on airtime donated by broadcasters.12 A decade after it had launched, the original message of the CDC's America Responds to AIDS \u2014 that \"anyone can get HIV/AIDS\" \u2014 was sharply criticized in a Pulitzer Prize-winning Wall Street Journal article by some in the AIDS community as having mis - represented the true scope of the epidemic at the time. The article commented on the campaign saying, \"While the message was technically true, it was also highly misleading. Everyone certainly faced some danger, but for most heterosexuals, the risk from a single act of sex was smaller than the risk of ever getting hit by lightning.\" The emphasis on the \"broad reach of the disease,\" the reporters argued, failed in connecting with some of those at highest risk: gay men having unprotected sex, injec - tion drug users and their sexual partners.13 In 1988, the Ad Council worked with amfAR and the National AIDS Network to develop another public education campaign called AIDS Prevention . The advertising agency behind the creative was Scali, McCabe, Sloves, Inc. AIDS Prevention televi - sion PSAs ran concurrently with America Responds to AIDS , and were the first advertisements to use the word 'condom' in the U.S. Launched in September of 1988, just months before the first World AIDS Day (December 1st), the campaign received the endorsement of Surgeon General Koop and continued until 1990. The print campaign included multiple ads in both English and Spanish. All of the ads recommended using a latex condom with spermicide during sexual intercourse. Select AIDS Prevention Print Advertising Headline: \"Everything you didn't want to know about AIDS. But should.\" The subsequent text reads, \"you don't have to be gay or a drug user to get it,\" explaining that the disease simply hit those groups first, before we figured out how to prevent its spread. The ad includes statistics on HIV prevalence and warns about how rapidly the virus is spreading. It explains how the approximate ten-year latency period means that HIV-positive people may not appear sick and can unknowingly pass on the virus. The ad specifies that the virus can be transmitted through needle-sharing and through sexual intercourse from men to men, women to men, or men to women. After acknowledging that abstinence is the best protection, the ad recommends condoms. to the ad concludes with the statement: \"You can ignore these precautions only if you and your partner have been together for at least 10 years, and both of you have been totally faithful. Otherwise, don't make any exceptions. Because the one time you do can be the one time he shouldn't have.\" Headline: \"Any woman who wants to have a baby should use them.\" In the middle of the ad is a package with the words \"Latex Condoms\" printed on top. The surrounding text says that condoms are the best protection against HIV and that women should use them if they plan on having children one day, because there is a 50 percent chance they would pass HIV onto their baby. The text follows, \"And babies with AIDS rarely live to see their second birthday.\" The ad recommends latex condoms with spermicide until a woman is ready to get pregnant, \"Because no matter when you plan on having your baby, you have to start being a good mother right now.\" AIDS PREVENTION CAMPAIGN / VILMA1 2 / EV O L U T I O N O F A N EP I D E M I C :25YE A R S O F H I V/A I D S ME D I A CA M P A I G N S I N T HE U.S.Headline: \"You look like you have AIDS.\" The text says, \"You have all the signs. You look perfectly healthy. You feel fine.\" It goes on to explain how the 10-year latency period can prevent people from knowing they are infected. Thus, without knowing, people may be practicing unsafe sex and spreading the virus. The ad says you can prevent transmission of the AIDS virus and recommends using a condom \"no matter how good someone looks. Because while the AIDS virus isn't something you can see, it's something you can get.\" The television spots employed a similar hard-hitting strategy with a call to action promoting prevention \u2014 \"Help stop AIDS. Use a condom.\" \"Macho\" A visibly sad teenage Latino stands in the rain. He recounts how he told his brother that if he had sex, he should use condoms so he wouldn't get AIDS. But his brother had laughed at him, saying, \"Condoms aren't macho.\" Then the teen kneels down, and the camera follows to reveal he is sitting in a cemetery. Looking down over his brother's grave, he reflects gloomily, \"My brother, he was so macho.\" By 1989, the CDC's National AIDS Hotline had received more than one million calls. In addition to serving as the call-to-action for various public service advertising eorts, the number was promoted through a variety of sources, including by Madonna and the rock band Kiss, who printed it on their album jackets. By the end of the decade, one in 10 Americans personally knew someone with AIDS.14 AIDS PREVENTION CAMPAIGN / MACHOK A I S E R F A M I L Y F O U N D A T I O N / 1 3Perhaps no other moment in the history of the epidemic has so in/f_luenced American public awareness as when Magic Johnson announced he was HIV-positive in 1991. The nation took unprecedented notice, /f_looding the CDC's National AIDS Hotline with calls. In the 24-hour period following Johnson's announcement, 119,434 people called the hotline. Approximately 30,000 calls per day were made over the following two months.15 In 1992, AIDS became the leading cause of death among men ages 25 to 44, and the fourth leading cause of death among women in the same age group.16 Heading into the mid 1990s, Americans were becoming more knowledgeable about HIV/AIDS. According to a 1991 National Health Interview Study, 95 percent of respondents accurately identified sexual intercourse as a mode of transmission and 94 percent understood that pregnant women could pass the virus along to their babies.17 The same study documented that the media was an important resource, with 72 percent of Americans reporting getting information about AIDS from television in the last month. The major campaigns during this period began to hone their messages. In 1990, America Responds to AIDS reached out to \"adult in/f_luencers,\" in particular parents, encouraging them to talk with their children about AIDS. The next year, the campaign focused on testing and treatment. The campaign's first ad about condom use did not air until 1993, along with messaging around abstinence and monogamy. In the 1990s, the campaign focused on audiences disproportionately aected by HIV/AIDS, including African Americans and Latinos, employing similar strategies as it had with the general population, using \"real people\" delivering messages about the increased risk among communities of color. Data from the CDC indicated that AIDS case rates were six times higher for African Americans and three times higher for Latinos, than for whites.18 The campaign targeting African Americans included messages about stigma and prevention. Sex and injection drug use were discussed and viewers were encouraged to learn more. One television PSA developed for Latinos called \"Peter\" used the voice of a young AIDS activist named Peter (Pedro) Zamora, warning young adults that they are vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. Zamora had appeared on MTV's popular television show The Real World the previous year, becoming one of the most recognizable faces of AIDS. His death on November 11, 1994 \u2014 the day after the final episode of The Real World: San Francisco aired \u2014 was for a generation of young people as defining a moment as Rock Hudson's death had been nearly a decade earlier. While it had been clear since the earliest days of the epidemic that needle-sharing was a major risk factor for HIV transmis - sion, more recent research focused on the way drugs and alcohol contributed to the spread of the virus by lowering inhibitions and increasing the likelihood of risky sexual behaviors. In 1990, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), a division of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), teamed with the Ad Council to create the Drug Abuse and AIDS Prevention campaign. The campaign's tagline slogan didn't tread lightly, proclaiming, \"AIDS, another way that drugs can kill you.\" The spots were narrated by Spike Lee and directed by Martin Scorsese to resemble \"slasher\" films and focus on the negative conse - quences of drug use, especially crack cocaine. The series of four television PSAs were also released in movie theaters as a trailer. According to the Ad Council and HHS, the advertising for this campaign garnered $64 million worth of donated media.

A young woman's ankles seem to be surrounded by blood. The narrator, Spike Lee, says, \"Tonight Delores had a few drinks, did some crack and ended up another tragic story. Only she doesn't know it yet. Drugs make you forget.\" A young man pulls himself on top of her and they begin kissing. The narration continues, \"And if you forget how risky sex can be, you could catch the AIDS virus, and not know for months, even years.\" The camera reveals that the ominous red was just lighting falling over the beach. The ad concludes with the statement, \"AIDS, another way that drugs can kill you.\" \"Horror Film\" Clips from the movies \"Halloween\" and \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" are pieced together showing evil men brandishing knives stalking unsuspecting women. \"If this doesn't scare you, just wait,\" says the narrator. The camera closes in on a doorknob lit by red light, then rushes in on a terrified young African American woman. She gasps in fear as she looks at the door. A nurse steps through the door; blue lighting from below makes her look threatening. The door creaks and we hear her footsteps echoing. The music stops and the lighting returns to ordinary indoor lighting. The nurse smiles and says, \"The doctor will see you now.\" The camera reveals that the young woman is really in a clinic waiting room. She makes the long walk into the doctor's office. Spike Lee tells us, \"One night a year ago, Vanessa got high with some guy. She forgot everything that she learned about preventing AIDS. Now her life is the horror show. AIDS, another way that drugs can kill you.\" Two years later, the campaign issued another series of PSAs with the slogan, \"Get High. Get Stupid. Get AIDS.\" One ad fea - tured cartoon characters \"Jeanine and Barry\" experiencing The PSAs included a toll-free number, 1-800-662-HELP , which provides more information on drug and alcohol abuse prevention. The PSAs were distributed nation - wide, including on network, cable and local television stations, as well as in newspapers, magazines, shopping malls, movie theaters, on radio and college campuses. The campaign ran until 1997.19 More recently, NIDA has again returned to HIV/AIDS messaging with a campaign launched in 2005 aimed at reaching younger people again about the risks associated with sub - stance use. Another issue that began to emerge in the 1990s was the epidemic's growing impact outside of urban communities. Where there were prevention programs and health care services in rural communities, they were often lacking, and cultural barriers inhibited open discussion. Country Music AIDS Awareness was one of the first eorts that specifically targeted the American heartland, making use of a huge cast of country music stars to deliver messages about HIV/AIDS. Featuring country music art - ists Mary Chapin Carpenter and Mark Chesnutt, the 1993-1994 campaign was designed by advertising executives in Nashville, led by Bill Johnson, design director of Sony Music, and distributed by the Ad Council. MCA Records paid to distribute the radio spots to 3,000 country music stations. Dozens of artists appeared in print, radio, and television ads delivering messages about stigma, prevention, condom use, communicating with teen-aged children, and testing. The campaign's tagline was \"Break the and promoted the \"For more information: 1-800-342-AIDS, CDC National AIDS Hotline.\" Select Country Music AIDS Awareness Television Advertisements A montage of various country music stars standing in a studio, explaining that you're just not sleeping with your part - ner, you are sleeping with \"your partner's past.\" The ad says that it is estimated that \"one out of 250 Americans has HIV.\" It concludes with the statement, \"Commitment, faithfulness, love and prevention.

The final statement reads, \"Break the Silence. For more information: 1-800-342-AIDS, the CDC's National AIDS Hotline.\" Many of the artists who appeared in the campaign performed as part of Red Hot + Country , a benefit concert and album rais - ing funds for HIV/AIDS in the U.S. The project was coordinated by The Red Hot Organization, which began producing records, television programs and media events with the music industry in 1989. In 1992 LIFEbeat was created as the music industry's charitable organization dedicated to reaching America's youth with the message of HIV/AIDS prevention. Working with artists and the industry, LIFEbeat produces PSA campaigns, fundraising events, and education outreach projects in 42 states across the country. In addition to the music industry, cable television joined ranks in the fight against HIV/AIDS in a coordinated way in 1992 when Jerey Bernstein of Request Television, Brad Wojcoski of HBO, and June Winters founded Cable Positive. In 1994, Cable Positive launched its first volunteer chapter in Denver and as of 2006 maintained chapters in New York, Southern California, Philadelphia, and Atlanta. In addition to television PSA campaigns that is has distributed since its founding, the organization encourages local employee involvement and coordination with AIDS service organizations. The cosmetics industry was close behind. Established in 1994 by M\u00b7A\u00b7C Cosmetics, the M\u00b7A\u00b7C AIDS Fund raised money for organizations serving people aected by HIV/AIDS through celebrity-based PSA campaigns that raised awareness and promoted the VIVA GLAM lipstick. An ongoing eort, the Fund had raised over $64 million as of 2006. By 1994, AIDS had become the leading cause of death among all people aged 25 to 44 in the U.S. A landmark study that same year showed that a course of the drug AZT could help prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV, prompting the Pediatric AIDS Foundation to team up with the Ad Council to educate the public about the importance of prenatal HIV screening for pregnant women and treatment in a 1995 television campaign. \"Chance\" The camera drifts across a white picket fence as autumn leaves blow past; passing a house, it moves under a children's swing. The narrator says that thousands of women will lose children to AIDS because they didn't get tested. But now there is hope because there are drugs that can help prevent mother-to-child transmission. The film turns from black- and-white to color as we see a mother walking her baby out onto the porch. The baby laughs audibly. The narrator says that the baby will have \"a chance.\" \"If you're pregnant, please get an HIV test. Call the National AIDS Hotline for confidential testing information.\" \"Heartbeat\" White letters appear across a black background: \"There is now treatment that can help to stop the spread of AIDS. Un - fortunately, those who need it have a hard time asking for it.\" An image of a sonogram comes into focus and the sound of a heart beat comes up. \"If you're pregnant, please get an HIV test.

In 1995 the National Association of People with AIDS created the first National HIV Testing Day (June 27th), an annual campaign produced with the CDC to encourage voluntary HIV counseling and testing. Successive years of the eort over the last decade have included community outreach, local social marketing targeting women, adoles - cents and gay, bisexual, and transgendered men, as well as cable television PSA placement. The same year, the FDA approved the first round of protease inhibitors, a critical component of the emerging and eective new standard of care \u2014 highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). WWW.HIVTEST.ORG K A I S E R F A M I L Y F O U N D A T I O N / 1 7 ER / GLORIA REUBENBy the mid-1990s, health care providers were astonished by the results being yielded by a new combination HIV treatment regimen \u2014 commonly called a \"cocktail\" therapy. Known as \"highly active antiretroviral therapy\" (HAART), the drugs contrib - uted to a plummeting AIDS death rate in the U.S. in the late 1990s and there was renewed hope for those living with HIV/AIDS. Many even hoped HARRT might lead to an end of the epidemic; unfortunately, reality would be much more complicated. In 1996, the immensely popular television medical drama, ER (NBC) ended its second season with physician assistant Jeanie Boulet (played by Gloria Reuben) getting tested for HIV. When the third season began that fall, some 40 million viewers watched as Jeanie learned she had contracted HIV from her ex-husband. Over the course of the next three seasons, Jeanie became one of television's longest-running characters living with HIV/AIDS, depicting the real-life issues facing many people who are positive. By the time Jeanie Boulet exited the show, her character had married and adopted an HIV-positive baby. A 2000 survey of regular ER viewers indicated that viewers were more interested in Jeanie's HIV status (48%) than in any other storyline, including a developing romance between characters played by George Clooney and Julianne Margulies.21 For many Americans in the late 1990s, it seemed as if the struggle was over. In some ways, it was. Many of the gains that had been fought for during the painful first 15 years of the epidemic had been won: increased funding for HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment; greater public support; less stigma for those infected; better legal protections against discrimination; and, fast- tracked HIV therapies. Perhaps in view of this progress, many Americans began to see AIDS as \"under control.\" A 1995 Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that more than seven in 10 agreed there had been \"some\" or \"a lot\" of progress made in pre - venting the spread of HIV/AIDS in the U.S.22 So did many of the groups responsible for creating public information campaigns. By late 1996, America Responds to AIDS ended its long-running campaign. Some in the public health community debated the need for a national media strategy on HIV/AIDS at all.23 All funding was redirected into grants for local organizations serving the communities most at-risk. It was hoped that spending at a local level in targeted areas would be more eective than a national campaign. As pharmaceutical companies marketed HAART drugs directly to consumers, a new face of HIV/AIDS emerged: robust, athletic models depicting people living with HIV/AIDS. Some AIDS activists reacted to these campaigns with indignation\u2014saying they painted an unrealistic portrait of life on HIV therapies, which, especially in their earlier days, were often extremely cumber - some to take and frequently had difficult side eects. They pointed out that the ads contributed to increasingly widespread beliefs that HIV was not a serious disease and not worth avoiding through safer sex practices. The FDA eventually rebuked some pharmaceutical companies for their tactics and ordered them to tone down their messages and show a more realistic portrayal of life on the drugs.24 ((%\u000f\u00bf\u000f! \u000f\u000f \u000f \u000f 700AC\u000f1aX]Vb\u000f7^_T \u000f\u000f1dc\u000fXb\u000f083B\u000f>eTa.1 8 / EV O L U T I O N O F A N EP I D E M I C :25YE A R S O F H I V/A I D S ME D I A CA M P A I G N S I N T HE U.S.Working with Kenneth Cole, amfAR continued though the 1990s to issue PSAs with thought-provoking slogans to promote awareness and raise funds. The print and outdoor advertising were tagged with amfAR's hotline: \"1-800-38-amfAR\" and in - tended to build a sense of hope around research and a possible cure. Think negative. Act positive. Latest AIDS statistics: 40,000,000 infected. 00,000,000 cured. If your dad had AIDS, he would need more from you than a neck tie in June. If you had AIDS you'd want someone to be researching a cure. amfAR is and we need your help. In 1997, the Kaiser Family Foundation forged its first public education partnership with a television network with MTV to launch the then-called BE SAFE campaign. This partnership approach marked a departure from traditional public service advertis - ing campaigns, combining targeted television PSAs with longer-form special programs under a common brand. The on-air campaign promoted a toll-free hotline that viewers could call to request a free informational guide and be connected with counselors at the CDC to find local services. MTV was a logical partner for the Foundation, both because of the channel's long history of educating and empowering young people about HIV/AIDS, as well as its unique role in youth popular culture. Soon after MTV went on the air in 1981, the channel reported on the epidemic and its eect on both celebrities and young people, and aired PSAs about how to protect against HIV/AIDS. In 1989, MTV produced Decade \u2014 a two-hour documentary about music, news, and culture in the 1980s \u2014 that included segments about sexual health and HIV/AIDS, and earned the network its first Peabody Award. In 1992, before a nationally televised audience, a 24-year old man told future President Bill Clinton that he had contracted HIV through unprotected sex in high school. In this forum, part of MTV's Choose or Lose voter education and empowerment campaign, he implored Clinton to make condoms available in junior high and high school. Throughout the 1990s, MTV contin - ued to bring information about HIV/AIDS to its viewers through PSAs, news coverage, and music tributes centered on people suering from the disease, including specials about Queen lead singer Freddie Mercury, basketball star Magic Johnson, and rapper Eazy-E. For many MTV viewers, watching Pedro Zamora on The Real World: San Francisco in 1994 provided an up-close look at what life is like for someone living with HIV/AIDS. Four years later, as part of the partnership with Kaiser, MTV produced True Life: It Could Be You , which followed two young HIV-positive women, Rebecca Guberman and Jennifer Jako, as they traveled the country talking to other young people living with HIV/AIDS. Complementing the longer-form programming were targeted television PSAs directed at MTV's youthful audience. \"Profiles A\" A narrator introduces viewers to several \"ordinary\" young people, who are not all they appear to be. \"This is James. He's into video games, Spanish food and being the rebound king on his high school basketball team.\" On the screen appear the words: \"HIV positive since 1995.\" Next comes \" ... Trisha, part-time dance instructor, studying for the bar exam. She just ended a two-year monogamous relationship.\" From text on the screen the viewer learns what she \"doesn't know\" that \" ...her boyfriend had a one-night stand, and infected her with Chlamydia.\" \"Here's Justin. Messenger by day, bouncer by night. Loves giving massages.

The narrator says \"You never know what you'll find just beneath the surface. Wrap it up every time. For more information on safer sex, call toll-free 1-888-BE-SAFE-1.\" The ongoing partnership \u2014 now in its 10th year in 2006 \u2014 has won several Emmy Awards and a Peabody. The campaign con - tinues to use a variety of platforms to get out information about HIV/AIDS and related issues, including PSAs, news program - ming, documentaries, interactive online content, a free sexual health guide, new media initiatives, and a dedicated toll-free hotline. The campaign remains one of MTV's core pro-social activities, having been re-branded as Fight For Your Rights: Protect Yourself in 2002; then think: Sexual Health under think MTV in 2005 \u2014 the network-wide initiative to educate and empower young people on the most important issues they face. From its launch in September of 1997 through December of 2005, the PSAs ran nearly 10,000 times on MTV, including during peak audience periods such as the annual Video Music Awards and MTV Movie Awards. More than one million young people called the campaign's dedicated hotline and even more visited the website to learn more. Half a million copies of the campaign's It's Your (Sex) Life informational guide have been distributed. In the spring of 2003, the Kaiser Family Foundation conducted a survey of 1,100 16-24 year-olds to assess the reach and impact of its campaign with MTV. Forty-two percent of those surveyed had seen at least one of the PSAs. Among these \"known view - ers,\" 63 percent reported personally learning something new about HIV/AIDS and related issues. Among those who had been sexually active, more than two out of three said it made them more likely to take their sexual relationships more seriously (73%); use condoms (73%); talk to their partner about safer sex (69%); and get tested for HIV or other STDs (65%).25 In 1998, MTV International \u2014 today a network of more than 40 local MTV channels worldwide \u2014 launched Staying Alive , a coordinated public education campaign reaching young people around the globe with information about HIV/AIDS. MTV International's properties around the world commit a minimum of one minute per day per channel for HIV/AIDS PSAs, with MTV Base Africa and MTV Europe committing six minutes per day each. The ongoing campaign includes as partners: Family Health International, the Kaiser Family Foundation, USAID, UNAIDS, UNFPA, The World Bank, DFID, SIDA, and other organizations. The campaign produces a wide range of targeted PSAs, programs, documentaries, and concerts for global audiences, some of which is also distributed in the U.S. All content is provided rights-free and free of charge to other broadcasters, and MTV International actively promotes distribution beyond its properties. That same year, Kaiser launched a partnership with Black Entertainment Television (BET), focused on reaching African Americans about HIV/AIDS. The Rap It Up campaign also includes targeted PSAs, long-form special programming, free print and Web resources as well as an extensive community initiative. The campaign's early messages drew attention to the growing impact of HIV/AIDS on the African American community: \"Chandler\" A little girl is playing in the grass. She tells us that her name is Chandler and that she is a full-/f_l edged black woman in training. She is full of dreams for her future and looks up to positive role models that came before her, like Rosa Parks, Wilma Rudolph and Sarah Vaughn. But, she tells us that sisters under the age of 25 are one of the fastest growing populations infected with HIV and asks that they protect themselves and not \"kill the dream before it starts,\" as there is so much more. \"Get the facts about safer sex. Call 1-888-BE-SAFE-1.\" More recent PSAs and shows have focused on the importance of early diagnosis and treatment, as well as attitudes about sexuality and other related topics.

More than one million viewers have called the campaign's dedicated hotline and some 300,000 free informational guides have been distributed. In 2004 Kaiser conducted its first national assessment of coordinated eorts across media campaigns to reach African Americans in the U.S., including Rap It Up as well as eorts undertaken with BET's parent company, Viacom. Eight in 10 African Americans aged 18 to 24 (84%) reported having seen some element of the campaign on BET, either a full-length show or one of the PSAs. Higher numbers knew the Rap It Up brand.26 A third partnership with a major media company followed in 2001, when the Kaiser Family Foundation teamed up with Univi - sion, the leading Spanish- language television network, to launch \u00a1Ent\u00e9rate! around World AIDS Day. The campaign provides young Latinos (under 25) with information and resources on HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, and related issues. In 2002, the network adopted \u00a1Ent\u00e9rate! as the brand for its primary pro-social eort, expanding in scope to include other public health issues, while continuing to address HIV/AIDS. Kaiser remains a lead partner in the eort, focusing on co-producing tar - geted PSAs for its television and radio properties and developing special public aairs programs, as well as providing free print and Web-based resources in Spanish and English available at univision.com and through the campaign's toll-free telephone number (1-866-TU SALUD). From 1996 through 2000, the National Association of People with AIDS (NAPWA) and the CDC conducted their annual National HIV Testing Day outreach. In 2000, a Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report indicated that the campaign contributed to in - creased HIV testing from 1994-1998 and supported the idea of a national public health campaign designed to increase people's knowledge of their HIV status.27 Cable Positive, the cable and communications industry's AIDS action organization, worked in collaboration with NAPWA and National HIV Testing Day, as a national sponsor of the campaign, releasing a series of television PSAs annually, including bilingual versions in Spanish and English. BET / NAKED TRUTH UNIVISION PSA / BUT UNIVISION PSA / BUTK A I S E R F A M I L Y F O U N D A T I O N / 2 1During the latter half of the 1990s, perhaps in part due to the perception that HIV/AIDS in the U.S. was under control, there was a growing focus on the global epidemic, with HIV/AIDS increasingly seen as a problem occurring elsewhere. Dramatic examples of human suering in developing countries were uncovered and media outlets turned their attention to the global pandemic. As the epidemic moved past the two-decade mark, its image as a global disaster became increasingly clear. The vast majority of people worldwide with HIV/AIDS live in developing countries, where access to prevention, care, and medications is limited. More than 25 million have died of AIDS worldwide, a growing figure that threatens to eclipse the cumulative tens of millions who died in both the 14th century \"Black Death\" and the 1918-19 influenza pandemic. In the U.S. a new message was beginning to gain ground in media campaigns \u2014 the impact of HIV/AIDS around the world. Several media eorts addressing the global epidemic emerged. In 2001, the U.N. Foundation and Ad Council created an aware - ness and fundraising campaign called Apathy is Lethal , including a series of television PSAs and outdoor advertising. The strategy was clear: to confront the growing complacency many Americans seemed to be feeling about AIDS, and to link the experience of children in the U.S. with that of millions of AIDS orphans in areas of the world devastated by the disease. The first round of PSAs depicted children struggling to live in an American-style city absent of adults. The call to action was: \"AIDS is preventable. Apathy is lethal.\" In December of 2002 the Ad Council worked with Cable Positive to undertake an advertising \"roadblock\" on World AIDS Day. Cable outlets simultaneously aired \"Kids,\" a 30-second television PSA from the campaign, featuring the voice of Michael Douglas. Cable Positive estimated that between 35 and 50 million cable television households saw the AIDS message during the roadblock on that Sunday night. A successive round of the campaign launched in March 2004 that linked the number of global AIDS deaths to the number of schoolchildren in major American cities, depicting janitors dismantling empty classrooms. In 2003, the Kaiser Family Foundation teamed up with Viacom to undertake the company's first cross-cutting public education campaign on any issue. Individual properties \u2014 notably MTV and BET through partnerships with Kaiser \u2014 had already made considerable commitments toward addressing HIV/AIDS and related issues. KNOW HIV/AIDS marked the first attempt to en - gage all divisions within Viacom's vast array of assets in a unified campaign on HIV/AIDS. The partnership continued after the separation of the company into two publicly traded entities: CBS Corporation and \"new\" Viacom Inc. in 2006. Working with some of the top creative talent and ad agencies in the U.S., Kaiser and Viacom developed television, radio and outdoor PSAs, reaching out to the general population with information about the epidemic both at home and abroad, as well as targeting those at higher risk, particularly younger people, African Americans, and men who have sex with men, with more direct prevention and testing messages.

HIV is preventable. www.knowHIVAIDS.org A series of messages intended to promote HIV testing were developed by the KNOW partners and the agency Crispin Porter Bogusky in 2004 under the theme Knowing is Beautiful . A series followed in 2005 as The Know is Spreading , further reinforcing HIV testing as act of empowerment among young people. Radio PSA: \"Liberation\" by Common It's liberation & motivation From generation to generation... The Know Is Spreading... You can feel it like soul music The emotions of the whole movement...

The Kaiser Family Foundation has conducted annual briefings for the writers, pro - ducers and executives of the networks' entertainment programming since 2002. These briefings \u2014 which share the real-life stories of people living with or otherwise aected by HIV/AIDS \u2014 have resulted in dozens of HIV-themed storylines on top- rated shows, such as America's Next Top Model (UPN), Cold Case (CBS), The District (CBS), Eve (UPN), Girlfriends (UPN), Half & Half (UPN), Judging Amy (CBS), One on One (UPN), Without A Trace (CBS), and many others.

The television PSAs developed by VH1 creative sta focused on improving the general public's understanding of the disease, building a sense of hope for change, and raising money for the Fund. The tagline read: Stop AIDS Before it Stops the World . \"WMD\" The ad is entirely animation. First, small coffins line up in rows across the screen, 22 in all. A legend in the corner says that one coffin equals one million. Then a hand with a dispenser of red tape comes and puts two strips of tape across a close-up of one of the coffins. Within the tape is the text, \"22 million dead.\" A /f_l urry of Band-Aids cover the red tape, and reads \"40,000,000 infected.\" A bulls-eye appears, and text runs across the middle: \"We have found the weapon of MASS DESTRUCTION.\" Bullet holes riddle the target, revealing a globe with \"Global AIDS\" emblazoned across. Several traffic signs come into the frame, each one printed with part of the phrase, \"We can stop this epidemic.\" A map of the world appears, with \"The Global Fund\" printed above. Two fists thrust into frame; across the knuckles is: \"To: Join the fight. Go to: VH1.com/AIDS. The Global Fund & VH1: Stopping AIDS Before it Stops the World. VH1.com/AIDS.\" VH1 also produced a documentary in collaboration with the Global Fund featuring musician India.Arie's and actor Ashley Judd's visits to HIV/AIDS programs in Kenya and Madagascar. As of 2006, VH1 estimates the campaign has reached more than 88 million households in the U.S. and 1.5 million unique visitors at VH1.com/AIDS. Celebrities became an important part of this global messaging. The YouthAIDS/ALDO Fights AIDS outdoor and print campaign tapped into the celebrity community to solicit funds for its global education, health care, and communication eorts. In 2005, the campaign raised one million dollars, with images of well-known actors and musicians, including Ashley Judd, Salma Hayek, LL Cool J, and Christina Aguilera.28 A second wave of the campaign rolled out in 2006 featuring more stars with appeal to younger people, including the likes of Avril Lavigne, Ludicris, and the members of the band Good Charlotte. One of the highest-visibility contemporary campaigns about global AIDS is ONE , developed by U2 lead singer and global AIDS activist Bono and his organization, DATA, and featuring a number of high-profile celebrities, including George Clooney and Brad Pitt. Numerous other organizations \u2014 including Bread for the World, CARE, International Medical Corps, International Rescue Committee, Mercy Corps, Oxfam America, Plan USA, Save the Children US, World Concern, World Vision, the National Basketball Association, Rock the Vote, the Millennium Campaign, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation \u2014 are partners. The ONE campaign is about activism and operates internationally, nationally, and locally through an extensive Web-based initiative.

ONE also calls for debt cancellation, trade reform and anti-corruption measures in a comprehensive package to help Africa and the poorest nations beat AIDS and extreme poverty.\" Since its launch, more than two million people have signed ONE's declaration.29 On World AIDS Day 2005, Kenneth Cole launched an outdoor, print, and radio campaign called We All Have AIDS . The campaign focuses on reducing stigma associated with the disease by building a sense of solidarity among those who are personally aected and those who are not, primarily in the U.S. Widely distributed print and outdoor ads profile some of the most recog - nized AIDS activists, scientists and celebrities in a single group photograph under the headline: We All Have AIDS . The KNOW HIV/AIDS campaign served as an information resource for the eort. Another organization using celebrity to get out its message is Cable Positive, which created the Weapons of Mass Instruction campaign. Cast with talent including Rosario Dawson, Jerey Wright, and Matthew Broderick, the television PSAs encourage Americans to become involved in addressing HIV/AIDS by buying products that support AIDS charities, cultivating empathy for those with AIDS, or talking about the disease with other people. In the midst of these messages about the global epidemic, targeted campaigns around HIV testing, prevention, and the U.S. epidemic continue to carve out airtime. One such eort is HIV Stops with Me . Created by a San Francisco marketing firm called Better World Advertising in 2001, this campaign features real-life stories of people living with HIV and keeping others safe from infection. The outdoor and print campaign has run in several cities, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, and Boston. Recent government-sponsored campaigns have also developed targeted messaging strategies. In 2001 the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) worked with Ogilvy to launch Real People. Real Progress , an HIV vaccine communica - tions campaign. The eort focused on communities hardest hit by the U.S. epidemic, including African Americans, Latinos, men who have sex with men, and women. The goals were to raise awareness about ongoing HIV vaccine research, and encour - age the target populations to support clinical trial volunteers or volunteer themselves, once a large-scale HIV vaccine trial is ready. The ongoing campaign includes print and radio advertising which profile an individual \"face\" or \"voice\" from each of the campaign's target audiences. Paid media consisted of print advertisements in 45 print publications, radio spots on 161 stations, and online banner advertisements on five websites. In 2002, the CDC launched KNOW NOW, a multi-city pilot campaign aimed at increasing HIV testing in populations at highest risk for HIV. The messages were tailored to the needs of individual risk groups. It began with five cities: Jackson, Mississippi; New Orleans, Louisiana; Houston, Texas; Miami, Florida; and Detroit, Michigan. The campaign employed unique planning strat - egies by blending demographic data grouped by ZIP codes as well as data from consumer marketing databases that include information on buying habits, media use, and economic status, in order to obtain greater accuracy in targeting specific popula - tions. Evaluation was conducted in two of the five cities and showed promise. Based on the lessons learned from all five cities of KNOW NOW , the CDC developed an even more tailored campaign for African American women. This campaign, based on the social marketing model, is anticipated to launch in 2006, with messages and strategies intended for this specific audience segment.

Each spot takes place in a clean white room filled only with a bed. Elton John, Mary J. Blige and Shirley Manson oer their opinions on why they use condoms. The tagline was: \"AIDS ain't over, wear a condom.\" More recently, the M\u00b7A\u00b7C AIDS Fund collaborated on a targeted campaign for the New York City market in 2005, called 'I KNOW' focusing on HIV testing. Inspired by \"guerrilla market - ing\" tactics, the eort was a viral strategy using coins that looked identical to pennies with the 'I KNOW' message distributed in New York, dollar bills stamped with the message, distributing 100,000 free condoms, and small events on the streets of the city to promote the brand and encourage people to talk about the issue. Based in part on the success of World AIDS Day and National HIV Testing Day, several other special days were established to focus attention on the impact of HIV/AIDS in the U.S. on particular communities. National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day (February 7th) debuted in 2001, led by Concerned Black Men, Inc. of Philadelphia; Health Watch Information and Promotion Services; Jackson State University - Mississippi Urban Research Center; National Black Alcoholism & Addictions Council; and the National Black Leadership Commission on AIDS. In 2003, the Latino Commission on AIDS launched National Latino AIDS Awareness Day (October 15th), followed by the first National Asian and Pacific Islander HIV/AIDS Awareness Day (May 19th) recognized by HHS in 2005. In 2006, the HHS Office on Women's Health launched National Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day (March 10th). In 2004, President George W. Bush, by Presidential Proclamation, formally made June 27th National HIV Testing day.30 He used the opportunity to affirm the importance of testing and treatment, while simultaneously highlighting his international HIV/AIDS policies: \"To reach out to HIV/AIDS suerers in need, I recently announced $20 million in immediate new funding to deliver lifesaving drugs to Americans who are awaiting them.\" In his 2006 Federal Budget, President Bush requested more money for HIV testing in the U.S., the first proposed increase at the CDC in years. The Campaign to End AIDS , a grass roots AIDS activist coalition, was founded in 2005, and attempts to bring together the various threads of HIV/AIDS issues in the U.S. and globally under the umbrella of a single campaign. Their first PSA featured a series of New Yorkers aected by HIV/AIDS asking, \"People think AIDS is over. Then why isn't it over for me?\" The campaign's agenda includes increased government funding for HIV care, reauthorization of the Ryan White CARE Act, U.S. government support for the Global Fund, improved prevention services in the U.S. and abroad, and increased funding for HIV/AIDS-related research. It also seeks to reduce stigma and discrimination associated with HIV/AIDS globally.www.campaigntoendaids.org www.campaigntoendaids.org WWW. HIVSTOPSWITHME .ORG / LEE IN NYC WWW. HIVSTOPSWITHME .

One example is the meeting convened in January 2004 by the Kaiser Family Foundation and UNAIDS at the United Nation's headquarters, bringing together some of the world's top media executives to discuss media's role in addressing HIV/AIDS. Secretary General Kofi Annan, who presided over the meeting, called it one of the \"most important\" of the year. A key outcome was the establishment of the Global Media AIDS Initiative , which called on the world's leading media companies to contribute their resources and expertise to respond to the growing HIV/AIDS pandemic. Subsequent national and regional meetings of media executives were organized around the world, including in Bridgetown (Caribbean Broadcast Media Leaders Summit: May 2006), Johannesburg (African Broadcast Media Leaders Summit on HIV/AIDS: October 2005); San Francisco (Public Broadcasters Global Media Leaders Summit on HIV/AIDS: May 2005); Delhi (Indian Media Leaders Summit on HIV/AIDS: January 2005); and Moscow (Eurasian Media Leaders Summit on HIV/AIDS: October 2004). The gatherings have led to the establishment of new partnerships of major media companies in India, Russia and across the African continent that have committed significant resources and are working together to undertake unprec - edented coordinated public education partnerships to address HIV/AIDS in their regions. Millions of dollars of media time and space have been leveraged for HIV/AIDS messaging. In 2006, the AIDS pandemic marks a quarter century, and a generation of young people has grown up never knowing a time without AIDS. The face of AIDS in America is also changing. While men who have sex with men remain a population at high risk, women and minorities represent a growing share of AIDS cases. Campaigns are challenged to find new strategies that will communicate information about risk effectively to populations who may not consider themselves at risk, and fight against the complacency of those who have lived with it as a reality for many years. It is interesting to note that some opinions about HIV/AIDS remain relatively unchanged over the last 15 years. For example, according to national surveys, approximately the same percent of people in the U.S. in 2006 as in 1990 do not know that HIV is not spread through kissing (nearly four in 10) or by sharing a glass (about a quarter). About one in six continue to be under the misimpression that HIV may be transmitted through toilet seats.31 Testing has emerged as a central theme, as the CDC moves to make HIV screening a standard part of medical care. Among the population as a whole, the CDC estimates that approximately one in four of those living with HIV/AIDS in the U.S. do not know they are infected. Campaigns about domestic issues increasingly compete with efforts to raise awareness about AIDS internationally, which is no less complicated than the U.S. crisis. Americans are awash in information about a range of HIV- related issues, from generic drugs and treatment in Sub-Saharan Africa, debt-relief, and microbicides, to vaccine research, \"AIDS orphans,\" and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Nonetheless, more than half say that spending for prevention and education should be the top priority for the U.S. government's financial help to fight AIDS in developing countries, and six in 10 believe that spending more money on HIV prevention in developing countries will lead to meaningful progress in slowing the epidemic.32 In the next quarter century, public education campaigns have the opportunity to capitalize on this sense of hope for change in the global epidemic, and to help Americans better understand the complex issues related to HIV/ADS at home. 2 6 / ev o l u t i o n o f a n ep i d e m i c : 2\u0018 ye a r s o f H i v/a i d s me d i a ca m p a i g n s i n t He u.s. k a i s e r f a m i l y f o u n d a t i o n / 2 \u0018aids prevention Sponsors: Ad Council, the American Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR) and the National AIDS Network Years of campaign: 1988-1989 Purpose: HIV/AIDS prevention Target Audiences: Sexually active adults Website: NA The AIDS Prevention campaign was the first national campaign to promote condom use. Television and print advertising were produced in both English and Spanish, with the call to action: \"Help stop AIDS. Use a condom.\" The advertising offered statistics on HIV/AIDS prevalence and warned about how rapidly the virus was spreading. It explained how the approximate ten-year latency period meant that infected people may not appear sick and can unknowingly pass on the virus. The routes of transmission were outlined: needle-sharing and sex. The campaign explicitly noted that that the virus can be transmitted from men to men, women to men, or men to women. america responds to aids Sponsor: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Years of campaign: 1987-1996 Purpose: Raise HIV/AIDS awareness and promote prevention Target Audiences: General population, racial/ethnic minorities, sexually active young adults, and injection drug users Website: NA America Responds to AIDS was launched in 1987 to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS among all Americans. It was created in response to a 1985 Congres - sional mandate that required the CDC to educate the public about HIV/AIDS. The campaign was developed by Ogilvy and rolled out in the following phases from 1987 through 1996: The National AIDS Mailing to all U.S. households in 1988 provided facts about HIV/AIDS transmission and prevention. In 1989 a campaign was targeted to minorities, sexually active young adults, and injection drug users \u2014 all at greatest risk of HIV infection. Adult influencers, especially parents talking to their children about AIDS, were the focus of the 1990 phase of the campaign. Voluntary testing and treatment for HIV infection was addressed in 1992. HIV risk-reduction behaviors, including abstinence and condom use, were highlighted in 1994. Targeted PSAs to audiences disproportionately affected \u2014 African Americans and Latinos \u2014 were conducted in 1995 and 1996. Print and broadcast public service announcements (PSAs) profiling \"real people\" affected by HIV/AIDS were produced and marketed to mass media, generating more than $320 million of public service airtime in the first 5 years. The campaign promoted the newly created CDC AIDS Hotline, where callers could talk with counselors and receive free information in the mail. The federal government spent $7.36 million developing the first five phases, including $3.46 million for production, $2.06 million for marketing and distribution, and $1.84 million for development. Between the campaign's launch in October 1987 and January 1992 the PSAs aired more than 59,000 times, with a commercial airtime value of $67.8 million. The CDC estimates that, on average, American adults between 18 and 54 years old saw campaign PSAs at least 56 times over that 33 month period.
