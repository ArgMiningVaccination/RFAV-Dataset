Thequestion of what constitutes evidence is considered from various perspectives: biomedical, CAM,consumers and practitioners. The authors conclude th at all these perspectives are required in order to fully understand the appeal of CAM in Canadian society's search for appropriate healthcare.Most important, the complexity of methods for assessing the evidence about CAM is addressed. Aninclusive approach is urged that goes well beyond randomized clinical trials. Policy recommenda-tions are made in three areas: research, regulation and funding. Introduction Popular interest in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is part of afundamental change in society's orienta-tion to health and healing (Goldstein1999; Sharma 1992). Demand for CAMservices and products have grown inCanada, as in other Western societies(Ramsay et al. 1999; Unschuld 1980;Eisenberg et 200l; Beaudet 2001).Recent Canadian surveys found thatapproximately half of the respondentsreported using CAM in the past 12 months (Ramsay et al. 1999; Angus ReidGroup 2000). There has been a grassrootsrevolution in the expectations and choices of consumers of healthcare. In this paper,we turn a sociological eye on CAM andview it as a social movement that isassuming a significant place in the health-care system. We ask questions such as: How do people decide to use CAMproducts and to consult CAM practition-ers? On what kinds of evidence do theybase their decisions? Is the evidenceconvincing? If so, does it convince every-one? What kinds of evidence are requiredbefore governments can develop policiessupporting the use of CAM? The use of CAM therapies is not new. They have been widely used in societiessuch as Asia, Africa and India forhundreds of years. However, on thiscontinent, there is uncertainty concerningwhat such therapies should be called;alternative, complementary, unorthodox,unconventional, non-scientific andmarginal are some of the many descriptorsin the literature. Yet, in North America,we consider these options as somethingthat people have only recently discovered.Defining CAM The term complementary and alternative medicine is often used residually, as anything that is not included in conven-tional medical practice. For example,Vincent and Furnham (1997) define the term as an approach that \"embraces a widerange of therapeutic practices and diag-nostic systems that stands separate from,or in some cases opposed to, conventionalscientifically based medicine.\" Eisenberget al. (1993, 1998) argue that CAMdescribes practices and therapies that arenot typically taught in conventionalmedical schools nor practised by mostlicensed physicians. This assertion,however, is less factual today as thenumber of medical schools offeringcourses and programs on CAM in theUnited States and Canada is on the rise(Bhattacharya 2000; Ruedy et al. 1999). A comprehensive definition arose out of the National Institutes of Health Panelon Definition and Description (1997):\"Complementary and alternative medicine(CAM) is a broad domain of healingresources that encompasses all health systems, modalities and practices and theiraccompanying theories and beliefs, otherthan those intrinsic to the politicallydominant health system of a particularsociety or culture in a given historicalperiod.\" Such a definition treats conven-tional medicine and CAM as equals andavoids negative connotations. It also takesinto account the existence of multiplehealing systems that have various degreesof dominance and influence. Practices thatare considered \"alternative\" by the majorityof people in Western society are thoughtof as mainstream by people in many othercountries (Kelner and Wellman 2000).Complementary and Alternative Medicine: How Do We Know If It Works? 11It is important to recognize that complementary and alternative therapiesinclude a diverse set of healing practices,each with its own philosophy of healingand traditions of use. There are, however,certain core characteristics that arecommon to most of them. Most signifi-cantly, t hey focus not just on biomedical processes, but emphasize the natural abilityof the body to heal itself. They stress healthrather than disease, and their goal is tostrengthen the health-promoting forces ofthe body. The flow of energy is regarded asa crucial source of healing, and pronouncedemphasis is placed on the uniqueness ofeach individual, the subjective experience ofpatients and the important effects of theenvironment. CAM therapies are based onthe integration of body, mind and spiritand take a holistic approach to healing.The patient is regarded as an active partici-pant in his or her own healthcare and isexpected to take personal responsibility formaintaining and promoting good health(Berliner and Salmon 1979; Goldstein1999; Kelner and Wellman 2000). When we turn to the question of which kinds of healthcare are includedunder the umbrella term CAM ,w e quickly become aware that the boundaries withinit, and between CAM and the conven-tional medical system, are far from clear orfixed. For example, some physicianspractise CAM therapies such as acupunc-ture and relaxation techniques along withtheir conventional medical treatments.Another example of confusing boundariesis provided by chiropractic; since it is themost widely used CAM modality and iscovered to a limited degree by publicinsurance in some provinces, some arguethat it is now part of mainstream care.Others refute this view strenuously. Afurther complication is that some CAM practitioners provide more that one kindof CAM healthcare, combining, forexample, traditional Chinese medicinewith acupuncture, or naturopathy withchiropractic. Clearly, fluid boundaries area characteristic of the field. A useful way of classifying the array of CAM therapies has been developedby Tataryn (2001) based on their under-lying assumptions and approaches. He posits four distinct approaches to heal-ing: (1) Body - examples are diet, herbs,manipulation, etc.; (2) Body-Mind -examples are meditation, touch, etc.; and(4) Body-Spirit - examples are prayer,faith healing, etc. There is also confusion concerning which therapies should be consideredcomplementary and which should betermed alternative. Some therapies such asacupuncture are used as complementary toconventional medical practice, but otherssuch as homeopathy and reiki are basedon alternative belief systems and cannotbe easily reconciled with conventionalmedical care. Cassileth (1998) definescomplementary therapies in clinical termsas those that can be used in conjunctionwith conventional medicine or areemployed as adjuncts. Therapies that areused instead of medical care, on the otherhand, are described as alternative. Shecontends that it is the intention behind itsuse that defines an intervention. Saks(1992) sees this distinction in politicalterms. He argues that until CAM thera-pies are recognized and supported bygovernment, they are in a marginal posi-tion in the healthcare system and shouldbe regarded as alternative. Healthcare Papers Vol.3 No.5 12Complementary and Alternative Medicine: How Do We Know If It Works? 13The most recent term to be applied to CAM is integrative medicine .T h i s termi- nology focuses attention and Glik 2000). Whilethe term is not yet widely used, it couldprove to be useful because it emphasizesthe possibility of combining CAM andconventional medicine. As the field contin-ues to develop, trying to achieve a precisedefinition of CAM is like struggling to hita moving target. In spite of the lack ofconsensus about how to define CAM,however, researchers in Canada have beenexploring questions concerning who usesCAM a nd why they choose to do so. The Canadian Context A number of studies of CAM use in specific Canadian populations have beencarried out. One of the earliest was conducted in 1994-95 in Toronto (Kelnerand Wellman 1997a, 1997b). The researchcompared the social and health character-istics of patients of five kinds of practition-ers: family physicians (used as a baselinegroup); chiropractors; acupuncture/tradi-tional Chinese medicine doctors; natur-opaths; and reiki healers. The patients whohad consulted CAM practitioners weremore likely to be female, younger (meanage: 44), to have higher householdincomes and educational levels, to reporttheir ethnic origin as Canadian and toconsider spirituality an important factor intheir lives. They were less likely to be inblue-collar occupations and to be reli-giously affiliated. The range of their healthproblems was greater, and they tended torate their physical and emotional healthstatus higher than did the patients offamily physicians. Most of these CAMpatients had also visited a family physician about their care. While they had somereservations about conventional medicine with respect to how much help they hadreceived for their chronic conditions, they had not lost confidence in its effectiveness,particularly for acute conditions. Other Canadian studies have focused on populations with chronic diseases.Research on people with breast cancer andHIV-infected patients found that those who used CAM therapies and productswere younger and had higher educationand incomes than those who did not(Boon et al. 1999; Ostrow et al. 1997).Among brain tumour patients, youngerage and higher income were also signifi-cantly related to CAM use, although level of education was not (Verhoef et al. 1999).For people suffering from inflammatory bowel disease, only a higher level of educa-tion proved to be significant (Hilsden et al.1998). In all four of these studies, most ofthe patients who were using CAM serviceshad not rejected conventional medicaltreatments but were employing both kindsof care at the same time. Just over half ofthem reported that they had told theirphysicians about their use of CAM. Both values and pragmatic considera- tions played an important role in why thepatients in these Canadian studies choseto use CAM. The most frequently citedreasons included: preventing illness and improving the quality of life, gaining asense of control over a chronic illness,boosting the immune system, dissatisfac-tion with conventional medical care,dealing with the side effects of someconventional treatments, wanting to try alloptions, preferring a more collaborativerelationship with their practitioner and having a more holistic understanding ofhealth and illness. These explanations of why people choose to use CAM corre-spond to the findings of other empiricalresearch in North America, Australia and the United Kingdom (Astin 1998;Goldstein 1999; McGregor and Peay1996; Sharma 1992; In Canada, CAM products are regu- lated by the federal government under theNatural Health Products Directorate (formerly the Office of Natural HealthProducts), established in 1999. The responsibility for regulating CAM practi- tioners is provincial, although the situationdiffers from province to province. MostCAM practitioners are not regulated by the government, which means that anyone,with any level of experience and training,may practise (Boon and Verhoef 2001).While some modalities such as massage therapy, naturopathy and acupuncture areregulated in some provinces, chiropractic is the only one to have achieved self-regulatory status in all Canadian provinces. In addition, chiropractors are the onlyCAM practitioners to be included in and partially funded by provincial health schemes in Ontario, Manitoba,Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia (Boon and Verhoef 2001). Given that many CAM practitioners and products are not yet regulated, howare we to explain their growing useamong the Canadian public? Given thatthe scientific evidence that CAM worksis limited and equivocal, on what kindsof evidence are consumers of CAMservices relying? What Constitutes Evidence? While most consumers of CAM have been content with anecdotal evidence ofsuccessful healing, recent media attention to problems such as the negative effects ofinteractions of CAM products withregular drugs is beginning to make the public somewhat more wary. But the callfor solid evidence of efficacy and safety iscoming primarily from other healthprofessionals and from policy-makers. Forexample, the White House Commissionon CAM policy (Gordon 2002) urges thatCAM t herapies be held to rigorous scientific standards. Policy-makers recog-nize that the scientific evidence for CAMtherapies is sparse, and they are concernedwith what this means for the accountabil-ity of CAM practitioners and the regula-tion of both products and practitioners.Established healthcare providers wantevidence so that they can decide if and when to refer patients to CAM practi-tioners. Governments have a responsibilityto protect their citizens from fraud byquestionable healers, and to establishassurances that products and practicesdelivered by the healthcare system aretherapeutically effective. In a recent book on clinical research on CAM (Lewith et al. 2002), the authors assert that there are two crucial issues indeveloping appropriate evidence. Theseare rigour and relevance. Rigour refers tomanagement of biases that threaten thevalid analysis and interpretation of data.Relevance refers to the use to whichspecific audiences will put information. Itinvolves values placed on different types ofinformation. The authors think researchstrategies should start with questions suchas: For whom is the information meant andfor what purposes? How do the values ofpatients, practitioners, scientists andproviders inspire research? The authorsargue that a balanced approach is necessaryHealthcare Papers Vol.3 No.5 14to build an evidence base that includes both rigour and relevance. They cautionthat without balanced strategies that takeinto account both precision and the valuesof each audience, the interpretation ofindividual research studies is incompleteand thus open to error or misapplication. Accumulating credible evidence about the efficacy and safety of the variousCAM modalities is proving to be a diffi- cult and challenging enterprise. How bestto test their efficacy and safety is currentlythe subject of lively debate (see, for exam-ple, Ernst 2000; Glik 2000; Walach et al.2002; Richardson et al. 2001). The crucialissue is deciding upon the most appropri-ate methods for evaluation. Proponents ofthe randomized clinical trial (RCT) arguethat it is the method of choice for assess-ing an intervention (Ernst 1996). Thismethod involves ensuring that both thepatient and the clinician are unaware ofthe nature of the treatment. A furtherrefinement is that the assessment of safety or efficacy is carried out by an indepen-dent observer who is ignorant of thetreatment allocation. The control condi-tion varies according to the nature of thequestion being addressed; sometimes it issimply a comparison with an untreatedgroup, sometimes it is with a groupreceiving a placebo, and other times it is a comparison between a novel treatmentand a standard one (Vincent andFurnham 1997). But several scholars have suggested that the classic experimentalmethod of the RCT does not do justice tothe more holistic and individualizedapproach of CAM. Hence, they suggestthat new methodologies such as qualita-tive research are needed to reflect theunique characteristics of CAM (Cant andSharma 1996; Glik 2000; Goldstein Richardson 2002; Verhoef et al.2002; Vuckovic 2002). Underlying this controversy are two different perspectives. The biomedicalview holds that science must be objectiveand based upon universalistic quantifiablecriteria, rationality and skepticism.Medical research is based on the premisethat biomedicine is impartial and empiri-cally verifiable and that there is only one objective picture of reality and one validmethod of verifying it. The CAM perspec-tive, however, is based on the belief thatthere are different ways of knowing aboutreality, a variety of valid methods for verifying research and that humanistic andspiritual values influence health (Goldstein1999; Astin 1998; O'Connor 2000). Wewill sketch out these and other differingperspectives as they pertain to the issue ofwhat constitutes appropriate evidence. The Biomedical Perspective The advocates of the biomedical view callfor rigorous scientific testing to establishwhether CAM is effective and safe. Theyargue that the ground rules for evidence-based medicine have already been estab-lished and that CAM providers will haveto accept these rules. They believe that theonly way to convincingly demonstrate thespecific effectiveness of CAM (i.e., effec-tiveness over and above treatment byplacebo) is to rely on evidence fromcontrolled randomized clinical trials(Vickers et al. 1997; Ernst 2000). Using this research strategy, they claim, is theway to establish with the highest degree of probability whether an observed effectcan be linked causally to a specific inter- vention. Indeed, some proponents of thispoint of view have argued that \"there is noComplementary and Alternative Medicine: How Do We Know If It Works? 15alternative medicine. There is only scien- tifically proven, evidence-based medicinesupported by solid data, or unprovenmedicine, for which scientific evidence islacking\" (Fontanarosa and Lundberg1998). They add that most alternativetherapies have not been rigorously testedusing scientific tests of efficacy based onaccepted rules of evidence, and theyregard the lack of convincing evidence as unacceptable and deeply troubling (Angelland Kassirer 1998; Ernst et al. 2001). Edzard Ernst (2000) contends that evidence exists within a hierarchy of four levels of validity, as follows: 1) Systematic review of randomized controlled trials, or meta-analysis. 2) Randomized clinical trials (RCTs).3) Controlled clinical trials.4) Uncontrolled data (e.g., case reports, case series, observational studies). Ernst argues that uncontrolled data in and of itself is only a starting point forgenerating hypotheses for research. Goodevidence, he insists, requires comparative studies through controlled clinical trialsand RCTs. He and his colleagues at theUniversity of Exeter have carried outnumerous systematic reviews of RCTs onparticular CAM practices (Ernst et al.2001). It is only when data across anumber of trials are combined, he believes,that the least biased evaluations of CAMtherapies can be produced (Ernst 2000). Increasing calls for evidence-based medicine are now being heard throughoutthe entire healthcare system, not just inthe case of CAM practices. Among themedical profession, evidence-based medi-cine (EBM) is accepted as the goal forwhich all medicine should strive (Sackett1998). EBM has been described as the \"conscientious, explicit and judicious use of the current best evidence in makingdecisions about the care of individualpatients\" (Ernst 1996: 71). The crucialpoint of EBM is that there is a hierarchyof levels of evidence, similar to the onesdelineated above by Ernst. Each level ofeviden ce permits different kinds of gener- alizations to be made. The evidencederived from randomized clinical trials isregarded by medicine as the highest quality for application to clinical practice.Other levels of evidence such as that provided by case studies, ethnographicstudies or experiential evidence areregarded with considerable skepticism by conventional medicine ( Jonas 2001). Because the logic of biomedicine has been the dominant influence in Westernsociety on healthcare research, the ideasupon which it was founded are accepted asmore accurate, true and correct than areother ideas that have originated fromdifferent traditions of healing. Practitionersand researchers who follow the biomedicaltradition have gained social authority asthe arbiters of truth on issues of healthand health policy (Saks 2000; Sharma2000). Indeed, exponents of this viewargue that any explanatory systems thatfall short of what biomedicine defines asevidence cannot be valid and are only pseudo sciences (Beyerstein 1997). For the medical and scientific community,controlled trials remain the final arbiter ofa therapy's efficacy and safety (Ernst andFugh-Berman 1998). The dominance of RCTs h as meant that many CAM thera- pies have been ignored or dismissed by themedical establishment because theirefficacy or safety has not been demon-strated by this particular research strategy. Healthcare Papers Vol.3 No.5 16The CAM Perspective For some CAM therapies, however, gathering evidence by using RCTs isdifficult and even inappropriate. What,for example, would constitute a credibleplacebo for acupuncture? How does aresearcher go about blinding a physical intervention like massage therapy?Another difficulty lies in the individual-ized and holistic nature of CAM treat-ments, which are customarily tailored to aspecific patient rather than standardizedfor a particular condition (Pietroni 1991;Kelner and Wellman 2000; Nahin andStraus 2001). CAM therapies often include several different kinds of interven-tions and frequently vary in actual prac-tice. They also often apply to non-specificconditions such as stress or lack of energy(Walach et al. 2002; Verhoef et al. 2002). Moreover, the focus of many CAMtreatments is on restoring balance to thebody rather than treating specific condi-tions (Verhoef et al. 2002). In otherwords, the findings of RCTs may not berelevant to what actually happens in clinical practice (Richardson 2002). It is important to recognize, however, that real progress is being made in scien-tific research on CAM. For example,glucosamine sulphate has recently beenshown to reduce pain during functioningas well as lessening the effect of pain indaily activities (Thie et al. 2001). Mentalimagery has been shown to be a clinicallyfeasible and effective adjunctive therapyfor stroke patients (Page et al. 2001).Another recent study of the possibleadverse effects of acupuncture has demon-strated that adverse events were minimalin a prospective survey of 34,000 treat-ments by traditional acupuncturists(MacPherson et al. 2001). Similar kindsof studies are going on in various coun- tries such as Germany, England, theUnited States and Canada. This upsurgein scientific studies on CAM is reflectedin the number of new peer-reviewedjournals reporting the results of recentresearch. Some examples are the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine and Alternative Therap ies in Health and Medicine in the United States, and Complementary Therapies in Medicine andFocu s on Alternative and Complementary Therapies in the United Kingdom. A considerable gap still exists between the demands for proof that are comingfrom established health professionals andgovernments, and the kinds of results thatresearchers of CAM are able to demon- strate (House of Lords Select Committeeon Science and Technology 2000). Whyhas the process of providing solid evidencebeen so slow and difficult? As has already been suggested, in the case of various therapies as well as some herbs and other natural products, tradi-tional forms of trials are often not appro-priate. Randomization can be problematicwhen it entails offering or not offering aproduct or service that may benefit apatient in need. Blinding the patient andthe practitioner to the therapeutic optionis often difficult, given the way CAMpractitioners tend to negotiate withpatients about treatment options and thedegree of active involvement that eachparty typically adopts in the delivery ofCAM. Removing placebo effects makes no sense in the case of most CAM prac-tices, evolving as they have from ancienttraditions of healing that emphasizefactors such as trust, relationship and thetransmission of healing energy. These areinherent components of the therapies, not Complementary and Alternative Medicine: How Do We Know If It Works? 17something that can be isolated to remove their contaminating effect (Glik 2000;Kelner 2000). The CAM healingencounter often includes factors that maynever be quantifiable. Thus, it is thephilosophical origins or world view ofCAM practices that make many of them inappropriate for RCT testing and, if suchtrials are conducted, may make the resultsmeaningless (Linde and Jonas 1999). The individualized nature of CAM treatments also mitigates against the use ofRCTs that use population-based tech- niques. Failure to take individual differencesinto account may distort or skew the effectsof actual practices upon health outcomes(O'Connor 2000; Nahin and Straus 2001;Stone 1996). Furthermore, a CAM therapies such as TCM and natur- opathy use several approaches simultane-ously to treat a given condition. This cancreate difficulties when interpreting theefficacy of a therapy if all the interventionsinvolved in a therapy are not taken intoconsideration in the research design (Nahinand Straus 2001; Mills et al. 2002). Anadditional complication lies in the variableways in which many CAM therapies arepractised. There are a number of differentapproaches to delivering chiropractic,naturopathy and acupuncture, for example,and one single trial cannot capture thesevariations (Nahin and Straus 2001). In addition to the nature of CAM treatments, there are also other problemsin designing research that can yieldcredible evidence of efficacy and safety.While the healthcare system has tradi- tionally focused on curing or coping withdisease, consumers are also interested indifferent kinds of outcomes such as healthmaintenance and quality of life (Lewith etal. 2002; Truant and McKenzie 1999).Assessing the effectiveness of a particular therapy has conventionally been done bylooking at markers such as symptomprogression, organ function or othervariables related to disease. But consumersare now demanding that effectiveness beconsidered in terms of their overall healthand well-being and are seeking outcomemeasures such as quality of life and abilityto perform well at work (Long et al. 2000;Truant and McKenzie 1999). CAM ideologies are more amenable to thesegoals, and this is often a reason whypatients seek them out (Ernst 2000). Inappropriate and inadequate research designs involving small sample sizes, non-homogeneous study populations, lack offollow-up and no analysis of patients whohave dropped out of care have also beenblamed for the paucity of valid, reliableeviden ce. Another aspect of the problem is the lack of research capacity among thepopulation of CAM practitioners. Only afew have had systematic training inresearch strategies and methods, and most of them are thus at a serious disadvantagewhen submitting research proposals tofunding agencies. It is difficult, however,for these practitioners to acquire thenecessary tools to do good research becausethere is so little credible evidence towarrant investing in their training andresearch. Funding for scientific research has traditionally come from large pharmaceuti-cal companies, foundations and academic institutions. These funders have beenreluctant to invest resources to investigate the utility of unproven CAM therapies. Many of these problems can be resolved over time, especially if adequate and sustained financial support can beprovided by governments and industry forresearch on CAM. In future, we can expect Healthcare Papers Vol.3 No.5 18that dependable research findings will become available as new, more appropriatemethodologies are added to RCTs andCAM practitioners become more sophisti- cated about 2001; Mills et al. 2002; Verhoef et al.2002). It is clear that CAM therapies mustundergo the same degree of systematic andrigor ous scrutiny as conventional medical therapies if they are to win full acceptanceand legitimacy in the healthcare field. According to David Eisenberg, chair of Harvard University's new Division forResearch and Education inComplementary and Integrative MedicalTherapies, \"The tools we have [today]are adequate investigate the over-whelming majority of alternative andcomplementary therapies\" (Lambert2002: 100). He mentions new techniquessuch as scanning technologies to look atbrain states so that we can expand ourknowledge of the mind-body interface,and robotic tools that can screen thou-sands of herbal extracts for their effect onbiological targets. He argues that sincethe National Institutes of Health in theUnited States has seen the potential ofresearch on CAM and has begun to fund it, young scientists are more willing toundertake it. He says: \"When the chal-lenge of creating a methodology becomesintellectually stimulating and fun, that'swhen a field has staying power\"(Lambert 2002: 100). The Consumer's Perspective Despite problems surrounding credibleevidence, consumers have been demon- strating an enthusiastic interest in CAMhealthcare. Over the past few decades,people's faith in traditional community,social and religious authorities has faded,and society has become more questioning and skeptical (Crellin et al. 1997; Putnam2000). The health sector, like others insociety, has been affected by the growingempowerment of the consumer who hasdeveloped an interest in health modelsfrom other cultures and in complementaryand alternative forms of care. Theseconsumers have not waited for medicalscience to produce solid evidence for theefficacy and safety of CAM. They havegone ahead without such proof and havepaid for these therapies out of their own pockets. The question is: What types of eviden ce have they been relying on when they decide to do so? One of the mostpowerful influences on decision-makingfor CAM has been shown to be the coun-sel of a health confidant (Wellman 2000). Using social network analysis to examine how people come to use alternative typesof healthcare, Wellman found that advicefrom close friends and family had the mostimpact. People turned to those whoseadvice they trusted - their health confi-dants - when they were having problemswith their health. When they were readyto consider alternatives to conventionalmedical care, they listened to those friendsand family members who had been helpedby CAM and decided that there might behelp for them as well. These recommenda-tions from health confidants provide akind of legitimacy for treatments that arenot formally sanctioned by science. Wellman's research also showed that only a few patients were recommended toCAM by their physicians, although this may be in the process of changing with theintroduction of courses on CAM intoCanadian medical schools (Ruedy et al.1999). Testimonies about the positiveComplementary and Alternative Medicine: How Do We Know If It Works? 19effects of CAM practices or products from acquaintances and colleagues at work alsoinfluenced the decision to choose CAM, asdid recommendations from CAM practi-tioners themselves. These practitionersoften suggested to their patients that theytry another type of therapy or a CAMproduct as an adjunct to the treatmentsthey were giving. Wellman's analysis ofpatients' health networks also revealed thatthe larger and more diverse a person'snetworks are, the more likely it is that heor she will be exposed to someone who hashad a positive experience with CAM andwill recommend it (Wellman 2000). Another kind of evidence is provided by media reports of successful outcomes.The press, radio and television have allstepped up the attention paid to CAM inthe last few years. Stories of people whohave been helped as well as warnings ofpossible dangers have become common-place news. Gurus such as Andrew Weil,Deepak Chopra and Dean Ornish haveraised the profile of CAM to a pervasivelevel. Their influence and the multitude ofbooks and journals on the uses of CAMcan be powerful forms of evidence for people who have been considering tryingCAM products or services. The power of advertising also has an impact on consumers. More and moreadvertisements for CAM are appearing inthe mainstream media. Formerly restrictedto specialized publications and localessuch as health food stores, advertisementsextolling the merits of particular CAMtreatments and products are powerfulforms of evidence for people who areseeking new options for their healthcare. Finally, th e power of the Internet has been growing steadily. People are increas-ingly turning to the Internet today forhealth knowledge and advice. In a study conducted in 2001, 500 Internet userswho go on-line for healthcare informationwere surveyed. Just under half (48%) werefound to have used it for informationabout alternative or experimental treat-ments or medicines (Fox and Rainie2002). While the quality of the evidencethey find there is highly variable, itsaccessibility and immediacy can have apotent effect on healthcare decisions. Allthese informal sources of information andinfluence are acting together; the impactof each is reinforced by the others. Deciding to choose CAM on the advice of such informal sources suggeststhat many patients are relying heavily onanecdotal information as evidence. Whilethis is a significant departure from scien-tific rigour, it is nevertheless very influential(Kelly-Powell 1997). Enkin and Jadad(1998) explain the importance of anecdotalevidence in terms of its fit with patients' belief systems, values and expectations. Itseems that scientific evidence of efficacyplays only a limited role in decision-making and that CAM patients areinfluenced by other, more social andemotional considerations such as frustra-tion with conventional care and a sense ofdesperation about their health problems(Kelner and Wellman 1997a). What constitutes evidence for one person will not necessarily work foranother. Different groups in society askdifferent types of questions and requiredifferent kinds of data. For example,people in severe pain may be satisfied withanecdotal evidence of relief provided by aCAM t herapy, while their physicians may insist on scientific proof of efficacy.Governments are accountable to thepublic and need to base their healthcare Healthcare Papers Vol.3 No.5 20policies on reliable data about safety and cost-effectiveness. Consumers, on theother hand, are more focused on healthmaintenance and prevention of illness andwill be looking for evidence of goodhealth from the histories of close friendsand family. The Practitioner's Perspective Another perspective on the need for scien-tific evidence that CAM works and is safe isthat of the CAM practitioners themselves.The views of CAM practitioners weresampled in a recent study conducted inToront o (Kelner et al. forthcoming). The leaders of three groups (chiropractors,homeopaths and reiki practitioners) wereasked about the importance of demonstrat-ing the efficacy and safety of their therapiesand practices. There were striking differ-ences in the attitudes of the three sets ofleaders. The chiropractors were strongly infavour of ongoing scientific research thatmight demonstrate the efficacy and safetyof their therapies. The homeopaths wereless certain that rigorous proof was needed,while the reiki practitioners were notsympathetic to the whole notion of researchand believed that \"reiki speaks for itself.\" These variations in attitudes toward the importance of research and evidencecan be partially accounted for by the fact that the three groups are at differentstages in the process of professionalizing.The chiropractic leaders encouragedcontinuing peer-reviewed researchbecause they seek full professional accep-tance for their group. They realized that inorder to accomplish this goal, they mustprovide convincing evidence that theirpractices have a positive impact on healthoutcomes, are safe and can save thegovernment money in the long run.Because they have been able to organize effectively and increase their numbersacross the country, they are in a positionto undertake and fund the requiredresearch (Kelner et al. 1980). The homeopathic group is far smaller and much more divided. While some ofthe leaders recognized that producing asolid base of evidence could help to winacceptance for their therapies, othersexpressed no interest in pursuing thiscourse of action. Even if the variousfactions were to agree that scientificresearch is a desirable strategy to pursue, the size of the group would be a serioushandicap. Producing credible research is acostly undertaking and requires a sizablegroup of practitioners who are sufficientlycommitted to the project. The reiki group is the smallest of the three and consists of several informalcommunities that have little or no contactwith one another. With one exception, thereiki respondents were completely unin- terested in encouraging research on theirhealing practices. The idea of scientificresearch that could demonstrate the value of their approach to healthcare seemedalien to them. They regarded conventionalmethods of measuring health outcomes asinappropriate for their philosophy of care.Furthermore, their small size and lack of an organizational structure would make itimpossible to carry on this kind ofresearch, even if their negative attitudes toward scientific research were to change. The findings indicate that healthcare occupations that seek to become profes-sionalized are the most receptive toresearch on their therapies and practices. CAM groups are increasingly seeking to meet demands from other healthcareprofessionals and governments for Complementary and Alternative Medicine: How Do We Know If It Works? 21evidence-based healthcare (Best and Glik 2000; Kelner et al. 2001). Groups thatwish to join the mainstream healthcaresystem recognize that they must respondto these demands. But not all healthcareoccupations are at the point in the profes-sionalization process where they are willingor able to undertake rigorous research.Some may never choose to do so, prefer- ring to practise outside the professional sphere. The data presented here provide apicture of three groups with widely differ-ing attitudes toward research and alsotoward the prospect of fitting the modelof a fully legitimate health profession. A Sociological Perspective The concept of evidence is clearlycomplex and multidimensional. From theviewpoint of sociologists, we present ananalysis of how the notion of providingreliable evidence can be refined and expanded. Many sociologists subscribe tothe view that \"reality\" is socially constructedand that what people accept as realityvaries from person to person, and time totime, even within one society (Berger andLuckman 1966; Cassidy 1994). For example, as circumstances change, people'snotions of what constitutes good healthalso alter; longevity alone is no longerenough - it is the way one lives that matters.People who are impoverished and from minority cultures perceive their optionsfor living a healthy life as restricted. Bycomparison, those who are well educated,affluent and well connected see numerousopportunities. So it is with views aboutwhat constitutes evidence. For those indifferent positions in society, the nature of credible evidence will vary. Moreover,people will change their views aboutevidence at different times, depending on their place in the life course. The prevailing wisdom of the moment also significantly influences the way peopleevaluate what they read and hear. For example, until recently scientific researchsuggested that hormone replacementtherapy had a role in preventing heartattacks and strokes in post-menopausalwomen. New research, however, showsthat estrogen makes women more suscep-tible to blood clots and that the overallcardiovascular effect is negative (Patterson 2002). Women are now confused andasking themselves what to believe. Whatpeople regard as reliable and compellingevidence is intricately connected not only to the circumstances of their everyday livesbut also to the socio-cultural climate inwhich they live (Garfinkel 1967; Koos1954; Schutz 1967). Nevertheless, useful scientific research is done, and reality approxi- mated. Two major paradigms or modelsof reality underlie much of contemporaryhuman thought, including the practice ofscience: the reductionist paradigm andthe holistic paradigm. At present, thefirst model is the dominant one used inscientific research. But many things inour world do not have logical explana-tions; this makes it hard to insist on ascientific rationale for everything. Forexample, modern medicine is predicatedon a biomedical perspective, but physi-cians frequently argue that medicine isalso an art. What they imply by this isthat science alone does not constitute thewhole of reality. In the healing process,the therapeutic relationship, the practi-tioner's intuition and experience and thepatient's confidence and participation areall significant influences on the eventualoutcome. Sociologists contend that both Healthcare Papers Vol.3 No.5 22models are necessary; each emphasizes different aspects of reality, recognizingthe complex interplay of biological,psychological, social, cultural, environ-mental and spiritual factors underlyinghealth and disease. Therefore, when itcomes to evidence about the efficacy andsafety of CAM, sociologists tend to takea broad view that includes a variety oftypes of evidence as well as an open approach to the evaluation of evidence. We endorse the view that the evidence base for CAM should be on a par with theevidence base for conventional medicine; no more, no less. However, the concept ofevidence needs to be broadened. We need an imaginative spectrum of researchmethods that balances relevance, scientificrigour and feasibility. Recommendations for Policy There is a recognition today that we need to develop innovative strategies forproviding quality healthcare to allCanadians. As part of this process, weneed to promote an understanding of therole of CAM in healthcare. Integral to its role is systematic evaluation of efficacy and safety. At present, the overall infra-structure to accomplish these goals doesnot exist, despite the presence of smallresearch centres across the country. We suggest some developments that can helpcreate a scientific foundation for comple-mentary and alternative therapies and forthe evaluation of their effects. This infra-structure has to provide opportunities forCAM t herapies to undergo the same close scrutiny and rigorous testing that havebeen applied to many conventionalmedical treatments. To accomplish this,federal, provincial and private support areall necessary.Research To bu ild a comprehensive research infra- structure for CAM in this country, weneed to develop a cadre of multidiscipli-nary, accomplished investigators with aspecial interest in this area of healthcare.Scholars have to develop appropriateconceptual frameworks and methodologiesfor evaluation. At the same time,researchers need to work on knowledge development and management throughsystematic literature reviews, bibliographicdatabases and researcher/practitionernetworks. Vitally important in thisendeavour is the establishment of linkageswith international agencies such as theNational Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at the NationalInstitutes of Health (NIH) in the UnitedStates and the Prince of Wales Foundation in the United Kingdom. Finally, cliniciansshould be involved in developing standardsof practice and peer review processes. The most effective way to accomplish these goals would be to establish anInstitute for Complementary andAlternative Healthcare under the auspicesof the Canadian Institutes of HealthResearch (CIHR). This institute wouldovers ee the development of a coherent national CAM research policy, linkresearchers across Canada to develop interdisciplinary expertise and act as aresource to other institutes within CIHR as well as to health policy-makersand politicians. Governments can also play a role by including information about CAM ingeneral health surveys. For example, theLongitudinal National Population Health Survey (NPHS), conducted bythe federal government, already includessome questions about CAM, but it doesComplementary and Alternative Medicine: How Do We Know If It Works? 23not go far enough. In addition to the descriptive data it produces, questions on patterns of use of both CAM andconventional medicine should take intoaccount cultural and geographic differ-ences. Besides data on mortality andmorbidity, questions that reveal the effectof CAM therapies on prevention andquality of life should be included.Surveys on the use of CAM could also be mounted by the Canadian Institute forHealth Information (CIHI). It is not always necessary to reinvent the wheel. Research findings from othercountries can yield valuable informationand insights. For example, pharmaceuticalcompanies have taken advantage ofaccumulated knowledge from elsewhereconcerning herbs and other naturalelements to develop their own modernscientific products. Existing data can alsobe found in the numerous studies ofnatural herbs conducted in Germany andother European countries (see reviews inFACT). Research on CAM in Canada should actively seek out the results ofwork already undertaken in other parts ofthe world. Regulation Governments have a responsibility toassure that healthcare services are not onlyrespon sive to needs but are also safe. In order to provide accountability to thepublic, the federal government has under-taken to regulate health products (NaturalHealth Products Directorate). This workis proceeding at a rapid pace, andCanadians will soon have guidelines andstandardized codes to assist them inselecting CAM products. Provin cial governments are responsi- ble for regulating healthcare practitionersso that the public is not harmed or duped. Regulation provides protection fromunqualified, incompetent or unscrupulouspractitioners who are not well trainedand/or treat patients without practice andethical standards. The regulation of CAMpractitioners varies widely betweenprovinces. Most CAM practitioners arenot regulated in any way. The only CAMgroup that is regulated in all provinces ischiropractic, while some other groups,such as massage therapists, naturopathicand traditional Chinese medicine practi-tioners and acupuncturists, are regulatedin a few provinces. The criteria for achieving statutory self-regulation currently exclude manyCAM groups that are providing health services to a broad range of the public.Decisions about which groups merit state-sanctioned self-regulation need to bebased on a range of considerations that gobeyond the ones that are typically used.Evidence of efficacy, for example, shouldinclude not only the results of clinicaltrials but also take into account positiveexperiences in other cultures over longperiods of time. The fact that many ofthese CAM therapies such as homeopathyand traditional Chinese medicine are wellestablished in other countries should bearweight on decisions about state-sanc-tioned regulation. Some CAM occupa-tions impose standards on their membersindependently of the state, but in theseinstances the government does not standbehind any sanctions such a group mayimpose. This presents a problem for thepublic and suggests that the criteria forattaining statutory self-regulation shouldbe relaxed so that a broader network ofprotection can be available to Canadians.Healthcare Papers Vol.3 No.5 24Funding Government also has a responsibility to manage healthcare services in a cost-effective way. The more the public usesCAM, the more its use becomes a public issue, and that means that the governmenthas to take a role. In an era in whichprovincial governments are in the processof restructuring the healthcare system tocontain costs, the question of who shouldpay for CAM services is crucial. At thepresent time, some provinces pay a smallamount for selected CAM therapies suchas chiropractic. Increasingly, privateinsurance companies are offering to coverthe costs for some of the more widely usedCAM t herapies. But this means that many people are paying out of their ownpockets and that those who cannot paymust do without services that they might want to use and that may help them. If it can be established that CAM healthcare is cheaper than or equal in costto conventional medical care for certainconditions, it stands to reason that theseservices should be publicly funded.Unfortunately, little research has beenundertaken that could produce evidenceof cost-effectiveness. Admittedly, this is acomplex issue. Both short- and long-termeffects must be considered, as well as directand indirect costs. However, if governmentsare seeking to assure accessibility of careand to minimize costs, they must stronglysupport this kind of research withoutprejudice. CAM may provide a cheaperalternative to the highly technologicalservices offered by conventional medicine. References Angell, M. and J.P .
