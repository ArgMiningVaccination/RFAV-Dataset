I recently went through radiation treatments. The doctor recommended aloe for the skin in that area. After taking a toll on my aloe plant I went in search of something I could buy that was 100% aloe. This is as close as I found. It has been working great and my doctor actually said he would recommend it for his other patients. Best product. Will never not have it around. Such an inexpensive and wonderfully excellent moisturizer for hair and skin. Raving fan!. AMAAAAZINGGGG. It's all natural, it's verrryyy moisturizing, hardly any smell, and dries without residue, so your skin is soft once it's dry. This is my second time buying it. My friend also bought it because she tried mine and wanted to use it. My cousin in china also wants one now!
