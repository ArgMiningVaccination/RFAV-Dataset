How can you get healthy and out of pain the fewest moves possible? Our job is to help you answer that question. HOW DOES IT WORK? What Makes This Unique? No Hidden Fees All Lab Tests (the ones your MD wont Run) Included All Herbs and Supplements Included Genetically customized Diet and Supplement Prescriptions All protocols customized for your body (not \"one size fits all\" medicine) \"The best time to treat disease is before it arises\" the second best time is now. Our clinic, and our practitioner's efforts are dedicated to the relief of pain and suffering in the world with compassionate, modern and time tested, scientifically backed NATURAL MEDICINE, with a strong focus on \"Low Risk/High Reward\" interventions. Q: WHAT a catch-all \"Making a person whole again\" or \"treating a person as a whole,\" not a collection of disconnected organs. In the most simple words possible: Treating the body and the mind at the same time. There is ABSOLUTELY a connection between the food in your belly, thoughts in your head, and your health. Holistic Doctors recognize that connection, making it stronger, so you can heal more quickly and fully. Modern medicine is rebranding the scientifically proven connection between the mind, and body as its own. The connection has been acknowledged for THOUSANDS OF YEARS OR MORE, and we have many ways to enhance that connection. Our practice is dedicated to propagating and teaching medical principles that work, in a time in history when faith has been lost in doctors, hospitals and insurance companies. All Herbs and Supplements Included Genetically Customized Diet, Supplements and Herbs All In-office And Telehealth Visits Included One of the core principles of holistic medicine is that \"disease must be treated at its source, and in its manifestation. For example: If we are going to treat your headache, we'll treat the headache, AND the reason WHY you had the headache in the first place. More and more people are demanding to be treated like people in a medical paradigm that seems do embrace a philosophy of \"profit first, people second.\" We hear story after story after story of people being neglected and hurt by modern medicine - which can be archaic at times. We believe our role as doctors is to hear and validate patient experience, and offer counterpoint to the wrong or dangerous advice patients hear from doctors all too often. Our method embraces the parts of modern medicine that are amazing and life extending. We respect both sides of that discussion, old and new, and feel that medicine is about common problems and collaboration, not bickering about who is right and what ideology is better. So we believe doctors should be asking, \"How do our patients get where they want to be in the fewest moves possible?\" Our flagship program is an immersive, all inclusive program focused on results rather then upsells and the fee-sharing referral runaround that sends you everywhere and guides you nowhere. Our Membership Program Platinum Concierge Medicine: A Naturopathic and Traditional East Asian Medicine [Acupuncture, Herbs and Physical Medicine] Immersion If you are a person looking to get your health on track for the first time, again, or looking to take your health and life to the next level, you might be in the right place. This is an all-inclusive deep dive program designed to sort out, get a handle on, or gain insight into the nature of chronic disease and conditions, as well as prevention. Most doctors don't have time to hear all your stories about lumps bumps and bruises... This is a mistake, these are all clues. We designed this program after looking at the problem, our skillsets, then engineered a solution - It's not a perfect solution, as no solution is, but it's working. The Problem: Most doctor's offices are overcrowded, and they have to see 40+ patient's a day to pay off their massive student debts, cover overhead, and get paid a living wage by the healthcare conglomerates who financially incentivize doctors to see as many patients as possible. Our Solution: Plan extra time in to office visits to talk to people, answer their questions, and leave them feeling informed, empowered and at ease - or as close to that as we possibly can. Problem: In order to see those 40+ patients, they can only spend about 5-15 minutes with each patient. Our Solution: Spend more time with patients, as this one on one is the key to patient empowerment and, ideally, liberation. Having fewer patients caps our clinic capacity, and we have to charge more than most operations, but we want this to be the thing you've been looking for, not another stop on an endless merry-go-round of referrals, disappointment and frustration The Problem: Wait times to see a doctor, especially in Hawaii are increasing, beyond a limit that is acceptable for people in immediate pain. Our Solution: We are usually able to get new patients into the clinic within 3-7 days, sometimes sooner. The Problem: It is stressful waiting weeks or months to have your questions answered or your blood tests evaluated, only to have the doctor say \"your labs look fine\" even though you know something's wrong. Our Solution: Perform advanced and specialized blood testing that actually gives us answers. Don't take on so many patient's that we can't get patients their results ASAP. Explain these results in easy to understand terms. This is again more expensive, but provides significantly deeper insight than most GP's and PCP's will find. Their practice is specialized and limited, like every doctor. The Problem: Office visits are so rushed and tense that often times we are bombarded with language and concepts we don't understand, and rushed out of the office, and have no idea what to ask, and forget all of the important things we've just talked about. Our Solution: Slow down and actually answer patient questions; when you get home and remember what you wanted to ask, just email us, and we'll clarify. By working on a more intimate retainer/membership model, we can answer your questions without having you pay for another office visit. It's already covered. Our Solutions: Doctors need to have time for patients, educate them and not rush them out the door. A way to deliver safe and immediately actionable plans that are low risk, high reward. No surprise bills and hidden surcharge fees. No waiting 6 months to find out the answer to a serious and concerning question. Please note: This program includes any testing cost that isn't covered by your insurance, prescription supplement and herb costs, and customized diets designed by doctors, all appointment and visit fees, for one price - no hidden cost. We built a program that we believe to be reflective of what people need/want/expect from medicine. This isn't yet recognized by insurance companies as profitable to them, so they, wont cover. This program has been built by the feedback from patients. We want you to feel like you're being guided through the process of getting your health back on track, so you don't have to worry about getting distracted by life, kids, jobs, advertisers, health crazes, fad diets, etc. If you need someone to help filter out the cacophony of content advertising, affiliate marketers and other nonsense and tell you what to focus on, this might be for you. There's never been this much access to information, so easily - which is fantastic, but it can also be distracting and incredibly overwhelming. We'll help you cut through the noise, or avoid it all together. DOES IT WORK? \"I had my wedding coming up - Dr. Santander helped restore my vitality\" \u2014 P.C. \"With a decade of chronic illness under my belt, I have substantial concerns about the financial aspect of my ongoing treatment. Dr. Goto's concierge service allows me to be supported physically while removing the emotional financial stress associated with the need for frequent medical attention. She has my absolute trust; I have always felt that she prioritizes what is best for me as a patient. I have and will continue to recommend Dr. Goto to those looking to treat specific concerns or simply support their continued wellness. We are so lucky to have her on island!\" \u2014 R.H. Insurance FAQ Q: Do You Take My Insurance? A: Insurance is complicated and case-by-case. We can give you receipts to submit to FSA and \"superbills\" to submit to your insurance companies, however, at this time, we cannot submit those forms for you; but we WILL give you whatever paperwork you need from us to get reimbursed wherever you can. We do not work directly with insurance because we want to spend more time talking to patients and less time on hold. Simply put, that is our strategy at the moment, until the strategy changes. We're always open to having conversations about how we can make medicine more accessible to people, so if you know something that we don't, please reach out, and let's discuss. It's currently a nightmare to work with insurance companies, hopefully it won't be that way forever. Check back again later and see if we're working with insurance in the near future! Q: Do I Have Acupuncture Coverage? A: If you want to know about your specific insurance coverage, contact your insurance provider before contacting us - and ask them these 3 questions: 1.) About what kind of coverage you have, and if you have an FSA (flexible spending account - It's like an allowance for medical expenses). 2.) Ask them, does your insurance covers acupuncture or naturopathic medicine? 3.) If so, then ask them how many treatments do you get? What is covered? What is not covered? Please have this information BEFORE contacting us or any other medical provider, so they better assist you - this helps avoid frustration, runaround, and gets you the quickest care possible. We ARE currently able to work with FSA and HSA accounts to the best of our knowledge. We are not currently in-network with any insurance companies, and can give you a Super Bill to submit to your insurance company. Aloha, We understand that our methodologies and our programs aren't for everybody or in everybody's reach, and we want to give you a chance to feel us out before we begin. Because of this we have a short but comprehensive application and interview process. Our goal is to always be on the same page and take no more or less time to be effective. We'd love to help and encourage you to reach out and see if we're a good fit! Thank you for your time and attention, AND for reading this far without falling asleep.
