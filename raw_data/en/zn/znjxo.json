(102-16)A Message from our CEOTABLE OF CONTENTS At Dignity Health, we believe that humanity and kindness are at the heart of our healing mission, creating something that this world - not just this industry - needs. Dignity Health has long understood that our health and the health of our planet are intricately connected. We have always felt a special responsibility toward the communities we serve and the environment we are called to protect knowing that the decisions we make as an industry can either harm or benefit the safety and well-being of the families in our care. How Dignity Health contributes to the local environment and its quality of life will continue to be a key measure of our organization's success. During FY 2018, we experienced both successes and challenges in promoting the health of our common home. As a system, we: Led in the formation of a climate and health alliance comprised of five leading health care systems in California in collaboration with Health Care Without Harm, the Office of the Governor Jerry Brown, and California Hospital Association to further develop our voice and influence in the legislative and regulatory arenas. Reduced our use of plastic through the elimination of straws in food service areas and the purchase of selected OR supplies made from the waste of sugar cane. Partnered with Greenhealth Exchange to advocate for better, safer, and more environmentally friendly products and integrate this purchasing concept into our sourcing strategy. Invested $1 million in Health Care Without Harm to help further the organization's efforts to achieve its mission of transforming health care worldwide so that it reduces its environmental footprint and becomes a community anchor for sustainability and a leader in the global movement for environmental health and justice. Continued to advance climate and energy initiatives at the state, federal, and global levels, and at annual shareholder meetings of companies in which we own stock. Made little progress in increasing our rate of recycling due in part to the turmoil in the global recycling markets which have greatly disrupted the attractiveness and pricing for the purchase of recycled materials. The magnitude of the changes and the challenges that the health care industry faces is abundantly clear; so are the opportunities. We will continue to value that which sustains life, including our environment. It is imperative that we measure, manage, and report our efforts on our interlocking environmental, social, and economic/governance (ESG) initiatives in a manner that allows all of us to see our true impacts on our world and our people. Dignity Health will continue modernizing our delivery system, making higher quality care easier to access at a lower cost, with a special focus on prevention and public health - all areas that we are uniquely equipped to address. We will need to look out from our hospitals, care centers, and clinics to the communities we serve and consider the effects of the social and environmental determinants of health on the people we care for. I want to acknowl- edge the vibrant, selfless women and men who are leading the transition to a more resilient, equitable, and sustainable world, and look forward to working with all of you to advance our healing ministry in the year to come Lloyd H.

To help ensure that, we developed our strategic plan called Horizon 2020 and, to make sure we got there even faster, we decided to accelerate our efforts. We now have distinct Horizon 2020 Acceleration goals related to quality, patient experience, and financial performance, and the good news is, we continue to get closer to our goals (see attached graphic). Heightened acceleration in these strategic areas is imperative in light of the challenges and opportunities we are currently facing - as an industry and as an organization. Our strategic plan and goals guide us in bringing our mission, vision, and values alive. We have the opportunity to define our future so that we ensure the long-term viability of the special ministry that has been entrusted to us.

We have prepared this report in accordance with the core GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards. At Dignity Health, sustainability encompasses all elements of our operations. This report highlights the sustainability initiatives of our 39 acute care facilities serving communities in California, Arizona, and Nevada for the period of July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018. With the exception of the audited financial statements, we have not submitted the report for external assurance. We regularly review the universe of issues we could report on in order to focus on those most important to our organization, our stakeholders, and society at large. We strive to report on those issues that are material from a sustainability perspective and over which we have a reasonable level of influence or control. In our sustainability reporting, we define materiality by the degree to which an issue is significant to our organization, our industry, society, and our interested stakeholders, and the degree to which it is relevant to our scope of operations and ethical commitments. The topics covered in this report represent our ESG priorities identified through our ESG assessment.

The assessment: Systematically engaged Dignity Health's cross-functional leaders to identify the organization's most significant environmental, social, and economic opportunities, with specificity around: WHAT the issue, risk, and/or opportunity is. WHERE the issue, risk, or opportunity exists in the value chain. HOW actionable the issue is. Developed a value chain map through a sustainability lens that: Highlighted topics that may impact Dignity Health which may have been overlooked due to a focus on our own operations. Clarified each topic to a greater level of specificity. Validated existing strategies, suggested changes when they were needed, and identified areas of opportunity or risk that had not been previously identified. Identified seven competitors and/or industry peers and three aspirational peers against which to benchmark the organizations' material topics to judge our performance and reveal any gaps. Identified, prioritized, and surveyed/interviewed key stakeholders (both internally and externally) to unveil the issues most material to these groups, as well as potential opportunities and risks. Enabled Dignity Health to determine how actionable each of the material topics is in the short term, and how to use the findings to inform Dignity Health's strategy and commitments for the next sustainability strategic planning and GRI reporting period. ESG is periodically reviewed and updated as needed.Reporting and Materiality | ESG Materiality ProcessTABLE OF CONTENTS CEO Letter About Dignity Health Reporting and Materiality ESG Assessment ESG Process ESG Matrix ESG Priorities and Boundaries Governance and Leadership Ethics and Integrity Economic Value and Impact Stakeholders and Community Human Trafficking Case Study Advocacy Case Study Patients Innovation Employees Climate Resilience Materials Stewardship GRI Content Index (103-1)ESG Materiality Process BrownFlynn collects and analyzes the information needed to conduct a materiality assessment aligned with the GRI guidelines.

Governance and LeadershipTABLE OF CONTENTS CEO Letter About Dignity Health Reporting and Materiality Governance and Leadership Governance and Leadership Structure Governance and Management Practice Ethics and Integrity Economic Value and Impact Stakeholders and Community Human Trafficking Case Study Advocacy Case Study Patients Innovation Employees Climate Resilience Materials Stewardship GRI Content IndexGovernance and Leadership | StructureTABLE OF CONTENTS CEO Letter About Dignity Health Reporting and Materiality Governance and Leadership Governance and Leadership Structure Governance and Management Practice Ethics and Integrity Economic Value and Impact Stakeholders and Community Human Trafficking Case Study Advocacy Case Study Patients Innovation Employees Climate Resilience Materials Stewardship GRI Content Index (102-18, 405-1)Governance and Leadership Structure The governance and leadership of Dignity Health is provided by our board of directors, executive leadership team, and sponsorship council. The board of directors is responsible for approving major decisions affecting our health care ministry, including long-range strategic plans, the allocation of capital, joint ventures, and major acquisitions and sales. The executive leadership team is charged by the board of directors to provide leadership and organizational management in the areas of operations, mission integration, finance, and support services, as well as leadership over the strategic direction of the organization. The sponsorship council oversees and acts upon issues of Catholic identity for our Catholic-sponsored health facilities including mission integration, ministry leadership, education, and formation, and preservation of the sponsors' legacy. The board has chartered the following standing committees: Audit and Compliance, Executive, Finance, Human Resources and Compensation, Innovation, Mission Integrity, Quality, and Technology. The board is 46.1% female and 30.7% diverse. The executive leadership team is 30% female and 50% diverse. Members of Dignity Health's governance and management make conflict of interest declarations on an annual basis.Governance and Leadership | Management PracticeTABLE OF CONTENTS CEO Letter About Dignity Health Reporting and Materiality Governance and Leadership Governance and Leadership Structure Governance and Management Practice Ethics and Integrity Economic Value and Impact Stakeholders and Community Human Trafficking Case Study Advocacy Case Study Patients Innovation Employees Climate Resilience Materials Stewardship GRI Content Index (102-11)Governance and Management Practice The board, in consultation with the executive leadership team, determines the critical issues facing the organization and sets annual, mid-term, and longer-term goals for patient care, employee engagement, social, and financial performance. Achievement of those goals informs management's incentive compensation. Horizon 2020 established the long term goals and strategies considered fundamental to the organization's continued viability. The board and management adjust annual targets based on the previous year's performance. Annually the board reviews long-term goals for patient care and safety as well as financial performance, and sets targets for measuring progress. The appropriate functional departments set short and long term goals related to sustainability priorities. The Sustainability Council, which was established by the executive leadership team in FY 2015, ensures the integration of sustainability (environmental, social, and governance/economic (ESG) performance) across the organization. The Council, which is chaired by the EVP of Sponsorship and Mission Integration, is comprised of a multidisciplinary team that meets regularly to guide and promote the development, implementation, and reporting of goals, strategies, and metrics for advancing sustainability initiatives across all functional areas and for engaging employees, business partners, and other stakeholders. The Sustainability Council is accountable to the Mission Integrity Committee of the Board. Precautionary Principle Dignity Health has applied the precautionary principle (seeking alternatives when reasonable scientific studies indicate an ingredient or product could pose significant human health or environmental risks) in many of our actions. Dignity Health has proactively moved to eliminate mercury, phase out PVC in medical supplies, reduce energy use and greenhouse gases, reduce the volume and the toxicity of our waste, and improve the sustainability of our buildings and food supply. Dignity Health Definition of Sustainability At Dignity Health sustainability means managing our social, environmental and governance/economic impacts to promote health and the common good by consciously using resources efficiently and in ways that meet current needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Our commitment to sustainability is: Guided by our mission and our commitment to deliver care in a way that demonstrates humankindness and ensures a financially stable organization; Reflective of our core values especially that of stewardship - the protective care we give our treasures in order to pass them on to the next generation; and Rooted in the inextricable link between the health of the person, the community and the planet.Ethics and IntegrityTABLE OF CONTENTS CEO Letter About Dignity Health Reporting and Materiality Governance and Leadership Ethics and Integrity Foundational Principles and Documents Compliance FY 2018 Goals Economic Value and Impact Stakeholders and Community Human Trafficking Case Study Advocacy Case Study Patients Innovation Employees Climate Resilience Materials Stewardship GRI Content IndexEthics and IntegrityTABLE OF CONTENTS CEO Letter About Dignity Health Reporting and Materiality Governance and Leadership Ethics and Integrity Foundational Principles and Documents Compliance FY 2018 Goals Economic Value and Impact Stakeholders and Community Human Trafficking Case Study Advocacy Case Study Patients Innovation Employees Climate Resilience Materials Stewardship GRI Content Index (102-16, 102-17)Ethics and Integrity Highlights Ensured compliance with the Corporate Integrity Agreement and streamlined process and procedures to improve overall effectiveness and efficiency of the program. Conducted and oversaw more than 1,450 audits of physician and non-physician practitioners, including 42,504 patient encounters. Collaborated with Finance, Health Information Management, Care Coordination, Legal and Cybersecurity on creating a standard Operating Procedure for third party access to the electronic health record. The Dignity Health compliance function promotes the prevention, detec- tion, and resolution of actions that do not conform to ethical, legal, policy, or Dignity Health standards. This responsibility includes the obligation to develop policies and procedures that provide employees guidance, the creation of incentives to promote employee compliance, the development of plans to improve or sustain compliance, the development of metrics to measure execution (particularly by management) of the programs, the implementation of corrective actions, and the development of reports and dashboards that help management and the Board evaluate the effectiveness of the program. Dignity Health has successfully met and exceeded these important obligations and, over the last year, improved processes and procedures which continue to help Dignity Health fulfill its fundamental care-giving mission to our patients and the community. Ethics and Integrity | Foundational Principles and DocumentsTABLE OF CONTENTS CEO Letter About Dignity Health Reporting and Materiality Governance and Leadership Ethics and Integrity Foundational Principles and Documents Compliance FY 2018 Goals Economic Value and Impact Stakeholders and Community Human Trafficking Case Study Advocacy Case Study Patients Innovation Employees Climate Resilience Materials Stewardship GRI Content Index (102-17)Foundational Principles and Documents At Dignity Health, our Statement of Common Values is the foundation for all our ethics and compliance programs. Respect for the dignity of the person shapes all we do for patients and our interactions with their families. As an organization founded by Catholic religious women, we bring our values to all the work we do, whether it is at the bedside or in the business office. The Catholic tradition of using the gift of reason to think our way through our ethical obligations is strong at Dignity Health. We take our responsibility to ask the right questions and to promote integrity both in patient care and business practices very seriously. Our Standards for Mission Integration make that responsibility clear. Ethics Committees at each hospital meet regularly to educate and provide consultation services to caregivers, and patients or families who identify an ethical conflict in their care. Because the health care environment is complex and changing, sometimes there are situations requiring resolution that seem to (or actually) place Dignity Health's core values in conflict\u2014the closing of a program or the anticipated use of a new technology, for example. At those times, we use a structured, reflective process for deliberating that allows time to consider the various options in light of our values, and make a decision that supports them. Dignity Health is committed to making all of our business decisions based upon ethical principles, values, and integrity. This careful attention to business ethics, in turn, supports the quality of our patient care by providing the right mechanisms for investigating any concerns employees or patients may have, and for identifying potential weaknesses in internal systems and management. Dignity Health has created a pioneer compliance program which continues to be recognized as best practice within the health care industry. Further - more, Dignity Health increasingly utilizes the Values Based Discernment Process, an aid for evaluating the right course of action when a business decision is difficult. This process ensures that our values explicitly guide decisions when a large number of employees, our financial integrity, or our reputation may be affected.Ethics and Integrity | FY 2018 Goals and Compliance HotlineTABLE OF CONTENTS CEO Letter About Dignity Health Reporting and Materiality Governance and Leadership Ethics and Integrity Foundational Principles and Documents Compliance FY 2018 Goals Economic Value and Impact Stakeholders and Community Human Trafficking Case Study Advocacy Case Study Patients Innovation Employees Climate Resilience Materials Stewardship GRI Content Index (102-17)Compliance FY 2018 Goals Our Compliance department helps Dignity Health fulfill its fundamental care-giving mission to patients and the community. Our program is designed to identify weaknesses in our systems, processes, and management and to correct those weaknesses once identified. Importantly, the compliance function helps employees understand their roles and responsibility, encourages employees and others to report potential problems, and demonstrates to employees and the community Dignity Health's commitment to honest and ethical conduct in the work- place. We have a defined procedure that encourages employees to come forward with issues without being concerned that the organization would retaliate against them for doing so. Moreover, the program includes monitoring and auditing processes designed to measure our compliance, a commitment to promptly remediate non-compliance and regular reports to senior management and the Audit & Compliance Committee of Dignity Health's board on our progress in executing the programs. Compliance Hotline Dignity Health has established a Compliance Hotline for use by employees to ask questions or report potential or suspected violations of the Standards, Dignity Health policy, or applicable laws and regulations when employees are not comfortable communicating these matters within their usual organizational structures. The hotline is accessible 24 hours per day, seven days a week. All reports will be taken seriously, reviewed and investigated promptly, result in appropriate corrective action and, to the extent possible, be treated in a confidential manner. An employee has the option to make a hotline report anonymously. In that event, employees should understand that in a follow-up review or investigation, the reporter's identity may be learned as a natural consequence of the review or investigation. Retaliation against any employee who, in good faith, reports potential or suspected violations is unlawful and will not be tolerated. Reviews and investigations of potential or suspected violations of the Standards, Dignity Health policy, or applicable laws and regulations will be conducted under the direction of the Dignity Health Compliance department, Human Resources department, or Dignity Health Legal Counsel. It is Dignity Health's policy to cooperate in all governmental audits and investigations and for employees to do so as well, subject to guidelines set forth in the Standards of Conduct and Dignity Health policies. All employees of Dignity Health receive training at the time of hire and annually thereafter regarding our compliance program, including how to report concerns through the Dignity Health hotline. During FY 2018 (7/1/17 - 6/30/18), a total of 877 hotline calls were received, compared to a total of 898 during FY 2017 and 922 for FY 2016.Ethics and Integrity | Compliance HotlineTABLE OF CONTENTS CEO Letter About Dignity Health Reporting and Materiality Governance and Leadership Ethics and Integrity Foundational Principles and Documents Compliance FY 2018 Goals Economic Value and Impact Stakeholders and Community Human Trafficking Case Study Advocacy Case Study Patients Innovation Employees Climate Resilience Materials Stewardship GRI Content Index (102-17)Compliance Hotline continued The following table shows hotline calls by allegation class: FY 2016 FY 2017 FY 2018 # % # % # % Americans with Disabilities 3 0% 5 1% 13 1% Billing and Coding 1 0.1% Compliance Ethics 240 26% 241 27% 213 24% EEO/Diversity Issues 71 8% Human 555 60% 526 59% 509 58% Misuse or Misappropriation of Assets or information53 6% 75 8% 52 6% Care IdentifiedEthics and Integrity | Compliance and New Business Models and Compliance Work PlanTABLE OF CONTENTS CEO Letter About Dignity Health Reporting and Materiality Governance and Leadership Ethics and Integrity Foundational Principles and Documents Compliance FY 2018 Goals Economic Value and Impact Stakeholders and Community Human Trafficking Case Study Advocacy Case Study Patients Innovation Employees Climate Resilience Materials Stewardship GRI Content Index (102-17)Compliance and New Business Models With the dramatic shift in health care delivery models, we have been active in supporting innovative business models to position Dignity Health for success in this new environment. Compliance has partnered with business leaders working with physician integration, practice acquisitions, Bundled Payments of Care Initiative (BPCI), Clinical Integrated Networks, and technology advancements including electronic health records and telehealth services. These partnerships will help Dignity Health ensure that compliance and ethics are key elements of the design, implementation, and operation of these new care models. Compliance Work Plan Each year, the Compliance department, in collaboration with key system leaders, identifies and evaluates various compliance and ethics risks to which Dignity Health may be vulnerable. From this assessment, a work plan is developed to serve as the road map for compliance activities for the year. The FY 2018 Work Plan included initiatives related to new strategies as well as emerging risks in the traditional health care space. Projects covered both structural and substantive elements. The structural projects were designed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the compliance program such as developing better documentation, reporting, and communication tools and processes. The substantive elements included projects to address medical record documentation, care coordination, coding, billing, and claims submission. Additional projects were completed to address weaknesses in controls related to privacy and physician transactions. The compliance department, working with many others, was successful in completing most initiatives, while also managing the requirements of the Corporate Integrity Agreement with the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and other risks identified by external scrutiny or in the normal course of business.Ethics and Integrity | FY 2018 GoalsTABLE OF CONTENTS CEO Letter About Dignity Health Reporting and Materiality Governance and Leadership Ethics and Integrity Foundational Principles and Documents Compliance FY 2018 Goals Economic Value and Impact Stakeholders and Community Human Trafficking Case Study Advocacy Case Study Patients Innovation Employees Climate Resilience Materials Stewardship GRI Content Index (102-17)FY 2018 Ethics and Integrity Goals FY 2018 Ethics and Integrity Results Create, publish, and execute annual compliance education plan. Training plan fully implemented. Training completed for the Board of Directors, Audit and Compliance Committee members, high risk employees, and entire workforce (over 60,000 employees). Conduct routine audits for compliance with Dignity Health policies specific to payments to physicians or physician owned entities.Audited more than 1,000 physician payments to determine if the payments were supported by a fully executed contract and that fair market value documentation was maintained by the hospitals consistent with Dignity Health policies. Participate in multi-disciplinary team to identify and document Hospital Acquired Conditions.Continued collaboration with Quality, Coding, and CDI teams to improve identification and documentation of Hospital Acquired Conditions and Patient Safety Indicators. The scope was expanded in FY 2018 to include wound care, tissue, and cardiovascular documentation. Implement and maintain all requirements of the Corporate Integrity Agreement.Successfully completed all Corporate Integrity Agreement obligations as determined by the Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General. FY 2019 and FY 2020 Ethics and Integrity Goals Evaluate compliance oversight at all types of joint ventures and determine if additional structure around compliance oversight within the joint ventures is necessary. Evaluate process for medical record requests to ensure documentation is provided accurately and timely to requesting agency. Create and implement mechanisms to assist new entities in assimilating to Dignity Health's culture of compliance. Within Dignity Health and in compliance with all regulations, develop governance and oversight structure to address data use requests including research. Challenges While FY 2018 was a very successful year for the Dignity Health compliance department there were, of course, challenges. Notably, it was difficult to replace individuals who left the department during the year due to retirement, relocation, or promotional opportunities. Experienced compliance professionals are difficult to find in the market and Dignity Health experienced a number of significant positions vacant during the course of the year. This resulted in a few work plan items being postponed until FY 2019. Communicating Concerns Dignity Health encourages all stakeholders to communicate concerns as they arise. Employees voice concerns and opinions in regular meetings with their supervisors, through the anonymous employee survey, and/or the dedicated hotline. Patients and their families register their concerns in direct conversations with care givers and through anonymous surveys following each care episode. Additionally, the public can communicate with the hospital through the \"Contact Us\" page of the hospital website and through our social media accounts.

Results are used to calculate patient experience rankings comparing hospitals nationally and to develop action plans for improvement. See Patients Employees participate in online surveys twice each year. Results are used to calculate employee engagement and to drive specific plans to address concerns identified. See Employees Community stakeholders in each hospital service area, such as public health officers and other government officials, non-profit organization leaders, and members or representatives of medically underserved, low-income, and minority populations, participate in Community Health Needs Assessments every three years. Identified community health needs are prioritized and form the basis of each hospital's Community Health Implementation Strategy. Ceres, a non-profit organization which promotes investment policies that are environmentally, socially, and financially sound, typically convenes a stake holder group of sustainability experts to review and provide input to our sustainability report. Results are incorporated into the current report prior to publication and/or used to enhance future reports. Recommendations typically include requests for expanded disclosure in specific areas, especially the role of the Board in sustainability, and development of and reporting on rigorous short and long term goals for all sustainability priorities.Stakeholders and Community | In Our CommunitiesTABLE OF CONTENTS CEO Letter About Dignity Health Reporting and Materiality Governance and Leadership Ethics and Integrity Economic Value and Impact Stakeholders and Community Community Partners Stakeholder Engagement In Our Communities Human Trafficking Case Study Advocacy Case Study Patients Innovation Employees Climate Resilience Materials Stewardship GRI Content Index (102-12, 102-44, 203-2, 413-1)In Our Communities Highlight Community Health advanced its focus on addressing the social determinants of health in conjunction with other Dignity Health departments and functional areas, with a wide range of community partners inside and outside of health care, and by using and adapting all of the tools in our program portfolio. Community health is rooted in our mission, notably as an expression of \"serving and advocating for our sisters and brothers who are poor and disenfranchised, and partnering with others in the community to improve the quality of life.\" Community health is an increasingly vital component of Dignity Health's services to improve and maintain health, working ever more closely with population health and care coordination in caring for patients, and also engaging in new ways with community partners on prevention and to address health-related social needs. Additionally, our efforts to prevent and reduce the impact of climate change (detailed in the Climate Resilience section of this report) speak to our dedication to our communities. Climate change will bring to our communities new health challenges, such as an increased number of heat days, different diseases, and more significant and damaging natural disasters. We hope to do our part to minimize these impacts, and adapt to the impacts that do occur. Consistent with changes in health care nationally that focus increasingly on \"value-based care\" and \"accountable care,\" community health initiatives now play a vital role in the care continuum that begins with community-based support and prevention, includes acute care when necessary, and extends back into the community to maintain health and well-being. Community health initiatives contribute to achievement of our Horizon 2020 strategies by improv- ing quality and reducing acute care cost, growing evidence-based prevention programs, engaging with clinical integration and population health, connecting health-related social needs to electronic medical records, and leading with inno- vation in community health and community benefit practices.We achieve this with a strategic portfolio of interventions across a continuum, from addressing community social and economic conditions, to prevention and health education, to direct services delivered by Dignity Health and partner agencies. These initiatives respond to priorities in the hospitals' community health needs assessments, conducted with community stakeholder input: Community Investment Program - Loans made at below-market interest rates for non-profit organizations working to improve health and quality of life. Social Innovation Partnership Grants Program - Funds new models of service delivery and transformative approaches to increase access and improve outcomes. Community Grants Program - Funds collaborating non-profit organizations meeting the significant health needs of vulnerable and underserved populations in our hospitals' local communities. Community Health Improvement Services - Community-based programs to help people prevent illness and regain or maintain health. Connected Community Network - Addresses social determinants of health within the clinical setting, identifying patients' health-related social needs and referring them to networks of Dignity Health and community partner agencies' programs to serve a range of health and social support needs.Stakeholders and Community | In Our Communities - GoalsTABLE OF CONTENTS CEO Letter About Dignity Health Reporting and Materiality Governance and Leadership Ethics and Integrity Economic Value and Impact Stakeholders and Community Community Partners Stakeholder Engagement In Our Communities Human Trafficking Case Study Advocacy Case Study Patients Innovation Employees Climate Resilience Materials Stewardship GRI Content Index (102-12)FY 2018 Community Health Goals FY 2018 Community Health Results Community Health Needs Assessment Streamlining: Innovate to streamline community health needs assessments that will be conducted by all hospitals in FY 2018 - FY 2019.Dignity Health migrated all hospitals to conduct their CHNAs on the same triennial cycle, and introduced indicators and data tools to enhance consistency across our service areas. Community Health Diabetes Self-Management: Expand evidence- based diabetes prevention and self-management programming.Three diabetes prevention and self-management programs were expanded throughout Dignity Health with improved outreach to vulnerable populations. Connected Community Network: Implement innovative technology solution to include social determinants of health network in care coordination.Connected Community Network was implemented in 17 facilities throughout Dignity Health. Social Innovation Partnership Grant Program: Further establish collaborative care networks to reduce readmission and improve chronic disease management for persons who frequently use health services.Social Innovation Partnership Grants (SIPG) promoted cross-sector partnerships to develop and/or extend creative solutions to address prevention, social determinants of health, and health equity across vulnerable patient populations and communities. FY 2019 Community Health Goals Increase access to preventive resources and chronic disease management programs by developing internal and external networks of community resources and enhancing community partnerships. Promote the importance of addressing health-related social needs in traditional and innovative ways to provide holistic care across the continuum for all patients. Align community-based diabetes prevention and self-management programs with our health care services, to provide greater access for patients as well as the broader community. Beyond FY 2020 Goals Community Health advances community-based efforts that address the social, economic, and environmental conditions influencing the health and health equity of vulnerable populations through capacity building, grant giving, investments, innovative partnerships, and collaborative health programs that improve population health. Community Health extends these efforts in our service areas and influences health care systems across the nation and around the world to serve communities with compassion and prioritize the needs of those who are vulnerable.Stakeholders and Community | In Our Communities - ChallengesTABLE OF CONTENTS CEO Letter About Dignity Health Reporting and Materiality Governance and Leadership Ethics and Integrity Economic Value and Impact Stakeholders and Community Community Partners Stakeholder Engagement In Our Communities Human Trafficking Case Study Advocacy Case Study Patients Innovation Employees Climate Resilience Materials Stewardship GRI Content Index (102-12)Challenges The challenges to achieving system-wide community health goals are frequently related to the diversity of and variation among Dignity Health's many hospitals and the communities they serve. Approaches to improving community health must blend system-level standards and support with the flexibility to draw on unique local resources to meet needs. For instance, our hospitals in urban areas typically conduct community health needs assessments in conjunction with several partner hospitals and paid consultants, while those in rural areas may need to take the lead mostly with internal staff support. Flexibility, creativity, and relationships are keys to achieving aligned goals together. How does Dignity Health's performance compare to industry benchmarks in key areas? Community Health is not a functional area with many benchmarks that are widely used throughout the country. Dignity Health is a leading health system in the areas of innovation in aligning community health with population health, and in employing creative solutions to helping address the social determinants of health outside of the care delivery system. Dignity Health is participating in innovative networks of health systems nationally to advance community and population health practice, including: Healthcare Anchor Network of health systems working to improve community health and well-being by leveraging all their assets, including hiring, purchasing, and investment for equitable, local economic impact; Medicaid Transformation Project, a national effort to transform health care and related social needs for the most vulnerable by implementing innovative solutions that address challenges like behavioral health and substance use disorder to improve health for underserved individuals and families. FY 2018 Community Benefit Expense ($ in Thousands) $108,592 Patient Financial Assistance $555,935 Unpaid Costs of Medicaid $13,971 Unpaid Costs of other Means-tested Programs $210,122 Community Health Improvement Services, Health Professions Education, Subsidized Health Services, Other Benefits, and Community BuildingStrengthening Victim Response Program: The PEARR tool was developed to provide guidance for health care personnel in responding to victims of human trafficking. The tool, which was created in partnership with HEAL Trafficking and the Pacific Survivor Center, provides an evidence-based approach. It incorporates the best practice of universal education in a manner that is responsive to a patient's traumatic experiences. National Leadership: Dignity Health provided training and technical assistance to the U.S. Office for Victims of Crime and Department of Health and Human Services. Dignity Health was also invited to participate on an expert panel event hosted by UNICEF-USA and an event hosted by Polaris, which operates the U.S. National Human Trafficking Hotline. Human Trafficking 101: Dispelling the Myths online training module was made available to the public. This module is narrated, includes video clips of survivors, and provides a certificate of completion. This course is being used by a multitude of health care organizations for training their staff on how to identify and treat patients who are victims of human trafficking. Training Other Health Care Systems: Dignity Health hosted its second annual Shared Learnings conference and presented at additional regional and national health care conferences. Dignity Health presented a webinar series in partnership with the American Hospital Association, which included education on human trafficking and a trauma-informed care model for patient care and services. Preventing Labor Trafficking in the Supply Chain: Dignity Health is implementing procedures to work with vendors to prevent the use of forced labor. A standard operating procedure has been created and two training modules on human trafficking in the supply chain are being provided to staff that work with contracting and purchasing. Global Impact: Health care organizations in other countries are requesting guidance from Dignity Health on implementing a victim response program in their area. A team of Dignity Health volunteer physicians and nurses provided training to health care personnel in India regarding trauma-informed care and medical documentation to support victims.Human Trafficking | Case StudyTABLE OF CONTENTS CEO Letter About Dignity Health Reporting and Materiality Governance and Leadership Ethics and Integrity Economic Value and Impact Stakeholders and Community Human Trafficking Case Study Advocacy Case Study Patients Innovation Employees Climate Resilience Materials Stewardship GRI Content Index (412-2)Highlights Provided national leadership in the health care field for human trafficking response through training and mentorship. Expanded the Medical Safe Haven clinic, providing primary care with integrated medical and mental health services to over 140 survivors of human trafficking. TABLE OF CONTENTS CEO Letter About Dignity Health Reporting and Materiality Governance and Leadership Ethics and Integrity Economic Value and Impact Stakeholders and Community Human Trafficking Case Study Advocacy Case Study Patients Innovation Employees Climate Resilience Materials Stewardship GRI Content Index (412-2)As awareness about human trafficking has grown, people from many different fields are stepping forward to do their part in addressing the need. In 2014, Dignity Health took the initiative to be one of the first health systems with a program to respond to victims who come to emergency departments and hospitals. Leaders and staff from across the system are responding to this call with compassion and are assisting victims with kindness and services. As different departments consider their role in the work to address human trafficking, the work has expanded into many new areas. The Human Trafficking Medical Safe Haven was launched in May 2016. Since that time, the team of physicians and medical staff have provided trauma informed, victim-centered care for over 140 survivors of human trafficking. In addition, the clinic is well connected with local agencies and provides ongoing referrals to community resources. A patient who is a survivor of human trafficking is never turned away, even if uninsured. Because of the community collaborative nature of the program, various forms of assistance are available to help create health care access that remains supported and sustainable. Efforts are underway to support the creation of medical safe havens within residency programs throughout Dignity Health, and to provide trauma-informed, victim-centered patient care education for providers. Supply Chain Treating patients who have been victims of human trafficking produces a strong desire to prevent this from happening to others. For labor trafficking cases, one of the primary tools for prevention is to ensure that companies are not contracting for any services or purchasing any products that were produced by forced labor. This is a difficult task to accomplish, as traffickers will often hide the use of forced labor through contracting with larger suppliers. Dignity Health is implementing a number of procedures to work with vendors to prevent the use of forced labor. India Project Dignity Health is responding to requests for consulting across the country as well as internationally. One of the areas of greatest need is in India, where there are more victims of human trafficking than in any other country in the world. Dignity Health is partnering with Indian hospitals and community based organizations, providing training on how to respond to victims in a health care setting and building the capacity of the rural hospitals to provide access to care, thereby preventing health care debt, a major driver of human trafficking. The first volunteer team of two physicians and two nurses went to India in April to provide training for Indian health care professionals on trauma-informed care and how to conduct forensic exams. In addition, several medical residents from the Graduate Medical Education programs plan to participate in a month-long rotation with the rural hospitals in India. In developing standards for this work, we are referencing the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Across all our service areas, we collaborate with government agencies and community based organizations. These groups are the key resources available for responding to the needs of our patients who are victims of human trafficking. Human Trafficking | Case StudyTABLE OF CONTENTS CEO Letter About Dignity Health Reporting and Materiality Governance and Leadership Ethics and Integrity Economic Value and Impact Stakeholders and Community Human Trafficking Case Study Advocacy Case Study Patients Innovation Employees Climate Resilience Materials Stewardship GRI Content Index (201-2)Highlights In FY 2018, Dignity Health remained steadfast in its support for the Paris Climate Agreement and was a leading health care voice in the \"We're Still In\" campaign and a faithful partner and collaborator with various organizations including Health Care Without Harm, Ceres/Business for Innovative Climate and Energy Policy (BICEP), the American Lung Association, and Catholic Climate Covenant. Dignity Health was a Global Green and Health Hospitals (GGHH) 2020 Gold Award recipient for climate leadership. Dignity Health organized and was a key speaker at the Health Care Climate Council's first congressional briefing on health care and climate in Washington, DC to the Offices of the Bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, demonstrating our leadership on mitigation and other climate resilient health care solutions. Dignity Health was featured in the publication, Safe Haven in the Storm: Protecting Lives and Margins with Climate-Smart Health Care. Advocacy | Case StudyTABLE OF CONTENTS CEO Letter About Dignity Health Reporting and Materiality Governance and Leadership Ethics and Integrity Economic Value and Impact Stakeholders and Community Human Trafficking Case Study Advocacy Case Study Patients Innovation Employees Climate Resilience Materials Stewardship GRI Content IndexDignity Health Board of Directors approved the following priorities: Health System Transformation: Transform the delivery of care and improve the health of individuals and populations by promoting a designed delivery system that improves access to compassionate, high-quality, patient-centered care. Fiscal Solvency: Protect Dignity Health's healing ministry by advocating for sustain- able payment models, adequate funding of government programs, and maintaining a balanced regulatory environment to uphold our ability to provide the highest quality of care in each of our communities. Foundational Expectations: Elevate Dignity Health's leadership commitment to justice and the communities we serve by reducing health disparities, improving community well-being, and building common ground to address social and ecological concerns. Advocacy strategies specific to addressing climate change include: Advancing health care's leadership in environmental and sustainability efforts; building awareness regarding the connection between human health, the health of the planet, and its connection to the transformation of health care. Advancing the health care platform on climate change; blocking attempts to roll back efforts to improve clean air and clean water laws; supporting international efforts to implement the Paris Climate Agreement. Supporting initiatives that drive clean energy and the promotion of a low carbon future. Advocacy is an explicit component of the Dignity Health mission and has been a significant expression of the health care ministry's call to serve the poor, vulnerable, and disenfranchised since the organization's founding. Dignity Health recognizes public policy activities have a direct correlation to the viability of its healing mission and the organization's ability to provide critical health services and help improve the overall quality of life in the communities we serve.U.S. health care is in a precarious place. Attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) threaten the health of our communities and call us to immediate action to protect the coverage gained by more than 20 million people, safeguard the Medicaid and Medicare programs that serve our most vulnerable brothers and sisters, and lead on key policies that allow us to reach into communities to strategically advance health equity and address social and environmental determinants of health. At Dignity Health, we are passionate about advocacy. We are health care leaders responsible for advancing transformation. As we work to build the health care system of the future, we are mindful to protect the ecosystem within our hospital walls and outside of it. Stewardship of Earth is integral to our healing mission. We know that the health care voice is vital to addressing the most pressing public health issue of our time: climate change. We believe our voice can cut through the political partisanship and deadlock to com- mand authority, foster awareness, and help build common ground. Earth cannot wait. The health of individuals, communities, and economies hang in the balance. Our health care story has the power to create the change we want to see at home and in the world. We are the voice that connects the dots between disease, such as asthma, and air quality; between super pollutants and the warming of Earth; between people's access to insurance coverage and health care's ability to provide high-quality, patient centered-care to those impacted by extreme weather events; between the cost to the entire global community if nothing is done and the lives protected when we act boldly. In partnering with others, we are supported, and challenged, and we are better able to raise our collective voice for the common good.Advocacy | Case StudyPatientsTABLE OF CONTENTS CEO Letter About Dignity Health Reporting and Materiality Governance and Leadership Ethics and Integrity Economic Value and Impact Stakeholders and Community Human Trafficking Case Study Advocacy Case Study Patients Patient Care, Quality, and Safety Patient Experience Patient Privacy Innovation Employees Climate Resilience Materials Stewardship GRI Content IndexPatients | Care, Quality, and Safety HighlightsTABLE OF CONTENTS CEO Letter About Dignity Health Reporting and Materiality Governance and Leadership Ethics and Integrity Economic Value and Impact Stakeholders and Community Human Trafficking Case Study Advocacy Case Study Patients Patient Care, Quality, and Safety Patient Experience Patient Privacy Innovation Employees Climate Resilience Materials Stewardship GRI Content Index (416-1)Patient Care, Quality, and Safety Highlights Significantly reduced hospital acquired conditions reducing harm to 2,000 patients and contributing $15 million.

We have instituted regular and rigorous training to ensure we safeguard personal health information. However, in a business where nearly every piece of paper associated with a patient is subject to privacy controls, we do have instances of noncompliance. The following represents the number of calendar year patient privacy breaches we have experienced and substantiated through 12/31/18: The vast majority of the breaches we have experienced affected only a single patient per event and were generally the result of misdirected faxes or providing the patient with the incorrect discharge instructions. These types of events are individually investigated and generally corrected with re-education and training. We have had a couple of more significant non-routine events affecting over 500 patients. In one case, a vendor misaligned a mailing list causing individuals to see other patient email addresses and physician names, affecting 53,084 patients. In another case, a business associate was provided patient specific information after its business associate agreement had expired, affecting 6,036 patients. We had a vendor lose two hard drives from lab analyzers, affecting 4,948 patients. We also had an employee snooping in 623 patient records without a business need to do so. Most privacy breaches were identified through the routine compliance monitoring done by Dignity Health or from reports/concerns from patients or their family members. In one case, the Office for Civil Rights investigated a matter that we had not identified internally. In all cases, Dignity Health conducted aggressive investigations, made all appropriate notifications (both to the regulatory bodies and to the patients involved), and implemented corrective actions to minimize the possibility of re-occurrence.

Our innovation practice and our commitment to collaborate/partner with others allows our health system to efficiently test and scale solutions - processes, technologies, services, or a combination of the three - that support our strategic growth and performance targets. Evaluating potential strategic partners on their ability to improve health care delivery and access, as well as on their mission and values alignment, is critical to successful collaborations. We have created an initial set of \"Company Values\" criteria to use in these evaluations. Example metrics include diversity of the company's leadership and workforce, job creation, charitable contributions, and community investments. By including these metrics in our partnership evaluation and performance reports, Dignity Health can influence and support partnerships with companies who are mission aligned and invested in improving the communities we serve.Innovation | GoalsTABLE OF CONTENTS CEO Letter About Dignity Health Reporting and Materiality Governance and Leadership Ethics and Integrity Economic Value and Impact Stakeholders and Community Human Trafficking Case Study Advocacy Case Study Patients Innovation Employees Climate Resilience Materials Stewardship GRI Content Index (102-13)FY 2018 Innovation Goals FY 2018 Innovation Results Complete transportation theme development and system policy, and put ride share partnerships into operations.Dignity Health was able to revise its systemic policies for transportation to include ride share as an option for patients.

The innovation team is working with local operating leaders and hosted a presentation at the recent operations conference illustrating the imperative to respond creatively to external changes and better support community need. As a result, the innovation team continues to work deeper and deeper in the units (digital, IT, physician integration, etc.) that are most likely to be immediately impacted. How does Dignity Health's performance compare to industry benchmarks in key areas? Dignity Health continues to be considered one of the leaders in innovation by various stakeholders across health care including other health systems. Our focus to truly scale three to five innovations across our health system annually sets us apart from the status quo, including how we bring innovation to all patients and payer mixes.EmployeesTABLE OF CONTENTS CEO Letter About Dignity Health Reporting and Materiality Governance and Leadership Ethics and Integrity Economic Value and Impact Stakeholders and Community Human Trafficking Case Study Advocacy Case Study Patients Innovation Employees Climate Resilience Materials Stewardship GRI Content IndexEmployees | HighlightsTABLE OF CONTENTS CEO Letter About Dignity Health Reporting and Materiality Governance and Leadership Ethics and Integrity Economic Value and Impact Stakeholders and Community Human Trafficking Case Study Advocacy Case Study Patients Innovation Employees Climate Resilience Materials Stewardship GRI Content Index (102-8)Employee Highlights Achieved five years of increased employee engagement scores as well as an all-time high in employee participation in our annual Employee Experience Survey. 76 percent of the engagement questions were answered favorably in the 2018 survey, which puts Dignity Health at the 66th percentile of engagement from our survey vendor's health care benchmark. Reduced our carbon footprint with the implementation of a new onboarding (preboarding) software. Specifically, we reduced from 150+ unique documents to 10 by moving the process online. This reflects a savings of over 43,000 sheets of paper, or 5.17 trees last year. Dignity Health recognizes the undeniable link between the care our patients receive and how employees feel about their jobs and their ability to contribute to our healing ministry. Consistent with our values and goals, we are committed to creating a positive environment for our patients and our employees, 58 percent of whom are represented by a range of unions. Our people drive the delivery of our mission and its promise of humankindness. When we create a positive employee experience, our employees can more fully devote themselves to that mission and to our patients. When we foster an environment of employee engagement, we become a better organization by drawing inspiration from the best ideas, skills, and people.

Engagement and retention: Benefits cost sharing with employees that began in 2018 as well as continued focus on cost reductions in operations were challenges for our workforce this year. Diversity and inclusion: The leaders who volunteer their time on the DIBs Council are doing this work because of their passion to create a more inclusive culture for our employees. Personal capacity is an issue for most of the team. Focused work in this area needs to consider other competing initiatives so that we don't create unintended consequences as we move through the implementation for a system wide program. Wage equity: With standard structures now in place in all service areas, we are better able to focus on and refine our approach to proactively monitor our pay practices for wage equity across all populations. Health, safety, and wellness: We continued to implement medical benefit plans that support our strategy of re-directing employees to Dignity Health providers for their health care while at the same time are financially sustainable and provide employees with valuable benefits packages. Labor Relations: While CNA represented nurses, a half dozen other unions, and Dignity Health's non-represented employees are either currently contributing towards dependent health care coverage or soon will be, we were not able to reach a similar agreement with the 15,000-member SEIU-UHW. We will revisit this issue with them in the future and will continue to pursue this objective with the remaining four to five unions in FY 2019.Employees | Goals - BenchmarksTABLE OF CONTENTS CEO Letter About Dignity Health Reporting and Materiality Governance and Leadership Ethics and Integrity Economic Value and Impact Stakeholders and Community Human Trafficking Case Study Advocacy Case Study Patients Innovation Employees Climate Resilience Materials Stewardship GRI Content Index (102-8, 405-2)How does Dignity Health's performance compare to industry benchmarks in key areas?

Workplace Violence awareness and training to employees system wide, and technology to track events. System wide efforts to improve employee health and safety and injury prevention are key components of the Dignity Health workers' compensation program. Facilities are committed to improving workplace safety and injury rate results. During FY 2018, each facility was tasked to implement and develop safety promotion programs and conduct safety walk-arounds, as well as develop safety initiatives to reduce the frequency of employee injuries. The health care environment presents increasing challenges in terms of safe patient handling. Collaborative efforts on the safe patient handling program integrates a hospital culture of safety and fully links patient safety with worker safety, as well as reporting workplace violence against hospital employees. The implementation of the Safe Patient Handling & Mobility Program provides greater focus on the safe care of patients and safe practices of our valued caregivers while performing direct patient care. An improved reporting system, standardized policy, and electronic learning program in MyJourney provide the necessary tools to support training to employees. In addition, the Bedside Mobility Tool (BMAT) was implemented in Cerner to assess if patient lift equipment or devices are needed. An elevated Workplace Violence Tier training was developed and assigned to staff about the implementation of the workplace violence event reporting system. Since FY 2003, the program has reduced the system wide indemnity injury rate of 4.76 per 100 FTE to 1.286 per 100 FTE in FY 2018.

Both plants are located in Nevada - 2.1 MW at St. Rose Dominican - San Martin in Las Vegas and 1.7 MW at St. Rose Dominican - Siena in Henderson. Increased the use of renewable electricity to 35 percent, which translates to 16 percent of total energy consumed (electricity + natural gas). Midway through the installation of Light Emitting Diode (LED) lamps in the interior spaces at all of our hospitals to replace fluorescent lamps. The project is currently resulting in 5 - 14 percent annual savings per hospital. The most pressing global health threat of our time is climate change. It not only has severe and detrimental impacts on human health and the natural world that sustains life, but also threatens the delivery and sustainability of health care. Energy production and use account for two thirds of the world's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The health care industry is among the major energy consumers in any given region. U.S. health care buildings constitute the second most energy-intensive U.S. building sector (consuming energy at an average of twice the intensity of commercial office buildings). These buildings operate continuously, 365 days per year, with multiple back-up and redundant mechanical and electrical systems, and they only increase in energy intensity as medical diagnostic equipment with large heat loads continue to enter the marketplace. Dignity Health is committed to reducing the impacts of climate change and improving the resilience of the communities we serve. We are taking steps to build and operate our buildings in a way that promotes the health of our patients, employees, and communities. Energy reduction strategies include lighting upgrades, retro-commissioning, continuous commissioning, new building automation systems, variable frequency drives, boiler and central plant chiller replacements, and installation of solar plants. We also are planning on installing solar parking and fuel cells as soon as the Time-of-Use and accompanying new rate structures for Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) and Southern California Edison (SCE) are settled with the California Public Utilities Commission so we can perform accurate economic analyses.Climate Resilience | Energy and Water GoalsTABLE OF CONTENTS CEO Letter About Dignity Health Reporting and Materiality Governance and Leadership Ethics and Integrity Economic Value and Impact Stakeholders and Community Human Trafficking Case Study Advocacy Case Study Patients Innovation Employees Climate Resilience Energy Water Materials Stewardship GRI Content Index (302-1, 302-3, 302-4, Energy and 2017 Energy and Water Results Energy Efficiency: 2.2% reduction from CY 2016 1% Energy Reduction in CY 2017.

This should ensure we meet all our Horizon 2020 Goals with the exception of reducing water by 20%. We will persist in reducing water beyond 2020. Beyond FY 2020 Energy and Water Goals Our biggest concern is the reduction of water usage. That is why we are getting the infrastructure in place to monitor water usage from irrigation and cooling towers. The Governor of the State of California issued an Executive Order two years ago asking Californians to reduce their water usage by 35 percent. After yet another dry winter, Dignity Health sees water as becoming a bigger issue in everyone's efforts to reduce utility usage, with water costs potentially surpassing energy costs at some point.Climate Resilience | EnergyTABLE OF CONTENTS CEO Letter About Dignity Health Reporting and Materiality Governance and Leadership Ethics and Integrity Economic Value and Impact Stakeholders and Community Human Trafficking Case Study Advocacy Case Study Patients Innovation Employees Climate Resilience Energy Water Materials Stewardship GRI Content Index (302-3, 305-1, 305-5)Energy In 2017, we engaged in a lot of \"set up\" work, where we did our homework by implementing traditional retro-commissioning studies, worked intensively with IT to figure out how to deploy continuous commissioning, and got contracting together for dozens of LED lamp installations at numerous hospitals. All of this was in preparation to begin execution in CY 2018 to begin realizing the fruits of our labor in late CY 2018, and in CY 2019 fully. Hence, although we did not meet all the CY 2017 goals set, we finished the groundwork necessary to install energy and water effi- cient measures in CY 2018 and CY 2019.

Energy efficiency: 23 of our 37 acute care hospitals are within 10 percent of the CY 2017 energy usage of our Practice Greenhealth (PGH) peers, which is a negative trend compared to CY 2016 when 28 of our hospitals exceeded Practice Greenhealth peers. As a result, we are building in mandatory low energy use indices (kBtu/sf/yr <= 165) in our new construction contracts, so new hospital construction will be much more energy efficient and all our other projects mentioned in Section 2 should have a very positive impact in CY 2019 and forward. Dignity Health reports to The Climate Registry annually. In CY 2017 the total Scope 1 emissions were 98,372 metric tonnes of CO2e (MT = metric tonnes) for all 37 hospitals. Scope 2 reported emissions were 137,426 MTCO2e, and 1,932 MTCO2e for biomass emissions. The total MTCO2e emissions were 237,730 MTCO2e. Renewable energy sources: Based on the 2017 Practice Greenhealth Benchmark Report, only 48 percent of all PGH hospitals reported using some form of renewable power. 100 percent of Dignity Health hospitals are using renewables in their utility mix or alternatives such as co-generation and landfill gas. In CY 2017, 16 percent of energy consumed by Dignity Health came from renewable sources. This will increase in CY 2019 as soon as the 2.1 and 1.7 MW solar plants come online. Dignity Health is a winner of the 2020 Challenge Climate Champion Awards. The 2020 Health Care Climate Challenge is a Global Green and Healthy Hospitals (GGHH) initiative to mobilize health care institutions around the globe to protect public health from climate change. Our awards include: SILVER - GHG Reduction (Energy) SILVER - Renewable Energy GOLD - Climate Resiliency GOLD - Climate Leadership Water consumption and efficiency: 26 of our 37 acute care hospitals (70 percent) are using more than 62 gal/sf/yr more water than our Practice Greenhealth peers. Twelve acute care hospitals are using less water than our Practice Greenhealth peers.

Planted 1,398 trees in collaboration with the Stryker program \"Pulse Ox for the Planet.\" Established human trafficking Standard of Practice for Supply and Services Resource Management. Healing is at the heart of what we do at Dignity Health. A core component of the healing process is the products and services that help to make the process as fast and safe as possible. We seek to use the most efficient and cost-effective materials and supplies available that will keep our patients and communities healthy. By paying close attention to our purchases on the front end, we can pay less attention to the impacts of those materials once they are released to the environment and people are exposed to them. Our purchasing decisions contribute to our Horizon 2020 cost and quality goals and connect us to our all our core values but especially stewardship \u2014cultivating the resources entrusted to us to promote healing and wholeness. Dignity Health's supply chain engages over 19,000 vendors across the United States and the world. These vendors provide both medical and non-medical supplies and services. Our overall spend is approximately $4 billion. The majority of our suppliers, old and new, are screened for environmental criteria during RF(x) processes. We are communicating our commitment to the elimination of human trafficking by implement- ing a human trafficking education program for staff, a screening process for vendors, and adding language to our vendor contracts that address the problem.Materials stewardship is the driving force behind our participation in such initiatives as the Chemical Footprint Project, which measures corporate progress toward safer chemicals and overall chemicals management performance and the Greenhealth Exchange, which aims to accelerate the development and adoption of new and more environmentally-friendly products. It underlies our efforts to integrate the concept of environmentally preferable purchasing into our sourcing strategy. It inspired us to implement Key Green Solutions, a comprehensive third party data management and reporting system, to ensure that high quality energy, water, food, chemical, and waste data is collected, used, and reported for decision making. Dignity Health will continue to integrate sustainability into our procurement strategies and to explore opportunities for further growth and innovation.

For instance, while participation in the sterilization wrap recycling program is increasing, it is a challenge to ensure that no contaminated products are collected. Tracking the sustainability performance of supply chain over time in a manner that can be communicated to internal and external audiences remains a challenge. While implementing the Chemical Footprint survey, it is often difficult to find the appropriate contact within the supplier company to initiate the survey. Often, vendors don't respond because they may not know how and/or may not know the answers to questions addressed in the survey. It is also an ongoing challenge to ensure that suppliers are in full compliance with the required legal, environmental, and social standards. How does Dignity Health's performance compare to industry benchmarks in key areas? We are a proud leader in the movement toward added transparency regarding safer chemicals. We're committed to working with our vendor partners to explore newer, safer alternatives to chemicals in health care and to share the improved impacts on our patients, their families, and our communities. We are an active member in this community through Practice Greenhealth, Health Care Without Harm, Greenhealth Exchange, and the Chemical Footprint Project. Additionally, using the Key Green Solutions purchasing module has allowed Supply and Services Resource Management (SSRM) to benchmark Dignity Health against industry standards to uncover opportunities for more sustainable purchasing practices.Materials Stewardship | Waste - GoalsTABLE OF CONTENTS CEO Letter About Dignity Health Reporting and Materiality Governance and Leadership Ethics and Integrity Economic Value and Impact Stakeholders and Community Human Trafficking Case Study Advocacy Case Study Patients Innovation Employees Climate Resilience Materials Stewardship Purchasing Waste GRI Content Index (306-2)Materials Stewardship - Waste Highlights Became an early adopter of the Small Change, Big Impact program launched by NewGen Surgical manufacturer of medical devices that are able to decompose, free of toxic chemicals, and use less energy for production. Coming in at the Pioneer Level, reserved for early adopters of sustainable products in the OR, we aim to reduce the plastic waste generated in that department. Some sites ensure that fresh produce is delivered in RPC's (recycled plastic containers) in place of single-use cardboard boxes in order to reduce cardboard waste, improve inventory control and organization, and simplify produce rotation. FY 2018 Waste Goals FY 2018 Waste Results Reduce total waste to as far below the industry average (42 lbs./APD) as practical. Total waste volume averaged 28.5 lbs./APD.

For example, a few of our largest facilities are located in Nevada and Arizona, where the recycling infrastructure is not as robust as it is in California, resulting in lower recycling rates than we would prefer in those facilities. Even in California, turmoil in global recycling markets, due in part to decisions made by the Chinese government, have greatly disrupted the attractiveness and pricing for the purchase of recycled materials, thus making recycling much more difficult. Dignity Health is supportive of the efforts being made by the State of California to create more local markets for recycled materials and to reduce the need for shipping recycled materials overseas. In FY 2018 Dignity Health was able to reduce the amount of solid waste we generated to 24,115.6 tons as compared to 24,488.1 tons the year before. We were also able to reduce the amount of waste we generated per adjusted patient day (our measure of efficiency adjusted for workload) to 28.5#/ADP from 30.1#/APD. However, as noted above, we have faced challenge with recycling, resulting in our percentage of recycling compared to our total waste dropping to 32.3% from 34.3% last year. How does Dignity Health's performance compare to industry benchmarks in key areas? We are a proud leader in the movement toward added transparency regarding safer chemicals.
