If there's anything [unusual about](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01587-1) the current monkeypox outbreak \u2014 now [over 1500 cases](https://www.monkeypoxtracker.net/) in more than 30 countries \u2014 it's its diverse yet limited spread worldwide. This had [never happened before](/microbial-instincts/this-monkeypox-outbreak-is-different-than-the-ones-we-ve-seen-before-b27607bf3a20?sk=7030d0258aa534db2ea7b0e71992e7d4), ever since monkeypox was discovered and known to be endemic in Africa only. This phenomenon is most likely due to virus evolution, where the monkeypox virus has gained mutations that enable it to adapt to the human population more efficiently. Most of us know that we have effective vaccines against monkeypox. But not many know that such vaccine effectiveness data came from the late 1900s. And now, barely anyone knows how effective those vaccines are against the 2022 monkeypox virus. The questionable vaccine effectiveness Some countries \u2014 notably, the U.K., the U.S., and Canada \u2014 have started vaccinating against monkeypox via a strategy called ring vaccination, where smallpox vaccines are offered to infected people and people exposed to monkeypox through close contact with an infected person. We have two types of licensed smallpox vaccines that are thought to be effective against monkeypox \u2014 Imvanex/Jynneos and ACAM2000. [Imvanex/Jynneos](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/imvanex) is a third-generation vaccine that uses the non-replicating vaccinia virus \u2014 a type of poxviruses like smallpox and monkeypox \u2014 to induce immunity. Whereas [ACAM2000](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/acam2000) is a second-generation vaccine that uses live replicating but weakened vaccinia virus to induce immunity. As ACAM2000 uses a live replicating virus, it can cause side effects, [especially to](https://theconversation.com/monkeypox-we-have-vaccines-and-drugs-to-treat-it-183686) pregnant or breastfeeding women and immunocompromised patients like those with HIV/AIDS. Imvanex/Jynneous \u2014 which uses non-replicating viruses \u2014 doesn't have such concerns and, thus, is the safer choice. "}
