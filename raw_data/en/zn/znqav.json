We have made the decision to require U.S.-based colleagues to be fully vaccinated as a condition of employment. We will assess all requests for religious, medical or any other accommodation required by state or local law on a case by case basis. Understanding that there are a range of views about vaccine mandates, this decision was made with careful consideration and analysis, but it came down to two key factors: First, as the U.S. government is a large and important client of Citi, we have an obligation to comply with the Executive Order issued by the White House mandating that individuals supporting government contracts be fully vaccinated \u2014 an order that would impact the vast majority of our U.S. colleagues. Second, having a vaccinated workforce enables us to ensure the health and safety of our colleagues as we return to the office in the U.S. Our people are our most important asset, and we will do all we can to help our colleagues comply with this new requirement. We've been through a lot, and we are proud of how we've all come together to support each other. Why don't companies such as citi stand up for their employees? You state that the government is such a huge customer of yours and therefore you must comply. Don't you realize what you are doing? Can't you stand on principle? Don't you see the bigger picture here and the fact that we are losing our country, our liberties? This is not about a vaccine, this is about control! Citi should use their influence and power to stand up to the government and protect its employees against any mandates but instead they cave, agree and walk away with their tail between their legs. Use your leverage to stop this insanity. Shame on you for being so spineless and catering to the violation of our Constitution! Smh Several questions... 1) Regarding justification #1 \"obligation to comply...mandating individuals supporting government contracts be fully vaccinated:\" Why is Citi's vaccine requirement solely for \"U.S.-based colleagues\" given the executive order mandates vaccines for all federal employees and contractors, without any reference to the geographic location of said employees and contractors? 2) Regarding justification #2 \"to ensure the health and safety of our colleagues:\" If \"health and safety\" is the second most significant justification for the vaccine mandate, why isn't Citi applying the mandate to all employees regardless of geographic location? Additionally, if Citi's concern for \"the health and safety of [their] colleagues\" has become a fundamental component of their hiring process to the point of excluding candidates who are not vaccinated against a single virus, what other mandates are being put in place to ensure a healthy workforce? I wish there was a \"thumbs down\" option. I am not against vaccines, but as an immigrant from the communist Soviet Union, my family came to the US for freedom. Freedom of religion, job, healthcare, freedom in general. In the Soviet Union, Gov't told you where to work, what to buy, where you will live, etc. Citi employs over 200K people in the US. I empathize with all employees who will sacrifice their freedom in fear of loosing their job or those that will loose their job. This is shameful! This is the complete opposite of freedom!! COVID-19 Vaccination and Testing ETS [https://www.osha.gov/coronavirus/ets2](https://www.osha.gov/coronavirus/ets2?trk=public_post_comment-text) So Citi continues to hire and offer WFH positions. Why should people who work at home be required to get vaccinated? Do you require them to get tested weekly? Do they have to take time off if they're sick? What if they work from home in a state that doesn't support mandates? Why would any employer want to step into this no-win mess? Are you weighing your employees weekly, and establishing BMI mandates given the additional risks of obesity in both catching and extending contagious periods by weeks, and being the biggest predictor of lifetime healthcare costs? And studies even show obesity is contagious as a peer group social influence. Are you \"in it together\" on that? Where does the line get drawn and why? Should we force normal BMI people to exercise extra because overweight and obese people aren't doing it for themselves? Makes about as much sense. You know that's illegal, right? Ok, before someone judges me, I'm not an Anti-Vax person and I've also received the vaccine. Last year in March 2020, I was sick with COVID and contracted the virus two times afterwards again while one was after I received the vaccine. So please don't fall into this misconception that you cannot contract it again. You can still contract it again and spread it to other folks. The difference is that your body has developed the immunities needed to fight off the virus. When I was in the service, I was mandated to receive various vaccines which was ok to me deeming what we are and it being a federal agency. Now I have different opinions on private entities such as CITI. Just because the government is your biggest customer does not need to be a \"Yes Man\" in this situation without question. I understand protecting the public health is a concern, but I wonder if mandating the vaccine to its employees is what they truly believe? I have some doubt in it. Stand up for something. In the private sector, I still believe it's a personal choice to get the vaccine, but of course such decisions does not come without consequences. I was always proud of Citi being progressive and advanced, but that decision should be left in hands of an individual. What will now happen to 30-40% of unvaccinated employees, are we ready to let our talent go for the sake of vaccine? They really care about their employees?? My wife has worked for Citi for I believe 17 years. The last 8 years 100% remote, never stepping foot in the office. She has worked 10 to 12 hours a day 6 and seven days a week for The better part of 4 plus years. I LOVE my wife very much and am not convinced the vaccine is safe. She will be unemployed January 14th thanks to this mandate and Citi's decision. I am disabled due to a stroke I experienced in 2019. So we will have no income after January. How is this "}
