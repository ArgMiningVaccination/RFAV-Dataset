The negative effects of social media on mental health include mood swings, low self-esteem, stress, anxiety, depression, fear of missing out (FOMO), feeling of loneliness, etc. Digital media addiction can also lead to an unhealthy sleep schedule, decreased physical activity, poor performance at school, work, and other everyday tasks, poor memory, and many other issues that lower the quality of life. Even if you think you don't spend too much time on social media or watching TV, it is still a good idea to do a digital detox every once in a while. Research has shown that the use of social media is closely linked to stress. And if you are suffering from depression or anxiety, social media will make things worse without you knowing. It's time to ditch social media for a while when you see that the content people post there makes you feel negative emotions, including aggression, envy, and sadness. Another negative effect of social media is when it makes us feel incomplete as a result of seeing the 'perfect' life of other people on the internet. Other signs that you need a digital detox are when you feel the need to check your phone at any moment and it distracts you from doing your daily tasks. Or, when you start to care too much about the number of likes or followers. "}
