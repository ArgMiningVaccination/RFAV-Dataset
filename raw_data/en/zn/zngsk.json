Our board-certified and licensed practitioners have unique skills and areas of expertise, which enable us to give our clients specialized care to meet their individual needs. Services - Acupuncture - This technique applies ultra-fine needles painlessly to the body in order to balance the nervous system, reduce tension and alleviate pain. This 5,000-year-old healing practice has been shown to effectively treat such diverse symptoms and conditions as pain, digestive problems, respiratory disorders, anxiety, depression, headaches and migraines. Acupuncture can also greatly ease side effects from cancer treatments, such as fatigue and nausea. - Art Therapy - This service involves the use of art materials and art-making as a vehicle of expression, coping, and the fostering of self-awareness and self-reflection. Common goals of art therapy include decreasing stress, anxiety and pain. - Chiropractic - This is a health profession that specializes in the evaluation and adjustment of your body's structural, spinal and neurological systems and their effect on your overall health. - Guided Imagery - Guided imagery, also known as visualization, is a gentle but powerful technique used in meditation to focus and direct the imagination. Specifically, it involves focusing one's attention on a relaxing image, such as a sunset or a flowing waterfall. Studies have shown that by using guided imagery, people can lower their anxiety levels during stressful times, reduce their heart rate, blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and even decrease morphine use for pain after surgery. - Integrative Medicine Consultation - During an integrative medicine consultation, the provider will create a health plan to address lifestyle, nutrition, sleep hygiene and stress management issues. It will also take into account patient goals, symptoms and circumstances. A patient might be referred to other UH Connor Whole Health providers or UH health care professionals to achieve optimal health and healing. During follow ups, the IM provider will help each patient establish and maintain healthier lifestyle habits. - Massage Therapy - In massage therapy, applying pressure to soft tissue creates a release of muscle tension while increasing the flow of blood and lymphatic fluid to the area. This provides therapeutic benefits, such as the easing of tightness and pain creating a deep sense of relaxation. - Meditation - Meditation can be defined as a set of techniques that help cultivate a heightened state of awareness and focused attention. There are many types of meditation and it has been practiced in cultures all over the world for thousands of years. A common myth is that meditation is used for religious purposes only. While religious connotations can be attached to it, meditation can be practiced in a purely secular manner. Meditation has demonstrated effectiveness for conditions such as anxiety, pain, stress, depression, insomnia and in alleviating some symptoms of chronic illness. - Mindfulness - Mindfulness is the basic human ability to be fully present, aware of where we are and what we're doing, and not overly reactive or overwhelmed by what's going on around us. Thirty-five years of research have shown that practicing mindfulness can result in reduced stress, decreased anxiety, reduced blood pressure, improved attention, minimized pain sensitivity, and improved emotion regulation. Given these benefits, large corporations like Google, General Mills and Aetna offer mindfulness programs for their employees. - Music Therapy - As decades of research have shown, music possesses immense healing value. As such, music therapy is used to reduce pain, anxiety and extreme tension. Our music therapists, who have advanced degrees combined with strong musical skills, help people re-capture speaking skills (if they have had a stroke, for example), as well as provide uplifting moments for emotional and physical relief. - Pediatric Integrative Health - Pediatric integrative medicine combines conventional pediatric medicine practices with holistic healing methods. Our pediatric integrative medicine provider will evaluate each child and work with families to develop a personalized treatment plan. This may include changes to diet, exercise and lifestyle habits as well as holistic treatment options to improve your child's well-being. - Stress Management and Resilience Training (S.M.A.R.T.) - UH Connor Whole Health's S.M.A.R.T. program teaches individuals how to be smarter about managing stress in their lives in order to reduce the negative impact stress can have on a person's health. The S.M.A.R.T. program focuses on developing techniques to minimize the physiological and emotional effects of stress. Our eight-week interactive series is led by experienced stress management experts who provide strategies for self-care and practical tools to help build stress resilience. Conditions We Treat: The physiological and emotional effects of stress - Yoga - The physical stretching and the holding of yoga poses is combined with breath work and relaxation techniques. It goes beyond physical fitness, and into the realm of healing both the body and mind. Yoga works by increasing body awareness while also increasing flexibility and strength.
