It is recommended that the multiple deprivation measure should only form one part of any targeting strategy. Key factors influencing the number of areas eligibl e for certain government funding programmes include; the cost of each individual intervention and the p otential for economies of scale whether the policy requires concentration of resou rces in the most deprived areas or the spreading of resources more w idely whether a particular demographic of the population is being targeted potential complementarities/substitution effects w ith existing programmes in the area the geographical level at which the programme is d elivered (as discussed in 'Using Area Based Measures'). If the NIMDM 2010 or component domains are included as a factor in the decision making process it should be recognised tha t the measures are relative measures, ordering areas from the most to the least deprived. As such, a single definitive point does not exist at which a ll areas that are more deprived can be classed as deprived and all ar eas that are less deprived are classed as not deprived . If this were the case such a point would form a natural cut-off point for eligibility criteria. Furthermore as differences in the level of deprivation between are as with consecutive ranks is often small, it is likely that the difference between the level of deprivation in the least deprived area that meets the eligibili ty criteria and the most deprived area that does not will be marginal . When assigning a threshold for eligibility criteria however it is necessary to define such a point where all areas that are more d eprived will receive funding while those that are less deprived do not. The graphs below show the distribution of income an d employment deprivation according to the Income and Employment Deprivation Domains 2010. The graphs are intended to illustrate the con tinuous nature of the distribution of deprivation. i.e. it is not that 25 % of areas in Northern Ireland contain an entirely deprived population while the r emaining 75% of areas contain populations that do not experience deprivat ion. Specifically in Graph 1 the 890 Super Output Areas (SOAs) are ordered from most to least deprived (horizontal axis) and their corresponding level of income deprivation (the proportion of the total pop ulation in an area that are income deprived) is plotted along the vertical axis . Graph 2 shows the 890 Super Output Areas (SOAs) ord ered from most to least deprived (horizontal axis) and their correspo nding level of employment deprivation (the proportion of the working age popu lation in an area that are employment deprived) is plotted along the vertical axis. Graph 1 - Income Deprivation % Population Income Deprived by SOA 0.00 0.10 0.20 0.30 0.40 0.50 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.90 1.00 0 89 178 267 356 445 534 623 712 801 890 SOA % Population Income Deprived Graph 2 - Employment Deprivation % Working Age Population Employment Deprived by SOA 0.00 0.10 0.20 0.30 0.40 0.50 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.90 1.00 0 89 178 267 356 445 534 623 712 801 890 SOA % W. A. Population Employment Deprived The graphs show relatively small differences betwee n the levels of deprivation for the vast majority of areas with consecutive ran ks, characterised by the lack of large steps in the distribution when ordered fro m most to least deprived area. In fact the difference in the level of depriv ation (the percentage of the relevant population experiencing income or employme nt deprivation) between any two areas with consecutive ranks is often less than 1 percentage point. Both graphs can be interpreted as showing at least three groups; Group 1 - A group containing a relatively small num ber of areas experiencing relatively high levels of deprivation, within which levels of deprivation vary. Group 2 - A large group of areas experiencing moder ate levels of deprivation within which deprivation levels do not vary greatly . Group 3 - A group containing a small number of area s experiencing relatively low levels of deprivation, within which levels of d eprivation vary. For example: % Population Income Deprived by SOA 0.00 0.10 0.20 0.30 0.40 0.50 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.90 1.00 0 89 178 267 356 445 534 623 712 801 890 SOA % Population Income Deprived It is assumed that a programme seeks to target the most deprived areas; either all or part of Group 1. A single cut-off point is not evident between the h ypothesised groups in both the Income and Employment Deprivation Domains, alth ough the break between Group 1 and Group 2 lies within the most de prived 15% of areas in both domains. It should be noted that even within the most depriv ed group of areas, the levels of deprivation vary grea tly. Consideration should be given to varying the levels of government intervention accordingly . As a single cut - off point is not evident from the Income and Employment Domains it follows that a single point does not exi st when the domains are combined to form the Multiple Deprivation Measure. It is however Group 1 Group 2 Group 3 recommended that funding is focussed within the 15% most deprived areas to ensure the most deprived areas receive funding. Key points NIMDM should not be used in isolation when determi ning eligibility criteria for the allocation of funding. A single point along the deprivation distribution does not exist at which all areas experiencing more deprivation are classed as deprived and areas experiencing less deprivation are not. It is likely that the difference between the level of deprivation in the least deprived area that meets the eligibility crit eria and the most deprived area that does not will be marginal. Relatively few areas experience the highest levels of deprivation. Therefore within a group of areas eligible for fund ing, the levels of deprivation are likely to vary greatly and varying levels of government intervention may be required. Case Study - Defining Neighbourhood Renewal Areas The Neighbourhood Renewal Strategy focuses urban re generation programmes in the most deprived urban areas in Nort hern Ireland. The most deprived urban areas were defined by firstly identi fying the 10% most deprived urban Electoral Wards as per the NIMD 2001 as well as the most deprived Enumeration Districts as per the Economic Deprivation Measure that were outside the most deprived wards. Further consu ltation took place with community representatives to form Neighbourhood Ren ewal Areas taking the results of the NIMD 2001 and the locations of commu nities and neighbourhoods into account.
