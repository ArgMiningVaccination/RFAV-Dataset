Participants can begin any time and work at their own pace. Every month you will receive a new lesson including content towards understanding the inner development path and how to utilise the various methods of self-assessment to gauge for yourself where you are in this work and what you may need. There will be practical exercises suggested each month, so you can have direct experience as well as the opportunity to reflect on how the content resounds for you. This will help to deepen your individual insight into the inner schooling with which it would be most useful for you to engage. It will help you to orientate towards putting the time, energy, and attention you have in the most fruitful direction.
