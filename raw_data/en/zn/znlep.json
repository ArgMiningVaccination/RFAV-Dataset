At HMI we understand the importance of teaching you information that actually works. That's why our entire course program is based on 50 years of nutrition science concluding that plant based diets prevent the diseases that are responsible for almost all illness in our modern world: diabetes, heart disease and cancer. At HMI Nutrition you will become a highly qualified plant based health coach after 8 months of devoting your studies to plant based nutrition. You will receive extensive training throughout HMI's 26 in-depth Modules on everything from understanding liver health, detoxification, how the body processes nutrients, micronutrients and macronutrients, adrenal and hormone health, supporting the musculoskeletal system, nutrition through the life stages from birth through old age, and what the nutrition requirements are at each stage. With the mass confusion in the world of nutrition today people are looking for someone who has in-depth knowledge, and they get it with an HMI practitioner. Our program has graduated many students who were already Medical Doctors, Pharmacists, Registered Dieticians, nutritionists, bodybuilders, professional athletes and health coaches, who came to HMI AFTER their prior education, seeking the level of deeper knowledge that truly enabled them to change lives. - Dr. Roxanne Smith I am Roxanne Smith, a Board-certified Medical Doctor trained in allopathic medicine, and I am also a Holistic Health & Wellness Coach. I have been searching for optimal health for as long as I can remember. It is what led me to pursue a career in Medicine. The truth is that I did not understand how to feed my body so that I could THRIVE, not just survive. And my medical degree did not give me an in-depth education in nutrition. I was taught to deal with the body's symptoms by treating them with medication, rather than looking at that symptom as a message from the body that something deeper needed to be healed. Making the choice to study at HMI Nutrition School is what finally gave me what I was searching for: the science, the education, the practices and protocols to make the changes to my life that actually heal and support the body for optimal health. A blueprint for preventive optimal health... - Angie Bernreuter, RN, BSN, HMI Health Coach, Juice Shop Owner I found Liana Shanti in 2013 and was so grateful to be a part of the launch of her 66 Day Health Mastery Program! It literally saved my life. Within the first week of my very first cleanse, I knew I found what I needed. I never again looked for another health program, fad diet or teacher because my health improved so drastically in such a short time. When you know you know! Liana Shanti's 66 Day Health Mastery Program taught me how to heal my lifelong, debilitating IBS and migraines, acid reflux, diabetes, high blood pressure, PCOS, psoriasis, anxiety, extreme exhaustion, etc. I no longer take any medications (I was on 6-8 medications) and feel better at 43 than I did at 23... - Torre Washington, IFBB Pro I have always wanted to increase my knowledge and expertise with Plantbased/vegan nutrition. With HMI Nutrition School my desires have come to fruition and I feel like all coaches and trainers within the fitness community should go through this program as a way to be well rounded. - Allison Pangilinan, HMI Health Coach, previously attended IIN Believe it or not, I enrolled at HMI while I was four months into the Institute of Integrative Nutrition's (IIN) Health Coach Training Program and three months into IIN's Gut Health Program. After a colonic wreaked havoc on my digestive system, I was looking for a solution that I couldn't find with the education that I received at IIN. While IIN touches upon over 100 dietary theories, HMI teaches the best nutritional approach is based on 50 years of scientific research-a whole foods, plant-based diet. My IIN classmates were blown away with the practical and valuable HMI information that I learned... - Inna Revina, HMI Health Coach, Vegan Chef, previously attended IIN HMI Nutrition School is beyond amazing! The in-depth, scientific, and well-researched information you get from it is priceless. HMI education is like a missing piece of puzzle I've been looking for. I switched to a plant-based \"diet\" in 2010. Later I encountered some pitfalls like B12 deficiency and I was looking for more education. I became a health coach by the Institute for Integrative Nutrition. It helped me to broaden my knowledge on nutrition in general. However, I still had so many questions. Especially on all the rising \"healthy\" fad diets like keto, the apple cider vinegar miracles, sea moss, collagen etc. The overwhelming sea of information out there was confusing. When I found HMI it brought me so much clarity! Once I became a student of HMI I realized I didn't know that much from my prior education... - Dana M Quarles, DO, HMI Health Coach I completed medical school and a residency in Obstetrics and Gynecology then worked for several years in a government funded community health center. I quit due to burn out as well as wanting to be home with my son and have another child. After my daughter was born I knew a change was needed and I found HMI Nutrition School. I had long been interested in nutrition and would often read books about food and how it heals. Because food truly is medicine. HMI is comprehensive, science-backed and from the very beginning really resonated for me and I knew I would never look back... - Macinsey, HMI Health Coach, previously attended IIN I was introduced to HMI Nutrition School a few years after completing my coursework from The Institute for Integrative Nutrition (IIN). At the time, I had gratefully been able to use that education to identify allergies in my son and remove so many problematic foods from our diet. Years later though, when I began suffering symptoms related to hormonal imbalance and adrenal fatigue, I realized I didn't know what specifically to add IN that would help my body regain the balance it was trying to find. Upon receiving my first health history from an HMI coach, I was blown away at it's detailed explanation and realized what I'd been missing... - Verenice Olivera, HMI Health Coach, previously attended Health Coach Institute (HCI) Prior to enrolling in HMI Nutrition School, I joined another health coach program by Health Coach Institute (HCI). My passion for health coaching started after doing the \"Heal Candida Now\" protocol by HMI. I found myself talking to everyone about how awesome our bodies are and how doing a proper cleanse is life changing. I really thought all health coaching schools were the same. Two modules into HCI I knew it was not what I was looking for. I learned more from the \"Heal Candida Now\" program within one week than I was learning here. Less than a year later, I received a large sum of money and before spending it on anything else, I payed for the entire HMI Nutrition Certification program even though I still had over two years remaining on my payment plan with HCI. Module one of HMI I knew it was the best decision I had made... \"Health Coaching is one of the smartest, most lucrative career choices in the economy today. It is part of a four trillion dollar industry and growing. If you want to make a difference and be well paid this is clearly the place to be.\" \u2014 Forbes Magazine YOUR EDUCATION At HMI, our foundational philosophy is that we can't change the future if we keep doing things the way they've always been done.

YOU MATTER TO US At HMI, we don't enroll thousands of students where you become just a number. We limit [enrollment](/enroll). Why does that matter?

We empower you with marketing and business training and tools, critical sales and marketing knowledge, and implementation systems that include programs and products. Living at this exceptional level is not only possible-it's right there for you with the Three Pillars of HMI's philosophy: PHYSICAL HEALTH Give The Body What It Needs. Every body needs the nutrients from food in order for the cells and systems to function well. Many of us are nutrient starved even though we take in plenty of calories. The most nutrient dense foods are whole, fresh, organic and plant based. Our profound dissatisfaction with our bodies, our energy levels and our health is directly related to the devitalized nature of what we are feeding ourselves. The unique and in-depth curriculum at HMI shows you step-by-step how to implement evidence based nutrition into your own life, and how to create lasting change in your clients so you'll be in high demand. EMOTIONAL HEALTH Set Your Emotions Free. When emotions that we have not dealt with rise to the surface, we often eat to suppress them. Then, when we eat food that doesn't fit into our beliefs about what's healthy or allowed on our current diet we feel guilt and frustration. We're controlled by so many emotions around food that it's no wonder that we can't hear what our body and intuition are telling us. In order for Deep Healing to occur, we need to create an environment in our lives where all emotions are welcomed and integrated, so that they are no longer interfering with our ability to access clarity and intuition. HMI has a unique approach to helping you free your emotions, so you can in turn, help your clients to the same. A vibrant and passionate life is the goal! FINANCIAL HEATH Having Financial Independence And Security Is A key Part In Living Your Best Life. When people are struggling to pay their bills, or not ever truly having the freedom to do the things they want to do most, it can create stress, strained relationships, and sadness. In reality, most people have never taken the time to really examine what wealth or true prosperity really looks like for them. Our specially designed Business Training Modules provide you with world class business knowledge and tools, gained from decades of experience in successful business creation and operation. The Wellness Industry is the Fastest Growing Industry On The Planet Did you know that Wellness is a $4 Trillion Global Industry? That industry analysts predict more growth ahead? \"Prevention-challenged traditional healthcare systems, and an obesity and chronic disease crisis, are simply costing people and governments too much. So, it's a very good bet that the double-digit annual growth rates across these wellness sectors we've tracked these last few years should continue, as more people proactively change the way they eat, exercise, travel, work and live.\" So with the market being the fastest growing industry on the planet, why are so many health coaches, wellness practitioners, and people in the healing arts struggling financially? Why are they unable to turn their gifts into financial freedom and abundance? There are many reasons for this and after interviewing a wide variety of wellness coaches, Liana came to understand that they have never been given proper business training. Most had received a little knowledge about \"business\", but were never given the tools to implement a fully functioning business plan \u2014 one that could enable financial abundance whether as a home-based business, internet business, or face to face client based business. But it's not just business training.
