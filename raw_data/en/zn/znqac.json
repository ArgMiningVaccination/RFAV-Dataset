Dyspepsia is a common condition seen in general practice, accounting for 2-4% of all primary care office visits. 2The term non- ulcer dyspepsia (NUD) refers to epigastric discomfort not associatedwith ulcer disease. In modern clinical practice in this country, themainstay of treatment for NUD includes antacids, H 2-blockers, proton pump inhibitors, and antibiotics aimed at Helicobacter pylori , all of which may work in the short term, or may not work at all. In thesepatients, turmeric when used in doses of 1-3 g/d may improve dyspep-tic symptoms. History Turmeric and its powdered rhizome were highly valued by early Asian civilizations because of its golden yellow color, reminiscentof sunlight. In Sanskrit, turmeric can be identified by pita (fire/yellow) or gauri (brilliant). 3Turmeric's distinc- tive color was thus exploited and used in commercial textile dyes. Itwas also noted that turmeric powder, because of its antimicrobialand antioxidant properties, preserved foods and preventedspoiling. 3This is one of the reasons turmeric powder is used as a preservative and flavor enhancer in many Indian curry powders. InWestern cuisine, turmeric is still used as a preservative in the pick-ling process, and as a dye and preservative in condiments like yel-low mustard.

Intraditional Chinese medicine, turmeric, also known asJianghuang, has been used for dyspepsia, liver disease,and hyperlipidemia for more than two millennia and islisted in the Chinese Materia Medica. 4 Source and Identification Curcuma is a perennial herb indigenous to Southeast Asia and like ginger, belongs to the Zingiberaceae fami-ly. Of the genus Curcuma , two plants, known as C. domestica ,i s by far the most commonly used and will be the focus ofthis review. The underground rhizome of C. longa ( 1/2 inch in diameter) is cultivated, boiled in water, air dried and cured into fingers, and then ground into powder. Themajor constituents of the powder include curcuminoids(2-5% by weight) and volatile oils (2-6%). 5The majori- ty of the biologic activity is believed to come from thecurcuminoids, and to a lesser extent, the volatile oils thatgive turmeric its characteristic smell and taste. cyclocurcumin.5The primary volatile oils, of which much less are known, are composed of sesquiterpenoidssuch as curcumone, turmerone, and have beenidentified, including turmerin. Metabolism Studies in rats and humans confirm that the majority of orally ingested curcuminoids are excreted in fecesand that only very small amounts can be detected inserum and urine. 5In vivo experimentation in rats using a very large oral dose of curcumin have found that 60% ofcurcumin is absorbed. 1 In humans, curcumin is barely detectable in serum after a single 2 g oral dose of curcumin.6It is possible that curcumin undergoes transformation to unmeasuredcompounds in intestinal cell walls, and may be effectiveat very low concentrations. Interestingly, coadminister-ing a small dose of piperine, an extract of black and longpepper used in Ayurveda, increased bioavailability ofcurcumin by 2,000% in one study. 6The small amounts of curcumin that are absorbed in the serum are quicklymetabolized by the liver to glucuronides of tetrahy-drocurcumin and actively excreted into bile. 5 Mechanism of Action Curcuminoids' mechanisms of action have been extensively studied and are multifaceted. Curcuminoidshave been shown to antagonize the effect of severalspasmogens in isolated guinea pig ileum. 5Curcumin may also stimulate the release of GI paracrine hormonesfrom intestinal luminal cells. Curcumin has also beenshown to increase hepatic cholesterol-7a-hydroxylaseactivity in rats, which stimulates bile acid synthesis. 7 Turmeric extracts inhibit cyclooxygenase enzymes, like NSAIDs8and thus may be ulcerogenic, especially at higher doses. Animal Studies In a study done in rats fed a flatulent diet, curcumin feeding decreased gas production.5Curcumin adminis- tered at an IV dose of 25 mg/kg increased bile secretionin anesthetized dogs by 100%. 5Other studies have con- firmed these findings and also found a cholekineticeffect. Some investigators have found that curcuminprevented the formation of cholesterol gallstones inmice. 9 Curcumin has been shown to increase mucin content in gastric juice of rabbits, thus possibly imparting a pro-tective effect on the gastric mucosa. 5This protective gas- tric effect is controversial, however, as one study hasshown that curcumin when administered at high doses 50 May 2000Subscriber Information Customer Service: 1-800-688-2421.

Of these 12trials, only five of these trials specifically investigated theGI effects of turmeric derivatives and all of these trialswere randomized, placebo-controlled trials (RCT). One multicenter RCT done in Thailand reported the effect of turmeric powder compared with a combinationantiflatulence product containing ginger, capsaicin, andcascara with placebo. 12One hundred sixteen patients with clinically diagnosed non-specific dyspepsia wererandomized to take 500 mg turmeric powder PO qid incapsule form for seven days. Fifty-three percent of placebo patients were \"improved or cured\" compared to 83% of those assignedto the antiflatulence product and 87% of those in theturmeric group (P < 0.008 for either drug vs. placebo).At the end of the study, approximately 50% of subjectsacross all groups were satisfied with their treatmentassignment. Problems with this study include the use ofa nebulous, non-endoscopic definition of dyspepsia andthe very short treatment period. When treating a subset of NUD patients with func-tional biliary tract pain (i.e., no evidence of gallstones), a recent German group found that a proprietary combina-tion product (Cholagogum F Nattermann \u00ae) containing 45 mg of curcumin and 4 mg of celandine given orallytid significantly reduced complaints of colicky rightupper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain when comparedto placebo over three weeks (P < 0.01). 13No significant differences were noted in the incidence of early satiety,nausea, or vomiting. This study implies that increasing bile flow may improve symptoms in these patients. This effect attribut-able to curcuminoids was recently demonstrated inanother RCT in which 12 healthy volunteers received a20 mg dose of oral curcumin or placebo, and had fourserial RUQ ultrasounds over two hours. 14Investigators found a 30% reduction in gallbladder volume two hoursafter receiving curcumin (P < 0.001). Another RCT looking specifically at the healing rate of duodenal ulcers found that 6 g of turmeric powdergiven orally each day was no better than placebo at eightweeks. 15Healing was actually worse in the turmeric group (2% healed) compared to the placebo group (15%healed) at four weeks. By the study's end, both groupsdemonstrated a 30% healing rate. Another RCT compared turmeric powder 250 mg PO qid with a liquid antacid qid in healing endoscopicallyproven gastric ulcers in 60 patients. 16After six weeks, 33% of gastric ulcers in the turmeric group had com-pletely healed compared with 65% in the antacid group.Fifteen percent of the turmeric group was unchanged or Alternative Medicine Alert 51Table 1 Comparison of commercially available turmeric products with other products used for dyspepsia Product/ Active Manufacturer's Dyspepsia Dosing Retail Price/Month Manufacturer Ingredient Suggested Use (Based on RCT) (Based on NUD Dosing) Zantac\u00aeRanitidine 1 tablet PO bid same $41.15/month 150 mg Artichoke Leaf 13-18% caffeylquinic 1 capsule PO tid same $20.50/month Extract (Enzymatic acidTherapy) Chamomile German chamomile 2 capsules PO tid same $11.07/month (Nature's Herb) flowers 354 mg/capsule Turmeric-Power qd $6/month (Source Natural) bromelain 50 mg Source: Hospital of University of Pennsylvania outpatient pharmacy, online mail order companiesworse compared to 0% in the antacid group. These find- ings imply that large doses of turmeric may actually beulcerogenic and retard healing rate in peptic ulcer disease(PUD). Adverse Effects and Drug Interactions Most animal studies have found turmeric and cur- cumin to be safe, even at high doses. For example, onestudy done in monkeys found no adverse effects at anoral curcumin dose of 800 mg/kg/d for three months. 17 There is one report of curcumin causing gastric ulcera-tions in mice at 50 mg/kg/d for six days 10and another report of hepatotoxicity with exaggerated oral feedingswith turmeric over just 14 days. 18 In humans, turmeric is a Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) spice with typical consumption in Indianculture ranging from 0.1-3.8 g/d. 19Published clinical tri- als do not report significant adverse events. Specifically,a clinical trial done in rheumatoid arthritis found cur-cumin to be well tolerated at doses up to 1,200 mg/d fortwo weeks (approximately 24 g/d turmeric powder). 20 Also, a published abstract from a Phase I trial of cur-cumin in patients with HIV found curcumin safe atdoses of up to 2,000 mg PO qd for 18 weeks. 21 There are no published reports of curcumin-drug interactions. One review raised the possibility of aninteraction with antiplatelet agents as curcumin inhibitsplatelet aggregation in vitro. Animal studies have foundthat turmeric is safe in pregnancy but no human studiesaddress this population. It is clear, however, that medici-nal use of turmeric should be avoided in pregnancy as itmay increase uterine contraction. 19 There are several published case reports of contact dermatitis associated with turmeric powder when usedtopically. A search of the FDA adverse drug reaction(ADR) database identified 12 reports associated withturmeric or curcumin. 22A review of these ADRs found that every case report was associated with multiherbalpreparations, which included small amounts of turmericand often included ma huang. Formulations and Dosage Turmeric is widely available commercially as a spice used in Indian cuisine but the doses required for a thera-peutic effect in dyspepsia (1-3 g/d) precludes the practi-cal use of this formulation in most Western diets.Turmeric is also available as a concentrated extract incapsule form standardized to curcumin content, as analcohol extracted tincture, and as a tea. ( See Table 1. ) Since the curcuminoids and volatile oils are poorlywater soluble, teas are not recommended. In this country, turmeric and curcumin are found primarily in combination products marketed as antioxi- dants or for the treatment of arthritis. It is important tonote that the anti-inflammatory doses of curcumin usedin RCTs for arthritis treatment are at least four timeshigher than the doses found to be effective in dyspepsia. International Practice In Europe, carminative herbs like chamomile, arti- choke leaf, and turmeric are frequently used in clinicalpractice for the treatment of dyspepsia. The GermanCommission E has approved the use of turmeric alone,and in combination with the herb celandine, for thetreatment of dyspepsia. 23 Conclusion For simple NUD, it appears that curcumin or turmeric powder may decrease symptoms over the short run. Nodata exist to support its long-term use for this chroniccondition. Turmeric should not be used in patients withactive PUD as it may be ulcerogenic even at doses of 1 g/d. Turmeric should also not be used in patients withknown cholelithiasis or chronic cholecystitis as this herbcauses biliary contraction and could precipitate anattack. the subset of patients with biliary dyskinesia,turmeric and curcumin seem to improve pain symptoms.To date, there are no studies directly comparing turmericto artichoke leaf extract, the most popular herbal chola-gogue used in Europe. Recommendation We caution against the indiscriminant use of medicinal turmeric for undiagnosed epigastric pain. This is based ondata from RCT that suggest turmeric may impede healingof ulcers in PUD. Turmeric should also not be used inpatients with known or suspected cholelithiasis. However,in patients whom you or curcuminoids 50-150 mg/d and likely effective remedy. v Dr. Szapary is Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine inPhiladelphia.

Jane Kattapong, MD, MPH Illness is not something a person has. It's another way of being. Jonathan Miller The Body in Question EPILEPSY WREAKS HA VOC IN PEOPLE 'S LIVES ; PATIENTS with epilepsy have to get used to another way of life. They give up much of their independence. They oftenhave to give up driving. They cannot swim alone. Theyfrequently miss school and work. They must alwaysremember to bring their medications with them whenthey are away from home, and to take their medicationsregularly. Children may have difficulty in school. Severe-ly affected individuals may be completely disabled andunable to work at all because of the seizures themselves,post-ictal symptoms of lethargy or confusion, or the seda-tion from multiple seizure medications. Thus, living withepilepsy may amount to another way of being. A decrease in seizure frequency or severity may enable people with refractory epilepsy to achieve somesemblance of normality in their lives. 1Effective treat- ment of epilepsy may lessen the disability that patientsexperience. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is one treat-ment modality that may decrease frequency and severityof seizures, as well as decrease the amount of sedatingmedications that patients must take. Background Epilepsy is generally defined as recurrent, unpro- voked seizures.2Epilepsy occurs commonly; the risk of Alternative Medicine Alert 53developing epilepsy by age 80 has been reported to be 4%,3and it affects 0.5-1.0% of the population.4Epilepsy causes significant disability: Up to 50% of epilepsypatients experience either inadequate seizure control ordisabling side effects of medication such as drowsiness,poor coordination, or poor concentration. Thus, disabili-ty from epilepsy occurs commonly. Seizures are broadly classified as either generalized or partial in onset. Generalized seizures begin bilaterallyin both hemispheres of the brain. Partial seizures have alocalized onset and may evolve into generalizedseizures. Procedure In VNS, intermittent stimulation is administered to the left vagus nerve in the neck. The VNS is deliveredvia the NeuroCybernetic Prosthesis (NCP stimulation device developed by Cyberonics, Inc.(Houston, Texas) for the treatment of epilepsy. 5(See Figure 1. ) The device is a programmable signal generator which is implanted as an outpatient, or during an overnightadmission, in the upper left chest. The generator is con-nected to a stimulating coil placed in close proximity tothe left vagus nerve. Patients typically receive vagal nerve stimulation for 30 seconds every five minutes. 6 Since the device is programmable, signal duration andfrequency can be modified as needed. In 1997, FDAapproved the device for use as adjunctive treatment forpartial-onset seizures for people over 12 years of age. Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of VNS for seizure control is not well understood. The vagus nerve normally sup-plies parasympathetic innervation ascending and transverse colon, liver, and pan-creas, 7and has an integral role in regulation of respirato- ry, digestive, and cardiac function.8 In addition, the vagus nerve provides the brain with visceral sensory information from the head, neck, tho-rax, and abdomen. 2,9The cell bodies of the vagus nerve sensory axons are contained in the nodoose ganglion.These cell bodies relay information to the nucleus of thesolitary tract (NTS). 2One pathway of the NTS provides an ascending projection conveying visceral sensoryinformation to the forebrain. 10This communication with the thalamocortical may be the mechanismwhereby VNS modulates seizure activity. Vagus Nerve Stimulation in Adults Long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of VNS were assessed in an open-label study of 454 patientswith refractory epilepsy. 3All patients had had continued seizures despite medical therapy. All patients had anNCP implanted in the anterior chest. During the study, patients continued using antiepilep- tic drugs (AEDs) as needed. About half of the study par-ticipants were male and half were female. The averageage of participants was 31 years, and the average dura-tion of epilepsy was 21 years. The average number of seizures per day at baseline was about two, and the average number of AEDs used was two. Significant(P < 0.0001) seizure reductions were seen at predeter-mined time intervals, including three months, one year,two years, and three years. To minimize the potential bias resulting in patient attrition, a \"last-visit-carried-forward\" analysis was per-formed, considering the status at the last visit to be thecurrent condition. At three years, 43% of patientsremaining in the study had experienced a > 50%decrease in seizure frequency. At three years, the mostcommon side effects reported were hoarseness (19.3%)and cough (5.9%). Serious adverse events were limitedto severe hoarseness in three individuals and shortnessof breath in three individuals. There were no deaths of 54 May 2000 Figure 1 Implant detail of the vagus nerve stimulation pulse generator, the NeuroCybernetic Prosthesis (NCP\u00ae) Source: Reprinted with permission from Michael JE, Wegener K, Barnes DW.

The total cost of VNS, including surgery and follow- up visits, is about $20,000 (personal communication,Cyberonics). This compares favorably with traditionalepilepsy surgeries, such temporal lobectomy, whichcan range from $20,000 to $100,000. Contraindicationsinclude the a bilateral vagotomy or left cer-vical vagotomy. Vagus Nerve Stimulation in Children Evidence is starting to accumulate suggesting that VNS may be efficacious in children. The Pediatric VNSStudy Group evaluated the use of intermittent left vagalnerve stimulation in children with medication-resistantepilepsy. 11 In this study, essentially a meta-analysis of two dou- ble-blind, controlled trials of VNS efficacy, 60 childrenbetween 3 1/2and 18 with uncontrolled epilepsy were followed for up to 18 months. At 12 months, seizurereduction of 35% was found in 51 patients; and at 18months, seizure reduction of 42% was found in 46patients. Twenty-seven percent of patients had general-ized tonic-clonic seizures, and 73% had partial-onsetseizures. Differences in numbers between studyenrollees and patients still enrolled at 18 monthsoccurred because of patient dropout. However, an intent-to-treat analysis revealed little difference between analy-ses involving the entire group vs. the patients enrolled atthe end of 18 months. Of the group of patients who did not complete the study, three left because of lack of efficacy, one leftbecause the device eroded through the skin, and onedied of aspiration pneumonia (unrelated to the device).The study authors concluded that VNS is a safe, effec-tive adjunctive therapy for children with intractableepilepsy. Side Effects Relatively few side effects have been reported in association with vagus nerve stimulation. Side effectsthat have been reported include hoarseness, cough,paresthesias, headache, and shortness of breath. 3In a blinded study of 254 epilepsy patients, no seriousadverse events were found to be related to VNS. 12One post-marketing case report described a 56-year-old manwith mild mental retardation, right hemiparesis, andrefractory partial seizures who developed bradycardiaand transient asystole during lead diagnostic testing. Thepatient recovered completely with brief cardiopul-monary resuscitation. The manufacturer has stated thatthe occurrence of similar arrhythmias is expected tooccur in about 0.1% of patients. 13The American Academy of Neurology's Assessment of Vagus Nerve Stimulation The American Academy of Neurology's Subcommit- tee on Therapeutics and Technology Assessmentreviewed the existing evidence in 1999 14and found that the degree of improved seizure control attributed to VNSwas comparable to that of the new AEDs. The subcom-mittee found that VNS for epilepsy was both effectiveand safe. Nevertheless, neurologists may be reluctant tooffer VNS because it utilizes neither traditional pharma-ceutical nor traditional surgical means of treatment. Conclusion VNS appears to be a safe, effective alternative to multi-pharmacy for patients with refractory epilepsy.Although current FDA approval covers usage for peopleover 12 years of age, it appears to be of benefit foryounger children as well. Recommendation VNS may be beneficial as an adjunctive therapy in refractory epilepsy. This device is a nonpharmacologictreatment option that should be considered for epilepsypatients. v Dr. Kattapong is a board-certified neurologist and prin- cipal in Medicat Consulting, a health services consultingfirm in Tucson.

Goldenseal Infections By D\u00f3nal P. O'Math\u00fana, PhD GOLDENSEAL REMAINS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR herbs sold in the United States. In the first eight months of 1999, sales of echinacea and goldenseal,often formulated together, ranked fifth among herbalremedies sold through mainstream markets. 1If your patients use herbal remedies, there's a good chance theytake goldenseal as a \"natural antibiotic\" to treat and pre-vent flu. History and Harvesting Goldenseal ( Hydrastis canadensis ) is a member of the buttercup family. It is a low-growing herbaceousperennial, characterized by a bright yellow rhizome (orunderground thickened stem), from which it gets itsname. Other common names include golden root, eyeroot, and ground raspberry, because of its small red fruit.It grows naturally in the woodland areas across much ofthe Eastern and Midwestern United States. Overharvest-ing of goldenseal in the 1980s and early 1990s led toconcerns that it was becoming an endangered species,especially as it was difficult to cultivate. Much progresshas since been made in this area, leading to significantlyexpanded agricultural acreage. 2 Folklore Native American tribes (including the Cherokee, Iro- quois, Crow, Seminole, and Blackfoot) commonly usedthis herb as a diuretic and stimulant, as a treatment forstomach ulcers, and as a wash for irritated eyes andmouth sores. It was also an important source of yellowdye. European settlers first mentioned it in 1804 as apowerful \"bitter\" to increase appetite and facilitatedigestion, and as a mouth and eye wash. 3Goldenseal was enthusiastically promoted by the Eclectic medicaldoctors, who focused on herbal remedies and gave manyAmerican herbs their first scientific evaluations by care-fully observing and recording their effects. 3Many Eclectics were critical of overblown claims about gold-enseal, such as its alleged ability to cure cancer. With the decline of the Eclectics in the 1930s, gold- enseal's use dropped off in the United States. Recentinterest in goldenseal began when it was reported duringthe 1970s that oral ingestion would mask morphine indrug urinalysis. These claims have been shown to bewithout scientific merit, but they persist, and have broad-ened to include masking of marijuana and cocaine. 4 Official Recommendation and Current Use Goldenseal was officially approved as a medicinal herb in the United States Pharmacopoeia (1830-1840and 1860-1926), and in the National Formulary (1888and 1936-1955). 3 Many pharmaceutical companies sold the root and preparations of it until the early 20th century. Gold-enseal is now sold as a cure-all type of herb to preventand treat colds and flu, strengthen the immune system,potentiate insulin, cleanse vital organs, and promote thefunctioning capacity of the heart, lungs, liver, spleen,pancreas, and colon. Pharmacology The active ingredients in goldenseal are a group of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, the most abundant ofwhich are adiverse group of alkaline nitrogen-containing compoundsmade by many plants from a small group of amino acids.Many have pharmacological activity. The chloride salt ofberberine is responsible for goldenseal's yellow color.Most of goldenseal's alleged medicinal effects have beenlinked to berberine, with recent studies confirming thelack of antibacterial activity of other constituents. 5 Mechanism of Action The mode of action of goldenseal and berberine inhumans is not understood well. Berberine (also isolated from barberry, Oregon grape root, golden thread, andseveral Chinese herbs) has antimicrobial effects, inhibit-ing the adherence of microorganisms to host cells. 5 Berberine has in vitro antimicrobial activity against awide variety of microbes, including Bacillus ,Strepto- coccus , and Candida organisms. 6Antiviral activity has not been reported for berberine. Goldenseal is believed to relieve colds and flu by increasing the flow of mucous and causing the release ofmore antibodies. 7Goldenseal allegedly acts in humans as an \"alterative,\" an herbalist's term for substances thatgradually produce beneficial changes in the body bystimulating natural healing processes. In this case, gold-enseal's GI effects are said to result from \"increasingdeficient flow but decreasing excessive flow\" of variousmucous secretions. 7 Animal Studies One animal study examined goldenseal's effect on the rat immune system.8Animals given goldenseal in their drinking water showed significantly elevated IgM anti-body levels compared to control rats during the first twoweeks, but not in the four subsequent weeks. Levels ofIgA antibodies did not differ between the two groups. Another animal study provides some support for goldenseal's relief of cold symptoms. 9Mice with drug- induced diabetes were fed a diet containing 6.25% byweight of goldenseal to investigate its reputation as anatural diabetes treatment. No significant changes inplasma glucose and insulin concentrations were detect-ed, but hyperphagia and polydipsia were significantlyreduced. Clinical Studies A search of MEDLINE, TOXLINE, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (using the terms goldenseal,golden seal, hydrastis, and berberine) found no clinicalstudies using goldenseal. Several goldenseal monographsalso were consulted, and none reported clinical studies. Aclinical study of giardiasis and berberine found Goldenseal contains 2-4% of berberine, so one would have to take 26 commercial 500 mg goldenseal capsulesdaily to obtain the berberine dose typically given in thereferenced clinical studies. Twenty-six capsules (or 13 g)daily far exceeds the usual recommended dose. 7 Formulation Goldenseal reportedly enhances the effects of echi- nacea and is frequently added to other herbal prepara-tions. It is available as dried root and rhizome in capsules,tinctures, extracts, tablets, salves, and ointments. For colds and flu, one or two 500 mg capsules are recom-mended 2-3 times daily. Alternatively, one teaspoonful ofherb (the contents of 2 or 3 capsules) or tincture can beadded to a cup of boiling water to make a tea taken threetimes daily. Stronger mixtures are recommended forexternal use only. Adverse Effects Large doses or prolonged use of goldenseal can cause nausea, vomiting, paresthesia, hypertension, and respira-tory failure. Fatalities have been reported. 11Goldenseal (10 capsules; strength not reported) is one of severalberberine-containing used as abortifacients. 7 Berberine displaces serum-bound bilirubin, raisingblood levels and increasing the risk of brain damage ininfants with previously raised bilirubin levels. 12 Adulteration Widespread use of goldenseal has led to over-collec- tion and deforestation of the plant, leading to high pricesand adulteration with less expensive different overall effects. Oregon grape in particular has been associated with adverseeffects, especially diarrhea, nephritis, confusion, andstupor. 14The European Union's drug regulating agency in 1996 listed Oregon grape as an Herbal Drug withSerious Risks because of its berberine content. 7 Conclusion The likely active ingredient in goldenseal has in vitro antibacterial, antifungal, and antiparasitic activity. How-ever, its systemic efficacy, especially against viral infec-tions, remains unproven. One animal study showed itmay induce short-lasting immune system stimulation. Recommendation Given goldenseal's serious adverse effects, its pop- ular use for colds and flu appears unwarranted. Gold-enseal certainly should not be used during pregnancyor lactation. Traditional usage has primarily been as atopical antimicrobial, and berberine does have broadantimicrobial activity. Ironically, goldenseal has fall-en prey to the same tendency toward overuse as haveprescription antibiotics, resulting in endangerment ofthe plant's wild variety. v Dr. O'Math\u00fana is Professor of Bioethics and Chemistry at Mount Carmel College of Nursing, Columbus, OH.

(-)-Hydroxycitric acid does not affect energy expenditure andsubstrate oxidation in adult males in a post-absorptive state. Int J Obes Relat Metab Dis- ord AS AN HERBAL SUPPLEMENT , (-)-Hydroxycitric acid [(-)-HCA] is promoted as a weight loss agent. It ishypothesized (-)-HCA can increasefat oxidation by inhibiting lyase, anenzyme that plays a crucial role in energymetabolism during de novo lipogenesis.The indirect inhibition of the cytosolicpool of citrate reduction coenzyme Aand oxaloacetate alter steps in the citricacid cycle that promote fat oxidation. We hypothesized that supplementa- tion with (-)-HCA would result in anincrease in fat oxidation and metabolicrate, reflected by an increase in beta-hydroxybutyrate and energy expendi-ture (EE) and/or a decrease in respirato-ry quotient (RQ). Furthermore, duringmoderately intense exercise, we hypoth-esized that (-)-HCA supplementationwould increase the rate of lactate con-version to glucose in the liver. No stud-ies have investigated the effects of (-)-HCA supplementation in conjunctionwith a typical daily dietary composition (approximately 30-35% fat) on meta-bolic processes that could influencebody weight regulation in humans. Sedentary adult male subjects (n = 10, age 22-38 years, body mass index 22.4-37.6 kg/m 2) were enrolled in a random- ized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,crossover study involving three days of (-)-HCA (3.0 g/d) or placebo supplemen-tation. Four laboratory visits were con-ducted: Protocol A with and without (-)-HCA treatment with no exercise; andProtocol B with and without (-)-HCAtreatment with moderately intense (30 min at 40% maximal fit-ness [VO 2max] 15 VO2max). EE (by indirect calorimetry) and RQ were measured for 150 min fol-lowing an overnight fast. Blood sampleswere collected for the determination ofglucose, insulin, glucagon, lactate, andbeta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations. In a fasted state and following three days of (-)-HCA treatment, RQ was notsignificantly lowered during rest (Proto-col A) nor during exercise (Protocol B)compared with the placebo treatment.Treatment with (-)-HCA did not affectEE, either during rest or during moder-ately intense exercise. Furthermore, theblood substrates measured were not sig-nificantly different between treatmentgroups under the fasting conditions ofthis study. These results do not supportthe hypothesis that (-)-HCA alters the short-term rate of fat oxidation in thefasting state during rest or moderateexercise, with doses likely to beachieved in humans while subjectsmaintain a typical Western diet. nnCOMMENT These University of Colorado investi- gators add to the clinical work done onthe enzyme HCA, in the rind of the fruitGarcinia cambogia , which might reduce how much fat the body actually makes.But according to this and most humanevidence I've seen, it doesn't work. Theonly human studies that support its useand show some weight loss combined750 mg HCA with a low-calorie diet andexercise (a combination for the ages). This well-designed, high-tech (they measured body composition by DEXAusing a bone densitometer!) study notesthat obesity is a chronic disease requir-ing lifestyle modification for a long-termsolution. The authors also point out thatthe daily cost of 3 g/d of HCA approach-es $40, and it's not uncommon for peo-ple to waste their money in just this way. Recommendation Garcinia and HCA are not recom- mended for weight loss, short- or long-term. Refer patients to a medically soundweight management program for assis-tance with the skills needed to changetheir eating and fitness habits. v Alternative Medicine Alert 59Clinical Briefs With Comments from John La Puma, MD, FACPReader Question Comment: Your journal in no way represents the facts about SAMe. [See Alternative Medicine Alert , Decem- ber 1999, pp. 133-135.] SAMe has to be taken with B-vitamins (folic acid and B 6); none of the references cited required that SAMe be taken in that condition. Pleaserespond to this, as you are misinforming the public.SAMe is, indeed, the most effective antidepressant evermade available to the public.John A. Rush, PhD, NDOrangevale, CA Response: You are correct that none of the trials of SAMe published to date discuss B-vitamins. If SAMe raiseshomocysteine levels, then taking folic acid along with SAMe might be helpful. There is still considerable contro-versy, however, whether patients who have elevated levelsof homocysteine benefit from taking folic acid. 1In addi- tion, as I discuss in my article, there is also very little evi-dence that oral SAMe is an effective antidepressant.Barak Gaster, MDActing Assistant Professor of MedicineUniversity of Washington, Seattle References 1.

Noni juice (Morinda citrifolia ): Hidden potential for hyperkalemia? Am J Kidney Dis 2000; 35:310-312. \"WE REPORT THE CASE OF A MAN with chronic renal insufficien- cy who self-medicated with an alterna-tive medicine product known as nonijuice ( Morinda citrifolia ). The patient presented to the clinic with hyper-kalemia despite claiming adherence to alow-potassium diet. The potassium con-centration in noni juice samples wasdetermined and found to be 56.3mEq/L, similar to that in orange juiceand tomato juice. Herbal remedies andalternative medicine products may besurreptitious sources of potassium inpatients with renal disease.\" nnCOMMENT These Purdue and Indiana University authors report, and an editorial commentsupon, a surreptitious source of hyper-kalemia in a patient with chronic renalinsufficiency. The editorial notes a Chi-nese herbal nephropathy, associated withcarcinogenic phytotoxins. Even without toxic herbs, juices, and medications, patients with kidney dis-ease do not have it easy. Most of theirnutritional prescriptions are hard to fol-low, perhaps especially so in these daysof high-protein, fast-food craziness.Either these patients have to watcheverything they eat, or they have tochange their way of cooking, eating,and shopping so that they learn how toplan, and make eating in a low-protein,low-potassium, usually low-sodium,low-calorie, high-calcium way secondnature. Many function deteriorates; theydevelop complications; they requiredialysis; they get a new kidney; or theydon't; they die, or stay on dialysis. Noni juice is available refrigerated or frozen in some health food and specialtymarkets. It is often, as it was in this case, sweetened with white grape juice. Thenoni tree grows in India, Samoa, Tahiti,Southeast Asia, and Australia, and thejuice of its fruit is reported to be a cureall. Though 1 oz/d is recommended,containing only 1.66 mEq of potassium,popular daily usage is (and testimonialsreport) much greater quantities. Recommendation Who knows what's really in noni juice? But suspect supplementation ofjuices and other processed dietary sup-plements when a renal patient's num-bers don't make sense. v Iridology to Identify Toxins Source: Ernst E. Iridology: Not useful and potentially harmful. Arch Ophthalmol 2000;118:120-121. MORE THAN 1,000 LICENSED NATUR - opathic physicians practice in the United States, and iridology is describedas \"the most valuable diagnostic tool ofthe naturopath.\" Some therapists areusing iridology as a basis for supplements and/orherbs. organizationsexist: The European-style iridology training programs; and the BastyrNaturopathic in Seattle, Wash.,has an elective course on iridology (J.Colton, e-mail communication, Decem-ber 2, 1998). In the United States, insur-ance programs do not normally cover iri-dology, but in some European countries,they do. In Germany, for instance, 80%of the Heilpraktiker (nonmedically quali-fied health practitioners) practice iridolo-gy. Ophthalmologists iridology and how valuable is it? nnCOMMENT Iridology is knowledge about the iris,especially about the connection between its pigmentation and organ dysfunction.Each iris is divided into three major andthree minor zones; some iridologistsdivide the iris, like an hour, into 60parts; others divide it into 100 parts.Each part relates to an organ or an inter-nal function. Maps of the right iris cor-respond to the right side of the body;maps of the left iris correspond to theleft. Careful photographs of both iridesare often taken by iridologists, andexamined. Neural connections areresponsible for the correlation betweenthe iris and organ function. Iridology is practiced by some home- opaths and naturopaths. Iridologists donot claim to diagnose particular illnesses,but instead, to identify toxicities and dys-function. Specific natural remedies can, atan iridologist's recommendation, preventillness from developing. If it does, thenthe credit goes to the iridologist. Ernst identifies four controlled, masked evaluations of the diagnosticvalidity of iridology: One study evaluat-ed patients with renal disease, gallblad-der disease, ulcerative colitis, coronaryheart disease, asthma, pleurisy, gas-troenteritis, and an upper respiratoryinfection. Sample size ranged from 1-146; all trials were small; all involved atleast one and two involved several iri-dologists. All studies, according toErnst, were adequately designed andmasked, and consisted largely of evalu-ating color photographs of the iris. Nonefound any diagnostic accuracy with iri-dology. These data suggest that iridology is a waste of time and money. But how manypatients have been reassured that theirirideal maps were normal while their realpathophysiology continued to brew?How many patients receive diagnoses of\"toxicity\" they don't really have? Recommendation The practice of iridology should be thought of as crystal ball reading\u2014whatyou see is, or is not, what you get. Tellyour patients to save their money. v 60 May 2000In Future Issues:Praying with Patients: How? When? Where? Isoflavones for Menopause "}
