In Liber Divinorum Operum, her final visionary text, Hildegard notes four pathways of holistic healing: bodily healing with nutrition and natural remedies; the thirty-five spiritual healing elements of the soul; harmony with the four cosmic elements and \"oneness\" with the divine These medieval recipes are selected to provide inspiration for your own healing practices. Visit [St. Hildegard and her Medicine](https://www.st-hildegard.com/en/spelt/spelt-recipes/153-4-fleaseed-cookies.html) to read about the remedies and their preparation in full. Vermouth Elixir This elixir is said to boost immunity and improve digestion by stimulating saliva and stomach acid. It also helps mood, fatigue and circulation. Boil vermouth (ideally from spring plants cut early in the morning during the full moon), wine and honey and drink a shot before breakfast on an empty stomach. Jasper Plate \"If there are bouts of pain in the heart or on any other parts of a person, place a jasper on this place and hold it there so that it gets warm and the pain will be relieved.\" Hildegard of Bingen The precious stone jasper is a universal remedy for the heart and should be placed on the skin over the heart or where the pain is located. As its vibrations are similar to those of the heart, when placed cold on the skin, it balances excess energy from an anxious, agitated heart, becoming warm in the process. Bad dreams, stress and concentration can also be helped. Psyllium Cookies \"They bring joy into a troubled heart and make us happy..... They procure cheerful spirits by virtue of a good digestion and fortify the health of the mind with their harmonizing effect.\" Hildegard of Bingen These psyllium\u2014also known as fleaseed\u2014cookies are good for healthy and efficient digestion for a healthy gut to improve depression and sadness. Best made with spelt, Hildegard's most healing ingredient, other ingredients include common baking supplies such as raw sugar, sunflower oil, eggs, baking powder, citrus peels, cinnamon and nutmeg. Parsley Wine \"Whoever suffers from pain in the heart, spleen or side, drink this wine often (daily) and it will heal him.\" Hildegard of Bingen A delicious aperitif, this parsley wine is a remedy for stress, circulation and nervous issues, and is simply made by boiling wine, honey and parsley. Meum Pear Honey This \"Hildegard gold\" promotes a healthy gut and was considered by Hildegard to be more valuable than gold. Blend cooked pears with skimmed honey and meum powder, decant into sterile jars, and take three times a day. These recipes are intended as inspiration only: seek professional medical advice for any signs of sickness.
