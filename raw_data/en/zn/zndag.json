Studies now show that aspirin is not for everyone and may not help as previously thought. Researchers now say that aspirin should be used only by patients who have had a heart attack or stroke. For people at low risk of heart attack and stroke, the danger of bleeding and other complications outweigh the benefits of preventative aspirin use. If you have any of the conditions, or a history of the procedures below, you are a good candidate for aspirin therapy: Heart attack (Myocardial Infarction) Ischemic stroke Coronary artery disease (CAD) Peripheral artery disease (PAD) Stents Heart valve replacements Coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG surgery) The bottom line? Don't take aspirin unless your doctor prescribes it. As always, consult your physician before starting or stopping medications, and be sure to let the Anticoagulation Clinic know about any medication changes at your next visit! Pennsylvania state law now allows patients to use medical marijuana only with an approved medical marijuana dispensing card. If you are a patient who is currently using or is considering using medical marijuana, you may be asking yourself - is it safe to use while taking warfarin? Currently, we do not know all the effects of medical marijuana on different medications, but we DO know that it interacts with warfarin and can change your INR. This change can also depend on the type of medical marijuana product you use (i.e. tablets, oil, liquid, inhalation). In most cases, medical marijuana can increase your INR. It is important to watch for any signs of bruising or bleeding when you use medical marijuana and communicate with your doctor and pharmacists at the Anticoagulation Clinic. Frequently Asked Questions: Can I use medical marijuana with warfarin? Yes, but with extreme caution. You should always make your primary doctor and pharmacist aware that you intend to use medical marijuana so we can monitor changes in your INR. Does it matter what form of medical marijuana I use with my warfarin? Medical marijuana is available as tablets, capsules, lotions, oils, inhalations and many other different formulations. Based on current evidence, we do not know if one form of medical marijuana causes more changes in INR but studies have shown that smoking medical marijuana will increase INR. Why does medical marijuana change my INR? Medical two chemical components: THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) and CBD (cannabidiol). Both of these chemical components of medical marijuana directly prevent your body from breaking down warfarin. This causes warfarin to be left in your body for a longer period of time which may increase your INR. I rarely use medical marijuana, do I really have to let my primary doctor and pharmacist know? Yes. Using medical marijuana even once can increase your INR and increase the risk of bleeding. It is important for your primary doctor and pharmacist to know when you use medical marijuana because this may change your dose of warfarin. How do I know if medical marijuana is interacting with my warfarin? By checking your INR. You may see an increase in your INR when using medical marijuana and warfarin together. You may also notice that you bruise and bleed more easily, which may be signs of an increased INR. Where can I find more information on medical marijuana use in Pennsylvania? More information can be found at www.pa.gov under the \"guides \" section. This website provides more information on getting registered, finding a physician, and locating dispensaries in the state of Pennsylvania. Penn State Health Milton S.

Hershey Medical Center Anticoagulation Clinic Page 3 How to SHOO the Flu It will soon be that time of year again - FLU SEASON! \"The flu \" is a contagious respiratory disease caused by the influenza virus, which can lead to severe symptoms requiring hospitalization and lead to death in some circumstances. People are at high risk of getting the flu from October through March. Even though people may get the flu despite receiving the flu vaccine, several studies have shown that they will have less severe symptoms. Currently, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends everyone six months of age and older receive the flu vaccine every year. It is important to get the flu shot not only to protect yourself from the flu virus, but to also protect people who cannot receive the flu shot (such as newborns). The more people who are protected against the flu, the less likely the flu is able t o spread from person -to-person. This is because the virus can only survive and replicate in people not protected against the flu. We refer to this concept as \"herd immunity \". In order for herd immunity to be successful, everyone who can get the flu shot needs to get the flu shot. So do your part, and contribute to your community 's immunity against the flu! YOU CANNOT GET THE FLU FROM THE FLU SHOT . A lot of people believe this myth, but, in fact, the flu shot is made with viruses that have been killed. Since the virus in the vaccine is dead, you are not able to get the flu from receiving th e vaccine. You may still experience some mild side effects following the flu shot, which include soreness and redness at the injection site, low grade fever, or mild body aches. It is important to get the flu shot every year because the flu virus continues to evolve and change. Thus, the contents of th e flu shot must change each year according to the predictions for the upcoming season. Furthermore, your protection with the flu vaccine declines over time, and it is recommended for you to receive a flu shot every year. Flu shots are conveniently available in places such as the Anticoagulation Clinic , local pharmacies, and your doctor 's office. Not only is it important to receive the flu shot every year, but it is highly recommended to always stay up -to- date on your other vaccines including tetanus, pertussis, measles, rubella, herpes zoster and hepatitis, to name a few. The concept of herd immunity still applies to these vaccines as well. You have seen reports on the news of several outbreaks of vaccine -preventable diseases occurring due to the increase of unvaccinated individuals. This occurs by the virus or bacteria replicating and spreading throughout the community. Don't wait - VACCINATE!!! Penn State Health Milton S. Hershey Medical Center Anticoagulation Clinic Page 4 Colds, Antibiotics and Warfarin: How getting sick can affect your INR Clindamycin Rifampin Bactrim Fluconazole Nystatin Word Search In the winter, your risk of getting sick is higher due to germs being more prevalent. If your symptoms are due to bacteria, y our doctor may prescribe an antibiotic, but some of them can affect your INR . The effect of most antibiotics is an increased INR which puts you at risk for bleeding. Antibiotics can have a high risk, mod erate risk, or little to no risk when interacting with warfarin. In addition to the antibiotics, infections can increase your INR a s well. Symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, poor appetite, and fever can cause your INR to be out of therapeutic range. If you are prescribed an antibiotic, it is important to tell your Anticoagulation Clinic, so they can assess the antibiotic and closely monitor your warfarin dose. It's also important to tell the doctor prescribing the antibiotic that you take warfarin. Although antibiotics can affect your INR, always finish the regimen even if you start feeling better, If the infection is still in your body, the surviving bacteria will multiply and develop resistant properties. Be proactive and inform the Anticoagulation Clinic if you 're sick or are taking antibiotics BEFORE your INR increases!

Penn State Health Milton S. Hershey Medical Center Anticoagulation Clinic Page 5 Forbidden Fruits? Cranberry and Grapefruit Juice with Warfarin While taking warfarin, it is important to always consider what you are eating and drinking throughout the day. There is much emphasis placed on vitamin K containing foods, since vitamin K and warfarin work against each other. Therefore, changing diet can affect how warfarin works on the body. Some foods such as cranberry and grapefruit do not contain significant amounts of vitamin K. However, many people have asked if it 's okay to consume these while taking their warfarin. It has been thought that cranberry juice can increase INR, which would increase your risk of bleeding. Both warfarin and cranberry are broken down by the same enzyme in the body. Because of this possible concerning interaction, studies were conducted. Two studies found that drinking cranberry juice did not affect warfarin. Patients in one of the studies consumed two 8 -ounce glasses of cranberry juice daily! Due to the findings from these newer studies, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) removed the warning against cranberry consumption with warfarin therapy in 2011. Therefore, drinking usual amounts of cranberry juice has little risk to patients taking warfarin. Now, what about grapefruit juice? Grapefruit juice has the same interaction with warfarin as cranberry juice, possibly leading to a higher risk of bleeding. However, one study found that drinking 24 ounces of grapefruit juice every day did not have an effect on warfarin. Since there is not a lot of information regarding this interaction, grapefruit does not have to b e avoided. However, it is best to consume a moderate consistent amount of grapefruit. What medications do interact with these juices? Cranberry juice has minimal reports for interactions with medications. However, grapefruit juice may interact with your cholesterol medications such as lovastatin and simvastatin, your transplant medications like tacrolimus and everolimus, your heart medications like amiodarone and dronedarone, as well as an anti-viral medication called Maraviroc. So, what 's the take home point? Both cranberry and grapefruit may be consumed in moderation while taking warfarin. However, other medications may interact with cranberry and grapefruit juice. If you choose to add either of these to your diet, let your pharmacist and doctor know. Cranberry & Grapefruit Health Benefits: 1. High in vitamin C 2. Powerful antioxidants 3. Low in calories 4.
