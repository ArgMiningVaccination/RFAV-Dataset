Pattishall, Jr., Ph.D., M.D. 443 iii INTRODUCTION What are the \"behavioral sciences\" and what is their relationshipto the training of medical practitioners? These are the central questionsexamined in this part of the report.We will not take time to offer history of the term or the eventsthat led to use of the phrase \"behavioral sciences\"An preference tothe older designation, \"social sciences\"; that has been detailed in Volume I.It should he clear from the outset, however, that the termshould not be thought equivalent to the \"behaviorism\" of psychology, norto the current \"behavioral therapy\" techniques. The term in its generalusage refers to those academic disciplines that study the developmentand behavior of man as an individual organism and as a member of human society.In this connection it is therefore-preferable to the phrase\"social sciences\" as the more inclusive term, since it points moreaccurately and comprehensively to the basic empirical process beingstudied -- behavior, especially human behavior, its determinants, patterns,and functional implications p:of other observable features of interest-such as human biology and cellular disease. The common element among thevarious \"behavioral sciences,\" is that at one point or another the scopeof each scientific discipline touches behavior of the organism; empiricallyobservable human behavior is the root datum for the various conceptualiza- tions.In this volume we do not include statements from all of the fieldsthat have been included at one time or another among the \"behavioral 74 sciences.\"Boundaries are a bit vague, and sometimes the work ofscholars from non-behavioral science fields (such as history) isincluded under the rubric because of the nature of the problems studied and the approach taken to them. We do, however, cover the principalfields designated behavioral sciences. A first group of papers includesthose that are at the core of the term: anthropology (by llughes andKennedy), psychology (Wexler), and sociology (Bloom and Badgley). Asecond group of papers includes those from economics (Berry) andPolitical Science (Gore). Also included is a statement from behavioralbiology (Kramer), a field which, in this context, provides a clearlinkage between traditional medical concerns and the behavioral sciences.The overall format for this section of the report is as follows:In tied tun A are two papers dealing with the intellectual and institutional contextin which medical education occurs. Pattishall discusses theperceived current ferment and needs in medical educations, the shape of a changins; present that betokens an unclear future. Stainbrook then take:; npfiiscussionof the relationship of behavioral sciences LI) p::ychiatry-the medical specialty with strong historic involvementwith the social sciences, and which has provided strong sponsorshipfor the introduction of behavioral science content in the medicalcurriculum. Section B presents papers from the individual behavioral sciences.Authors discuss the nature of their particular disciplines and therelevance to those disciplines for the training of medical doctors.obviously it is not easy in a few pages to characterize an entirediscipline, much less its implications for the field of medicaleducation.Beyond these common guideline:, it is clear that the vi authors in each case wished to stress particular aspects of therelationship between their discipline and the process of training .rodent physicians.gnilding upon the preceding section, in Section C, Weisenbergtakes on the problem of how to translate or transform the data and skills ofthe behavioral sciences into instructional settings and modesthat will be easily perceived as relevant by medical students atvarious stages in their educational careers.Finally, in the concluding chapter, Pattishall turns attentionto one of the critical issues from an administrative as well as a teach- ing point of view: what is the best way to relate the behavioralscientists to the medical school setting? Is it through their beingdispersed and administratively attached to several basic biologicalscience or clinical departments, to serve in these contexts as con-tinual advocates for the injection of appropriate empirical findings? Or isit better to take on the \"protective coloration\" under whichother scientists work in the medical school setting and be organizedinto formal departments? Or some organizational format in betweencomplete diffusion and departmental organization? Here is a personalstatement by the chairman organizing one of the few such departments in the country. vii Section A THE CONTEXT Curriculum Trends in Medical Educationand Their Implications for BehavioralScienceEvan G.

Pattishall. Jr., Ph.D., M.D.Professor and ChnirmanDepartment of Behnvioral ScienceCollege of MedicineThe Pennsylvania State University, Hershey, Pa. It was sixty years ago when Abraham Flexner 1studied the trainingof physicians in the United States. He made a series of recommendationswhich profoundly affected the evolution of medical education. Theserecommendations included the university affiliation, the academicmodel, the disciplinary laboratory, and the strong emphasis on thescientific base of medicine.The Flexner study and recommendations have been so frequentlyquoted and acclaimed that its significance has begun to reach thestature of historical myth. As David Banta 2recounts, the firstuniversity-type medical school had already been established by 1893and a number of significant changes were already in progress severalyears before the Flexner study. For example, during the years 1908-10,prior to the Flexner Report, 28 medical schools closed their doorsbecause of the already existing trends affecting medical education.The Flexner Report, however, did serve as a powerful force to insurethat the medical schools would eventually become university affiliated,laboratory oriented and scientifically based institutions.The science orientation continued to win favor during the 1920'sand 301s, but the impact has been steadily growing during the past 30years, with the ever increasing financial support for scientificresearch and with the discovery of powerful agents and techniques toconquer some of the traditional 'Tiller diseases \". 3 These forces have resulted in a dramatic mushrooming of the medi- cal sciences.Medical education has so closely reflected this mushroomingthat it has now clearly overshot the original criticisms and recommenda-tions of Flexner. The pursuit of science has become so respected andpowerful that it has essentially captured the goals and training programsof medical education. Many critics of medicine state that the medicalstudent is forced to become first a scientist, or \"scientist-like\", andonly secondly a professionally trained person with the knowledge, skills,and attitudes to solve a patient's problem and to treat both the patient and the problem.Society is greatly indebted to science and to the scientist forthe many break-throughs which have occurred during the past 30 yearsand the evidence is clear that quantitatively there has been a dramaticincrease in the survival of human lives, but there is very little evidenceof qualitative benefits achieved,for these lives. We have concentratedso heavily on the science of molecules and the mechanisms of disease thathuman and behavioral factors have often been ignored.This tremendous imbalance is currently being recognized by thepublic, medical educators, and students alike. The public has becomeso concerned that it is not getting either the quantity or the quality of medical care ..which -it deserveh. Thus, society is now begin-ning to demand that both the medical, and the care aspects of medicalcare be provided for all the people. This is increasingly accompaniedby the threat to withhold or alter many of the sanctions formerly reservedfor the medical profession.3Medical educators are also beginning to recognize and respond tothe overloaded and lopsided medical curriculum, the disciplinary bureau-cracies, and the fragmentation and overspecialization of teaching time 4 and patient care. The.student, IN vOnCerCdp be' use he ceehimselfbeing forQed inLo an impossible learning situation often involvinglittle relevance to the needs of a practicing physician. Also, heoften secs himself being forced to participate in the perpetuation ofpriorities which seem to be incompatible with patient care and human-itRrian concern.4All of these factors, plus many others, are forcing a rapidevolution, or a quiet revolution, in medical education. Admittedly,many of the changes and movements in curriculum represent more of a\"Brownian movement\", in that there appears to be much activity, change,and reshuffling of schedules, hours, and some content, but often verylittle movement in the direction of more efficient and effective learningto accomplish the process of becoming a physician.Nevertheless, there do appear to be some general trends in medicaleducation, and some more specific trends in the basic sciences and theclinical sciences. These trends are important in that behavioralscience must be aware of this evolution, or revolution, in order mostappropriately and effectively to relate to the medical education scene.There appear to be at least eleven identifiable trends in mostmedical schools today. These include: 1.The search for relevance. 2.Early introduction of clinical medicine and integrationof the basic and clinical sciences; 3.An increase in curriculum flexibility with electives,free time,and multiple tracks, 4.The general adoption of the \"core\" curriculum concept, 5.An increase in enrollment, 6.A increase in the total training time of the traditionalfour year curriculum, 7.An increased interest in research on the learning processand in the medical student as a learner 8.An increase in self instruction and independent study, 9.A shift in attitude and preparation of the entering medical student, 10.An increased interest in the role of human behavior in thetraining of physicians, and 11.An increased emphasis on family medicine and primary care.It is true that many of these trends overlap to a considerable degree,however 'I should like to discuss each briefly: 1.The Search for Relevance:Irrelevance is being challenged for the sake of relevance and meaning.With much student and faculty help, as well as help from somenational commissions and public agencies (3, 5, 6) as medical educators,we are being forced to recognize that the medical student is in medicalschool to become a physician and that he cannot continue to absorb theendless information explosion which has been superimposed upon thetraditional courses of 10 or 20 years ago.Nor can he achieve many of the fantasy notions that some basicscientists and academic physicians have structured for him. The simplereductionist model in the medical sciences has been accumulating animportant, but often irrelevant, mountain of data in the name of edusation,professional standards, or understanding the scientific base of medicaltraining and practice. Yet, we have little evidence to indicate thstmost of the mass of minutiae a medical student is forced to learn andregurgitate actually makes any difference in terms of improved patientcare or physician performance. In factipwe have much reason to suspectthat we have been fighting a losing battle, attempting to improve 6 patient care by focusing on fncLual information rather 'than on problemsof the patient and the patient care system. 2.Early Introduction of Clinical. Sciences and Integrationof Basic and Clinical Sciences.The rigid separation of the basic science years from the clinicalscience years is being replaced by an early introduction to patients and patient care. This is having three effects: a.It is adding awelcome note of realism to the activities of the medical student, re-minding him of his original purpose for being in medical school, b.) Theincrease in clinical teaching time has resulted in a decrease in basicscience teaching during the first two years. Indeed, some schools areactually proposing that some traditional courses be moved back into theundergraduate university program, or put on a remedial or prerequisitebasis, and c.) It is providing an opportunity for the integration ofclinical teaching into many of the traditional basic science disciplines.This is beginning to result in recognizable relevance in many of thebasic science courses. While the clinical sciences are still being usedprimarily to accomplish the objective of learning the traditionalbasic sciences, a few schools are even beginning to teach the clinicalsciences early for their own sake, not just to reinforce the basicscience teaching. On the other end of the continuum, the idea of integrating someof the basic sciences into the clinical years has not met with as muchsuccess.We do not appear to have many basic scientists who are ableto bridge into clinical medicine, although there is some indicationthat this is a \"new breed\" of academician, and as the basic sciences arerequired to become more relevant, they will gain more experience inthis type of bridging and integrating. If this trend is continued,the basic science department of the future will be more apt to reflectthe model of bridging and integrating into clinical medicine, ratherthan teaching a sepnratz., dir-ipline for its own sake.Indeed someday we may come to the realization that the basic sciences exist primarilyto support clinical medicine and that they can best be taught and learnedin the context of clinical problem solving.Another important aspect of this trend of earlier introduction ofclinical teaching and more integration of the clinical and basic sciences,is the subtle, and sometimes not so subtle, shift of the power structuretoward the clinical scientists. This is happening with increasingforcefulness on admissions committees, curriculum committees, promotioncommittees, etc., as well as at the assistant and associate dean levelsof administration. The implications are that the long reign of thepowerful basic sciences is slowly coming to an e-ad. The clinical sciences will have the main say in the future as to who is admitted to medicalschool, what training they receive, and who survives the training. Thetraditional weeding-out during the first two years of students who havehad difficulty mastering much of the basic science material is passing from the scene. Also, the learning of a basic science as an end in itself is becoming less and less justifiable. 3.Curriculum Flexibility and Electives.The lock-step, highly fragmented, course offerings are beingreplaced with much more emphasis on flexible curricula so that therehas been a dramatic increase in electives, free time, and multiple track alternatives. Many schools already provide one-fourth to one -third ofcurriculum as elective, so that it is quite common for the fourthyear of medical school to be essentially elective, with additionalelective opportunities having been offered during the first twoyears.(7, 8) The third year is still generally consumed by the usualrequired clinical clerkship rotations. In some schools the electivesallow the student to go into much more depth, usually in a clinicalarea, and often provide a basis for specialization or multiple trackopportunities.8 The multiple track curricula exist more in theory and good in-tentions rather than in practice. However, as more flexibility andmore student selection is introduced, there is a concomitant opportunityto specialize earlier or pursue individual interests and-goals otherthan the usual lock-step sequence. Several schools (e.g. Stony Brook)are now designing such multiple track opportunities. It is proposedthat this would allow the training of doctors in critically neededfields in a shorter period of time as well as provide additional ex-perience in a specialty area early in the student's career so that hecan make an earlier decision as to whether he wishes to continue topursue the specialty.Some of the most attractive aspects of the flexibility andmultiple track trends are that students may be able to enter thecurriculum ladder at multiple points, with multiple goals, and beallowed horizontal as well as vertical mobility. The successfulpassing of each hurdle or course may not be as important in thefuture as long as a student develops appropriate and measurableknowledge and skills to achieve a predetermined level of competenceand performance in a particular track or specialty. 4.Adoption of the \"Core\" Curriculum.There is much argument as to whether the idea of a \"core\" con-tent has any validity, or even exists. It is argued, resisted,ridiculed, and acclaimed, yet about seventy percent of the medicalschools confess to using the core curriculum concept. ( 7)Thecore has definitely taken over, and whether it survives may not be asimportant as the effect it has had on the over-all curriculum. Ithas attempted to require each discipline to reexamine its content interms of basic components and relevance. l Considering that most basic science disciplines had continued to 9 add on more and wore nQwfacts as a result of the information explo-sion, most medical school courses were becoming increasingly imbalanced.and distorLed with the overload. The new curricula required that the basic 1..;clencef: teach \"their thing,\" in two-thirds to one half the tune.This tended to force a recognition that even though all of theirteachings were basic, some things were more basic than others.The most effective core presentations have resulted from thebasic science disciplines that have attempted to resynthesize theircontent in terms of e. relevant core. However, some common distortionsof the core have resulted from attempts to teach only the first halfof a traditional course, or to somehow talk twice as fast, stillpresenting the same amount of information. The half course, while ithas tended to panic the student with feelings of less than enoughpreparation, it has also allowed him to learn the other half indepen-dently, and has often resulted in increased, not decreased, performancein the discipline. At least in some situations, \"half a loaf\" has beenbetter than a whole loafl 5.Increase in Enrollment.In an attempt to secure more medical care and manpower, political,social, and community forces are now demanding that medical schoolsincrease the number of physicians trained and that something be doneto reduce the total time and cost involved in training a physician. (3 ,5,Most schools have responded by increasing the size of their enteringclasses over the past few years. Between 1965 and the Fall of 1972,the 88 schools in existence in 1965 will have increased their classsize by one third. This represents an absolute increase of 2,900over the 11,700 students in 1965. An additional 1,300 first-yearstudents will enter the 21 new schools that have been organizedsince 1965.(8)109) The Carnegie Commission on Highur Education has set a goal of15,000 first-year students by 1975 and the AAMC Committee on theExpansion of Medical Education has set the same goal for 1974. Thenew federal and state per capita financial inducements and the new health care legislation proposals are likely to make the achievement of this goal possible. 6.Decrease in TraininR Time of the Four Year Curriculum.A decrease in the total training time for the M.D. has alsoresulted from the various pressures mentioned above. There has beensome experimentation with five, six, and seven year programs duringthe past 20 years. ( 8)Only one school awards the M.D. after fiveyears of post high school work, but four schools offer the M.D. 'aftersix years and five schools after seven years. Ten schools have a com-bined eight year program.Most of these programs have taken the form of combining the fouryears of college and four years of medical school into one \"integrated\"program over five, six, seven, or eight years. The word integrationhas been placed in quotes, because the usual sequence has been one oftime and schedule integration or reshuffling rather than curriculumcontent integration. At present there are a total of 26 schools withsuch combined college-medical school programs.Another variation has been the so-called three year curriculumfor medical schools, providing an option so that a student may chooseto graduate after three years of study rather than the traditional four years.At least 26 schools have declared that they have suchprograms in operation at the present time. If one examines theseprograms, however, almost without exception they do not represent anactual shortening or redefinition of the curriculum, but a general11 r4.compressing of the traditional four year curriculum into three yearsby appropriating the student's summer vacations, Christmas holidays,free time, between-term breaks, and by eliminating electives in the senior year.. In actuality, there is very little difference between the presentthree year programs and the compressed schedules intitiated duringWorld War II.The University of Tennessee, for example, has had athree year program operating continuously since 1943.It is still the goal of many medical educators, however, thatsome schools will actually redefine their content and program sothat a true three year program can be offered that does more thanrob the student of his free time and elective experiences. 7.Interest in the Learning Process and in the Medical Studentas a Learner.During the last ten years there has been a dramatic increase inthe interest and attention directed toward the learning process andin the measurement of the product and process of medical education.The technology of educational research and measurement has developedto the degree that most medical schools are utilizing such talents andresources to an ever increasing extent. (10, 11)Some of the first schools to establish a separate division oroffice of research in medical education were Case Western Reserve,Buffalo, Illinois, Southern California, Georgia and Michigan State.At present there are more than 33 such educational research unitsin medical schools and they employ more than 600 faculty.As more medical schools alter their curricula to the extent that newinstructional and evaluation materials are required to implement the newcurricula ideas, there will be a continued increase in the formation andthe utilization of educational research resources. A few of the innova-tions which have either originated with or are dependent upon such12 educational resources arc self-instructioral materials, programmed instruc-tion, simulated patient exercises, computer instruction and examination,development of educational objectives, and curricula evaluation. 8.Self Instruction and Tndependent Study.The increase in self-instructional opportunities and independentstudy may be one the most subtle but powerful developments in the medical curriculum.The increased numbers of students admitted to medical school, theattempt to shorten the traditional four year curriculum, the developmentof multiple tracks with different points of entry and earlier selectionof specialty interests, the proliferation of seminar and independentelectives during the entire three or four years, the renewed interest inthe learning process and in medical education research, and the developingprograms in self-assessment and recertification are just a few of thetrends which are going to make self-instructional opportunities andindependent study programs flourish over the next ten or more years. Wecan expect that more and more of the traditional and integrated courseswill be converted to self-instructional units.The lecture will not become extinct, but it may become fairlyrare, except in cases of special faculty competence in lecturing andfor the purpose of demonstrating integrative thinking, or to satisfya few persistent and colorful personalities among the faculty. Every-one appears to recognize that the lecture is one of the poorest methodsof conveying information, yet it has persisted. At least one of the,beneficial effects of such a trend is that the remaining lectures shouldhave a much higher degree of excellence and relevance than the typicallecture found in most medical schools today.Several schools hare been pioneering in the development of self-instruction materials and units; notably, Ohio State University, University of Vtashinj,Lon, thi. Univemity of Pittsburgh, and the Uni- 11 versity of Rochester. More recently the University of North Carolina,Pennsylvania State Unilersity, Michigan State University, and theMedical College of Georgia have begun to develop such materials andprograms.In fact, there is now a Southern States Consortium of 29medical schools committed to developing and sharing such materials.The University of Pittsburgh has put most of the didactic portionof obstetrics on a self-instruction basis with tapes, film, video, slides, etc.and this has been adopted by more than a dozen schools.Other examples include the pharmacology course at the University ofNorth Carolina and the physiology course at Hershey. Ohio Statehas attempted to use the computer and other individualized instructiontechniques to program the entire basic science curriculum and thedidactic part of the clinical curriculum.Self instruction programs to date have emphasized the need forsome mechanism to allow for faculty dialogue and guidance and smallgroup discussions. After the initial time investment required todevelop each unit, the time involvement of faculty is usually reducedsomewhat.It does not reduce the need.for faculty, but the flexibilityallows more students to progress through the learning experiences. Asfaculty and students begin to experience and appreciate the potentialof students (and faculty) progressing at their own rates, according toindividual interests and skills, with the teacher regaining the taskshe performs best (e.g. dialogue, integrating, inspiring, and guidingdevelopment), more and more medical schools will institute selflearning programs coordinated by tutors and supplemented by smallgroup discussions.A projection into the future might even include such a radicalidea as \"open admissions\" whereby all students who aspire to becomephysicians or health care professionals could each have an equal chanceon the basis of their ability, motivation, and performance in medical14 problem solving and patient. care skills. 9.shirt in Attitude and Prerarntion of Students.There is considerable evidence that the student entering medicalschool today differs from the student of five or ten years ago.Funkens Lein (12), Ni!itarano (13), Dube (14), and others have shownthat the grade-point averages, the Medical College Admissions Testscores3 and the IQ scores have tended to increase over the past fewyears.They assert that the student entering medical school todayis better prepared than his colleague of five or ten years ago, partlybecause the increased competition has had the effect of raising theGPA and the MCAT score of students who are finally accepted to medicalschool, but also because the high school and college curriculum hastreat the entering medical student as though he had only had the traditionalpremedical courses; whereas he may have completed his basic collegechemistry, biology, or physics while he was in high school, and has nowprogressed in college far beyond the student of a decade ago.The medical curriculum is slowly beginning to recognize thisadvanced preparation. Also, the appropriateness of some of the basicscience courses is being challenged (e.g., biochemistry, cell biology,genetics), since an increasing number of students are entering medicalschool having already completed respectable courses in many of thebasic science subjects. Rather than repeat the same introductorycourses, many medical schools are either allowing students to test-outin introductory courses or are revising the medical school course sothat it is more appropriately problem solving oriented and providesa medical perspective.Another well- publicized change had occurred in the attitudes andgoals of entering medical students. (15,16,17)Much of the socialconcern, the humanitarian commitment, and the activist strategy of thecontemporary college student is now being reflected within the medical student population today. They are very much concerned with relevanceto the practice of medicine, the importance of patient care, and theneed for social and environmental changes. They are increasinglybeing heard as participants on curriculum committees, program planningcommittees, evaluation committees, community concern groups, etc. Ina few instances their participation has been challenged as being in-effective and based on ignorance and arrogance. However, most often ithas been acclaimed as unusually constructive and helpful in terms ofarticulating the meaningful, or meaningless, learning experiences in themedical curriculum and the use and abuse of patient care in the educationalprocess of the physician.Most medical schools now include students on major standing commit-tees, and their participation is regarded as generally helpful. Certainly,the new breed of student provides us with an opportunity to gain instantfeedback on the meaningfulness of the learning experiences we attempt toprovide and can be helpful in planning future learning experiences. 10.Interest in the Role of Human Behavior in Training Physicians.There has been an increased interest in and commitment to theteaching of social factors and human behavior as a necessary part ofthe training of the physician. Part of this increase can be attributedto the social or \"soft science\" vacuum created by the mushrooming ofthe \"hard sciences\" the last twenty five years. The \"social deficit\"in solying medical problems and in patient care practices has become soevident that even the patient has begun to realize that he is not therecipient of all that modern science could or should provide.This concern has also been promoted by many medical faculty witha strong sense of social: conscience and patient care orientation --long before the student rebellion for relevance and social concernbecame a strong factor in the medical school subculture. (18, 19) 16 The increase in social and behavioral scienti.sts in the medical schools and the increatJe, in the teaching time for which they were responsible reflects this trend. Thomas Webster's (20) comprehensivereview of behavioral science teaching demonstrated a rapid and steadygrowth, so that by 1966 the preclinical teaching had increased to an average of 96 hours per school, augmented by required interdepartmentalteaching exercises, and involving both preclinical and clinical inter=departmental teaching. The recent establishmient of a behavioral sciencesection of the Part I examination of the National Board is further evidenceof the concern of medical educators for the social and behavioral factorsin medicine. If one takes into account the recent, but rapid increase in electivetime throughout all four years of medical school, the increase inbehavioral science teaching time has been even more dramatic as ournew breed of action-oriented and person-concerned medical student hastended to favor the electives in behavioral science.As mentioned above, the new medical student reflects a real searchfor relevance, a new sensitivity to the social, moral, political, andhuman rights aspects of medical problems and patient care. He is alsoexpressing an increased insistence on playing an activist role inguiding his own future and in changing many of the incongruencies of hissociety and the medical profession. This concern has added the increaseddemand that the social and humanitarian factors be considered as ofspecial, if not equal, importance.With the activist student, the aroused and sometimes angry patient,the concerned faculty member, and the failure of science to produce thepromised panacea, there has been renewed hope placed on the social andbehavioral sciences.This poses a rather interesting paradox. Students, faculty, and 17 patients are recognizing the importance of more training and concernwith the social and behavioral factors. At the same time, the basicscience faculty is being threatened with loss of its own teaching timeand in apt not to respond too sympilthetically to another basic sciencegroup competing for their curriculum time. The students, while theymay recognize the need for more social and behavioral skills, are quiteaware that the behavioral sciences have not been a part of the tradi-tional basic science survival system. As in most any behavioral system,the survival instinct most-often wins over social, ethical, or moral values.Thus, students (and faculty) appear to be trapped in the system,making a desperate claim for curriculum change, but fearful of beingunable to survive the additional science learning load necessary toinstitute the behavioral sciences. Until there is a complete re-examination of the relevance and appropriateness of all of the basicscience content, or a restructuring of the survival system, theparadox will continue. 11.Emphasis on Family Medicine and Primary Care..The need for more family physicians and primary care physicianshas been documented by almost every study commission that has concerneditself with the quantity and quality of medical care delivery. (3, 5, 21)Many medical educators have begun to respond to this felt and expressedneed by pioneering the development of family medicine or primary caredepartments or programs. (22, 23, 24) This has actually progressed tothe point that there are now more than 35 established teaching depart-ments of family medicine or primary care in medical schools and atleast an equal number in the planning stage of development. (25) 18 It is quite understandable that medical students have not chosenfamily medicine when one considers the development of specializationover the past twenty years. Instead of being trained in primary medicalcare, or how to be first a primary physician, the medical student receivesmost of his training in secondary or tertiary care.From the beginning he is selected by highly specialized basicscientists and clinical specialists. Then he is mainly exposed tosecondary or tertiary care physicisns as teacher-models during hisfour years in medical school. Thus, he is rarely able to see, muchless have a chance to work wi th, a primary physician who has theresponsiiiilit Y for comprehensive and colAinuing medical care. Ifhe sees his specialist-teachers struggling with var:ous diagnosticand treatment problems which they cannot answer, how could he imaginehimself able to learn enough as a primary or family physicianto make a dent in all the medical problems he might face inactual practice? Having been selected, taught, guided, inspired, andrecommended by the specialist, there should be little wonder why healso chooses a specialty rather than primary or family care.There is little doubt but that the public will continue to addincreased support and demand for more and better primary care asevidenced by the Comprehensive Health Manpower Training Act of 1971.Also, there is little doubt but that this trend will have a powerfulimpact on medical education and the training of future physicians. ADDITIONAL TRENDS AND PROBLEMS Many of the above trends will continue to exert an influence onmedical school curricula, but there are also several problems and trendswhich are due for more emphasis in the future. A few of these arebriefly described below.19 Consider the fact that the student spends as much time and energystudying the esoteric and rare diseases which he may never see, ratherthan studying and mastering the most common diseases which he will seealmost every day of his practicing career. This may be a natural resultof the specialization found in a university medical center where manypatients ere sent because of the facultyts special competency or researchinterest in rare or difficult problems. However, it does influence theclinical curriculum of the medical student.Also, consider that the examination system in the clinical sciences(and the basic sciences) is based on the rationale that most of thestudents know the common disorders and that the only way you can selector reward the best student is to test him on the rare or esoteric thusproviding the faculty with a ranking of competence among students fromthe most to the least competent. This is a myth, because students then study and aim for the esoteric or E:he minutiae rather than mastering themost common problems. At best he ends up well trained in perhaps 70per cent of the common problems and 70 per cent of the esoteric problems,rather than 100 per cent of the common problems and perhaps 50 per cent ofthe esoteric ones which he may never see.Another concern is that the medical student receives almost hisentire training in a hospital setting with patients who are acutely ill,whereas in real-life, he will be spending most of his time, energy,and expertise treating patients who are ambulatory, rather than bed-ridden, and who are chronically ill, rather than acutely ill. Thisdoes not imply that he should not have mastered a certain level oftraining for hospitalized patients who are acutely ill, but it shouldnot mean that it receive 90% of his curriculum time.A final discouraging note is the observation that most of theexamining and changing of curriculum today involves the rearrangement 20 of the basic sciences with some clinical science involvement, while mostof the clinical clerkships are essentially unexamined and unchanged.On the encouraging side, there are several movements in the direc-tion of rectifying some of the gross inadequacies in the clinicalcurriculum.Among these are the formation of self-instruction programs,of departments of family medicine or primary care, the increase inambulatory training, the trend to use more community hospitals andcommunity physicians in the teaching programs, the increased involvementwith community medicine, and the problem solving or problem orientedapproach to learning clinical medicine.It must be recognized that medical education decisions are stillbeing made by clinical specialists who have considerable vestedinterest in the present training programs. Also, with the new moneyand emphasis in primary care, many of the clinical specialists aretaking the position that they are, and have been, practicing primarycare, and that they will give more emphasis to primary care in thetraining of their own specialists. This could have a very positiveeffect if it is approached with the goal of improving the primary caretraining of the physician and the primary care of the population. THE IMPLICATIONS FOR BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE Having identified eleven trends which are actively influencingmedical school curricula today, it is important to consider each trendin terms of its implications for the teaching of the behavioral sciencesin medical schools. 1.Irrelevance Challenged for the Sake of Relevance and Meaning.It would seem obvious that a behavioral scientist does notwant to design his teaching as being irrelevant to the training ofa physician.Nevertheless, this is often what happens when one selects 21 content primarily from the point of view of a particular behavioralscience discipline or the perspective of the behavioral scientist,rather than the needs of the medical student or the content that isrequired for the solving of medical problems.Since most behavioral science courses are of more recent origin,it behooves us not to follow the historical evolution of the basicsciences by attempting to develop our content as though we were teaching a pure discipline. The information explosion has occurred in thebehavioral sciences, as it has in the other sciences, but we mustconstantly demand that our faculty extract the behavioral sciencecontent from all the behavioral sciences and translate the content interms of relevance to medical problems. This does not exclude thepossibility of presenting theoretical or philosophical concepts, but itdoes demand that one understand and be able to demonstrate the tie-inor significance of the less relevant material. The student should beable to see the learning of the material as bringing him one step closerto his ultimate goal of becoming a physician. We will gain little byplaying the old academic game of cramming more and more facts into acourse because it is of interest to the discipline itself or theparticular behavioral scientist, projects a scholarly image, or main-tains academic standards.From the standpoint of survival as a basic science, the behavioralsciences can achieve a significant advantage over the other basic sciencesby or6nizing the behavioral science teaching on as relevant andmeaningful a basis as possible. This means that behavioral sciencecontent must be based on human behavior. As relevance becomes deter-mined more and more by clinical faculty rather than basic science facultyalone, it seems reasonable to predict that those basic sciences whichsurvive will have a high relevance and meaningfulness component. Thoseparts of the basic sciences which are more purely discipline oriented 22 will probably be moved back into the university undergraduate years or be eliminated entirely as irrelevant. 2.Early introduction of clinical teaching resulting in more relevance to the task of becoming a physician, an increase in clinical teaching time, a decrease in basic science teaching time, and an in- creased integration of the clinical and basic science disciplines. With the concept of the behavioral sciences being basic to all fieldsof medicine, we must put considerable effort into developing supportiveand bridging relationships with all clinical departments. This doesnot mean that behavioral scientists have to begin playing the clinician role.Indeed, we will be interpreted as a threat if we do so, but wemust seek relationships with clinical faculty on both a teaching andresearch basis. This will be of particular educational advantage tothe behavioral scientists, as it will teach them about the types ofclinical problem solving for which they are preparing the medical student.Thus, they will acquire the perspective of clinical medicineso that they can critique their own basic teaching in the behavioralsciences in terms of clinical relevance. Also,\"it will open manyepportunities for the behavioral science content to be integrated intoclinical teaching.One must remember that the content of all basic sciences is notretained in its basic disciplinary form by the practicing physician,but isintegrated and retained in the context of specific clinicalproblems of diagnosis, patient care, and mechanisms of disease. There-fore, the sooner we learn to integrate with those clinical problems,the more crucial we will become for the training of the physician.This is valid for all basic sciences.An additional point should be made for learnino: to think ofbehavioral science as an integrative discipline. Consider, for example, 23 that the expression of human behavior occurs at the interface betweenthe internal (physiological) environment and the external (social,cultural) environment of the patient. Thusbehavior becomes the logical end renult of uny disruption of hofnconttuliS either the internal. or external environment.Thus, behavior is the major mechanism available to the patient inorder to reestablish internal or external homeostasis. Since somechange of behavior is most often involved in biological and socialdysfunction, the teaching of behavioral science can be an effectiveintegrative medium to pull together the various biological and socialcomponents of illness and health. 3.Flexible curriculum with increase in electives and free time.The behavioral sciences are especially well suited for electives.Most required behavioral science courses cover such a broad area ofcontent that it is difficult for faculty or students to achieve muchin-depth instruction in any one area of behavior. Electives allow thestudent to select those additional areas in which he is most interested,and hence he will have the opportunity to learn the most. It alsoallows the faculty to offer an entire unit with a reasonable degree ofcontinuity and academic respectability.The common practice of allowing the fourth year of medical schoolto be essentially elective was initially seen as providing the studentwith an opportunity to return to the basic sciences and/Or to takespecial training in clinical areas in which he was either deficient orfelt the need for more advanced training. With the nearness ofgraduation and the impendihg responsibility for disease diagnosis andpatient care, most medical students have expressed little or no interestin the basic sciences during their fourth year.If the behavioralscientist can develop his teaching in the context of more relece andintegration with the clinical sciences, he will be better prepared to24 offer the fourth year medical student an elective experience thatrelates more closely to his professional and career goals. The idealwould be to combine the student's clinical interests and goals with thestudy of the basic science of human behavior in a medical problem solving situaLion. 4.The general adoption of the \"core\" curriculum concept.If a sincere attempt has been made to compile the core in terms ofa resynthesis of components of a discipline that are relevant andnecessary in solving a medical or patient problem, the core conceptcan do much to strengthen the basic science curriculum.There are many behavioral scientists who resist the core concept,however, because they feel that the behavioral sciences are too broador there is no identifiable core. This is probably true if one isattempting to formulate a unified multidisciplinary behavioral science.However, if one considers the large mosaic of the behavioral sciences,one has to recognize that there are at least some basic facts andconcepts; and that some of these basic facts and concepts are moreimportant or central than some others. Considering the type of medicalproblem to be solved by the physician, some behavioral science knowledgebecomes clearly more important or relevant than some other behavioralscience knowledge.In establishing a core for the behavioral science curriculum, itis important to recognize several dimensions of the problem. It is not sufficient merely to secure the most competent psychologists, sociolo-gists, anthropologists, etc., and ask each to summarize the basiccomponents of his discipline in as concrete and concise a form as possible.This may produce the bare essentials for understanding the 1n: iv5dncl disciplines of puc:holoiy, socioloj,u, an',hropolocv, etc., 25 but it may not be organized in a useful form, nor contain the mostimportant information cecessary for a student to understand a medical problem.In fact, it is very likely that a basic understanding ofthese disciplines will soon be a premedical requirement for admission to medical school.Likewise, the core can not be obtained by somehow locking all ofthe behavioral scientists in one room for several days, or even weeks,and expecLing them to agree on the validity and importance of variousunits within each separate discipline. This procedure can accomplisha lot, however, in terms of training the various behavioral scientiststo think and work together on a practical level.Even though the above methods are the most frequently used inbehavioral science teaching programs, it is even more valuable toapply a multidiscipline approach by incorporating the active partici-pation of one or more clinical faculty. This is one of the few placeswhere a faculty member trained both as a behavioral scientist and as aphysician can have an immediate payoff. The clinical input andclinical bridging can also be accomplished, however, by working closelywith a faculty member in a clinical discipline, such as, family medicine,internal medicine, or pediatrics. The behavioral scientist must be ableto become familiar with the clinical problems to be solved by thestudent physician. Likewise, the clinical faculty member must be ableto explore the various areas and topics within the behavioral scienceswhich might relate to or throw some light on these medical problems orpatient care situations.Once one has established the behavioral components which arerelevant to the practice of medicine, the task then becomes one oforganizing the content into some meaningful form. It should be remem-bored that, in the long run, most basic science knowledge will beretained primarily in the manner in which it is used, rather than in the .26 manner in which it is initially learned. Behavioral scientists mustkeep this constantly i mind as they develop and design learning unitswith both academic substance and professional relevance. There may appearto be no end to the underlying knowledge and theory which might seemappropriate to the purely discipline-oriented behavioral scientist.However, if one retains the emphasis on the bridging and the problemsolving needs, much theory can be put in perspective or assiged to anelective sequence.As stated earlier, the need is to design the behavioral sciencecontent so that it has its input at the most appropriate point andlevel during the entire medical school curriculum.After one knows the kinds of medical problems the student physicianwill be solving, the kinds of changes in behavior one is attempting toaccomplish, and the most appropriate point to introduce it, it is thenimportant to list the specific behavioral objectives for each segmentor teaching unit in the behavioral science curriculum. This is a stepthat is usually.omitted by most teaching disciplines because it reallyinvolves making explicit what you are trying to accomplish before youtry to accomplish it. It is on this pragmatic level that we come tothe realization that we are attempting to do more than to unravel orlogically portray the various components of a behavioral discipline.It will also help us differentiate the many gray areas between clinicalpsychiatry and the basic components of human behavior which relate toall areas of clinical medicine.In the selecting of core content for a particular behavioral scienceunit, it is especially important to examine the material in terms ofthe supporting data and the firmness with which we can make our state-ments or generalizations about the range of normal and abnormal humanbehavior.While this may seem like an unnecessary emphasis, the twomost frequent complaints lodged against some teachers of human behavior27 Is that what they have to teach is either common sense or is based on \"soft data.\"The objective here is to select the knowledge and dataabout which we can be both certain and relevant.Some day, we may be able to design a curriculum that will notrequire a complete relearning of a basic science in order for it tobe used.The basic science discipline that is able to.accomplish thatgoal should have no fear of being eliminated in curriculum revisions of the future. 5.Increase in enrollment.The increase in enrollment which has been demanded by many political,social, and community forces will have a major impact on the behavioralsciences through increased manpower needs. At present, there is a shortageof trained medical behavioral scientists to teach the required behavioralscience courses in medical schools at the existing level of enrollment. Ifone considers the standing needs of the new and developing medical schoolsand adds to that the expected increased in class size of all medicalschools, it becomes apparent that the same manpower pool of behavioralscientists will be required to teach an even heavier load then exists today.Teaching behavioral science in a medical school involves far morethan academic competence as a social scientist in a university departmenttransplanted into a medical setting, or than a professionally trainedpsychiatrist.It is important for medical schools with active multidisci-plinary behavioral science teaching programs to initiate training programsto produce the necessary medical behavioral scientists for the next fiveto ten years of increasing enrollment. If we fail to do this, manyschools will be forced to develop and teach behavioral science using socialscientists who have not'acquired an understanding of the needs of medicalstudents and medical practice, or by using psychiatrists who have notnecessarily had behavioral science training.The increase in enrollment and resultant increase in manpower needsmakes it imperative that behavioral scliptists immediately begin to develop self-instruction units. This will not reduce the teaching load as faculty-student dialogue is still important, but it will allow several behavioralscience programs to share content development which is very time consuming. 6.Decrease in the total traininr, time of the traditional curriculum.Several implications are relevant for the behavioral sciences. If thecurriculum of a particular school is moving in the direction of attemptingto combine parts or all of college and medical school, the behavioralsciences can play a unique role as an integrating science throughoutthe college and medical school training. This is apt to be especiallytrue when attempts are made to introduce clinical medicine early in thecurriculum, as social and psychological factors can often be observedmore easily than some underlying physiological or biological mechanism.An attempt can also be made to make the behavioral science courses incollege more relevant to the eventual goal of practicing medicine.One of the major difficulties is that the behavioral sciences areoften taught by the Departments of Psychology, Sociology, and Anthro- pology.Unless there is planned integration and correlation, this canresult in a purely disciplinary approach to the teaching of behavioralscience with the loss of relevance and meaningfulness as far as thedeveloping physician is concerned.The compressing of four traditional years of medical school intothree years by using all vacation, free time, and electives, is thecommon approach to shortening the training time for physicians. Thebehavioral scientists will not suffer any more than any other facultywith an accelerated teaching and work load, except they will becomeoverloaded more quickly due to the more rapid growth of the behavioralsciences and the short supply of trained faculty. The main person tosuffer will be the student without time to relax, consolidate, orexplore areas of intellectual and professional curiosity.If the pressure on the medical student increases too greatly, the29 behavioral sciences can suffer by becoming the target of the student'sanxiety or agitated depression, whereby the student attempts to lightenthe pressure and overload by attacking the discipline or disciplinesthat appear to have less survival value in terms of his immediate goalof not flunking out of medical school. Vie can expect that this willbe directed toward the newer disciplines, such as behavioral sciences,humanities, family medicine, etc.It is also possible that if medical school faculties are pressuredto shorten the training time for the M.D. without reexamining the contentof all courses, the behavioral sciences and more recent disciplines willbe in greater jeopardy of losing curriculum time in the reshuffling ofthe medical school courses. 7.Increased interest in research on the learning process and inthe medical student as a learner.This trend provides some comfort and safety for the behavioralscientist, partly because much of the work is being done by otherbehavioral scientists through Departments, or Divisions, of Researchin Medical Education. As new evaluation criteria and measures aredeveloped and applied to existing curricula, medical educators arebeginning to reexamine many of the more traditional and heretoforeunchallenged educational methods in the training of a physician.Behavioral science teaching units should most certainly takeadvantage of some of the innovations being developed by their fellowbehavioral scientists in order to improve their own instruction in thebehavioral sciences. This new interest in the learning processcan help us lead th' way among medical school faculties, so thatour teaching will be especially meaningful, relevant, effective, andefficient.Its difficUlt for anyone to criticize, or eliminate, ateaching program that rates high on relevance and meaningfulness. 8.Increase in self-instructional opportunities and independent study.The self - instructional 'snit, independent study, multiple tracks,.30 and electives will have much influence on behavioral science teaching,as it will on most basic science and clinical disciplines in medicalschools.As has been expressed above, disciplines with less identifiablecontent will be forced to work much harder at the task of identifying an3organizing(and possibly defending) such content. Since this isprobably the highest priority need for teaching programs in the behavioralsciences, this trend will have a very beneficial effect on our developingteaching programs.We should not assume that just because most of the other basicsciences have already identified their content, that they will be ableto design self-instruction packages any better than behavioral scientists.Some may have an even more difficult time with the task, since theyhave an overabundance of content which will have to be reorganized.At Hershey, we are actively converting parts of our behavioralscience teaching program into self-instruction units and will continueto develop new units and materials. Our experience thus far has beensuccessful and rewarding.If behavioral scientists can begin thinking in these terms anddesigning new content on as much of a self-instructional basis aspossible, we will be much farther ahead of other teaching disciplines.We should be able to use it as an opportunity to help us define ourcontent and improve our teaching to the point of freeing our facultyfor what they do best: interacting in a real dialogue with students. 9.A shift in attitude and preparation of the entering medicalstudent.This shift, discussed in the trends above, has several implicationsfor the teaching of behavioral science. With the competition for entranceinto medical school becoming even more tough than it has been in thepast, the characteristics of the medical student may change in thedirection of those seeking the highest grades and those with exceptional31 ability to score high on paper and pencil tests, such as the MCAT, Inorder to impress medical school admissions comm'ttees, students maytry to outdo each other by taking as many science courses as they can,at the exclusion of much of the social sciences and humanities. Thefear of many medical educators is that this could produce an extremelybright, but lather narrowly-educated person who may be refractory tosocial, behavioral, humanitarian concerns. The practice of medicineis still more pragmatic and humanitarian than intellectual or abstract.On the other hand, with the present increase in the new activistgeneration of students, impatient with the abuses of society anddetermined to encourage confrontation with educators, politicians, andindustrialists, we may find that more of the entering medical studentsare unusually receptive to the social and behavioral sciences. If wedemonstrate a concern for the.. relevance of the behavioral sciences toThe practice of medicine, to patient care, and to cocial and environ-mental changes, we can most surely capture the interest of this newkind of medical student.One pitfall should be mentioned. Many students (and sometimesfaculty) are apt to see the behavioral sciences as providing the neededtools and techniques for social and political change. While we maybeable to offer more help and know-how than other medical school disci-plines, this can also become a trap and can severely distort the contentof the courses by making them exclusively action-oriented. Such afield experience can serve as a valuable laboratory exercise, but itmust be carefully planned to include substantive content and attitudes.We must not lose sight of the goal of understanding the social andbehavioral factors which interact in disease, patient care, and health.Our primary task is still to train the best possible physician, butwe can also assist him to develop his skill as a social change agent. 10.An increased interest in the role of human behavior in thetrainincr, of physicians.With the increased interest and receptiveness of curriculum 32 committees, the behavioral scientist is apt to find himself withavailable teaching tine, but without available teaching faculty ororganized content to present to the student. The need for trainedmedical behavioral science teachers has already been mentioned above,however, whit these teachers do is also important. As in Parkinson'slaw, there is a tendency to fill whatever time is made available. Thiscan be a great hazard for a new discipline or a new teaching groupunless the focus is on well organized and relevant content.The increased interest in human behavior is not limited to thebehavioral sciences, but also includes the disciplines of psychiatry,1,diatrics, psychosomatic medicine, etc. An important task of thebehavioral scientist is to differentiate those aspects of humanbehavior which are basic to all areas of clinical medicine versus thoseareas basic primarily to clinical psychiatry; Psychiatry and behavioralscience must use every opportunity to work and teach closely together,however, behavioral science must be willing and able to assume themajor responsibility for teaching the basic science of human behaviorat all levels of the medical curriculum.Since most medical students are starved for some contact with patients,the clinical presentation can be used as an effective teaching mechanism.Much social science content can be learned best in the context of apatient and his problem if we are careful to make explicit the behavioralscience Objectives of each patient demonstration. One warning:thebehavioral sciences are often awed by the opportunities for relevancethrough patient contact without giving equal concern for content. Wemust do both.If vie can learn this lesson, we will be far ahead of theether basic sciences.The behavioral sciences and clinical psychiatry are the most logicalallies: for students and faculty interested in yLychosociFil factors and illness.However, neither of us can afford to be the only department or academic croup assigned that responsibility. it mu3t also be the con-cern of all faculty and disciplines, just as an humanitarian concernmust be the active and continuing responsibility of all faculty and disciplines.The fact that we may know more about the social andpsychological factors than other disciplines, should not be confused withassuming the major responsibility for the integration or reinforcementof these factors.Again, if the social and behavioral factors are really importantin the training of a physician and in patient care, it becomes thebehavioral scientist's responsibility constantly to search for relevantcore content and for the most appropriate time to teach this contentduring the four years of the medical curriculum. Just because we areattempting to define ourselves as a basic science discipline does notmean that we are limited to the basic science years.One of the most significant developments that will influencebehavioral science teaching in medical schools is the establishment ofThe Behavioral Science Test Committee of the National Board of MedicalExaminers.The National Board has been studying the increase inbehavioral science teaching since 1967. In March, 1969 an Ad HocCommittee on Behavioral Sciences was appointed and as a result of thework of this committee, experimental test material was developed.Since behavioral science is considered to be basic to all of the clinicaldisciplines and occupies curricula time largely within the preclinicalyears, it was decided that the subject should be included in Part I.The first experimental material was included in the June, 1971Part I exam.On the basis of the performance data on those experimentalitems and a review of the need for more emphasis on the biological,psychological, socio-cultural and environmental aspects of behavior,the Executive Committee of the National Board authorized in October, 1971,a permanent Behavioral Science Test Committee and the inclusion of 34 questions in the 1972 Part I Examination. The nunber of questionswill be comparable to the other six subjects (anatomy, biochemistry,microblology, pathology, pharmacology, and physiology) and the behavioralscience questions will be included in computing the total score of eachexaminee, although a behavioral science subscore will not be reportedthe first year.The implications of this development are that the behavioralsciences have indeed come of age, are now gaining \"official\" academiccredibility, and will be entering the medical student survival systemwith full membership. Even though many behavioral scientists mighthave preferred to continue to work outside the system, most are goingto be needed to plan and work for the continued development of thebehavioral sciences. This does not mean that we should abandon attemptsto change the present system, but should provide a toe hold and oppor-tunity to help design a new system, except now we will be playing thegame for real! 11.Emphasis on Family Medicine and Primary Care.With the establishment of new departments of family medicine andprograms in primary care, we can expect that this trend will add con-siderable force to continuing curriculum change. Several aspects ofthis trend are important to the behavioral sciences.As medical educators attempt to respond to governmental support,public demands, and the need for continuing comprehensive care, thebehavioral sciences will become more and more involved with these efforts;first, because so much of the neglected part of patient care involvesbehavioral factors, and second, even though our skills and knowledgemay be grossly underdeveloped in comparison to the other medical sciences,we still represent the major available resource for teachingiresearch andevaluation in the behavioral areas. A largo part of the curriculumcontent of any teaching program in family medicine or primary care will require the participation of behavioral scientists.The research skills of the behavioral scientist will be of specialvalue to these developing programs since so many of the \"unknowns\"either involve behavioral factors or will require behavioral research skills.For example the needs, values, and practices of the consumer(the patient) are almost unknown. Many medical educators have ideasabout patient needs and behaviors, and we know that it is not just thestringent application of good scientific medicine that is required, butwe have not identified and documented the nature and dynamics of thehuman factors involved. Medicalscience has operated on the veryunscientific assumption that if we can control or alter the metabolism,the infeCtion, the pharmacology or the hemodynamics, the behavioral orsocial or human factors will take care of themselves. We are now inthe midst of a reassessment of this tragic error in scientific judgment.The behavioral sciences can not promise solutions, but we do have manyof the scientific research skills and methods which will be imperativeto any solution.In terms of teaching content, the behavioral sciences must appre-ciate and develop the excellent opportunities for bridging and translatingbehavioral science into clinical medicine. Such conjoint teachingopportunities can help strengthen both areas. Also, the behavioralsciences should be able to help family medicine and primary care programsidentify the knowledge, skills and attitudes required and how they canbe lealmed.Since the behavioral sciences have most recently struggledwith the task of synthesizing content from a very large area of socialscience and human biology, the behavioral scientist should be able tohelp family medicine evolve through. this most important first step inacademic survival.Another evolution through which family medicine must pass, is the 36 complicated and hazardous passage into academic credibility and accep- tence.Though we are at different evolutionary stages, there is somesimilarity between the family medicine Gnd the behavioral science situa-tions: we exist in part because of a void or imbalance in patient careand academic medicine; vie are relative newcomers to the medical schoolscene; we have evolved out of a very broad and general informationalsystem; we have many of the same problems in attempting to synthesizea body of information and concepts relevant to the training of a physician;and we have many of the same survival hazards attempting to becomeestablished and accepted in a fairly traditional academic system. Thebehavioral sciences have passed through many of the same evolutionarystages as psychiatry passed thru more than a decade ago. Now, familymedicine has appeared on the scene; in many instances as an uninvitedguest who happens to have the support of a rich uncle.Each medical school situation can be quite different, of course.In some schools, psychiatry has been the supporter and promoter of thebehavioral sciences, while in other schools, psychiatry has felt threatened and insecure.Likewise, family physicians may be seen as supportingcolleagues in some schools and as a threat to the specialists domain in others.Some medical schools are attempting to establish a cleardemarcation between family medicine and primary care with the hope thatthe specialties will be able to reassemble enough commitment toprimary care and continuing care to satisfy the public demand andcontrol the shift occurring in the entire health care delivery system.There is no way to determine the outcome of this particular trend,but it will do a lot to modify medical education. The behavioral scienceswill do well to offer some of their expertise and to use every opportunityto engage in cooperative teaching and research endeavors.In summary, changes in medical education are occurring at a morerapid rate today than ever before. The eleven trends identified in this37 paper are not intended to include all of the forces or changes exertingan influence on medical education today. Rather, they represent someof the more active movements and include those trends which will influence,.and be influenced by, the behavioral sciences.Before these trends are replaced or reversed they will most certainlyaccomplish some real changes in medical education in terms of morerelevance, more clinical involvement, more physician graduates in lesstime, with more flexible and effective learning situations, more selfinstruction with students with better academic preparation, with moresocial conscience, and with a rediscover' the patient and primary care.Tho behavioral sciences will have an important role in these new curricula.The hope is that both the physician and the patient willbe the better for the changes.

Thislocalizing visibility has been enhanced in several medical schoolsby departments of psychiatry naming or renaming themselves to includethe designation behavioral sciences in the departmental heading.However, clinical neurology, pediatrics, community and publichealth medicine, and many preclinical basic medical sciences, to name _43 less than every instance, include frequently within their research,training, or service domains both behavioral scientists and their sciences.Very recently, for example, a textbook has appeared withthe title Behavioral Science in Pediatric Medicine.(6)It is quite obvious that the theory and knowledge which informseducation, training, research, and practi in psychiatry can be allo-cated, like much other scientific informaon in general medicine, tothe commonly accepted and established sciences such as biology, psychology,sociology, anthropology, and their subdivisions. However, a scienceis determined not by its subject matter but by its methods. Hence,any happening, whether in the laboratory or in the clinic, can becomethe object of scientific scrutiny and validation. An impressiveamount of theory construction and experimental validation of theoryby psychiatrists, themselves, has given rise to much scientific know-ledge about behavior.Probably the most cogent reasons, then, for an explicit or impli-cit designation of psychiatry--a medical clinical specialty--as a be-havioral science must be sought not in the taxonomy of science butin the historical and contemporary sociology and culturology of psy- chiatry.I do not, therefore, wish to get entangled in any emotion-ladencontroversy about the classificatory appropriateness of designatingpsychiatry a behavioral science. In the pursuit of the major objectivesof how the knowledge about human behavior can be most comprehensively,most resourcefully, most impactfully, most helpfully, and most rele-vantly developed, taught and used in medical theory and practice, thelabeling of organizational divisions in a medical school is a quitesecondary problem. Nevertheless, some of the current uncertainties andambiguities associated with the teaching of behavioral science in med- 44 Leal schools may be clarified by attempting an analysis of the deter-minants of the trend to conceptualize psychiatry as behavioral science.Before trying to specify some of these social and cultural deter-minants, let us define the behavioral sciences, when they refer speci-fically to human beings, as all of those sciences concerned with thedescription and understanding of the human body living as a social per- son.Although for heuristic and pragmatic purposes behavior and behav-ing uay be conceptualized frequently as if it is not also biologicalaction, there would appear to he no particular logical merit in restrict-ing the term \"behavioral science\" to the various constructions of dis-embodied behavior which constitute frequently the conceptual models ofpsychology and the social sciences. So, too, it is obvious that notall of the independent variables influencing behavior are consideredcorrectly as existing \"within\" the body. Unfortunately, some humanbiology still remains the study of ahistorical, desocialized, and de-personalized bodies. The behavioral sciences, therefore, are at leastbiology, psychology, sociology, anthropology, political science, econom-icsall writ large--and history, insofar as it is retrospective soc-iology and anthropology in the widest sense of these sciences,Historically, psychiatry was the main portal of entry for theintroduction of behavioral knowledge directly into its own theory andpractice and indirectly, therefore, into the rest of medicine. Cer-tainly most medical faculties today are prepared to grant that thesciences of behavior are at least basic to psychiatry and, hence, in-directly if not directly basic to all of medicine.Other basic medical science disciplines such as anatomy, bio-chemistry, microbiology, and physiology were also originally developedand taught in medical schools by clinicians. (5) However, researchand teaching in these sciences were subsequently taken over by non- 45 clinical research scientists who established themselves as separatebasic science medical school departments. In spite of the creationwithin very recent years of a few behavioral science departments inthe basic science curriculum of the medical school, behavioral sciencedissemination in medical education and practice has remained largelythe responsibility of clinical teachers in psychiatry. Hence, inreality, psychiatrists have been, and are, behavioral scientists iffor no other reason than they have represented and do represent be-havioral science knowledge in medicine.Moreover, the development of psychoanalysis within psychiatrictheory and practice provided a psychological theory and therapeutictechnology under almost the exclusive control and concern of clinicalpsychiatrists. Both the strength and the weakness of psychoanalysisconsidered as behavioral science resides in the fact that so much ofits scientific validation has depended on clinical research. In fact,one can think of psychoanalysis as an unique instance in contemporaryscience of a behavioral science without experimenting scientists, ifthe distinction between basic and applied science, between the scientistand the engineer, has any significance. In any event, however, thepsychoanalyst is identifiable as a behavioral scientist and it is hewho, because he is in psychiatry, has contributed significantly tothe actuality that psychiatry is almost exclusively the representativeof psychoanalytic behavioral science.Shortly after World War II psychology began to demonstrablyinfluence psychiatry through the increasing number of psychometriciansand clinical psychologists who came to work in the psychiatric hospi- tal and clinic. This invasion into psychiatry of psychologists edu-cated and trained in university departments of psychology could haveresulted in the transplantation into psychiatry of a broader based46 and ba!;ic psychological research activity and in the introduction intopsychiatric thinking of the whole s?ectrum of psychological theory extant in the universities. For various reasons both within and withoutthe practice of psychiatry, the optimal openness of psychiatric think-ing to general psychological research and theory did not occur. From1940 until relatively recently, both because of external opportunityand internal desire, clinical psychology developed rapidly by identi-fying largely with the theory and practice of the psychiatrist. Itwas rare during that period to find either a clinical psychologist ora p!qchiatrist in a medical school department of phychiatry, who wasat all familiar with the theory and research of the contemporary general psychology.The introduction of clinical psychology into psychiatry did not,therefore, result in psychiatry becoming a repository of general psy-chological science within medicine. Nevertheless, the inclusion oflarge numbers of clinical psychologists within departments of psy-chiatry gives further affirmation to the designation of psychiatry as a behavioral science department.In the assessment of future trends, it is interesting to observethat many university departments of psychology are now phasing out their clinical psychology programs. At the same time, clinical psy7chological practice is being greatly influenced by other psychologicaltheories than psychoanalysis and is being considerably diluted by non-medical and nondisease models for the explanation and modification ofbehavioral impairment. We are witnessing the secularization of psycho-therapy into education and the widening of the therapeutic communityinto the environmental evocation and shaping of adaptive behavior byother social institutions rather :han only by those social organiza- tions designated as hospitals. 47 Many of the clinical psychologists who are now in medical schoolpsychiatry are change agents for the introduction into psychiatric andgeneral medical education of this recent behavioral science knowledgeand its applications. The conflict with traditional psychiatry is ob-vious and its productive resolution will create several differentorganizational adaptations within medical education which will thenoffer an opportunity for a study of their effectiveness and efficiency.For at least the last 30 years, the sciences about social man,particularly social psychology, sociology, and anthropology, have beenrepresented increasingly in psychiatry. Social class, life-style, andcross-cultural observations have long aided epidemiologic studies ingeneral medicine as well as in psychiatry. More recently, changes inpsychiatric practice relating to the therapeutic community and to grouptherapy have necessitated heavy reliance on the knowledge about theorganization and processes of social groups. And in the last decade,the preoccupation of psychiatry with the development of social and com-munity resources with which to react to persons -defined as ill, andwith which to reduce behavioral impairment and to promote increasedbehavioral competence for persons not yet defined as sick has putpsychiatry into close association with social scientists. Such needshave also encouraged psychiatry to expand on its own initiative, clinicalresearch into the natural setting of the community.Social scientists, therefore, are represented in greater num-bers in departments of psychiatry than in other divisions of the medical school.Clinical psychiatrists are also doing an increasing amount ofteaching of social science and of research into the social context ofbehavior either with or without the collaboration of social scientists.Hence, like the situation obtaining for psychoanalysis and psy-chology, the department of psychiatry is both the major organizational 48 home within medicine of the social scientists and a substantial sourceof the teaching, applicatior, and research development by psychiatristsof social science knowledge. This latter fact, particularly, can headduced as an additional justification for calling psychiatry a be-havioral science.It is of more than derivative interest to recall that the enrich-ment of psychiatry by the social sciences has had a parallel recipro- city.Many sociologists and anthropologists have been influenced bypsychoanalytic and psychiatric thinking. Even though many such scholarsworked outside of medicine, they nevertheless helped form relevantsocial science theory and knowledge for use in medicine and psychiatry.Thus, the psychiatrist has been offered from the university, gratuitous-ly and lrequently, easily assimilable and applicable behavioral science information.The increasing concern of psychiatry and of medicine in generalwith the neurosciences and with behavioral biology has been expressedin recent years by the growing number of neurophysiologists, biochem-ists, psychopharmacologists, geneticists, psychophysiologists, andneuropsychologists who are members of the teaching and research fac-ulties of departments of psychiatry. The curricula of psychiatricresidency training and education also reflect this developing inter-est in behavioral knowledge.The advent of psychoanalysis into psychiatry and the consequentemphasis on psychologic constructs to describe and to explain behav-ior and to direct behavioral change techniques was one of the reasonswhy medical school departments of psychiatry had moved away, largelyby 1945, from an intimate, sometimes intradepartmental, associationwith clinical neurology. Perhaps more importantly, the theoreticalmodels of brain structure and process extant at that time did not accom- 49 modate very resourcefully the conceptual variables of prevailing psy-chological theory.However, while the break away from neurology was occurring, psy-chosomatic medicine was evolving and creating research, teaching, andclinical practice collaboration between psychiatry and many othermedical departments and specialties. The earlier problems in corre-lating brain and behavior which made clinical neurology and its asso-ciated neuroscience less valuable to the psychiatry of two or threedecades ago did not inhibit the development of psychosomatic medicine.Psychiatry reestablished a close affiliation with clinical medicineby way of psychosomatic theory and research. Psychosomatic thinkingand experimentation flourished along with the progress in both thebasic and the clinical medical sciences in the study.of general per-ipheral neurophysiology.By contrast, the new contemporary thrust in behaVioral biologyand the return of the neurosciences to psychiatry has been largely dueto the evgipring theory and knowledge about central rather than peri- pheral neurophysiology. This trend has culminated in the growingexperimental evidence that, like the voluntary somatomotor system,autonomic effector action is governed by feedback and memory inform-ation and is sensitively modulated for adaptive learning, both respond-ently and operantly, by the general integrative activity of the central nervous system. (3)The emergence in medicine within the last decade of a clinicallyrelevant behavioral biology is steadily eroding the importance of ;Arpsychosomatic medicine as a separate discipline. (4) This transform-ation of psychosomatic theory largely associated with psychiatry into ageneral clinical psychophysiology for all of medicine is both a con-sequence and a determining cause of the changing role of the behavioral 50 !;ciences in medical education, theory, and practice.On the one hand, existing basic biologic science departments inmedical schools are becoming interested and concerned with the bio-logy of behavior and are extending their research collaboration withbehavioral scientists. This is occurring most notably, perhaps, be-tween pharmacology and experimental psychology, but also to an increas-ing extent among physiology, p3ychology, and the social sciences inthe study of psychosocial stressors. As has already been suggested,medical neurophysiology is extensively working and teaching in the do-main of brain and behavior. Behavioral genetics and molecular bio-logy is another germinal collaboration within basic medical science.All of this suggests the continued growth of the inclusion ofbehavioral scientists within existing basic science departments ofthe medical school. It can also be used to document one of the mostimportant arguments for the creation of a basic medical behavioralscience department, that is, the facilitation of collaborative bio-behavioral research and teaching in the total basic science group inmedicine.Particularly at the basic science level, the human bodyshid, be researched and conceptually presented to students as aliving social person.So, too, the presence of a general basic science and clinicalpsychophysiology, by which we always mean, of course, a psychosocialphysiology, tends to enforce the fact of a normal, that is to say,of a medically ubiquitous psychophysiology. The older concept ofpsychosomatic medicine, identifying a few diseases as within itsspecial ken and looking to psychiatry as its preferred authority,emphasized, wittingly or no, that knowledge about the behaving personwas important only for those patients formally labeled with a person-ality-specific or a conflict-specific diagnosis selected from the 51 psychiatric nomenclature of deviance.Teaching behavioral knowledge collaboratively with anatomy,physiology, biochemistry, and other basic medical sciences, withoutidiosyncratic and adventitious earmarks that communicate to themedical student a highly restricted or special use of such information,must be the goal of any teaching program in behavior, whether imple-mented by a department of psychiatry or by any other department.in assessing trends in medical education, we must consider atleast one additional consequence of teaching human behavior the wayother basic medical science information is taught, that is, as basicto all of medicine and not merely to psychiatry. If the outcome is tocreate in medical students, and subsequently in practitioners, thedesire and capability of bringing behavioral information to bear onevery medical problem-seeing and problem-solving task, then the con-sultation and referral relationships of nonpsychiatric and psydhiatricphysicians will probably alter considerably. The direction of thischange toward either an increase or a decrease in the use of the psy-chiatrist for consultation and therapeutic referral cannot, I think, bepredicted confidently. One. could hope, however, that the nonpsychia-trie doctor might be more resourceful, more effective, and more con-fident in the comprehensive understanding and management of the patient.He might then be less inclined to neglect the behavioral aspects of ill-ness, less ready to intimidate himself from being an effective psy-chotherapist, and less apt either to refuse irrationally to refer tothe psychiatrist or to make such a referral unnecessarily.Some of the other intellectual disciplines concerned with thesocial organization of human behavior, such as political science andeconomics, are scarcely represented at all in medicine or psychiatry.The recent addition to the Harvard Medical School of economists placed 52 organizationally directly under the Dean indicates presumably an un-certainty both as to whether such disciplines are to be consideredbehavioral science and as to where such scholars should be placed inthe departmental terrain of the medical school. Nevertheless, it isobvious that in terms either of epidemiology or of the adequate provisionof preventive and reparative health care, economic theory and practicemay have more to do with physical and sociocultural sanitation andwith the efficiency and effectiveness of the doctor's job than, for ex-ample, a myopically exclusive concentration on the sociology of the city.With the exception of these latter subjects of economics andpolitical science, the behavioral sciences in medicine are representedin almost every department of psychiatry either by some combinationand number of behavioral scientists, themselves, or by psychiatristswho represent more or less adequately some or all of the behavioralsciences.Administrative concerns and constraints and the associatedsecurity operations of the faculty are likely to dominate the discussionof values and ideas in medical education. It is necessary, therefore,to guard vigorously against being.caught up in the pressure to pre-occupy oneself with questions of feasibility and preference about theorganizational place of behavioral science in medicine. For purposesboth of demonstration and assessment, all of the readily obvious organ-izational possibilities are in existence. These may be summed up as follows:1) Behavioral scientists in departments of psychiatry andin other clinical and basic science departments withfull-time or part-time appointments either exclusive-ly within the medical school department or conjointlywith other university departments or with separate schools; 1.)The divisional or sccilonal organization of the behav- ioral science faculty within a department, particularlywithin a department of psychiatry;3) A formally combined department of psychiatry and behav-ioral science;4) Behavioral scientists attached to some administrative unit;5) A separate department of behavioral sciences.The independent department of behavioral science is an organ-izational arrangement that makes most overt the basic concerns ofpsychiatry about the teaching of behavioral knowledge in medicine.A fundamental issue, present in any medical educational relation-ship between psychiatrists and nonpsychiatric behavioral scientists,centers around the assessment by psychiatrists of the adequacy andvalidity of theories of behavior and of the relevant and appro-priate applicability of the information and techniques engenderedby those theories. This poses the related problem of the extentto which psychiatry can or should control what knowledge about be-havior and behavioral change is taught, by whom, and where in the curriculum.Obviously, psychiatry like every medical specialty is eagerto develop or to seek out new and useful knowledge in order to dothe doctor's job more effectively. Neither psychiatry nor the restof the clinical medical disciplines are accustomed to depending ona basic science department of behavior for the development and intro-duction of new behavioral knowledge. It must be recognized, too,that currently there is a distinct trend in the medical school forclinical medicine to teach more and more of its own basic science.From this viewpoint, separate departments of behavioral science may 54 be bucking a historical current. Departments of psychiatry, histor-ically lacking a basic preclinical ally of a department of behavior,may now find themselves in the vanguard of medical change by havingremained and expanded as combined basic and clinical science depart- ments.Whatever the direction and outcome of these current trends, thefollowing essential directives seem pertinently urgent with refer-ence to psychiatry and the behavioral sciences in medical education: 1)it is essential to achieve and maintain an integrated pre-sentation of theories and information about the behaving human body.Medical school curricula of behavioral scienceshould not, as they now do, arrange themselves into bi-modal content distributions of behavioral biology and thepsychological and social sciences. Neither should theoriesof human behavior which have become professionally com-fortable for psychiatrists prevent the teaching, examin-ation, and use of other theories and of the informationvalidated experimentally under their aegis.2) Whatever the medical organizational source of the behavior-al curriculum, it must be taught and applied in an inti-mate collaboration with the teaching and application ofanatomical, physiological, pharmacologic, biochemical,and other basic medical science knowledge.3) The ability to conceptualize and to understand a behavingperson must be taught and learned as a basis for subse-quent general clinical application to any medical problemand to any person of medical concern whether defined asnormal or labeled as a psychiatric abnormality.4) Mostly because of the recent rapid development of the be- havioral sciences, the behavioral scientists, themselves,should be present on, or work closely with, both pre-clinical and clinical medical faculties in order to ade-quately and critically represent the knowledge and methodsof their disciplines and to supervise and conduct the ap-propriate research into problems of medical relevance. Whenthis organizational base of the behavioral scientists iswithin a department of psychiatry, these scientists musthave support for their scholarly autonomy and authenticityintradepartmentally as well as in research and teachingactivity outside the department. 56 REFERENCES I.Cope, O.:Man, Mind and Medicine.

Hughes, Ph.D.Michigan State University Donald A. Kennedy, Ph.D.Harvard University Our purpose is that of commenting on relationships betweenanthropology and medical education. The obvious first step is toclarity what we are talking about in terms appropriate to the task at hand.Let us therefore try to do so--hriefly. Yet it is not soeasy to characterize anthropology succinctly (or, perhaps, any disciplinefor that matter).* A dictionary definition does not really do it, andthe trouble with not characterizing or defining it at ail is that wemay each think of its corporate nature in much the same way as the severalIndian blind men conceived of the totality of the elephant- -we take the little we are familiar with for the whole of the matter.At some levels there is obviously considerable overlap among theseveral behavioral science fields in concept, terminology, and method--one of the reasons, no doubt, that grouping them together into a\"behavioral science\" division or department is so easily justified in amedical faculty. (lt is interesting, by way of comparison, that thereare no \"biological science\" departments in medical schools; this hasto do, no doubt, not with degrees of differentiation of the broad (*)Cf. Two recent publications that bear on this problem as it isrelated to our present concerns: Von Mering and Kasdan (eds.),1970; and the report of the Behavioral and Social Sciences Surveyon anthropology, (1970), Smith and Fischer (eds.) 61 subject matter areas but rather with historical recency and relative .functional importance of the behavioral sciences in the medical education scene.)But internal differences do exist, of course, especiallyat the level of the philosophic configuration in which the world is viewed.So, with apologies to our colleagues, we will offer abrief characterization of the field of anthropology that takes theform not of a definition, per se, but rather of a sketch of the main ideas of the discipline., those that in their interaction comprise itsbasic structure.There are several such major themes, assumptions, or conceptualorientations, that interweave the diverse researches and problem-choices made by practitioners of the field; and such assumptions, forthe most part implicit, are operative in an \"anthropological\" characteri-zation of a problem and its study. They constitute a hidden agenda,a body of usually unverbalized understandings in discussions amonganthropologists--and often, therefore, by reason ofnot being madeexplicit, animpediment to fundamental communication across behavioralscience disciplinary barriers. Let us, therefore, try to isolatesuch basic themes or assumptions, for they inform many of the methods,techniques, and concepts employed by practitioners of \"anthropology\"and after that consider what contributions these may make to medical education.We would see six basic themes as characterizing the conceptualframe of reference in which anthropological inquiry is conducted, themeswhich, taken together as a \"syndrome,\" have differentiated it for a longtime from neighboring behavioral sciences.* (*)Some passages in the next several pages are adapted from theintroduction to Charles C. Hughes (ed.), Make Men of Them: IntroductoryReadings for Cultural Anthropology, Chicago: Rand McNally, 1972.6 The first of these is the species-centered character of the Field.Rcior4less of how widely each of the behavioral sciences may rangebeyond their implicit Intellectual loci and of how many other contingentphenomena they begin to study, such problem-frameworks seem to remainas basic anchoring points that implicitly inform many discussions of thenature of the fields. Thus, if it may be proposed that for sociologythe primary reference concept in the study of human behavior is theconcept of society, its forms and sub-systems; and for psychology as a discipline the central focus is on psycho - biological process in oneform or another; then for anthropology, such a point of entry would beman taken in the biological sense of an entire species, homo sapiens.Thus itis clear that the three primary behavioral science fields ar:.not simply differently-shaped pieces cut from the same cloth; on thecontrary, they differ rather markedly so far as the nature and implicationsof their points of entry into the empirical world are concerned.Again, it should be stressed that the natural history of inquiry.in the evolution of each of the behavioral solemn disciplines hastaken them into many common problem areas, such that it is sometimesdifficult (and of Len unnecessary) to discern wl,ether'the given investi-gator is a sociologist, psychologist, or anthropologist. Thus, forexample, studies of socialization have been done by all three disciplines,studies of social organization, mental health, etc. But there usuallyremains, in an almost atavistic manner, something of the attachmentto, or \"imprinting\" from, the central stamp of the disciplinaryassumptions and orientations that give coherence to the body (ortlsyndrome\") of concepts distinguishing each discipline and serving ascorporate values for the group of scholars differentiating themselves by use of the disciplinary label.. However difficult it is for any one person to live up to thedemands of such an intellectual commitment (the day of Alfred Kroebersand Ralph Lintons has apparently passed), it is such an open-endedcommitment that, more than anything else, provides the unifying conceptfor anthropology as a discipline and creates a degree of intellectualcoherence out of studies of man's evolutionary past and current dif-ferentiation, bodily form and mental functioning, settlement patternsand social organization, artifactual manipulations, symbolic productions,growth and development--in other words, nothing that is part of the lifeand behavior of man as an animal form is excluded by academic fiatfrom corporate investigation. It is, then, a model for the formationof discipline or field of study that is clearly based on those of thebiological sciences (such as mammology, herpetology, apiology, entomology, etc.)This intellectual commitment to what is still often called the\"study of man\" is frequently used as an example of the \"holistic\"approach so basic Jr, anthropology--an open-ended, \"wide-angle vision\"rather than \"tunnel-vision\" in approaching the conceptualization of a problem.A` second theme is the preference for natural settings in studiesof human behLvior. By and large, anthropology is very much a field-oriented enterprise, looking to the \"natural experiment\" as a sourceof variations in data. This includes, of course, an emphasis upon- -but not an exclusive concern with--observational and participant-observational techniques as supplementing the different kinds ofverbal interviews (structured and unstructured) variously used by otherkinds of behavioral scientists.While it can be.argued that because of the investigator'spresence in the research situation the object of inquiry is thereby 64 ,11.amin. Led, the counter-argument can be made that. the quality cif dotethus obtained is worth the cost in whatever legree of artificialityof conduct that-may occur because of the researcher's presence. Inaddition, being in the action affords the chance to observe not onlythe real life situation of the perscas being studied, but also thedegree of correspondence between self-reports of attitude and actualbehavior, with an opportunity also to follow up any discrepancieswith free-structu-cd interviews.Such observational and participant-observational methods supplement,and do not replace, data gathering techniques based upon verbal interviews.They simply enlarge the range of instances upon whichcor:lusions and inferences relating to the behavioral process being!Audied can be based, bringing In, for example, the \"language of gesture\",the :;tructurint, of interpersonnI contact, the effects of \"unprogrammed\"events in Ur daily social round, as well as the paraw2Lers of the .physical setting in which the behavior occurs.A third theme is the pervasiveness of an Ecologic perspective.Closely intertwined historically with the development of anthropologyas a discipline has been concerned with interrelations between man asan evolving species and the press of his total environment. Indeed, it could not be otherwise, given the commitment to the first theme; forthe very development of man out of proto- and pre4tominid primate formswas apparently strongly influenced by particular climatological andtopographic conditions. But the concern with man-environment relationsin both a behaviOral and psychological sense and the degree to whichthese influence social and cultural forms are also evident in thepragmatic catgorizing of much anthropological data--witness, for 65 example, the common breakdowns of societies into \"hunters and gatherers,\"\"agriculturalists,\" \"peasantry,\" \"industrialists,\" and the like.The Inclusive term for such an orientation Is, of course, \"ecology\"a term much used these days (and equally as much abused). \"Abused\" inthe sense of often being conceived in an overly-restrictive and toonarrow modesuch as the static, structural sense in which it is oftenemployed to refer simply to settlement patterns or aggregate social data.But the term in actuality comes from, and makes reference to,the very essence of life process: attempts at adaptation, accommoda-tion, activity, and adjustive behavior on the part of an organism orgroup of organisms--adaptation either to outer environing conditionsof Life, or to each other (e.g., matters of population density, ofhierarchical power structuring and \"pecking orders,\" etc.) The term,indeed, has the power to inform a wide range of particular investigationswhich relate to the dynamics of behavior, either in individual or ingroup terms.It may be suggested that the behavioral science theoreticalapproach labeled \"structural-functional analysis\" is, with socioculturalcontent, simply another expression of the basic ecologic perspectiveon events in nature; for the intent here, as with ecology more generally,is to discern the many varieties of the functional coupling of eventsand structures.With the human species, ecologic studies become more complicatedthan they do with infra-human orders, for another set of parametersis introduced into the basic dialectic with nature: elaboration ofthe psychological transactions with the environment in the form ofperceptions, projections, rationlizations and repressions, anticipationsand aspirations, affect-laden symbolizations and images, abstractions 66 nod class concepts, etc. all heavily Influenced by a specific social context.Itis this capacity of the human organism for complex psycho-logical relations with the environment which underlies both the develop- ment ofshared group systems of belief, value, and assumption (in oneterm \"culture\"), and the development of complex inner worlds of motive,sentiment, and normative evaluation; and the ongoing stream of behav- ior isin some senses a compound of such group-structured orientationsand the individual compromise with those environmentnlly-based (i.e.,schtiLly-based) parameters for behnvior.Another theme is an ingrained evolutionary and diachronic 1)erspective.Although not all problems demand it and obviously not all anthropologistsemploy it as a perspective of choice, there is, nonetheless, built into the.eorpornte frame of reference a strong awareness of the wor jugs of timein shaping the observed structure or event. Ethnographies typicallybegin, for example, with placing the community or tribe in its histor-ical context on the basis, of course, of the common-sense assumption andtheoretical construct that man is a \"time-binding\" animal, that in manthe past lives in the present to an exalted (and often deplorable) degree.A theme like this one has profound implications for the study of human be-havior nod sociocultural systems; for one .thing, it insistently urgestranslation of static concepts of \"structure\" into dynamic conceptsof \"process\" and asserts change and alteration of pattern as the norm,helping bring about a more productive relation between concept and reality.Wide swings of investigatory ,styles and theoretical predilectionsaside, a perduring feature of the \"culture of anthropology\" is Lheimplicit cmphae:.s upon process and interaction of empirical events over time, whether the content be morphological or societal. Such a para-meter of the frame of reference explains, for examplq the conjoining(in introductory courses) of human evolution with the growth anddevelopment of human society and culture; indeed, to do so helpsilluminate many of the most striking aspects of \"human\" nature whenthe phrase is used in its broadest comparative sense, such as thosefeatures of homo sapiens as a primate which underlie his capacity forculture and for a distinctly human mode of adaptation to the environ- ment.It is with respect to this theme, for example, that studies byphysical anthropologists, zoologists, and ethnologists of primatebehavior are relevant in elucidating some of the social organizationaland adaptational modes possible given particular stages of somatic andcortical development. Although the \"origin of language\", for instance,will never be sharply specified in a temporal framework, the hypothesisis well-evidenced that survival possibilities of australopithecineand other pre-hominid forms were immensely increased when they achievedbetter coordination of group efforts through development of that highlyeffective signaling and information-storing system, language, a_dlelopment itself functionally evolved through interacting factors ofhabitat, posture, omnivorous diet, and enlargement of the frontallobes of the brain.The congeniality of a long-range historical perspective to a fullerunderstanding of \"human\" behavior is thus one of the areas of contributionof the culture of anthropology to the behavioral sciences,- although-asnoted above--not all practitioners of the field may construe theirproblems in such a framework. That \"long-range\" perspective is indeed 68 enormous and, if internalized fully, forces one to acknowledge howparochial and circumscribed is the usual anhropecentric sense of time with which we operate. If nothing else, it boggles the mind torealize how miniscule a portion of the span of organic life on thisplanet is occupied by anything that we can justiliably call humanexperiences:If the orgin of the earth itself is placed at about 3billion years ago (probably a conservative estimate) and if thisestimate were to be concretized by a book consisting of 3,000 pages(each page representing one million years), the point at which the veryearliest (and crudest) forms of man-like apes appear would be some7where on page 2,999: earliest forms of \"modern\" man (some 50,000yedrs ago) close to the bottom of the very last page; the birth ofChrist somewhere in. the last word in the last line; and the beginningof the twentieth century as the final period in that last Line.There is something else than merely philosophic bewilderment thatthe long record of the unfolding of life and its forms accomplishes.It underscores an essentially dynamic and interactive point of view forall phenomena of life in which concepts of \"structure\" serve as \"half-way house\" concepts in the service of understanding patterns of process.But one other area of more concrete implication is that of thedifferential susceptibilities to disease based upon 'phylegeneticfactors--racial differences and their implications for differentialepidemiological profiles in various populations. The interrelationsbetween the.\"sickle-cell\"' anemia, malaria, the evolution of agriculturein the continent of Africa, and the vestigial susceptibility to theanemia (and protection against malaria) in persons of Negroid descent isbut one example from a wide field. Indeed, taking the long view ofhuman history, man's development can be seen as a series of multifarious 69 transactions between culture, behavior, and biology.A fifth theme is closely tied in with a central concept ofthe entire discipline, the concept of culture. it is the pervasivenessof the symbolic and meaning dimension in human behavior. This Isperhaps-expressed most succinctly in the phenomenon of language, withits abstracting and generalizing properties, but language is ofcourse by no means the only way in which shadow worlds of meaninginterpenetrate empirical events. In Whitehead's phrase, \"Symbolism hasa tendency to run wild, like vegetation in a tropical forest.\" Sounds,physical sensations, material objects, social events - -all and anythingmay function in the dual capacity of expressing one process while atthe same time being an indicator of a different definition of the situation.The event or object, when functioning symbolically, must be interpretedin terms of that world of meaning beyond itself to which it hasreference if a full understanding of its importance in human affairsit to be achieved. With reference to the topic of-concern in thispaper, look at the famous mask of the modern priest-healer; the clinician's white coat.Worn by anyone, it confers--no, it means to the patient authority, skill, and wisdom. Or take the (formerly) blinding white-ness of the surgical room; somehow the virginal whiteness betokenedsafety and cleanliness, antisepsis carried to the extreme. Beyond colorthere is the ability of symbols--dress, seating patterns, posture,titles--to convey status, i.e., to indicate, without explicitlysaying so, relative power ranking and special privilege--in an ongoingsocial system. Indeed, not only in a hospital setting, but in mostsituations of human behavior, the forms of symbolism, the ability ofany one thing or object to serve as an alter ego for something else or someother situation, are protean--especially when the matter is viewed in a 70 cross-cultural framework.A final theme that brackets anthropological most_ well-known characteristic: animplicit cross-cultural andcomparative perspective. Although the task is immense, the fieldcorporately takes seriously the commitment to Man writ large inconsidering the scope and power of a generalization concerning humanbehavior and social process. As the current wide interest in comparativestudies in behavioral science fields attests, far from serving simplyan anecdotal function, contrasting and diverse ethnological databearing on the same problem are vital in cleansing variables ofparochial content: and creating that degree of conceptual equivalencerequired for theory development.Such an approach, which is almost instinctive in anthropology,derives, indeed, from several of the principles sketched in above.Insofar as-the ambitious subject matter of the discipline is the\"study of Man,\" the list of-diverse instances is drawn as broadly aspossible as foundation for generalizations--from the small hands ofBushmen, in the Kalahari Desert to the high civilizations of theAndes, the ghetto dweller, political elites in modern Africa, orTungus reindeer herders of northeastern Siberia. Return for the moment tothe illustration of color symbolism referred to above. To those ofus in the Western tradition, the color white conjures up positivevalues: sanctity, cleanliness, holiness, goodness and purity, etc.Contrastingly, in many contexts the color baick signifies the oppositevalues; indeed, it is culturally the predominant color of grief andmourning.But for Chinese groups white, not black, signifies griefand bereavement; and for some Mexican Indian groups red serves asimilar purpose. In each case, through socialization,the color presented\"means\" the same thing to members of the group and engenders a common affect.Fromone point of view in a cross - cultural perspective, it isnot necessarily a given color per se that is important, but the fact thatso many groups do have affect-laden symbols (color and otherwise) bywhich they \"express\" and thereby externalize psychological processesin response to a crisis event. Beyond color, of course, all theltdata of human behavior are subject to diverse cultural differentiationand expression, and this includes such \"sub-cultural\" phenomena assymbolic and value differences between ethnic groups of socioeconomic classes.These several themes or orientations represent one way ofcharacterizing the \"hidden agenda\" in an anthropological frame of reference.But what might they (and the factual that emanate from them)have to do with medical education? Anthropology and the Future Medical PractitionerLet us consider that there are three ways a given discipline canmake intellectual contributions to a curriculum not its own. (Whateverchanges in affect and value may occur are something else- -not irrelevantbut simply not discussed here.) The first Is training in specific skills,either those of data gathering or analytic techniques. The secondcontribution is introducing the facts or empirical knowledge of thatgiven discipline--information. The third contribution, the mostdifficult kind of objective to achieve, is conveying to the participantsin that curriculuM what is usually an alien theoretical or conceptual frame of reference in terms of which those empirical facts make sense- -'a perspective. This latter contribution is difficult because it isnot so easily bounded or packaged as are facts or skills, and becauseits acquisition usually is the result of a gradual evolution andseasoning of thought on the part of the student, rather than the 72 outcome of a simple act of disclosure.(It is not, in short, one of Ehrlich's \"magic bullets.\")If the formulation of a more comprehensive frame of reference is a process ofsynthesis and integration requiring time, this may explain one of the covert difficulties in regard to the teaching of behavioral sciences, and particularly anthropology, in medical schools; for- - as will be argued later--perhaps the most critical outcome to he desired will not be that of either data gathering or simple acquisition of empirical facts about human behavior, although both these will be involved to some degree. Rather, the most long-lasting and pervasive effect to b sought (which not every student is able or willing to do)is a change or enlargement of the conceptual frame of reference with which the student looks at any disease process, so that he sees It as occurring in context or interaction field of human behavior in which the patient is a participant (along, indeed, with the physician himself as one of the interacting units when the issue is that of diagnosis and/or treatment.) The goal is, then, to give the student an ability to move with ease along what might be called a continuum of Erogressive contextualization in regard to any given health/disease problem--to use, appropriately and heuristically, alternative per- spectives not based on reductionistic parameters.He will not, for example, feel compelled to translate all issues of pathology into cellular terms, but will he able to see malfunction at several levels of dynamic organization. Some might prefer the language of general systems theory for conveying such a \"perspectivistic\".image, a language of sub-systems within environing systems of Linctional interrelations. Indeed, such language is concinnous with the biologistic frame of reference the student learns to employ anyway--in which the cell is accepted as the basic unit of living matter, analyzable in its own right and exhibiting system properties at one level of analysis whileat the same time. entering into environing systems of tissue, organ,organism, etc. without losing its phenomenal integrity. In this view,then, the task for the behavioral scientist is simply to gain anopening for the field enlargement of those elements of nature thatcan be seen as exhibiting such partwhole system composition andinteractions, such as person In his own right, and person in a socialand cultural system, sub-systems of larger social. systems (e.g.,emergency room in a hospital structure, etc.). Perhaps, to sum upthis point with jargon familiar to the anthropologists (since thisis what this particular paper concerns and not the whole of thebehavioral sciences), the third way in which a discipline can makea contribution to an outside curriculum is to achieve at leaStsomething of a change in the \"world view\" or \"ethos\" of those exposedto that curriculum--to lay hands on, and shape into more 'comprehensiveform, their epistemology. SkillsLet us return to specifics. What kinds of data gathering oranalytic skills might anthropology have to contribute to the futuremedical practitioner?What is apparent when we look at anthropology as a whole, i.e.,including the several sub-fields such as archeology, physical anthropology,linguistics, sociocultural anthropology, and psychological anthropology,is that there are specific data-gathering techniques in some of thoseareas that, if related to medical practice,,are more related to theresearch questions that contribute to the domain of knowledge forpractice or preventive medicine than the actuality of practice itself. 74 Techniques in genetics, hematologic research, osteology, growth anddevelopment, for example, are part of the physical anthropology (or,in other, equivalent terms, \"human biology,\"); similarly, archeologicaltechniques For studying the antiquity of disease (\"paleo-epidemiology\")would seem Co have very little direct bearing, except in a highlyderivative sense, on contemporary medical practice.On the other hand, take social and cultural anthropology.Traditionally one of the chief modes of data-gathering here has been that ofthe interview, what is sometioes re erred to as the \"non-structured\"interview (i.e., it does not follow A strictly-outlined and tightly-phrased sequence of questions). To say that an anthropological interviewis \"non-structured,\" however, conveys to some readers a misleadingconceptionone to the effect that there is no point, no framework,no guiding conceptual objective being sought in the interview; thatthe proceeding is an anecdotal gossip session. On the contrary, thetypical sociocultural anthropological interview is in fact problem- focused.It is clear in its strategic outlines; what varies are the tactics.If the researcher is interested, for example, in ascertainingthe patterning of kinship roles and kinship relations in an unfamiliar group,he well knows what lie is after- -but he may try alternativemodes of approach in getting data from his informant. The entireproceeding can better by characterized as a \"guided dialectic,\" amoving to and f-ro, an evolving toward the solution of the problembeing investigated, rather than one of a too-highly-prestructuringof the questions in rigid form, a prestructuring which, indeed, maywell pre_sup_pose without any exploration that the very questions beingasked are the most appropriate and effective ones to ask.The structure, or the organization, fur this kind of interview 75 can be visualized in the following way, (with both the diagram and comment taken from Spicer, 1952, the diagram the squares represent the items of informa-tion which the student has systematically determined that heneeds for the solution of a problem. The curving line representsthe course of the interview. It may not begin at the point theinterviewer had expected, or disclose the items in the order inwhich he had thought of them. Perhaps a firs: interview, more-over, does not touch on all the items. Nevertheless, through skil-fully keeping the interviewee talking along the lines of his owninterest, and in his own way, answers to most of the questions canbe obtainedperhaps to all those concerning which the inter-viewee has anything valuable to offer. Additional items of in-formation may be obtained in a second interview or from inter-views with other persons.. 76 Another feature of this kind of anthropological interviewing, one thatis often not remarked upon, is that the anthropologist must establish along-term communicational climate that is conducive to the gathering of dataand the cross-checking of those data over time. There must be established,in short, a rapport and mutual confidence between anthropologist and informantthat allows for the fullest possible exploration and delineation of the topicor problem in question. Saying the latter is, then, to suggest immediatelya possible contribution of anthropological data-gathering techniques to thetraining of the future medical practitioner. For if the patient coming to thedoctor with symptoms--of whatever kind--does not perceive a congenialcommunicational environment and is not encouraged by the doctor to enterwith him as a respected and indispensable participant in the dialogue thatexplores the problem and attempts to outline solutions, then this importantaspect of the student-physician's training will have been deficient.Laboratory tests give only part of the necessary data; in many clinical instances,the host for that disease process (the patient) can contribute even more vitaldata (such as responses to the questions, \"Where does it hurt?\" or \"What kind of pain is it?\") .To characterize a socipcultural anthropological interview in the abovefashion is not, of course, to assert that nothing like this will be done ineither medical education or medical practice until anthropology enters the scene.Indeed, in many instances now the effective practitioner is \"effective\"at least in part because he does conduct his data-gathering along some suchlines as those sketched in above. Nor is it to assert that it is only thecontribution from anthropology that would provide the necessary training inthis kind of data-gathering for the student-physician; in a number of medicalschools at the present time there are courses in the \"doctor-patientrelationship\" that include the interviewing process and incorporate some of the 17 ideas and rationale of this kind of interview. But it probably is fair to saythat anthropology can contzibute to the medical education process in thisrespect, both by reinforcement of the basic purposes and structure of al-ternative types of interview, by inculcating an awareness of the situationaland sociocultural dimensions of the interviewing process, and--especially--byoffering experience and instruction in such data-gathering techniques whenthe problem of interest to the student is larger and more diffuse than therelatively simple doctor-patient interaction--such as one in \"social medicine,\"community development,\" or some of the others for which data-gathering incommunity settings is required.There are other features of the \"anthropological\" interview that bearmentioning in relation to training for medical practice, such as the sheer factsof language usage and of vocabulary. If the anthropologist is exploring agiven topic with the informant and the latter uses an unfamiliar \"native\"term to refer to some feature of the situation, the anthropologist makescertain that he explores the dimensions of meaning until he has accuratelyunderstood it. The well-trained anthropologist is sensitive to differencesin meaning and differences in perception of familiar things between himselfand someone from another culture, for this is part of the fabric of culture.A not unimportant implication for the medical practitioner is therefore suggesteeviz., that he constantly be aware of possible differences between him an,'his patients in use of language and even what appear to be \"common\" termsfor sickness, especially those Coming from different socioeconomic andethnic backgroyndsiof his own society, an awareness that expresses a\"sociolinguistir interest\". The term \"high blood,\" for instance, does not mean\"high blood pressure\" to American blacks in the ghetto; and references to\"hot food\" in a diet by Puerto Rican and other Spanish-speaking patients are 78 likely to mean a reference to the alenic-derived system of classificationof foods in a pervasive belief system of disease causation and etiology thatIs not based on their thermal qualities (see below). But it isn't just exoticwords or notions that are not understood between doctor and patients.Studies hive shown that the doctor using the technically correct term for apart of the body or one of its processes frequently does not communicatein the framework of layman's English which the patient brings to thesituation.\"Have you voided today?\"--how commonly, in the patient's world, isthat phrase used to refer to urination? (cf. Samora et al., 1961).There are only a few ways we an receive information from the world aroundus, and all our \"data-gathering techniques\" are channelled through one or moreof these modes. We can see, hear, touch, smell, taste. When we speak ofinterviewing, implicitly the reference is to hearing--listening to whatsomeone else says in response to our on verbal cues. We have spokenalready of the areas of overlap in use of such a technique between anthropology and clinical 'practice. But it should also be made explicit that,.whetherrecorded or not, much observing also goes on in the \"interview,\" and indeedit forms an extremely important independent part of the total data-gatheringprocess for both the anthropologist and the physician. The anthropologist inthe field records his observations not only of the physical and social setting(e.g.,-house, work area, etc.) in which an interview occurs, but also-theappearance and behavior of the person being interviewed, the reactions ofothers around him to the dialogue, the effects on the person of theinterviewer's questions or comments, and so forth. He looks at and records the \"nonverbal\" communications that are going on. l'n'\",addition, beyond the .data-gathering involved in talking with a person, the anthropologist makeSmany \"respondent-free\" observations--descriptions of what he sees going on in L 79 a village, on a street corner, in a hospital ward: patterns of interactionor behavior, modes of sitting, of dress, of house-building or baby-birthing.In other words (depending on the problem, of course) the anthropologistrecords his own observations of what is going on in addition to what a personor persons tell him about what is going on (using whatever extensions ofhis eyeballs are available as windows into empirical events, such as cameras).Clearly this observation-based mode of data-gathering is another area of skillIn which anthropological research techniques and those ofpractice overlap. The physician's initial notes as well as the continuingcase record usually include reference to the patient's appearance (mode ofdress, coloration and texture of skin, clearness of eyes, appearance ofthroat, tongue, ears, relative stockiness or height, etc.), and his behavior (gait, posture, speech, eye-contact, etc.). (He may also use other sensorymodes, such as taste, smell, and certainly touch.) While usually suchobservations (both in anthropology and clinical medicine) are used in afairly rough and unsystematized manner, there are techniques available interms of which group norms have been established. In anthropology one suchbody of work Is known as \"kinesics\" (cf. Birdwhisteil, 1970), and others havemade attempts to quantify and pattern overt aspects of behavior in a similarway (e.g., Hewes, Caudill,). The practical implications of such knowledge for medical practice (anticipating here for a moment the '-.next section) canbe illustrated by a case now well-known in medical behavioral science, inwhich a Navajo Indian acted toward outsiders in a perfectly,\"natural\"Navajo manner and his behavior was interpreted by ,bite police officers andhospital attendants as indicative of schizophrenia (Jewell, 1952). Hisinterpersonal demeanor was that of appearing downcase and out of contactwith reality--avoiding other persons' eyes, not responding to questions, exhibiting \"bashfulness.\" (In his case, the matter was not particularlyhelped by the fact that his physical 80 apponranco was interpreted by some as Mexican, and he was spoken to only inSpankh or English--neither of which he knew well enough to use.) Yet thebehavior of this man, when understood and interpreted in terms of hiscAtural context, made perfectly good sense; his shyness, his withdrawal in athreatening environment, his inability to communicate (no one else in thehospital knew the Navajo language), all were \"normal\" responses when consideredin the appropriate framework.There are other features of the clinTtl\\situation in medicine that insome senses are analogous to the problem situation of the anthropologist,and these bear comment in relation to skills and method. In medical practice,the physician starts his process of interaction with the patient with whatexists, with the problem that is presented to him empirically--and imperatively.There is a person who is suffering and who has sought help. That person'sproblem, that set of empirical facts, remains paramount in shaping andinfluencing the physician's subsequent behavior, both with respect to theclearer definition of the problem itself and to possible and feasible solutions.This strong allegiaike to empirical data as they present themselves and .to the utiliiation of inductively-derived knowledge (not, of course, to theexclusion of deductive processes) also characterizes many aspects of theakanthropologist's professional activities. Obviously he does not haveresponsibility for application of his knowledge in regard to the same kindsof pragmatic concerns that the physician does; but it can be asserted thatthe \"presenting situation\" so far as his anthropologizing is concerned sharesmany conceptual features in common with that of the physician in being highly\"data-centered,\" or, at least, in making the facts of the case the loadstoneby which further activities are to be guided. He seeks, and tries to foster, serendipity'.There is in anthropology, in other words,'far less of an initialpre-selection of data appropriate to the study of a given problem and far less opportunity for actual experimental manipulation of data than is trueof the other behavioral sciences (e.g., experimental psychology, small-groupbehavior studies, etc.). anthropologist--to oversimplify in order tomake the main thrust of the point--takes his data where they present themselvesand begins the process of inquiry at that point; the archeologist, for example,not very often being able to predict where or what he will find, but, havingestablished a site and done analysis, then more accurately narrowing the rangeof posiihle alternatives so far as subsequent finds may be concerned. Oneway of characterizing the anthropological \"style\" of inquiry is that of\"painstaking induction guided by working hypotheses,\" much akin to the approachof the epidemiologist. In short, in anthropology as in medicine, in theprocess of problem solving the empirical context of that problem, the problemin its full, real-life situation, remains on center-stage, with theoreticalformulations in and of themselves serving as spear-carriers, much more thanis the case in many areas of the other behavioral sciences. By virtue of suchan orientation, anthropology (at least some sections) has often been dubbed as\"non-theoretical\" and \"data-bound\"; a rather more accurate way of putting .the matter would be that it uses its.theory flexibly, being guided in suchuse by the dictates of the problem at hand.Another point follows from the preceding one. Arthropological dataconcerned with a given problem area, being usually not amenablo to experimentalpre-defining and selection are therefore often of a heterogeneous character--\"bits and pieces.\" But bits and pieces of a more dynamic whole. Theanthropologist's task, therefore, is to infer pattern and structure fromsuch an assemblage of data, data which often approach the problem area fromdifferent points of entry, diverse data which \"triangulate\" upon the issues at hand.The analyst's skill, therefore, lies in his bans able to extraci: from 82 different kinds of usually incomplete data the regularities, the configurations,the patten coherencies that exist, many of which he may not have evenenvisioned at the beginning of his inquiry. The field of linguistics perhapsprovides the best prototype for such \"pattern analysis,\" and in anthropologythis kind of analytic interest and problem has been well stated by, forexample, Szipir, Krocber, and more recently Kluckhohn, who incisivelyillustrated the process of bringing order--i.e., patterning- -out of data fromdIfferer.t levels of analysis and of different orders of completeness. InOf the world of anthropological facts there is no end--man's origin andevolution, his racial differentiation, cultural variation, his susceptibilityto group pressure and influence, the dynamics of his social structures, etc.But those facts related to health and disease behavior that are relevantthe medical practitioner are a sub-set of that larger universe. Those thatfollow here are merely examples from a range. They would include, forexample, such topics as folk medicine, indigenous beliefs about diagnosis andtreatment, native schemes of classification of disease (including concepts of\"normality\"), studies in medical ecology and epidemiology, as well as inter-relations 'among evolution, culture, and disease.An example of the latter kind of problem is genetically-based disordersor disease-susceptibilities rooted in man's biological development that, byreason of particular evolutionary situations, affect modern human groupsdifferentially. A now notorious example is sickle-cell anemia mentionedpreviously, a disorder found in approximately one out of every 400-500 Americanblacks; there is considerable evidence linking persistence of this mutation tothe survival advantages with respect to malaria it conferred on those having it,the malaria itself being associated with the. development of agriculture in .83 Africa (Livingstone, 1958).Another example is adult lactose intolerance, for a time assumed to bea matter of psychosomatics but now hypothesized by some to be based on geneticdeficiency and derivative from particular cultural evolutionary featuresrelated to the domestication of milk animals (see Simoons, 1969; Hunter, 1971;McCracken, 1971). Racial groups differ in intolerance levels--Africans andOrientals, for example, showing levels of up to 90%, while Caucasoids manifestonly 10-15% intolerance--and such differences are associated, at least, withdifferential length of time the given population has been exposed to use ofmilk in the diet. Similar associations, those of a sociocultural nature, areimplied in differential epidemiological rates for cancer at various sites(Quisenberry 1960; Graham 1960), and some other physical or genetic features,such as body type. Damon (1969) has summarized numerous studies that relateto the question of differential ethnic and racial associations with diseasebased upon genetic and possibly genetic factors: Racial and Ethnic Disease: SimplyInherited FrequencyRelatively LowFrequencyG-6-PD deficiency, African type fever from McKusick, 1967. For references on individual conditions, seeMcKusick, 1966., 85 RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISEASE: MULTIFACTORIAL DISORDERS WITH 1967. His commwIs on the data are succinct with respect to the question of \"relevance for medical practice ? \": What use can we make of the clear associationsbetween racial or ethnic group and disease presentedso far?The practical scientist can, as mentioned,apply them immediately to the detection, diagnosis,and treatment of disease. A given expenditure ofresources will find, cure, and prevent more cervicalcancer, syphilis, and tuberculosis among Nonwhitesin the United States than among Whites, for example.In clinical medicine, fever, abdominal pain, andleucocytosis may have different implications in aNorthern European (a \"surgical\" likeappendicitis or cholecystitis), Mediterranean and aNegro (possible sickling crisis). In the two lastcases, the patient may be spared needless surgicalexploration if the physician is aware of the ethnicand racial associations Of disease. (1969, p. 174). Aside from genetics and disease, another area where applied physicalanthropological concerns might have considerable to say to the practicingphysician (as well as increase his knowledge and insight into preventivemedicine) is biomechanics. An example is the common \"bad back\" problem.Physical anthropologists have given considerable study to problems ofthe physics of the human body, the structural strains built into thebody by evolutionary developments (such as assumption of an erect 87 posture).Such knowledge as variations in body fl and size in agiven population has considerable implications for health when it comesto HuHI matters as equipment design -- whether for safety or comfort(as exmplified, for instance, in the design of space capsules).Given ranges of variability in the structure and capabilities of thehuman body, there exists a-fertile field for investigations havingimplications both basic and applied for medical practice, a field towhich anthropometry and other branches of applied physical anthro-pology address themselves (see, for example, The Human Body in1,AuiEnlent Design, by Damon, Soutdt, and McFarland, 1966).Cultural facts are rich with implications for the differentialperception and meaning of pain (cf. Zborowski, 1970) and diseaseitself -- including such basic matters as just what constitutes adisease and. -what is considered \"normal\" (cf. Paul, 1955; Saunders,1954; Simmons and Wolf, 1954). The implications of this for diagnosis,patient care, and preventive medicine are clear -- if the physician isnot given the chance to intervene in a disease process until too latebecause that process has not been defined by the people concerned as acondition appropriate for him to see; or if, by his verbal questioninghe elicits and then misinterprets an answer because of differingvocabulary or differing belief framework, then these data from thedomain of human behavior become coequal in importance with laboratoryfindings in the total problem of diagnosis and management.Cassell cites a good example of the influence of \"folk\" beliefsabout illness, an example which, while taken from a contrasting cultural 88 setting, is probably not as radically different as we might thinkwhen the intra-U.S. sub-cultural differences are looked at in depth.Among the Zulu it is a tenet of the cultural belief system of SouthAfrca that only sorcerers and witches have the ability to transmitdisease, particularly diseases that show themselves in symptomsnormally associated with pulmonary tuberculosis. Against thebackground of this belief, then, counterpose modern medicine with !tstheoretic structures of the transmission and role of the tuberclebacillus.In the South African case considerable progress was beingmade in a program of community medicine and tuberculosis control untila physLcian inadvertently ran afoul of this belief -- he triedintroduce the medical concept of contagion in tracing the course oftuberculosis through a family, showing how one person had been the original source of the disease in the group and had therefore bee,; theagent :esponsible for sickness in all others. In his mind he was, ofcourse, illustrating a scientific principle; to the family, however,he was'in effect accusing one of their members who originally had hadthe tuberculosis of being a witch through causing the sickness in the others.The physician could regain the cooperation of the family inworking on health problems only by retracting his proposed explana-tion for the transmission of the sickness.Another example relating to folk conceptions of disease that hashighly pragmatic implications for patient management of some groupsin the U.S. is the \"hot-cold\" theory of disease causation and cure,held widely in Latin America and other places culturally irfluenced bySpanish colonization. It also illustrates the general point that thepatients may well interpret and define both illness and its remediesin,a different framework from that of the physician. Do only non- western \"folk\" have \"folk medical\" beliefs? Quite, aside, for example, from specific sub-cultures such as Puerto Ricans, Chicanos, orBlacks, there is the great bulk of the population that may exhibit\"ethnomedical\" or -contemporary \"folk medical\" notions about the structure and processes of the body and remedies to 'sure diseasegotten from the simplified diagrams of television advertising. (Donasal sprays or stomach coatings really work as illustrated? Andhow persuasive in establishing a negative self-image is the dinned-in phrase about the \"heartbreak of psoriasis\"?) In any 'case, among the Puerto Ricans diseases are character- ,ized as either \"hot\" or \"cold,\" depending on the specific symptoms.Herbs, medicines, and foods are likewise classified in terms of thisscheme, a scheme that depends not upon thermal conditions but rather \"hot\" and \"r2old\" in largely a metaphorical or mystical sense (forexample, because of its alcoholic content cold beer is a \"hot\" food).The following table from a study of Puerto Ricans in New YorkCity (Harwood, 1971, p. 1155) gives examples of illnesses, foods, andmedicines which are categori7ed in terms of this system (illnesses,beint-dichotomized into \"hot\" and \"cold,\" while foods and medicinesare tnichotomiZed, the third category being \"cool\"). \"Hot\" diseasesare to be treated with \"cold\" foods, and vice-versa, and for a patientwho firmly holds eliaindigenous theory of disease dynamics it will dono good to prescribe a diet that contradicts those beliefs -- toprescribe, for example, orange juice or other \"cold\" foods' as anelement of treatment for the cammon.cold (which is classified as a \"cold\"disease).In the following table is illustrated the classification of 90 disease conditions and types of food and medicine into threecategories, \"hot,\" \"cold,\" and \"cool.\" THE HOT-COLD shows some of the probable patient behaviorvis7a-vis certain disease conditions, behavior that, regardless of howthe physician diagnoses any' prescribes, is likely to occur as the Isr--Natos=.-4 patient's way of responding to the disease in the pysicfan-free atmosphet.., of the home.

He provides, for example, discussion of this belief 9-2 system as related to general medical care, use of diuretics, theprophylactic use of penicillin, pediatric care, oral medication forchildren, childhood diseases, and obstetric and gynecologic care. l'crspectiveA discipline may also contribute to a curriculum by engenderinga new perspective, a new way of looking at things, both old, familiarthings and new things brought into awareness by application of thatnew framework. if one part of the process of education is accumula-tion of \"facts\" or mastery of a craftsman's technique, then the otherpart, perhaps the most important in the long-run, is the acquiring ofconceptual frameworks along the way which organize and give a widerrange of meaning to those \"facts.\" In the ideal case, of course, onemay even characterize the course of a true \"education\" as theacquisition of ever more inclusive and comprehensive frames ofreference; as a process of integration, not merely an accumulation, of data.ft is in this area of contribution to a curriculum that anthro-pology can also have considerable impact in medical education. If welook for a moment at the behavioral sciences as a whole and note thatone of their chief contributions to medical edUcation is through pro-viding some level of understanding of the structure and dynamics ofhuman behavior, then anthropology's contribution to this combinedeffort becomes critical. Take the central concept of the discipline, for example, culture. One of the chief points to be made in connectionwith beginning to grasp the concept -- a point initiated in introduc-tory courses that usually takes several years to mature -- is how 93 pervasive and profound is the enitural shaping of behavior. This Isnot to say, of course, that \"culture\" Is an all-purpose explanatoryconcept.but it is to assert that, whatever may be the biologicaland genetic mainsprings of behavior, and whatever form our idio-syncratic experiences may shape these into, there remains a longlasting cultural stamp on the way that behavior turns out, acultural stamp or programming that is derived from specific, sharedsocial experience. We are hard put, literally, to specify very manyareas of human behavior that are not heavily influenced in their formand process by particular cultural formats that shape the expression,timing, sequencing, and situation of that behavior -- in short, thattransmute primate behavior into \"human\" behavior. Speech is of coursethe most obvious cultural mechanism, speech and the ideas to whichwords refer.But the reach of cultural shaping extends throughout therealm of motor habits (how, and what, to eat; to dress and adorn thebody; to defecate and urinate \"properly\"; to mate; to express emotions;to react to pain, etc.); of social relations (how to act \"properly\"with respect to the many different kinds of other human beingsencountered throughout life); and to the higher reaches of human con-ception, in such things as values, beliefs, and orientations about theself, other human beings, and the nature of the cosmos. As ClydeKluckhohn (1954, pp. 960-961) once said:The simple biological analogy of \"organism andenvironment\" is inadequate because man is aculture-bearing animal. Some sort of three-way paradign is necessary since we have: (a)individuals, (b) the situations in which theyfind themselves, and (c) the modes or ways in 94 which they are oriented to these situations.In terms of the intellectual division oflabor which has generally been adhered toduring this century, the study of Individuniorganisms and their motivations has been theprovince of psychology and biology. Insofaras sociology has had a distinct conceptualfield, it has been that of investigation ofthe situation. Cultural anthropology has beendealing with the modes of orientation to thesituation.Now the individual is oriented tohis situation is, in the concrete sense,\"within\" the actor, but not in the analyticsense, for modal orientations cannot, bydefinition, be derived from observing andquestioning a single individual they areculture.lf anthropology, then, has a contribution to make to a student'sunderstanding of the dynamics and structure of human behavior,especially in the area of inculcating an understanding of the largeextent to which that \"human\" behavior is \"culturally-constituted\"behavior, the question follows: what relevance has this to the medicalstudent?The answer hinges on the function of conceptual frames ofreference In any field of study: they organize data, they provide new insights into possible relation.-hips that. are not suggested i.;1 an arrayof data not organized by a conceptual scheme, they allow for predictiveand probabilistic anticipation of events. They provide, in short, thebase for inquiry and the framework into which findings will be inte-grated into the conceptual anchorage to which data will be related.If, for example, the medical student leaves his period of trainingmaintaining a focus on a \"disease process\" and is unable to enlargehis conceptual framework so at; to place that disease process in a largercontext of the \"patient\" as a psychobiological system, br even the personinteracting in a larger sociocultural field, he may well misssome of the most important dynamics that relate to his own chosen goals,such as those of health care. Unless he is aware, for example, ofclass- or ethnic-group based differences in patient perceptions of andresponses to the physician in the clinic- defined role setting, he maywell be surprised (but should not be) when the patient fails to followmedication orders at home or take preventive measures.Another kind of comment relating to conceptual frame of referenceand implied by the above point also has direct bearing on the activitieson the physician himself -- upon his own professional socialization. Itcan be put very simply: viz., to the extent that the physician (and itbegins in his student years) sees his professional role as the treaterof disease, rather than the maintainer of health for a patient or apopulation, then his actions will be the more circumscribed and narrowly-focussed. What this implies, of course, is that tne morecomprehensive conception of the role of the physician is that of aprofessional concerned with Lhe health of the _public. and In thislarger conception of the corporate character of medicine treating ofthe sick will comprise a sub-set of the total range cf tasks. But thatparadigm is the reverse of what holds now in medical education; andperhaps one of the chief contributions of the behavioral sciences as awhole in medical education will be that of helping change (throughenlarging) that frame of reference which defines and legitimizes whatare called relevant professional activities. This, indeed, might bethe most lasting and important of the contributions the behavioralsciences (with anthropology as a constituent member) could make to 96 medical education; for in the end it must be recognized that ourcontributions in skills (be they interviewing or analytic) and ininformation and data are ancillary to the principal activity, whichis the delivery of service the responsibility of the medicalprofessional.They can only modify, not replace, that professional acLivity.But when it comes to conveying an understanding of thestructure and dynamics of human behavior, of community organizationand social systems generally, of belief and value systems, this isan area of unique contribution of the behavioral sciences; and if aworking frame of reference, a first approximation, incorporatingadequate knowledge of these matters becomes part of the conceptualapparatus of the medical student, he will be in a better position toappLy his own technical skills more effectively and efficaciouslywhen it comes to extending his goals of maintaining the health of the public.Indeed, one might hope that, once the problem is definedmore relevantly in broader \"public health\" terms, many indicatedactivities will flow from within the structure of medicine itself;an example that can be adduced here is the work of Geiger andassociates in treating disease in a rural county in Mississippi, wherea wider scope of health-related issues and required activities (suchas nutrition improvement) fell logically into place once the definingframework was enlarged.There is danger, however, in stressing the point that one ofthe chief contributions of the behavioral sciences is in the enlargementof a perspective, a frame of reference. To emphasize the imparting of aperspective rather than the inculcating of specific concepts and skills 97 Is almost to assert that what we are, in fact, doing is engaging Inwhat Is often called (usually disparagingly) in American universities,\"general education.\" Perhaps itis unrealistic to expect much moreat this point, with curricula filled as they are and many students'motivations being (in the narrowest sense) \"medical\" as they are.But the question must be raised: is it realistic to expect much moreuntil and unless there is a broadening of the so-called \"clinicalmodel\" in such a radical manner that it is able to transcend students'parochial entry goals of wanting Lo be \"physicians\" as they haveenvisioned the role, of wanting to \"help people\" as perhaps the mostdominant single announced motivation for entering medical school (and,heaven knows, the popular culture reinforces the view that one doesn'tneed training to \"help\" people!) it is at least a sobering cautionthat until the institutionalized practice of medicine is conceived morebroadly and intercepts the disease arc earlier in the minds of students,perhaps there may be little relevance of the behavioral sciences otherthan as sometimes interesting but nonetheless side-trips away from thepriest-healer ego-ideal that seems to be the conceptual Procrustean bedor the typical medical student.;f that is the case that as behavioral scientists in medicalsettings we may be much more practitioners of a kind of general.education and much less purveyors of specialized bodies of knowledge wethink highly relevant to medical practice dealing with hospital struc-ture, the \"patient role,\" ethnomedicine, social psychiatry, and so on --then we can see another reason for some of the role conflicts frequentlycited in discussions of behavioral science in medical education. For in 98 a sense it makes of the behavioral scientist something of an \"applied\"behavioral scientist -- one faced with the task of adapting widebodies of knowledge in such a way as to innovate new behavior patterns,to create, as it were, social and culture change of a sweeping nature.Certainly, for the field of anthropology at any rate, those who haveworked in an \"applied\" situation have traditionally felt thedisparagement of such activities -- perhaps one of the reasons we findso few anthropologists involved in the behavioral science programs of the medical schools.And yet let us ionk again at this process and its relation tomedical education. A great dea3 is written in anthropology on the-subject of introduction of changes in thought or behavioral habit amongpeople different from us. The general rubric is \"induced sociocultural change.\"Without stretching the point too far, one may draw a parallelbetween such programs of deliberate innovation in nonwestern societies,and the attempt to introduce new concepts (and ways of behaving) tomedical students. In each case, so far as anthropology is concerned, itis more.fundamentally an exercise in centrifugal anthropology than onein what may be called centripetal or \"selfcentered anthropology,\" i.e.,anthropology which looks only to those goals dictated-by the purposes ofthe discipline itself, and not to questions thought to come from someother findings coming from studies of the introduction of technologicalor ideational change is that the proposed innovation must articulate witha \"felt need\" of the group concerned; it must initially in some way touchwhat the clients are interested in, no matter how far afield from that 99 initial point of entry it may eventually carry the group.In this light, it seems understandable why any behavioral sciencethat does not seem related ro the clinical enterprise 1?; often not veryenthusiastically accepted by medical students. Their \"fe:.t needs\"clearly are related to those of the \"doctoring skills\" -- of helpingpeople, alleviating pain, solving problems of distress, and so on. Thusit is that a health-related issue on which the behavioral sciences havea great dual to say in the abstract (such as, for example, air pollution)may not conform to what the medical students hold to as the relevant frameof reference, no matter how logically its relationship to the clinicalissue may be argued. What this implies, of course, is that perhaps thetechnique of choice for the introduction of behavioral science knowledgeand skills into the medical curriculum is an inexorable and pervasiveextension ofthe \"clinical model,\" rather than the construction ofcompeting but non-articulated tracks of basic science. Some years ago Clyde Kluckhohn and Henry Murray, two major figuresin the movement toward integration in the behavioral sciences, noted that:Every man is in certain respects a.like all other men b.like some other men c.like no other manTheir purpose was to illustrate the multiple influences that shape humanbehavior (and hence, the multiple approaches to understanding it that are 100 required).Another function of the paradigm, however, is an integrativeone, for it provides a semantic structure against which any given disci-pline (or, in reality, any given problem from that wide range ofproblems studied in the given discipline) can be placed vis-a-vis each otherin terms of levels of abstraction employed. Hence the areas of articula-tion and overlap can be seen.In the present context the paradigm can be made to serve an evenlarger purpose of integration; for it is with reference to some suchparadigm that the dialectic of medical practice goes on, in a manner thatis similar conceptually to what goes on in the hehavioral sciencus.Taking anthropology as an example, this field's concern withevolution, with cross-cultural comparisons, and with man as a speciesspeaks to the first proposition. The physician's attention to the\"normal\" curve as the basis for clinical judgment is, at least in intent,congruent with a species-wide generalization(although it must beallowed that often such distributions are based upon parochial samples).Anthropology is likewise concerned with delineating those features ofhuman behavior in which, at a lower level of abstraction, differencesexist among men and groups of men. Much of the literature on culturaldiversity, for instance, is relevant to this second proposition.Similarly, the physician, having established a departure from the \"normal\"in a given patient, then turns his attention to those features of thedisease process, their implications for care and for the personal life ofthe patient, which now separate him from other, in this case, \"normal,\" .men.lie becomes part of a, class that is less than the whole.Finally, regarding the last proposition, a theme in anthropologyz 101 complementary to the level of grouping cultures and societies intotypes, is the interest in the unique, the idiosyncratic; perhaps the mostdramatic way this is expressed is in the idea of \"cultural relativity,\"In which the specific context of any given cultural trait, the particularpattern of which it is a part, must be understood for grasping thedynamics of the whole. Such an orientation is highly congruent with theapproach of the practicing physician, who in his diagnosis, treatment,and continuing care must not only take account of the universal. andproximal features of the patient's biopyschologicai system, but in theend give attention also to the specific genetic, biochemical, andphenomenological domains of the universe that is the single patient.It is, perhaps, pre-eminently in regard to this third proposition thatthe \"art\" of the 'art and science of clinical medicine' becomesapparent. We have looked briefly at anthropology as a discipline, at thekinds of problem areas it is concerned with and the type of assumptionsIt makes as to what is important to study. We have also cursorilydiscussed some of the implications which that discipline, so charac-terized, might have for medical education through contributing skills,Information, or an enlargement of the student's orientation and frameof reference.We concluded that there are several ways in whichanthropology as a discipline can usefully participate in medicaleducation, along with the other behavioral sciences.But to what extent does it actually so participate? Let us lookat the nine case studies that were undertaken in connection with thisproject and see whether and in what ways anthropology as a discipline 102 is found in the behavioral science in medical education programs at i:Inaleci h ut., Duke, Harvard, Kentucky, Michigan Stale, Missouri,Pennsylvania Slate, Stanford, and Toronto.The most generous initial assessment of the situation Is that, ingeneral,anthropology as a discipline is notable by its formal absence.There aro very few anthropologists working in the behavioral scienceprograms or departments in the several schools -- in fact, in onlyfour arc there any-listed as members of the core group of behavioralscientists (Stanford, Kentucky, Michigan State, and Connecticut), andat only one other place are any listed as available for electivecourses (Duke). But all in all, the total. number of anthropologistsinvolved as basic members of the programs is less than 10 -- in otherwords, an average, at best, of about one per program. Clearly, onthe basis of numbers, the voice of the anthropologist is not heard .very loudly in the land of medical education.Rut there are ways a discipline can have influence beyond thesimple reckoning of number of bodies, which is only one indicator.There are others of the three \"C's\" (corpus, course, concept) we shouldalso look at regarding types of contributions.We are not, however, much better off in assessing anthropologicalcontributions if we limit the purview to \"courses\" that are \"clearlyanthropological.\" Again, perhaps by virtue of sheer number of bodies,but also by virtue of the special kind of amalgam of behavioral sciencecourses in medical education that characterizes much of this process,there are very few, if any, courses that are \"anthropological\" in thedisciplinary sense of the term. The program at Stanford is outstanding 103 In this respect, giying the student the option of pursuing the M.A.in anthropology as part of his total medical training.Other courses taught in a number of places, however, begin totouch on anthropological areas of interest, concept, and data; and it isin this way that the third possibility for anthropology making asignificant contribution to the behavioral science dimension in medicaleducation is most pronounced -- the area of concept, together withassociated data. When one surveys the range of courses taught, a numberof key terms stand out is not our purpose hereto resurrect tribalistic territorial disputes, but simply to make theassertion that a great deal of anthropological literature based uponboth research findings and conceptualizations has found its way intothe common culture of medical sociology and medical social psychology.The term 'culture\" is perhaps the clearest index of this; forsociology as a discipline, the term is a much used -- but ancillary --one in the characterization of group life and social organization.While its i;lstorical formulation and doveiopment in the behavioralsciences clearly lay in the emerging discipline of anthropology ratherthan sociology, in the current scene it is one of the common and sharedkinds of concepts among the behavioral science disciplines, often usedwhenever the dimension of shared belief, orientation, \"meaning\" is being discussed. And there are numerous other \"common\" concepts.The point\\is that there is a certain measure of fluidity in the 104 concepts and data employed as teaching aids in the field of behavioralscience in medical education -- if a particular reading is useful forthe point being made, in many cases not too much concern is given to its disciplinary pedigree. And that is the way it should be. Allthings are relative, taking their final form as a function of contextand perspective. This is true even of academic departments and thepurportedly absolutistic, bounded, unreducible domains of knowledge(\"disciplines\") they represent. For example, are the much-used worksby anthropologist Zborowski (on cultural perceptions of pain and thepain response), by Paul (on cultural and social factors in healthprogram innovation), by Caudill (on the psychiatric hospital as asmall society) shunned by non-anthropologists teaching behavioral science in medical education? Not likely, to judge from the extent towhich they are now (and have been) used. And this process of \"culturaldiffusion\" (to use an anthropological phrase) with respect to data andconcepts that goes on in current teaching programs is perhaps a harbingerof .the kind of incipient \"behavioral science\" that, perforce, couldemerge from the discrete contributions to medical education of the basicbehavioral science disciplines of anthropology, sociology, and psychology.If such a working unity does emerge from this arena of joint purpose,it will represent one way in which the behavioral sciences might be inthis instance the recipients, and not just donors, in their participation in medical education. 105 BIBLIOGRAPHY BIrdwhistell, Ray L. 1970.KI1CSICS AND CONTEXT: ESSAYS ON BODY MOTIONCOMMUN[CATION.

I haveonly a technical education.\" PARTI BehavioralSciences in Medical EducationThe origins of medicine are lost in pre-history. As best we canguess, the field probably derives from Man's propensity for magic as aproblem solving device. When medicine's exploits began to be recorded,it became clear from these chronicles that the magical ingredientwhich \"cured\" many diseases was to be discovered in an interpersonalchemistry that, to use what has become a modern day clich, is identifiedas the doctor-patient relationship. Much human suffering seems todissolve when these ingredients are properly mixed.Medicine depended for much of its therapeutic success on promotingthe process of this relationship. The physician's major therapeutic toolswere his capacity to influence the patient's malaise through authority,understanding, persuasion and other psychological techniques. For theother cures, the doctor relied on hope and the mysterious ways of nature. 110 The major breakthrough in the assault on disease and death came in thenineteenth century, the so-called Golden Age of Medicine. This was, inIts most important aspects, a technical revolution. The tools whichwould alter biological processes were foretold in the great discoveriesof the period. The technical revolution which began in the nineteenthcentury continues unabated in the second half of the twentieth. Newtools are being fashioned that promise to bring about quite startlingalterations in the human condition which, even a short time ago, onlyscience fiction writers dared to contemplate. Witness the recentbreakthrough in the unraveling of the genetic code and the isolation ofa single gene. Using the nineteenth century as a baseline, theknowledge explosion in medicine and the technological implementationwhich followed can be described as a rapidly accelerating curve movingtoward a limitless horizon.The rapid advances have produced some disturbing \"fall-out\".Since the end of World War II, some segments of the medical communityabetted by the increasingly influential sciences of human behavior,vigorously inveighed against what they considered the rapid decline inthe human side of medicine. The complaint, briefly stated, was thatthe technical revolution had created an array of tools with which todo things to people and this resulted in less and less time to do thingswith people.The atmosphere was becoming increasingly impersonal andthe physician was placing the person in the role of \"patient as object\".In essence, this concept is characterized by a form of communicationin which the patient is identified by the disease rather than by hishuman qualities. This attitude is characterized (perhaps caricatured)in a play about physicians produced in the 1930s. One intern remindshis associate that \"You'll have to check the gallbladder in 321.\" (1) 111 ItIllustrates the tendency to separate the disease from the individual experiencing it. This segregated view, self versus body, became somethingof a battleground for medical educators during the last twenty years. Thenew view one heard expressed with increasing frequency might he'summed upin the slogan, \"patient as person\". This concept has been moving intothe ascendency in recent years, perhaps best reflected in attempts todevelop patient-centered curricula, the object to reunite technicalmedicine with human medicine. 1 The \"radicals\" charged that medical schools had, in fact, deteriorated into trade schools. Whatever the merits of the charge, a hostile,denigrating meaning was intended. After all, no one wants his professionto be designated as a trade and teachers of these professions didn't likethe idea that they were training tradesmen. Historically, at least, being\"in trade\" became an acceptable way of making a living but it certainlywasn't a ticket to social acceptability in the upper classes.it is not altogether clear what was meant by a \"trade school\" whenapplied to a professional training institution such as medicine. Tradeschools generally are thought of as places where technical skills such asauto mechanics or typewriter repair are taught. It is not a school thatis concerned with ideas, theories, research, scholarship, human feelings,and the complexities of the physical and social environment. Within thecontext of this charge, then, medical schools were seen as not concernedwith these matters since their only objectives was to turn out skilledtechnicians. 1he author once suggested that these curricula be described as person-centered rather than patient-centered since medicine's interest in peoplewent much beyond the rather time limited slot occupied by individualsidentified as patients. 112 However, the epithet \"trade school\" has been used very impreciselyand perhaps even irresponsibly. The medical school has always beenconcerned with ideas, theory building, research and scholarship butthe emphasis has been clearly and almost exclusively on the physicaldimensions of the organism. What has been absent, at least untilrecent times, is the medical school as an important intellectual centerfor ideas and research regarding psycho-social matters as they affecthealth and disease. Perhaps it might be more correct to say that ithas only been in recent years that the study of behavior has begun toapproach in interest and status some of the more traditional concernsof the medical school.The \"trade school\" accusation seemed to revolve around what someeducators felt was medicine's failure to alert future physicians to theproblems of people as patients. In addition, this group felt thatstudents were taught to do a job but no one took the time to teach themhow to think critically about the tasks in which they were engaged.It was the often expressed hope that the addition of psychiatry andthe behavioral sciences to the curriculum would go far to correct thesedefects.The dissatisfaction with this aspect of education should bediminishing since departments of psychiatry have had a phenomenal growth.In recent years the increasing participation of behavioralscientists in the teaching task has also been notable. What we do notknow is the effects these efforts have had on the products that schoolsof medicine have turned out. Are they producing physicians who caneffectively use behavioral knowledge and methods in more effectivepatient management?The study of human behavior entered medical education through thediscipline of psychiatry. Its beginnings were minuscule but its rise to 113 prominence has been impressive. This achievement was not obtained withouta considerable struggle. From its inception, psychiatry has metwith downright hostility, amusement or indifference from the academiccommunity and the practicing physician. Only from a very small groupof physicians did psychiatry get any sort of hearing at all. As psychiatrygrew and prospered, the atmosphere became more hospitable and itsaudience bacame larger and more respectful. Physicians were increasinglyimpressed that emotional factors were in some way important. Theywere willing to accede to the insistence of psychiatric personnel thatsomewhere between fifty to ninety percent of all illness was basedon a psychological. etiology. They were even willing to accept thedictum that physicians should understand, evaluate and manage theemotional factors in illness. All signs pointed to the fact thatpsychiatry had made it into the community of medical specialitiesand yetnot quite.it is reasonable to predict trouble in any community where aminority segment of the population speaks a language which is differentfrom the rest of the group. The likelihood that the prediction will cometrue is increased when the minority members utilize concepts, content andmethods which seem alien to the concepts, content and methods of themajority.There have been herculean efforts during the last twenty-five years to bridge the gap. Psychiatry and the behavioral sciencesare now greeted with greater enthusiasm in the medical community.However, acceptance is by no means complete and the value of thisdiscipline is still questioned in many quarters of the academic andprofessional community.In my view, the reason for these reservations lies in the feelingthat the sciences of human behavior have not provided an information 114 base that can be translated into methods that have clinical applicability,that'is, for the non-psychiatric physician. In short, they are askingto be provided with specific skills with which they can attack specific problems.Unless we can meet the demand for practical behavior skillsfor a variety of problems which are met in practice, many students andphysicians will continue to he skeptical about the value of our contribution.Curriculum development often seems to proceed without any clear idea as to its purpose. Much content is selected without any apparentN.thought as to the specific functions ultimately to be performed by theconsumer of the knowledge. Part of the difficulty may lie in the factthat the behavioral scientist as teacher often does not have anyclear idea what these future tasks are like. The problem of teachinggoals was illustrated at one of an infinite series of meetings whosetask was to streamline and integrate the curriculum, i.e., build bridgesbetween basic science knowledge and clinical skills. Basic scientists(biochemists in this instance) championed the inclusion of certain kindsof material in the first year program. The representative from medicine kept shaking his head in disagreement and interjecting with \"theaverage doc just doesn't need that...doesn't need that at all.\"As he seemed to see it, a curriculum dedicated to the integrationof basic science knowledge and clinical practice involved siftingfrom available knowledge that information which had functionalvalue for the tasks most physicians perform. From the point ofview of scholars and scientists, such a task oriented position aimedat the education of the \"average doc\" may seem the height of anti- intellectualism. Nevertheless, behavioral scientists must cometo grips with the fact that the vast majority of the students 115 they educate will be practitioners who need tools (along with commonsense) Lu solve a myriad of problems patients present to them on a d;lily husk.If we cannot provide a significant base of scientificI nowledge which is usable for problem solving, our audience will(alter initial bursts of enthusiasm) grow smaller, more resistive andre jeer our product as interesting but impractical for them. This is nota new story.Does It need to be a continuing one?The choice'of material to be taught is also dictated by Lhe amountof time provided and the structure of the curriculum. The choicesmay be further dictated by the destiny that the school has set foritself, e.g., practice oriented versus research oriented. In agraduate school, relatively speaking, there is considerable time to presentthe necessary material. In addition, most of the methodsand content taught are concerned with a single discipline to whichstudents have elected, more or less, to commit themselves. No suchluxury is provided by the medical curriculum. Time is limited and multi-disciplines vie for the students' interest and involvement. Given suchlimitations, the behavioral science teacher must judiciously selectthe material he will present. Such decisions must closely reflect therelationship of the subject matter to the instrumental behaviors thestudent will ultimately perform. Behavioral science knowledge has multiplied at a very rapid clipduring the past twenty years. There is much to choose from but theproblem is what content is most relevant to what ends. The behavioralsciences should, it seems to me, order its methods and content withspecific goals in view. For example, if the sociologist discusses modelsof health care delivery the goal might be to sensitize students to thecomplex social, governmental and economic forces which ultimately define the structural and qualitative aspects of medical practice. Such knowledgehelps the student think in a more richly diversified way about medicine'srole in Society; makes him, hopefully, a more committed and effective citizen-physician, etc. However, its direct applicability to the pro-cess of diagnosis and treatment is difficult to specify. On the otherhand, medical sociologistS have made contributions which are closelytied to task oriented procedures. Leta Adler, for example, modifiedthe Bales method and developed what she calls a Psychotherapy InteractionScale (PIA).The PIA provides a means of illuminating the processesof the medical interview.(2) The scale derived from the methodology ofsociology has highly specific value for current (i.e.,diagnostic historytaking In practice). However, it must be stressed that the instrumentalvalue content may have depends on the audience and the goals it is seeking.If, for example, a specialty track were offered to studentsin medical administration, then the functional value'of a subjectsuch as health care delivery services might increase dramatically.These considerations depend on the curriculum structure that amedical school adopts. Many medical schools seem to be moving in thedirection of providing a structure in which there is a major core,a specialty core (sometimes referred to as a track) and a series of electives.Major corewould be defined as a subject matter whichall students would be expected to learn. Specialty core would bedefined as material taught to students who decided to \"specialize\" incertain areas of medicine such as pediatrics and psychiatry. Electives,of course, are defined in the usual sense and would be available to allstudents.Three variables seem to dictate the form a behavioral science curriculum .is likely to take. They are (a) allotted teaching time, 117 (b) sutueture of the medical school curriculum, and (c) goals of teaching.Given these, considerations, behavioral scientists shouldcarefully inventory their fields and in a sense apply a \"conversionfactor\" to each of the units which comprise such a listing. In otherwords, subject matter which has a high potential for being translatedinto usable techniques and information in medical practice would rankhigh on a \"conversion scale\"; those units which had little or no relationto medical practice in terms of clinical use would rank at the bottom of the scale.Samples of content which would rank high on such a \"conversionscale\" are learning theory, psychological and cultural dimensions ofpaint, psychopharmacology, communication theory, hypnosis, psychophysio-logical and socio-cultural aspects of anxiety, depression and relatedaffects, neuro-psychology, systems of diagnosis, computers in diagnosisand treatment, behavioral concepts of dying and death, etc. Other subjects would rank low. For example, behavior genetics, a recentaddition to the curriculum would rank low on such a scale. -Many, I fear,will see this as a retrogressive suggestion but the subject does notfit easily into the above framework. If it seems important that allstudents should have some knowledge of this field, then a requiredreading list should be assembled and if the instructor were so inclinedhe could test them on their level of acquisition. 2In any event, sucha list is a good idea since the student is likely to learn more frombooks than teachers.However, a subject which might have a high degree of convertibilitymay have its utilitarian value destroyed by the content chosen.

While the current study ofbehavioral science programs explores several significant issues, itsgreatest value is the detailed information it provides concerningcurricula.Although the curricula in these studies may not be a represent-ative sample, they do reflect the kind of currents which is likelyto be influential in shaping behavioral science teaching programs inmedical schools. Since my assignment is to focus on the role of psychology as abehavioral science in medical education, the balance of this paperwill concern this discipline. However, as in the introduction, thecentral issue of teaching content will be its focus. 119 PART II Psychology in Medical Education Introduction Psychology is one of the newest of the sciences to establish a beach-head in schools of medicine. Nevertheless, the human events psychology purports to study, understand and teach is medicine'S most ancient subject matter.There is no dean, professor, student or layman, past, present or future, who would not agree that doctors of medicine should be sophisticated in their ability to control human behavior.No one would dispute the view that a very significant part of good medical care is helping patients adapt to their health problems. While 1 infer with great confidence such \"unanimity of opinion, I hasten to add that this agreement only concerns the end product.There is considerable disagreement about the means by which these objectives are to be achieved.The diversity of opinion ranges from those who maintain that these skills are simply shaped by the process of living and that formal tutoring is unnecessary for their acquisition, to those who insist that a complex curriculum is required if doctors are to lea-rn how to effectively intervene in the lives of the people they are called upon to care for.The recent history of behavioral sciences in medical education, which, in capsule form, is illustrated by the case studieslindicates that the latter philosophy is clearly in the ascendent.In many medical 1,1n schools the behavioral sciences have commandeered a respectable sliceof curriculum time which provides unparalleled opportunities to shapethe future of medical thought and practice. Nevertheless, the casestudies tell another story. The current activities of the behavioralsciences in medical education parallel (for want of a better metaphor) thedevelopmental stages of the young child. It has so many tasks to masterand so many problems to solve that it seems to be running off at alldirections at the same time. As in any developmental struggle, thereare likely to be failures. There is a good deal of talk about how tomaster problems but there is also, I think, a good deal of uncertaintyabout how to proceed.There is not much agreement as to how behavioral sciences should betaught and even less as to what should be taught. There is no unifyingconcept which ties behavioral science knowledge together that goes muchbeyond the statement that these disciplines view an from different platforms.We confidently inform students that all of this adds upto a whole man but they seem to have difficulty in understanding howthe link-up takes place. It is questionable whether our unifying conceptsare much more sophisticated than that reflected in the song that goes \"...and the shin bone is connected to the-thigh bone...etc.\"None of the above is meant to be pejorative nor is it meant tostimulate gloom. On the contrary, the behavioral sciences have beenvigorously pushing forward and their organizational'growth within themedical school attests to that fact. Its growth is also prima facieevidence that its relevance to patient care at the individual andcommunity levels have been sufficiently impressive as to persuademedical administrators to provide increasing support for, these programs. 121 Nevertheless, there are formidable problems which lie ahead such asdevelopinga coherent body of information that we all consider essentialfor doctors of medicine. The case studies are a useful guide not onlybecause they provide some idea of the \"state of the art\" but becausethey pose important questions and provide useful information concerningcontent, methods and objectives. An Historical Note Before proceeding to psychology's role in the case studies and thekinds of contributions psychology can make to a core medical curriculum,some observations concerning psychology's history in mediCal educationmay provide a useful backdrop. This picture is derived both from theformal history of the period and from the narrower perspective of myown experiences as a participant in medical education.Although psychology is a relative newcomer to medical education,it is clearly the senior member of the behavioral sciences group interms of years spent in teaching, research and administration as wellas in the number of its members engaged in these 'pursuits. As early as1912, a series of papers authored by .1. B. Watson, Shepherd I. Franz,Morton Prince, and Adolf Meyer appeared in the Journal of American MedicalAssociation urging a psychology curriculum in medical education. (3)inthe ensuing years, an occasional psychologist such as David Wechsler atNew York University was to be found on mediCal school faculties. AsMatarazzo points out, this \"represented a recognition of individualabilities rather than a recognition that psychology as a profession hada contribution it could make to medicine.\" (4) However, it was notuntil post World War II that psychology began to command an active,expanding and formal role. within the medical school. Perhaps the 122 appointment of David Shakow in 1946 as Professor of Psychiatry at theUniversity of Illinois might provide the bench mark for this development.In the early fifties, psychologists such as Louis Cohen at Duke, IvanMensh at Washington University, Irwin Knopf at Iowa, Milton Horowitzat Western Reserve, Arthur Bachrach and Evan Pattishall at Virginia,Joseph Matarazzo at Oregon, Carney Landis at Columbia and many othersassumed active roles in teaching, research, training and administration.By 1956, the movement was accelerating so rapidly that the time seemedripe for a conference designed to assess where psychology had been and when...It might begoing in nedical education. (5) As a further indexof growth, a survey prepared for this conference revealed that 346 psycho-logists were employed by medical schools. In 1959, another conferencewas convened to consider what substantive content psychology couldcontribute to medical education. (6) By 1964 the number of psychologistshad increased to 993 and the most recent study indicates that thereare approximately 1300 psychologists on the roster of medical schools.(7)In addition, at least two psychologists, Carlyle Jacobson and JohnConger attained high level leadership roles when they were appointedas deans at Syracuse and Colorado respectively. We can infer fromthese figures that psychology has had an impact on medical education.I think it would be altogether reasonable to state that psychologyprepared the ground for the introduction and effective participationof the other behavioral sciences. While Psychology's pioneering role was influential, it is historicallyunclear at what point the broader concept of behavioral sciences wasgrafted onto the body of medical education. It is likely that psychologists 123 who were in medical schools during this early period made use ofideas from sociology and anthropology in teaching and research.My own recollection Is that the ferment in psychiatry, which beganafter World War 11, led to a search for new concepts and tools withwhich to broaden its theoretical and factual base. Psychiatry hadalready discovered a useful if sometimes difficult ally in psychology.Particuiarly because of the influence of the postFreudian socio-cultural. theorists such as Horney, Fromm, Sullivan and Kardiner,psychiatry began to form alliances with the social sciences. Butincreasingly influential nonpsychiatric physicians within the medicalschool appreciated the potential contribution of the social sciencesand provided financial and administrative support for them. Psychologists)as the above figures indicate, were already present in appreciable. numbers.As 'sociologists and anthropologists entered the scene, thenecessary professional ingredients were present for the collaborativeeffort demanded of a behavioral science program. However, a superordinating concept was needed to organize and launch the behavioralscience team.As I recall, the credit for introducing such a conceptto medical education belongs to Edward Stainbrook. The State UniversitySchool of Medicine at Syracuse, New York was the cradle in which theconcept was initially tested.The author first heard the term \"behavioral science\" from Stainbrook.1The year was 1949. At that time, Stainbrook was assistant professorof psychiatry at Yale and a consultant to the Connecticut StateHospital where I functioned as a staff psychologist. During frequentconversations and at lectures and conferences which I attended, Stainbrookoutlined his ideas, conceptual and administrative, concerning the role 1Stainbrook'S preparation in several aspects in psychology was extensive.He had wide experience in clinical psychology as well as in theoreticaland experimental psychology. He received a joint M.D., Ph.D. (inpsychology) in 1945.124 of behavioral sciences in medical education. Although Stainbrook'sformal training was in psychology, he had a unique grasp of sociologicaland cross-cultural themes as they applied to health and disease. Allof the essential issues we have become so familiar with over the pastfifteen years were described by Stainbrook during the period 1949 - 1.952.He had the opportunity to put his ideas into practice when he acceptedthe chairmanship of the department of psychiatry at SUNY at Syracuse. iwas invited (and accepted) to join the department as the representativeof psychology.We began our teaching activities in 1952. However, in order tolaunch a collaborative teaching program, a sociologist and/or anthro-pologist at a minimum was a necessary requirement. We borrowed ananthropologist from Syracuse University. In 1953 our need for asociologist was solved when Robert Straus, whose contribution tothe behavioral sciences in medicine is too well known to need furthercomment here, joined the faculty as a member of the Department ofPublic Health. With this skeleton crew we began to limn out a behavior-al science curriculum.Stainbrook suggested when feasible that \"wave front\" teachingshould be the method of choice. This technique is based on a conceptualpoint of viewwhich he described as follows:\"At what most medical men consider the basiclevel of physiological function and dysfunction,it can be shown readily that social and culturalhappenings may have quite definite effects uponthe facilitation and the perpetuation of physio-pathology.It would seem that one effective wayto represent the transactions by which culture,society, and personality enter physiology is to usethe conception of open-ended, interlocking, recipro-cally transacting systems. The physiological system,structured by anatoma and composed of interacting 125 biochemical and electrophysiological systems, isan open-ended relationship with the personalitysystem.The personality system, in turn, can berepresented in reciprocal relationship with thevarious small-group and institutional systemswhich comprise the more complicated social environ-ment, ranging from the single organization to thecommunity and national polity.\" (8)Transacting this in terms of the \"wave front\" teaching meant that atopic, for exampLe, infancy, would be taught from several points ofview and hopefully appropriate linkages between them would be estab- lished.Ideally, the lecture sequence for this topic would he initiatedby a biologist(or other specialist who had expertise in this arca)whose objective would be to outline the role of genetic history asMuth a limiting and directional. process In development. A secondexpert, perhaps a physiologist, would provide a picture of structureand function and its implications for the development of human behavior.The next specialist at bat would be a psychologist and histask would be to discuss those events which are important to personalitydevelopment.Finally, a sociologist and/or an anthropologist wouldaccent social data designed to illuminate the effects of child-renring practices on personality development both locally and cross-culturally.Other behavioral scientists could certainly enter the\"wave front\" although at Syracuse we relied only on the more traditionalspecialists.Such a format provides for close collaboration. Animplicit hope was that the intimacy involved in this working arrange-ment coupled with the necessity of coming to terms with common objectivesmight result in a contribution to an integrated theory of human behavior.At Syracuse, we made no headway with the latter goal. Whether thispedagogical format was any more successful than the more usual arrangement is 126 a moot point.However, in one way or another most behavioral scienceprograms attempt to emulate this model. Since all of them are committedto the idea (in word ff not always in deed) of the continuity of thebiological, psychological and social systems, they seek teaching formulaswhich parallel this concept. How successful such an approach is interms of integrating content as well as teachers is unclear to me.The case studies are not very illuminating on this point.As the collaborative teaching effort evolved, an administrativeunit in the behavioral sciences was established by Dean Willard. RobertStraus acted as coordinator for the group. As far as I know, thiswas the first time a medical school made a move toward bringing behavioralsciences together under a single administrative umbrella. Whether thisarrangement would have eventually developed into a more formalized unitsuch as an autonomous department is a matter of speculation since severalof the major participants left Syracuse for posts at other institutions.However, the events described above were probably highly influential inthe decision to establish a department at Kentucky.If Syracuse was a prologue to the development of behavioral scienceprograms, the events at Kentucky can properly be considered the beginningof Act 1.Up until this time instruction in human behavior was almost thesole property of psychiatric practitioners. With the introduction ofbehavioral sciences, a new breed of professional scientist was to beadded to the roster of medical schools. There was no gainsaying the factthat these scientists were necessary (if not always welcome) additions to the faculty. The struggle now centered upon the administrative formatwhich translated meant how and by whom would behavioral scientists becontrolled.In the ensuing years, several solutions have been attempted. 127 As the matter now stands, it is unlikely that a single administrativestandard will be agreed upon.The general history of this problem has been discussed by others.However, there are two aspects related to psychologists which might benoted here.Most psychologists in medical schools are identified asclinicians.While a clinical psychologist may be able to do manythings, the usual characterization is one who is a specialist in theassessment and treatment of abnormal behavior. The emphasis is onpracticerather than research although many clinicians effectivelycombine both roles. in addition to these functions, clinical psycho-logists have provided much of the instruction in the fundamentals ofhuman behavior. As far as non-medical instructors are concerned, clinicalpsychologists have dominated the teaching scene at the undergraduate andgraduate levels. However, developments in the behavioral sciences pro-vided a new avenue for psychologists. Behavioral science units nowbegan to seek psychologists with other identities, e.g., neuro-psychologists, psychopharmaeologists, physiological psychologists,social psychologists, etc. A more catholic view of the role ofpsychology was emerging. Secondly, the historical relation of psychology to psychiatryis also of importance. Psychologists as a group have chronicallycomplained of their subordinate (some would substitute subservient).role to psychiatrists. There has always been a strong feeling thatmore autonomy and greater equality were the necessary ingredients for happiness.Indeed, in some quarters the bitterness has risen to sucha pitch that an exodus from medical schools is proclaimed as the only panacea for this problem, e.g., the statements of George ALbee. Fortunately, most psychologists in medical education do not take thismanifesto very seriously. At least, I've heard of no mass resignationas a response to this Latter Day Moses. 1But the wish for administrativeunits as well as teaching and research programs which are controlled bypsychologists is still a highly attractive goal within the profession.Mottarazzo's Department of Psychology at the University of Oregonis unique for medical schools and fits, I am sure, the \"beau ideal\"of many, if not most psychologists. But I also foresee that psychologistswill applaud the multiplication of departments of behavioral science.They represent another step in the direction of autonomy, equality andresponsibility. Support from psychology for the development of behavioralscience is a certainty.These developments will effect the numbers and the kinds ofpsychologists in medical schools. However, it is not likely to signi- ficantl Yalter the historical collaborative relationship betweenpsychology and psychiatry. Clinical psychologists will continue to bethe dominant representatives, at least in terms of numbers, in themedical school and they will continue to be largely housed in depart-ments of psychiatry. Since their training and interests emphasizeapplication, the identification with psychiatry's mental health missionwill continue to be strong. The Case Studies: Psychology's Role The nine case studies are impressive documents. They describe indetail the enormous amount of effort which has been expended in trying to effect a major change in medical education and thinking. It would be 1As Witkin and others have documented, medical schools are attractivesettings to work in. Material advantages such as salaries are generallybetter than at other institutions. 129 necessary Lo have been a participant in medical education prior to 1960 to appreciatehow drastically the scene has changed for the behavioral sciences.Anthropologists, psychologists, and sociologists are increasinglyfamiliar figures in the lecture halls, seminar rooms, on ward walks, atgrand rounds, on admission committees, etc.The case studies seem to provide evidence that a period of expansion lies ahead.This is based on the observation that the scientists whocompiled these documents feel that, on balance, what they have tocontribute to their medical schools Is well accepted and is here to stay.These studies also seem to point to the conclusion that a self-contained unit whether a department or division is the most effectivevehicle for achieving eJucational, administrative and research goals. Ifdeans as well as other powerfully placed administrators read and acceptthe message in the same way, then self-contained behavioral scienceunits will become commonplace in medical schools.The behavioral science programs from the nine schools are character-ized by their individuality. This is both a challenge and a difficulty.Since we are in a phase of exploration and growth, the challenge liesin the opportunity to study the effects of different formats as vehiclesfor achieving our educational gdals. The difficulty lies in makingclear to others (i.e., deans and other powerfully placed administrators)what we intend to provide medical students with that is useful in the care of people. Since different programs emphasize different content,administrators may question what appears to be the lack of a commonpool of relevant knowledge. Their expectations have been conditioned byother disciplines where core content is fairly well agreed upon. Whilewe need not apologize for the diversity, we should be prepared for such 130 questions with meaningful answers.The behavioral science programs in this study are built around acommon theme.They pay homage to the point of view that Man is a multi-Incett!d animal who can only be fruitfully comprehended through theanalysis and synthesis of biological, psychological and environmental events.While each program attempts to hold this multi-thematic banneraloft, it is a tall order to expect any curriculum to present thistripartite model in an even handed, in-depth fashion. Quite predictablysome themes are given greater prominence than others. However, I havethe very distinct impression that the shape a behavioral science curriculumtakes Is significantly determined by the special interests of theprogram's leadership. When sociologists are in charge, the social-culturaldimension shines through. For example, in describing the compositionof the groups who planned the initial programs at Missouri and Kentucky,the_absence of representation from biology and psychology is striking.Where the leadership has its roots in the biodlogical and psychologicaldisciplines then these issues seem to get top billing. Obviously, thesefactors give rise to very individualized notions as to what kinds ofinformation and experience medical students need.Using this idea, a rough classification of behavioral scienceprograms in this study is possible. Stanford, Harvard, Missouri, andKentucky would be classified in Group 1 since the socio-cultural issuesseem to be the major guidelines for their curriculum. Group II includesTofonto, Michigan State and Connecticut. While socio-cultural issuestend to dominate the curriculum, psychology and to a lesser extent,biology play more defined roles. Duke and Hershey are representated inGroup III.Psychology and biology are more definitively and extensivelyrepresented.While the socio-cultural themes are clearly represented, 131 they do not tend to dominate the curriculum as in Groups 1 and 11.The brief summaries of the nine behavioral science programs whichfollow are designed to highlight the role and contribution of psychology.If, from time to time, a querulous note enters, the reader is warned thatthese observations are made from a highly parochial and partisan platform. Stanford The case study is entitled \"Medicine and the Behavioral Sciences atStanford University.\" However, the \"behavioral\" refers only to sociologyand anthropology. Psychology was eliminated from the program becauseof a paucity of students electing an M.A. degree and because of \"anexpansion of undergraduate training in the medical school through theDepartment of Psychiatry.\" In addition, psychology was excluded be-cause of \"the interest of federal funding agencies in training pro-grams geared more directly to health service applications.\" Psycho-logy seems to have fallen victim to the politics of federal largesse.The assumption is that psychology is represented in the cur-riculum of the Department of Psychiatry. However, this report doesnot specify in what way psychology's contribution to the curriculum is made.There seems to be cold comfort at Stanford for psychologyat least in terms of the behavioral science partnership concept. Harvard Harvard almost exclusively emphasizes the effects of the culturalsystem on medicine. Health delivery systems, urban problems, poverty,moral decision making, the structure of governmental agencies in re-lation to medical care and related matters are the primary targets in 132. the first year. A series of field exercises complement the didacticaspects in order to provide a bridge between concepts and reality.In addition, there is a series entitled Social Medicine which appearsa mtx of the sociological, economic and psychological concerns. Inthe second year, eleven lectures are provided in psychopathology inthe context of a standard psychoanalytic framework. The electivesprovide some opportunity for concentrated study in subject mattermore closely related to biological and psychological processes.However, even in the elective area psychology's potential contri-bution in understanding human behavior is far outweighed by theemphasis on the social, cultural, political, and economic influ-ences on the practice of medicine. Missouri Missouri's program seems unabashedly sociological. The chair-man is a sociologist and hi!, faculty come from closely allied dis-ciplines, e.g., anthropology, economics, etc. Up to the presenttime, psychology has not been represented on the full-time facultyalthough a social psychologist has been employed for the comingacademic year. The choice of psychologist, however, tends to high-light the strong socio-cultural mission of this unit. While otheraspects of behavior are taught, the contribution comes from psycho-logists in the Department of Psychiatry. There are long series oflectures given by experts in many fields. There is an occasionallecture which utilizes a psychologist. Curiously enough, behaviormodification, a major specialty of psychology, is presented by asocial worker. While the curriculum provides diversity within asociological framework, it does not seem to provide instruction in other behavioral science sectors. This is pointedly highlighted inthe electives which have no provision for pursuing themes other thansociological ones. Kentucky On page 1047, Volume IV B, the components of a unifying con-cept of human behavior are listed, e.g., biological-structure, func-tion, chemistry, genetics, characteristics of the organism; psycho-logicalthe personality; social; cultural and temporal. If we usetheir introductory course \"Health and Society\" as the barometer whichmeasures the emphasis placed on the various elements of the unifyingconcept, then the reading for the socio-cultural dimension is highbut low for the biological and psychological segments. Psychologyseems to make a more specific contribution in conjoint courses, i.c,,human growth and development, communication and interviewing. How- ever,Itis difficult to determine in what way psychologists re-present their discipline in the teaching of these courses. The elec-tives are essentially sociological. This heavy emphasis is relievedonly by the inclusion of medical economics and statistics as elec- tives.Despite the above mentioned unifying concept, biology andpsychology seem to be the background music for the major message. Toronto The Toronto report makes the point that psychologists and socio-logists are \"unaccustomed to work together, whose teaching and re-search orientations often differ; in sum, whose scholarly valuesR.re on occasion incompatible.\" However, these conflicts as they af-ect the shape of the curriculum and faculty working relations are not specified. While the strong sociological influence is apparent,the attempt to focus on individual psychology is more even-handed thanin the four previous reports. In addition to growth and develop-ment and interviewing, they focus on such themes as the problems of students adapt.1.-:g to their new roles as physicians, personal crisesin medicine, etiology of obsessive- compulsive neuroses, the psycho-physiology of pain and the psychology of personality. Importantsubjects such as learning and biology seem to be neglected in the form-al curriculum. However, there are faculty members who appear to beexperts in these areas at least as suggested by their research, e.g.,limbic system and behavior, neural mechanisms of learning and behav-ior, etc.The Toronto report closes on a somewhat ambivalent note,\"The program is both inter- disciplinary and inter-professional - astrength and a weakness.\" Neither the strength or weakness is de-tailed although their initial observation about the differences be-tween psychologists and sociologists comes to mind. While Toronto hasattempted to maintain balance in subject matter, do these initial andfinal observations imply that agreement between disciplines concern-ing obji 2tives and content is often extra-ordinarily difficult toachieve? Michigan State One of the striking features of the Michigan State Universityprogram is that the home base of behavioral scientists is the parentdepartment rather than the school of medicine. This arrangement al-ways raises the haunting spectre of commitment. It is no secret thatmany departments of psychology are very wary of becoming involved inmedically controlled organizations. Does this pose problems at Mich-igan State University? The behavioral science curriculum evolves out of committee deliberations. The subject matter for which psycho-logists have major teaching responsibility is in a series of \"mini courses.\"Behavior modification, mental retardation and the psy-chological problems of the physically handicapped are choices avail-able to medical students. What. Is Intriguing about the content iswhy these areas were selected rather than many other topics of med- ical interest.This is not to imply that these topics are of limit-ed or negligible value. But the thinking behind these choices isnot provided.Were these choices left to the discretion of the psy-chologists or were they a consensus of the decision making group?Did the decision makers see these areas as the most significantcontribution psychology could make to patient care? On the otherhand, were these areas chosen as models which exemplified the mannerin which psychological theory and research are applied to the solu- tion of practical medical problems? Connecticut The psychology faculty is concentrated in the department of be-havioral sciences and community health. What is unique in this ar-rangement is that the department is located in the school of dentalmedicine.As far as I am aware, this is the richest vein of full-time talent in the country administratively assigned to a dentalschool.How this arrangement came into being is not made clear.It is also striking that there are no psychologists in the depart-ment of psychiatry. Can it be that the University of Connecticutis attempting to avoid the aggravations which have been visited onhybrid departments? However, these administrative arrangements donot seem to hamper the teaching commitment to the school of med-icine.Curriculum time is provided to teach important psychologi- 136 cal subjects such as anxiety and stress, behavior modification tech-niques, cognitive development, perception and cognitive style, groupprocess in the management of stress, illness and dying, pain, etc.Since the University of Connecticut people provided an excellent sum-mary of their content, some assessment of what was taught is possible.The material on anxiety and stress is well organized and the majorissues are clearly presented. This is true of the other content areas as well.However, from my point of view there is one significantdifficulty with the material. It seems to be organized with grad-uate students of psychology in mind. While the content is currentand relevant, the instructors seem to build too few bridges to clin- ical medicine. Duke Duke differs from the schools previously described in terms ofits administrative arrangements for behavioral science and its bio-logical and psychological emphasis. Duke was one of the firstmedical schools to emphasize the role of psychology in medical educa- tion.In addition, the psychology taught had firm ties to the exper-imental tradition. In part, this bit of history may have been import-ant in shaping the current-strong psychological and biological em-phases in the curriculum. An examination of the outline of the firstyear course clearly underscores this fact. However, psychologistsappear to play no role (except as small group leaders) in teaching anyof the major segments of the course. The only non-physician whois used as an instructor for a majoz segment is a sociologist. This,however, may only highlight the fact that psychiatrists and psycho-logists are competitors for the same material. There appears tohave been some unrest regarding the use of psychiatrists as teachers of basic behavioral science. This criticism is contained in the fol-177 lowing quotation: ...that clinical psychiatrists are not appro-2orlatc in teaching basic science and furthermore that this providesthe department of psychiatry (which houses the behavioral scientists)overexposure in terms of capturing the students' interest in future career involvement. The teaching criticism was offset to a certainextent by a recent ruling in the department of psychiatry that onlythose M.D.'s in psychiatry who also had appointments in the graduateschool or behavioral science departments would be used as instructorsin the third year behavioral scienk ,urse.\"However, there is noindication how many physicians-instructors would have these creden- tiais.The heavy accent on psychology content and instructors is inthe third year elective program. Experimental design, behavior devel-opment, cognitive personality theory, intelligence and cognition,neural substrates of perception and cognition, learning theory andpsychopathology, mental retardation and related topics are possiblechoices provided students. Both in curriculum and in faculty, theemphasis at Duke appears more bio-psychological than socio-cultural. Pennsylvania State (Hershey) The philosophy which appears to guide the Hershey curriculumis summed up as follows: \"The type of graduate valued as an end pro-duct of the medical school has been stated as an undifferentiatedphysician interested in primary care.\" I assume from this that theirobjective is to produce physicians who possess basic attitudes, con-cepts and skills necessary to operate in one or more areas of medi-cal practice.One can assume further that the choice of behavioralscience content is predicated on this point of view. Like otherprograms, the basic required course is \"behavioral growth and devel-opment.\"The course is taught by a physician and a sociologist withoccasional participation of other unspecified experts. Psycholo- gists make their major contribution to the teaching program in thefirst year tracks, i.e., brain-behavior mechanism, etiology of mentalillness and the theories of psychotherapy. A review of the examin-ations of these tracks indicates that the major emphasis lies inbiology and psychology. In addition, the electives for the firstand second year also support the impression that the biological-behavioral themes receive the major accent. This is not meant toimply that matters of socio-cultural import are not attended to butthe contrast with Harvard, Stanford and Missouri curricula is quitestriking.Perhaps more than any of the other programs, the emphasison individual patient care is stressed. At least, this focus sur-faces more clearly than in the other eight studies. The Critical Issue Revisited The nine programs propose several solutions to integrating be-havioral sciences into medical education. While there are similar-ities between the programs, it is their diversity which is moststriking, and, in the end, most instructive.Perhaps the diversity of approaches is due to the fact that weare a young and inexperienced group. The years of maturity still lie ahead.In addition, we may still feel uncertain about what weknow or at least what we have to contribute that is significant tomedical education. Perhaps we are also overly-ambitious. Placingseveral disciplines under one umbrella may put too much of a strainon the decision-making process. While people committed to the idealsof behavioral science subscribe to the notion that cooperationis a guiding principle for effective group action (and we would enthu-siastically teach this to students), they may be discovering thatgracefully relinquishing territory to achieve the goal is rather more 139 difficult than they care to admit. The Toronto group alludes to this, and if Jextrapolate from my own observations, difficulties in mutual decision- making between people who are in different fieldsand have different Identifications often seem to be very great.Many psychologists, for example, might be sympathetic to the ideathat health care delivery is an important social and political prob- lem.However, their colleagues from the social sciences might findthem less than enthusiastic about using the limited time availableparticularly in the first two years to teach this subject. Underthese circumstances, \"power politics\" may be more influential thananything else in arriving at the shape of the curriculum. Asidefrom allegiance to the common goal of understanding the human factorsin health and disease, the various disciplines have different agendas.Whose agenda - the biologist's, the psychologist's, economist's, the political - will receive the most sympathetic hearing? Obvious-ly, the character of the mix in the several programs will determinethe curricula and contribute to wide inter-program differences.One need not decry diversity. As I suggested earlier, it may be an opportunity and a challenge. How different programs work and howeffectively they achieve their goals should be instructive for future developments. There is, however, another critical questionthat needs to be posed concerning wide variability in curricula.How do behavioral scientists approach the task of curriculum development?I have little idea what the process was in the nine case studies.The authors were not asked to detail these events and per-haps this was a major omission. But my impression is, buttressed byexperience in the medical schools I have been associated with, thatthe question which governs the selection of content is, \"What should doctors of medicine know?\" This is a perfectly simple and reasonable question,There is, however, one difficulty with it. The answerswhich emerge are restricted by the limitations of the disciplinesasking the question. A behavioral scientist may order his prior-ities in terms of the knowledge extant in his own field. Psycholo-gists may have one set of priorities, sociologists another, politicalscientists still another and so on. Choices are then made in termsof what each specialist thinks is important from his particular field.Perhaps what is needed is external criteria, that is, a modelagainst which each discipline's theories and facts can be matched. Ifthe above question were changed to \"What is the doctor's job(s)\", thenthe first task would be to clothe the model with what is basic andessential to the task at hand.The two questions I have posed may sound like a word game. How-ever, the distinctions may become clearer by reference to the recenthistory of the struggle for curriculum change in medical education as a whole.Briefly, it involves a clash between basic scientists andclinicians in which the latter claim that the former do not teachwhat is essential to the doctor's job. In other instances, the accu-sation is that what they teach is irrelevant to the effective edu-cation of good clinicians. These problems arise, the clinician com-plains, because the basic scientist frequently is not conversant withthe doctor's job.Most behavioral scientists are at a disadvantage because they arenot physicians and do not have certain important experiences. Theyhave not gone to medical school and therefore do not have that bodyof knowledge that directs the thinking and behavior of physicians. Inaddition, they have no experience with nor any responsibility for thedaily care of people's needs both personal and physical. Important 141 Ingredients of the \"docturIng process\" are missing. In nn earlier im- pel-Isuggested that behavioral scientists who plan a career in medicaleducation need specialized training. (9) Its purpose would be toprepare them for understanding the doctor's job. Such compensatorytraining Is necessary so that when they come to tasks like curriculumdevelopment, they can make useful discriminations between a widerange of possible content.Developing the model of the doctor's job(s) was not part of thisstudy and is well beyond the scope of this paper. However, the effi-cacy of such a model can be illustrated by some glaring omissions insome of the case studies. Pain and the negative affects are cases In point.Physicians are prime practitioners of pain control. In developinga model of the doctor's job, no one could argue that such a functionwas not a critical part of such a model. Yet the subject of painis rarely taught in medical schools except by neurologists andpharmacologists. If you look at standard textbooks in psychology, thesubject is not alluded to except perhaps in relation to cold pressortests as techniques for studying stress. The situation is no betterIn textbooks of psychiatry. This is amazing given the enormousImplications of the subject. in recent years, the work of Melzack,Sternbach and Zborowski and some others have been instrumental in bring-ing the subject to the attention of behavioral scientists. Despiteits importance, only two of the nine case studies pay any significantattention to the subject of pain. If one used a well defined modelof the doctor's job as a guide to content, then all of the behavioralscience groups should provide significant instruction in the study of pain.The negative affects, anxiety and depresSion are a second case in point.When people become ill (or perhaps just go for their annual physical) internal perturbations in one form or another are evoked.These feelings range from mild tension or a vague uneasiness to themore extravagant forms of anxiety and/or depressio Because these experiences are ubiquitous, specialists of various stripes in medi-cine have emphasized how important it is for physicians to under-stand the forms and functions of these emotions. Any analysisof the doctor's job should give a high priority to instruction inthe biology, psychology, and sociology of the negative affects. How-ever, in none of the case studies is there any reference to anxietyand depression as independent subjects of study. The doctor'sjob required in-depth knowledge of these matters and all programs. 1.,should make specific provision for teaching them. JI\\\\In considering the kind of content that is essential in prepar-ing students to take care of people, the factor of time is of someconsequence.The time devoted to a medical education seems to be con,-tracting in two ways, at least in terms of its formal boundary lines.Absolute time is shrinking, e.g., the elimination of the internship,the three-year medical school, etc. But with the rapid increasein the number of subjects to be taught, time available for any onesubject decreases. Behavioral science has significantly contributedto the problem by the number of courses it has added. While wetalk of behavioral science as if it represented one subject, it iscomprised of many disciplines each with a vast body of knowledge.The present study identifies six disciplines and there are otherswhich might have been included, e.g., history, linguistics, etc.How are all of these subjects to be accommodated within the confinesof the time we can reasonably expect to carve out? Shall we preparea light smorgasbord so that everyone can have a taste of many delicacies?While no one may get indigestion, such a meal is likely to be neither satisfying or nourishing. Or shall we fade-the fact that we must 143 make hard choices about what we are going to teach? My own view isthat fewer subjects taught in greater depth and related to basicobjectives, that Is, primary patient care, will reap the greatest rewards.Expansionist policies may lead to the same disappointmentas Cinderella's sisters who tried, to fit too large a foot into too small, a space. They experienced both disappointment and rejection.Carefully selecting content to be taught in medical schoolinvolves eliminating material which is nevertheless important foreducated physicians to be cognizant of. If my thesis that-educationalanemia will result from overcrowding the curriculum, then, perhaps,more living space ought to be sought elsewhere. The obvious placeto prospect is in undergraduate education.Applicants to medical school have been required to completecertain preparatory courses,e.g., English, organic chemistry, etc.As psychiatry's influence becomes more pronounced, some educatorsadvised (and a few schools even required) students to take someundergraduate behavioral science courses. Psychology received mostof the publicity but in recent years the broader social sciencepoint of view has been emphasized. Any experienced interviewer ofapplicants to medical school will appreciate its impact on student thinking.The applicant, almost on cue, would communicate to theinterviewer how important he thought the study of human behavior wasfor a medical education. Whether he really believed this, it was clearthat he had learned that such statements were de rigueur for a goodinterview.But these expectations coupled with the social unrest ofrecent years seems to have contributed to the number of medical appli-cants with preparation in the behavioral sciences. Twenty years agoit would have been impossible for a student to have majored in oneof these disciplines and expect an admissions committee to sympatheti- cally review the application. These circumstances no longer obtain.For example, while the numbers of behavioral science majors who areadmitted are relatively small, they are astronomical in comparisonto pre-1950 standards.The recommendations to pursue behavioral science subjects duringthe undergraduate period, however, have been general and unspecific.The advice is to \"prepare yourself\" because \"understanding humanbehavior\" is important in treating patients. Perhaps the time haspassed when we can be so casual in our suggestions.The case studies indicate that one of the major consumers of timein the medical curriculum are those subjects which are concernedwith medicine as an institution. I assume that the objectives are(a) to prepare students to cope with a changing socio-economic med-ical system, (b) to sensitize students to the effects of health caredelivery on the various segments of the population, (c) to provideconcepts, information and perhaps tools to students who may becomephysician-administrators, and (d) to change attitudes so that studentswho become physicians will be better informed citizens. The case studiesleave me with the feeling that the time which is available is quiteinsufficient for these purposes. Given the nature of medical edu-cation, the \"competitive effect\" will insure that these objectiveswill be seriously impaired or fail.The need now, I believe, is to more carefully \"engineer\" behav-ioral science experience at the undergraduate level. A sequence inmedical behavioral science would provide the student with necessaryconcepts, information and attitudes while at the same time \"economize\"in terms of the formal medical curriculum. But economy is not theonly issue.More solid preparation is important if we are to useful- ly tie behavioral science to the practice of medicine, The study of 145 the history of medicine would seem to illustrate this point.Knowledge of the history of medicine appears to be at or closeto zero among medical students. My information does not derivefrom an objective study but rather from the experience of inter-viewing hundreds of medical applicants over a period of about thirteen years. As part of my interview, I always inquired into the .applicant's familiarity with medical literature and history. \"Notas a Stranger\" was the odds on favorite in the fifties and almostthe exclusive entry for literature. As far as history was concerned,DeKruif's \"Microbe Hunters\" was mentioned by a few. By the sixties,even that old standby had disappeared. I can't recall a student whohad read any of the standard histories of medicine. When the appli-cant was queried about any of the popular giants of medicine, ablank stare was the most frequent response.Why there seems to be such indifference to the story of the pro-lession among applicants is probably worth further inquiry. But Ithink educators are remiss in not rectifying this deficiency. Thereason is not that students need to know the story of medicine inorder to practice medicine but because we are spending an increasingamount of time in medical school in trying to sensitize future phy-sicians concerning medicine as a social institution. A history sequencehas the great advantage of .retailing the social, economic, psycho-logical, political and intellectual currents which shaped the develop-ment of medicine. It would seem to me that much of the effort atinstructing medical students in the institutional aspects of medicinemight be accomplished by such an academic arrangement. In addition,electives within the history sequence might be available so thatstudents could pursue special topics of interest in greater depth,e.g.,politics of medicine, the development of medicine in socialist economics, etc.Under these circumstances, students would arrive in medical school with much more effective preparation for appreciating medicine as an Institution.Medical schools, in the end, may be forced to .ollow the generalroute that John Hopkins is pursuing. The undergraduate years willbe harnessed in order to provide the general blueprint. In the behav-ioral sciences, such topics as medicine as an institution and theoriesof personality would be assigned to this period of time. Medical school\"proper\" would be reserved for those asvcts of behavioral sciencewhich are more directly applicable to primary patient care. PART IIIPsychology's Contribution to a Medical Curriculum Psychology's role among the behavioral sciences is unique forat least three reasons. Unlike its sister sciences, psychology admin-isters vast territories, the borders of which are frequently difficultto identify.The behavior of all living organisms are subject for study.Psychology maintains strong alliances with the biological andchemical sciences because of the importance it ascribes to the rela-tionship of behavior to the physical properties of the organisms. Butpsychologists are equally interested in understanding behavior,whether it be that of ants or humans, as a function of social organ- ization.Between the biological and the societal, psychologists areengaged in studying a wide array of human events and activities.Sensation, perception, cognition, affects, conditioning, learning,development, communication, motivation, frustration and conflict,personality, abnormal behavior, the conditions of behavior change, etc.The second distinctive feature is the fact that psychology hasa strong technological tradition. In part this is based on the devel-opment of instrumentation for research purposes. But application 147 of psychological findings to human affairs has always been an import-ant objective.The study of human abilities led to the developmentof tests designed to identify human skills. Aptitude tests andmeasures of intelligence, for example, have had considerable impactin various areas of human endeavor. The study of the processes oflearning led to teaching machine; as well as techniques for develop-ing as well as modifying various kinds of behavior. If Skinner'swork had reached fruition during World War II, perhaps pigeons mighthave actually become a significant part of the guidance system formissiles.In any event, psychology has and continues to be activelycommitted to converting psychological information into methods whichare directly applicable to the practical problems of people.The third unique characteristic is psychology's clinical tradition.A Significant proportion of psychologists are engaged in the directcare of emotionally disturbed people. It should also be noted that afair number of these psychologists combine their clinical acti-vities with research and teaching activities. However, it is thecaretaking role which includes both the assumption of responsibilityfor other people as well as adherence to a detailed ethical codewhich provides a direct bridge between psychology and clinical medi- cine.Psychology has obviously rich resources to contribute to abehavioral science program. However, since psychology is so wellendowed, it makes the choice of content and method more rather thanless complicated. Therefore some guide or model becomes essentialas a means of making choices. In the previous s?.ction, I suggestedthat the framework of the doctor's job can be used as the guide to suchdecisions.In conjunction with this, I would reiterate th'e pointI made in Part I which is that. ..\"behavioral scientists carefully 1 /,R inventory their fields and in a sense apply a 'conversion factor'to each of the units which comprise such a listing. In other words,subject matter which has a high potential for being translated intousuable techniques and information in medical practice would rankhigh on a 'conversion scale'; those units which had little or norelation to medical practice in terms of clinical use would rank atthe bottom of the scale.\"The overriding issue is the shape of the behavioral 'science cur- riculum.if1 were to make a single recommendation to psychology, itwould be to convene task forces to examine various aspects of itsfacts, theories, methods and techniques. The purpose would be to identifythat material which can most effectively be included into a curriculumwhich is heavily restricted by time limitations and which will be mostuseful in contributing to the care of \"dis-eased\" people.What follows is an outline of topics which I think can be most use-fully included in a core medical curriculum. There will certainly bedissent about these choices. However, if it stimulates &Mate over theissue of curriculum, then my objective will have been well served. LEARNING In recent years, there has been a significant increase in interestin learning theory. The reason for this lies in the fact that learningtheory has provided a non-disease model for explaining many aspects ofabnormal human behavior. Many physicians, particularly psychiatrists,have been uncomfortable with such a concept since they assume that theacceptance of a non-disease model removes a large sector of deviantbehaviorfrom the province of medicine. This, of course, is not sossince theoretical models, like music, transcend professional as well as 149 national boundaries. If non-disease models can help people who are introuble medically or otherwise, then this need be the only criteria forits utility.There are two general areas in medicine for which llearning processesarc important. Learning theory has provided now insights into the mech-anisms which may help explain both etiological as well as triggeringlactors in psychosomatic disease. In addition, recent studies Indicatethat techniques may soon be available which will be useful in modifyingsome kinds of psychosomatic response patterns. The first is an under-standing of psychosomatic disease and the second is the applicationof methods designed to either elicit adaptive behavior (e.g., institutingupeech patterns in the autistic child) or which modifies deviant or dis-ruptive personality patterns and/or symptoms (e.g., elimination ofphobias).While the classical conditioning of autonomic responses is wellknown, it has only been in recent years that modification through operantlearning has been demonstrated. There is now available a wide range ofreinforcing stimuli that can be used to \"train\" a variety of psycho-physical states. heart rate, urine formation, intestinal motility,bloodpressure, vasomotor response and contraction of the uterus havebeen operantly conditioned. (10,11)Not only does this work provide apotential avenue for understanding such aspects of so-called psycho-somatic disease but the research suggests that possible techniques formodifying these responses may be at hand, e.g., essential hypertension. (12)The second important derivation from learning theory which is im-portant to physicians are techniques that can alter several kind's ofdeficit and deviant behavior. Since people with these diffiCulties 150 appear in the office of physicians with high frequency, knowledge of andfacility with these tools make the study of learning processes a highpriority item for the curriculum. The following examples illustratethe use of techniques derived from learning theory:Pediatrician.Parents most frequently turn to this specialistfor information concerning the emotional and behavioral problems posed bythe children. Parents may simply seek reassurins; information (\"My six-year-oldon is stealing money from my pocketbook. Is he going to be-come delinquent?\") On the other hand, they may want the doctor toprovide them with prescriptions which will be useful in altering behaviorpatterns considered disruptive, destructive, objectionable, etc. (\"I can'tcontrol that child and sometimes (guilty weeping) I wish he were outof the home altogether.\")In the first instance, normative information about child behavior(Gesell is very useful) plus a reassuring manner and a few helpful hints(e.g., Keep your pocketbook out of reach) can go far to alleviate parental anxiety. In the second instance, developmental information isuseful but specific strategies designed to change the course of events iscalled for.Are there any? The answer is yes. The behavioral sciencebase is operant conditioning and the relevant research is being done byPatterson, Bernal and others.Doctors vary in their desire to handle behavioral problems. Somefeel it is a crucial and enjoyable part of their job; others see such prob-lems outside their province. If the doctor decides not to deal withthese problems in his practice, he must make a referral to those expertshe assumes can handle them. The referral process involves considerableknowledge as to what methods are available for solving such problems. 151. If,In our mythical example, his medical school training has ledhim to the view that aggressive and destructive behavior is \"sick\"and that complex unconscious sources maintain it, then he Is likelyto make a referral to a child analyst or other experts who holdsimilar theoretical views about child behavior. If, however, he isalso familiar with the operant model and the techniques derived from it,then an alternate referral possibility presents itself. lie might evendecide that psychoanalytic intervention might be ultimately necessarybut decides on the operant condition methods to see if it \"works.\" Thedecision might be based on such practical considerations that it is avery concrete technique which can be taught to parents (almost all. ofthe \"treatment\" takes place at home) and that if it \"works\" results canbe demonstrated in a relatively short time. Since the second techniqueis more economical in time and money, this may decide the issue. Inexploring this with the parents, he may tell them that if there are noresults then they might have to try the more complex and expensiveanalytic procedures.We can suppose further that the pediatrician decides thatpsychological treatment should be carried out by him as part of the totalcare package.if he chooses the learning procedures, then he will makean analysis of the home situation, i.e., primarily current methods ofcontrol although other facets may play a role in this analysis. Oncehe has the necessary data, he will instruct the parents as to how torespond to various aspects of the child's \"bad\" behavior.1 He willsee the parents at intervals (more frequently at first) to see \"how its 1The operant paradigm is based on n strict environmentalism in whichbehavior is determined by its consequences. Re-training the child dependson reordering the ratio of reinforcement to non-reinforcement in whichthe crucial variables are timing and consistency. 152 going,\" provide encouragement: and to clarify the program's procedures.Another possibility exists. The doctor may Feel that he does nothave the time to devote to this form of treatment yet he is a firm be-liever that, as far as possible, children's problems should be handledin a single setting. Therefore, he assigns a nurse or other assistantwho has been trained in the appropriate theory and technique to carry_ . out the treatment under his general supervision. internist.Control of appetite is a frequent problem which thisspecialist is asked to solve. Both obesity and severe underweighthave been difficult problems with which to deal. In recent years,research findings in obesity in which the operant model was theguiding theory have been promising. Probably the most successfulefforts to reduce overweight people are Weight Watchers and similarorganizations. Their techniques rely heavily on the variables thatlearning theorists consider crucial in changing behavior, i.e., socialreinforcement, social aversiveness, etc.However, specific techniques derived from the operant model havebeen applied to the treatment of severe anorexia nervosa. Bachrachand hisassociates demonstrated in one case that a dramatic weightchange could occur by systematically manipulating the environmentaccording to operant conditioning principles. Since then, othershave also demonstrated the effectiv,eness of altering the anorexicpattern by using techniques derived from learning theory. (13)Anorexia can be a life-threatening condition. It has beenassumed that a complex internal process determines the onset and courseof the disease. Treatment, therefore, has involved an attempt toalter the internal process. If this fails, more heroic and desperatemeasures such as tube feeding and shock treatment have been used. A 153 theoretical model to explain the development of anorexia is still needed.But from a practical point of view, the operant model seems to give riseto some potent treatment measures. As in the previous examples, thetreatment procedures are highly structured and can be taught to doctors, nurses, aides, etc. Generally, the treatment is carried out in theHospital because it involves considerable control of the environment.However, it is possible to execute procedures at home if the familycan be mobilized as \"helpers.\"Family Physician. The last of these illustrations might take placein the family physician's office. A young man of twenty-two whom thedoctor has taken care of for many years consults him about a paralyzing phobia.He wants to know whether medication, hypnosis, psychotherapy or whatever will help him. As in the other instances, the doctor mayLave the option of initiating the referral process or treating the problem himself. If he chooses to refer, he then must have someknowledge of local resources. The decision as to which expert to sendthe patient might seal the patient's therapeutic destiny, i.e., ananalyst, an encounter group, a behaviorally oriented therapy.The doctor decides that the patient can be helped by a behaviorally oriented therapy. The doctor has learned that systematic desensitization,a technique derived from learning theory, is very useful in eliminating phobias.In addition, he is enthusiastic about the method because heknows that the average number of re-training sessions is somewherebetween twenty to thirty although the patient's time commitment isgreater than this because he must carry out certain procedures on his own.1The theoretical forebears of the method are Pavlov and Hull. 1Systematic desensitization is'based on the thesis that if responsesantagonistic -to anxiety (i.e., deep relaxation) can be trained, thencounter-conditioning can occur. Anxiety producing images are pairedwith relaxation which results in the inhibition of the anxiety response. the basis of Hull's learning model, Wolpe's research led him to developthe method of systematic desensitization which is designed to increasinglyinhibit anxiety in relation to the phobic situation. (14)in these three instances, methods of treatment derived frombehavioral theories are applicable to problems physicians are calledupon to solve.Therefore, they wcuid rank high on the conversion scalesince they have considerable potential for translation into clinical skills. COMMUNICATION Of all the subjects with which we are concerned, communication hasthe highest priority in terms of its direct utilitarian value. Physiciansneed to use communication skills more often than any other techniquethat is available to them. The psychology of as well as the methodsfor promoting effective communication should rank high in any curriculum.The \"tool\" value of developing communicative skills are as follows: (n)Interviewing is an Indispensable aspect of medical practice since Itrepresents a basic method for getting information necessary toformulate hypotheses and decision's about diagnoses, prognoses, thechoice of diagnostic tests and treatment. Skillful interviewing canproduce in a brief period of time observation and information requiredto achieve these objectives. In addition, the well conducted interviewrepresents the most reliable vehicle for developing an effectivedoctor-patient relationship. (15,16) The physician who is expert inestablishing lines of communication will, in general, have a morecooperative and emotionally comfortable patient with which to deal. 155 (b) Some physicians are \"natural born\" psychotherapists and havealways seen such a function as a part of medical practice. In recentyears, there has been an increasing attempt to educate physicians inpsychotherapeutic skills which are applicable to an office practice. (17)The core of such training involves sophisticated knowledge aboutpatterns of communication.() Another important aspect of communication covers the effectof various messages given to patients whose objective is to change behavior.For example, physicians frequently find it necessary to havepntic:nts alter some aspect of their life style for health reasons, e.g.,stop smoking, lose weight, take a rest, etc. The findings of socialpsychologists indicate that different forms of communication may havevariable effects on the audiences to which it is directed, e.g., highfear messages are generally ineffective in changing health habits. (18,19, 20, 21)(4) Patterns of practice are changing so that physicians are in-creasingly involved with large organizations and the community. Forexample, group practice involves managing ancillary personnel, e.g.,nurses, medical and laboratory technicians, receptionists, etc. Howone communicates with these paraprofessionals may have considerableinfluence on how efficiently the organization is run and, in many in-stances, how effectively patients are cared for. Another role forphysicians will be that of administrators in large public or privatelyoperated medical systems, e.g., HMO's. Communication skills will beneeded not only in terms of managing the internal organization but indeveloping and maintaining effective relations with many aspects of thepublic sector. 156 PAIN The obvious reasons for an in-depth presentation of pain has beenpreviously alluded to. Since the ultimate clinical objective is themanagement of pain, the relevant behavioral information could be organizedaround the following three themes:(a) Pain stimuli is not necessarily equivalent to pain response. (S #R)There are several theories such as Melzack and Wall's gate controlhypothesis which attempt to account for discrepancies between thestimulus and response. (22) There appears to be important perceptual,cognitive, learning, emotional and personality characteristics whichcontribute to an understanding of the phenomena, e.g., intense pain inrelation to minor or seemingly absent stimuli. (23,24) Physicians needknowledge about these matters in order to enlarge their scope of infor-mation so that they have a broader base for problem solving. (25,26,27)(b) Pain intensity appears to be roughly correlated with theemotional state of the patient.Emotions, particularly anxiety and/or depression, appear to playa significant role in the experience of pain. flow these affectivecomponents shape the response to pain is extremely important sincethe physician must learn how to intervene at this level in order toameliorate the pain experience. (28)(c) Pain may represent a method of communication.Many people have learned to use pain as a method of communication.It becomes a vehicle for informing others about a variety of troubleswith which they have been struggling. The physician needs to understandwhat knowledge is available about the development and uses of pain for 157 interpersonal transactions. Doctors must learn to listen and decode pain language. Pain amelioration involves helping the patient substitutethe language of pain with verbal statements directly related to thepsychological conflicts.In addition, the techniques for pain control can be classifiedunder the following headings: (a) Audio- Analgesia: This method involves the alternate use of\"white noise\" and music. This technique has been used in dentistry,obstetrics, pediatrics, etc. While this method has few adherentscurrently, it is of interest becauSe of the important relation betweenattention, interference, distractability and pain. (29,30) (b) Placebo Effect: The placebo is important in medicine andphysicians should appreciate its role to use it when appropriate.Placebo influences can modify pain perceptions. (31,32) (c) Psychotherapy: The use of various techniques which areclassified under this heading may he employed for the purpose of pain managemcnt.in some instances, the physician may elect to employ thesemethods.[n other circumstances, he may decide to refer patients toother. specialists.' If he chooses to refer, he nevertheless shouldhave some knowledge of the'psychotherapeutic methods available.The relation of hypnosis to pain control should be emphasized sinceit may provide a useful tool that the physician can employ in his office,e.g., using hypnotic techniques to induce deep relaxation in order todim3nish the intensity of tension headaches. (33,34) 158 STRESS,_DISEASE AND MEDICAL-SURGICAL ENVIRONMENTS The preservation of physical, psychological and social integrityare ongoing lifetime tasks which can be studied from the perspectiveof the effects of stress on the human organism. Threat, the centralconcept in a theory of stress, has two major psychological characteris- tics:(a) \"It is anticipatory or future oriented.\" (b) \"It is broughtabout by cognitive processes involving perception, learning, memory,judgment and thought.\" (35) Since illness or the expectation ofillness is a direct threat resulting in a wide range of behavioralresponses that can influence physiopathology on the one hand and patientmanagement on the other, stress becomes a high priority topic. in theformer instance, the role of stress can be studied in at least three ways:(a) stress as an etiological agent, e.g., in peptic ulcers,hypertension, headache, etc.; (b) stress effects in promoting pathology,e.g., psychological consequences in cardiac disease; (c) stress fromthe effects of disease which alters behavior, e.g., the effects.ofdizziness,_tinnitus, sensations of pressure and loss of hearing inMeniere's disease. (36)The themes upon which instruction should be based are: (a) Whatdo we know about various effects of stress on physiology? (b) How dopeople identify, process, organize and respond to threatening medicallyrelated information? (d) What techniques are available to help patientsdeal with stress through a realistic appraisal of danger and which canmodify the impact of potentially disorganizing stressful experiences?The basic method is establishing effective communication. Other methodscan be discussed under the heading of control, affiliation, rehearsal and information. (37) 159 A second feature of stress concerns the unique social environmentsor tho hospital, e.g., surgical wards, coronary care units, hemodialysisunits, rehabilitation services, psychiatric in-patient hospitals, etc.Serious problems are posed because these environments have thepotential for heightening stress. For example, recent observations ona hemodialysis unit indicates that all of the patients on the wardappeared listless, depressed and seemed to have established no channelsfor communication among themselves. What are the stress factors in-volved and what are the implications for treatment? These examplescan be multiplied a thousand fold by anyone familiar with these special environments.Psychologists have been active in studying not only dr,medical environments but others as well which have a potential forproducing high stress, e.g., on naval vessels, 'in airplanes, in smallgtoups isolated in the arctic, in environments in which sensory ex-periences are experimentally controlled, etc. (38, 39, 40, 41). Theyhave compiled much valuable information from these studies that bearsdirectly on this problem. Students should be alerted to the fact thatenvironmentally generated stress can have anti-therapeutic consequences to patients.They should be made equally cognizant of the proceduresavailable which can reduce unnecessary stress and accelerate the re- covery process. DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEMS Diagnosis is a fundamental tool in medical practice since itfrequently is the guide to both treatment and prognosis. Concepts of diagnosis concerned with behavioral disorders involve many probt-imswhich distinguish them, from that used in the rest of medicine. How-ever, we teach psychiatric diagnosis as if there were no distinctions 160 among diagnostic concepts in other aspects of medicineSeveral serious issues concerning diagnosis have been raised inthe Last several years. (42)Our current system shows poor inter-rater reliability between experts in diagnosing specific behavioraldisorders although greater success has been achieved in terms of broadcategories, i.e., psychosis, character disorders, etc. (43) Sharpvariations in diagnosis occur between hospitals in different parts ofthe country and even between nations, e.g., the English have a penchantfor manic-depression and the Americans for schizophrenia. Questionshave been raised about the etiological value of our classification system.A diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease refers to a known diagnosticprocess in the central nervous system, but what does the diagnosis ofhysteria imply etiologically? If one uses psychoanalysis as the pointof reference, a statement about etiology can be made. But if oneuses a behavioral system, then etiology is meaningless. In the samevein, issues related to treatment arise. Paresis and brain tumors whichalter behavior can be specifically treated by penicillin or brainsurgery respectively. However, what is the specific treatment forschizophrenia and depressive reactions. For both, the recommendationwould probably be psychotherapy. However, the kind of therapy mightbe highly variable depending on the theoretical bias of the doctor.By the same token, it needs to be pointed out that the diagnosismight have some specific utility if drugs are to be part of atherapeutic regime, e.g., 300 mg. of thorazine in the over-activeschizophrenic and 100 mg. of elavil for the depressive.Other issues need to be brought o the student's attention such asthe stigmatizing effects of psychiatric diagnoses. For example, a diagnosis of psychosis can have significant occupational, social and 161 legal reverberations. In addition, a \"self-fulfilling prophecy\" mayoccur since a diagnostic label, such as schizophrenia, may affect the ;Iiiitude!4 of theindividual so tagged, e.g. ,as hopeless. 'I hero n re several other themes which could be included in llifs;cciton concerning problems of classification. However, the importanceor classirleation systems needs to be underscored since such systemsare important not only for descriptive and communicative purposes butultimately for predictive ones as well. However, the present state ofdiagnostic systems, related to behavior, needs to be outlined for studentsso they can deal with such issues in.a more sophisticated and meaningfulmanner. THE PSYCHOLOGY OF AFFECTS Anxiety and/or depression probably represents the most commonproblem seen in medical practice. In 1948 Arthur Schlesinger (44)described anxiety as the \"official emotion of our age\" although inrecent years some authors have suggested that depression is a c;osecontender for this honor. As far as medicine is concerned, theseaffects surface either because illness is anticipated, as a reactionto a diagnosed disease, as the symptoms of a disease, or as a responseto a series of life stresses. Because of their ubiquity, the curriculumshould provide a niche for an in-depth examination of their availablebiological, psychological and sociological information. While anxietyand depression are subjects which are included in other units of study,I think their significance as a public health problem makes it sufficientlyimportant for them to be studied in their own right. 162 Critical topics that might be included are physiological, chemicaland psychological theories, (b) anxiety and depression as learnedresponses, (c) the effects on cognitive functions and behavior, (d)their relation to personality styles, e.g., state-trait anxiety, (3)measurement of affects, (f) methods of control (45,46).There is one further topic that might be included in this section.Hope is an experience that people need most of the time. The need tohelp patients hope and maintain their optimism is an informal functionof the physician. While this subject has not been widely explored, somepsychologists have been attempting to understand the nature of theexperience. (47) It should be brought to the student's attention sincehope is not only a humanistic concern but may have important consequencesfor mastering illness and extending longevity. PSYCHOLOGY OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE Thu objectives of this unit are to provide medical students withInformation concerning the relevant facts that influence behavior change.There are three classes of students for whom such knowledge would beimportant.The first group consists of students wlio will becomeinternists, rediatricians, family physicians and the like but who willwant to utilize psychotherapeutic methods in their practice. A secondgroup consists of those students who will become psychiatrists. Thethird group are students who, when they become physicians, will befaced with the problems of referring patients to mental healthspecialists.They will be asked questions of all sorts by patientsseeking help for a wide array of psychological problems many of whichwill concern therapeutic measures. A base of information 'will be 163 usefulin intelligently answering questions concerning such problemsand may prove quite helpful in making a proper referral, e.g., to ananalyst, an encounter group, a hypnotist, a behavior modifier, etc.In addition, this material should prove most useful for all studentsin preparing them for their studies in clinical psychiatry.This unit of study might be divided into two main categories:(a) Systems of psychotherapy and (b) Psychotherapy as an art and a science.Students are confused by the welter of \"schools\" which have for-mulated theories and/or methods of psychotherapy. Therefore, it isvaluable to develop a scheme of classification which group systemswith common roots. (48,49,50) Such a classification might be as follows:(a) Psychoanalytic, Classical: A biologically oriented system inwhich instinctual drives and environmental demands are the major per-sonality variab for personality development. Since developmentalconflicts do produce emotional damage, treatment is directed towardeliminating the unconscious traumatic forces that control behavior.Insight is the major factor that accounts for behavior change. Therelationship with the therapist is viewed as a vehicle nr promotinginsight since it provides data for interpretation rather than havingsignificant implications for change in itself.(b) Psychoanalytic, Social-Cultural: Biological factors are less-important than other variables such as the disorganizing effects ofsocially learned anxiety, the search for security, and the struggleto find ways of relating to the world. Past interpersonal ex-periences are the roots of anxiety and determine the character ofpathological behavior. Treatment is aimed at evaluating interpersonal 164 experiences with insight as the significant variable that changes behavior.However, greater emphasis is placed on the direct learningeffects involved in the doctor-patient relationship, e.g., correctiveemotional experience. (c) Phenomenological Approaches: These include client-centered therapy,gestalt treatment and existential approaches. The basic theme is thatthe problems of living derive from unhappy, crippling human experiences.Treatment is focused on helping patients re-experience themselves innew, intense and creative ways. The therapist is a much more directparticipant in the treatment process. The rationale is that there isa difference between looking at someone and seeing them. In order to\"see\" the patient, the therapist must participate with him on a veryhuman level.Rogers underscores this point when he says that \"...thebest vantage point for understanding behavior is from the internal frameof reference of the individual himself.\" (48) Phenomenological therapistsuse a variety of methods such as interpreting, challenging, provoking,counseling, directing and advising. Encounter groups, group therapymarathons, nude therapy and the like are techniques recommended forhelping people re-experience themselves creatively. Insight is only oneof several factors that may account for behavior changes.(d) Behavioral Methods: Learning theory, which has been previouslydiscussed, is the source from which the behavioral techniques are derived.These methods tend to be quite mechanistic. While there are classesof techniques (e.g., desensitization, flooding, aversive conditioning,etc.), the patient's problems need to be carefully evaluated in order toidentify the appropriate treatment procedure. The goal of behaviortherapy is narrowly defined in that the objective is either to elicit 165 or eliminate specific behaviors. While communication, interpersonalrelations and Insight are important to the other categories of therapy agesw; ailbehavior change, they.are considered negligible orincidental to this form of treatment.In the second segment of this unit, a distinction would be madebetween psychotherapy as a science and as an art. There are \"principles\"which guide all psychotherapeutic efforts, e.g., communication, inter-personal relationships, learning, etc. Psychotherapy, in many instances,\"works,\" often dramatically. However, it needs to be made clear tostudents that from the standpoint of science, the reason it \"works\" is far from clear.It still remains a mystery why some people treated by aparticular method make significant gains while others-under seeminglysimilar circumstances remain stationary or even regress. The relevantvariables that produce behavior change still need to be scientifically adduced.Selected research findings and comparative treatment resultsshould be reviewed. (51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56.)Again, it Ebould be emphasized that some grasp of the status of thepsychology of behavior change is important since physicians will eitherbe directly engaged in psychotherapeutic activities or will be activelyinvolved in the referral process. GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT All the behavioral science units in medical schools seem to agreeon the relevance of this topic although it is difficult to determinewhether there is a consensus concerning content. Some schools mayteach from a biological framework, others from a psychodynamic position,still others frOm a learning theory point of view, while the remainder 166 might accent a sociological approach. Probably some of all these viewsare discussed in the typical course.Growth and development is generally assigned somewhere betweenLen and sixteen hours of class time. For those students who have nobackground, the number of hours allotted is just about enough time toprovide students with the general architectural plan. Since educatorssee the topic as extremely important, perhaps this should be part ofpre-medical preparation. The time allocated in medical school would beorganized to illustrate the relation of growth and development to practicalmedical problems.The following topics are suggested as those which illustrate utilitybut they obviously do not exhaust the possibilities:(a) Developmental Norms: This is baseline information whichphysicians can use to assess developmental deviations. In addition,such information is valuable in counseling parents, teachers or other surrogates who are responsible for the care of-children and adolescents, .e.g., intellectual development, perceptual-motor lag, stealing,1 aggresion, sexual interest, phobic resonses, etc. (57,58,59)(b) Age Related Response to Illness: The effects of diseaseoccurring at different developmental periods can have significant effectson behavior and pose management problems for the physician: For example,infants who fail to thrive may have significant neurophysiologicaldeficits that are aggravated by an inhospitable environment; (6)The traumatic effects upon a two-year old child who is hospitalizedfor an operation and the parents are excluded for significan t periodsof time; (61)A school age child who develops asthma at a time whenphysical and psychological requirements demand high levels of activity 167 is faced with significant adaptation problems; (62, 63) A teenagerwho has increased demands for food as well as needs to conform to peer group rules develops diabetes. This precipitates severe conflicts that miry resultIn serious violations of a rational medical. regime. (64) (c) Death-and Dying: While the snbject is usually only incidentallyincluded In growth and development, there are important age related cor- n: 1,1tes.There are a range of problems to be considered depending uponwhether a dying patient is three, eight, seventeen, thirty-five, sixty or ninety.Developmental concepts of death, critical psychological factorsin dealing with death at different age levLis and the doctor's role inrelating Lo the dying patient are useful themes around which to organize this topic.(65,66,67) (d) Mental. Retardation: The normal or abnormal development ofintelligence is predicated on a broad array of factors. Mental retard-ation which is a significant public health problem provides a usefulvehicle for discussing the concept of intelligence and illustratingthe factors which may impair its development. For example, geneticdeterminants (phenylketenuria, Tay-Sach disease, skull, etc.); postnatal causes (physical injuries and diseases such as encephalitis andconvulsive disorders) and psychological- environmental factors (emotionaldeprivation, serious cultural limitations, psychoses, etc.) are useful inillustrating etiological factors in mental deficiency as well as thelimiting factors in intellectual development. (68), (d) Ageing:Because \"death control\" has been so successful, thepercentage of people over sixty-five has increased rather substantially4since 1900.An increasing number of people over sixty -five appear in 168 the doctor's office with multiple complaints. Most physicianswho rare for the elderly would agree that the psychological problemsare extremely Important complicating factors in the illness they present_ ItIs often difficult to sort out, for example, how much of the mentalconfusion seen in the elderly male is due to arteriosclerosis and howmuch to the feeling of abandonment. (69)There might be three objectives for this unit: (a) Trying to alterattitudes about the \"crock\" syndrome on the one hand and emphasizingthat the physician is as important an emotional resource as a physical one for the elderly; (b) Presenting typical medical problems to demonstratethe relation between physiopathology and the socio-psychological statusof the patient; (c) The effects of organic states on psychological functions.Eisdorfer's recent work on the relation between hypertensionand cognitive functions is an excellent example. (70) MEASUREMENTThe development and application of measuring instruments has been amajor enterprise for psychology. In fact, psychology's entrance intomedicine occurred because several test methods were deemed valuable asaids to diagnosis.Most physicians, however, other than psychiatrists, do not usepsyohological.tests in their practice. There are at least three reasons for this:(a) Most physicians assume that test administration andinterpretatibn require the expertise of psychologists; (b) They havehad no adequate instruction in the application of tests for diagnosticpurposes in the context of an office practice; (c) Testing is assumed to be too time, consuming. 169 Each of the above reasons is both valid and invalid. There areproblems that require rather long and complicated procedures. For example,using the Reitan battery as an aid in diagnosing a brain lesion involves,pedal equipment, expertise aad time. Nevertheless, (Alero arc icHtswhich can be quickly administered and scored that provide useful diagnostic information.The. Zung test for depression would be useful in rapidlyproviding diagnostic information. (71)The \"minimult\" (a brief Form ofthe Minnesota Multiple Personality inventory) could be used to obtainFurther information about suspected behavioral disorders. (72)Thuinterested physician could even train assistants to score and interpretthese diagnostic aids.However, if the experience of the past is a criterion, it seems un-likely that most physicians will make use of psychological tests. Themajor rationale for including some instruction in concepts of measurementand test instruments is that they will have occasion to refer patientsfor psychodiagnostic studies and/or be recipients of reports describingpsychological test findings.The approach to instruction in the use of tests for diagnostic pur-poses' should be on a very practical level. This can best be accomplishedby formulating diagnostic questions that physicians are likely to encounter.\"The patient is a 62-year-old male who has shown a gradual deteriorationof his personality in the last six months. .1s there evidence that centralnervous system pathology may be involved?' \"This 24-year-old.marriedwoman complains of severe fatigue, headaches and a 'loss of feeling.' Arepsychological factors playing an etiological role in these symptoms?\"\"This 45-year-old woman has recently had a radical mastectomy. There isevidence of increasing depression accompanied by statements that 'life Isuseless.'Arc there suicidal risks?\" Tests can he discussed in the context of providing answers to practical questions. However, boththe patient's medical history and future destiny should be included inorder to demonstrate both the value and limitations of testing procedures. ETHICAL ISSUES Ethics has always been an integral part of the practice of medicine.A new challenge to ethical responsibility lies in the rapid advance ofbasic science knowledge. Asa consequence, new, radical and even fright-ening technologies are being or will be devised. The physician of thefuture will be asked to make complex decisions about human life andcond'ct, the consequences of which we can only dimly foresee.Psychology is directly involved in the ethical controversy becausemany of the current and anticipated medical technologies are directlyrelated to their effects on human behavior. Ritalin, for example, appearsto be useful in controlling the behavior of a certain percentage of hyper-active children. Its use, however, has been attacked by some because they sec its use as a. means of insuring social. conformity. They criticizeparents, physicians and educators for having little tolerance for theatypical child. in assigning children to a drug, additional educatiOnalefforts need now be expended and responsibility for their care diminished.Others have suggested that vicarious learning may take place so that achild on ritalin may later become more vulnerable to the \"drug culture.\"This poses several problems for the physician. Does he have a responsibilityto evaluate these various points of view before he prescribes drugs suchas ritalin?Assuming that he is cognizant of these issues, is it hisresponsibility to discuss these matters with the child's parent? Does he 171 have the right to withdraw a drug which may have specific beneficial short term ,!ffect because of potentially dangerous long term consequences?Ritaiin is an example of a current, drug controversy but there areothers in the making. We appear to be on the threshold of the developmentof drugs which arc designed to \"improve\" all sorts of psychological functions,e.g., intelligence, memory, violent behavior, etc. Kenneth Clark, arecent past president of the American Psychological Association has.higgested that. drugs might be developed with the aim of controlling theabuse of power. (73) If such drugs become a reality, the moral andethical problems would be staggering. Physicians would have powerfulCools in their hands with which to exercise enormous power over other people.In addition to drugs, there is work in progress which promisesLo produce technologies which may be quite potent in the control of human behavior.One such area is the electrical stimulation of the brain (ESB).The work done todate,suggests that ESE might be able to produce ratherrefined control over several behavioral functions. (74)Psychologistshave also been developing techniques which, while they are still intheir infancy, are viewed by some as, being capable of having potentiallymalignant effects on society. \"The Manchurian Candidate\" posed theproblemof the application of such methods of control on a fictional level.(75)A recent. motion picture, \"A Clockwork Orange,\" developsthe theme of a vengeful society's use of aversive conditioning therapyto emotionally cripple an individual it considers an enemy. The moralquestion which is posed is that these methods have the potential ofdestroying an individual's capacity for free choice even though itpresumably serves the \"public good.\" The ultimate question is who defines the \"public good.\" Skinner has suggested that behavioral 172 engineering be applied to society as a whole in order to achieve aworld where \"people are truly happy, serene, productive, creative andforward looking.\" (76)But who is to define happiness, serenity,productivity and creativity? Is Skinner's dream of a vast behavioraltechnology a utopian dream or the nightmare of 1984? (77)The physiclan of the future will find himself at the center of the controversy.It is likely that he will play an important role in influencingsocietal decisions about the use of these technologies. But on a morepersonal basis, he may be faced with decisions about the use of thosemethods with individual patients. It seems reasonable that we begin toprepare medical students not only about the nature of these methodsbut about the controversies surrounding their ethical use. (78) Final RemarksThere is a bit of philosophy currently in vogue which states thatthere are \"different strokes for different folks.\" This observation isquite applicable to contemporary medical education. Diversificationof the curriculum is \"in\" and conformity is \"out.\" This has sparkedconsiderable debate over whether the restrictions placed on the traditional curriculum for the sake of permitting students greater controlover their educational experiences may not lead to a generation ofsuperficially trained practitioners. Some educators such as Mellinkoffare apprehensive. His target is specifically the growing influence of the behavioral sciences. \"But it is possible that the complicated taskof improving the distribution of good medical care may not be made easierby crowding sociology into the time for physiology or cultural anthropologyinto the time for internal medicine.\" (79)While it is an inferencefrom the above statement, I assume Dr. Mellinkoff also feels that the 173 social sciences have nothing to contribute to either physiology or internalmedicine.Behavioral scientists would disagree and I hope not only for partisanreasons.Nevertheless, we have a responsibility to make clear to studentsand medical educators alike thPc our contribution is substantial ratherthan frivolous. The burden of this paper has been that we can do thisbest by pruning the subject matter of our several disciplines In orderLo identify that content which has utility for solving practical medical problems. 174 Bibliography 1.Kingsley, S.

SOCIOLOGY AND MEDICAL EDUCATION Robin F. Badgley, Ph.D.Professdeand Chairman-Department of. Behavioral. ScienceUniversity of Toronto, Canada Samuel V. Bloom, Ph.D.Professor of SociologyDepartment of Community MedicineMount Sinai School of Medicinof the City of New YorkNew York City, New York r SOCIOLOGY AND MEDICAL EDUCATION Robin F. BadgleySamuel W. Bloom IntroductionThe primary purpose of this report is to describe the currentstatus of sociology in the medical schools in the United States.To understand its present position, however, we consider itessential to examine first the historical origins of medicalsociology both as a scholarly discipline and as a collaboratingprofession in medical education. Against this perspective, anddrawing upon case studies collected specifically for this report,the major trends and issues in the status of sociology in medical education today will be interpue,tet.Hiptorical Perspectives: Antecedents of the Post-War Trend.The place of sociology in American medical education,although still subject to questions of what, where, and how itcan be most effective, appears to be established. Kendall and Reader, for-example,'asserC categorically that sociology \"has al-.ready contributed much to medicine, .... has (in its work relatedto medicine) developed a distinct body of knowledge, (and) infat, reached the position where it can contribute substantiallyto decision making in medicine.\" (42) This is in contrast withReader's ownolearlier assessment, in 1963, (55) when he spoke more of\"the promise\" of rociology's contribution to medicine than of its 182 accomplishments.Paralleling its intellectual growth, the position of medicalsociology in the structure of thL medical school also has ad- 4!)vanced.Wjnlike its previous dependency upon existing depart-ments, such as psychiatry and preventive medicine, current trendsare toward either separate departmental status as a major equalpartner of the behavioral sciences or divisional status withinsocially oriented clinical departments.Looking first only at the intellectual side of its history,there are traditional concerns of sociology as a general fieldwhich can be seen to have direct relevance to medicine. Prior toWorld War II, scholarship had been established in demography,mobility, social deviance, and social stratification, all ofwhich included inquiries with specific or indirect implicationsfor issues of health. There were also direct contributions tomedicine: in the social etiology and ecology of disease, thesocial components in therapy and rehabilitation, and medicineas a social institution. (55) Of the several sub-areas inmedical sociology which have shown sustained growth, more recently,only the sociology of medical education had no pre-war antece- dents.This shift to direct and major involvement by sociologyin both medical research and medical education has been, in it- ,self, an important subject for inquiry. Merton, for example,provides one of the most penetrattng interpretations of themotivating forces in both medicine and sociology which havedrawn them together. (48) On the influences of World War II f.183 lch turned psychiatry toward social science for major collab-,,ration, Ginzberg and his associates give a fascinating and de- tailed picture. (21) These are only two in a lengthy list of re-view articles and books which present both facts and interpreta-tions about the sources of what has been called the behavioralscience movement in medical education. (11, 13, 18, 56, 79, 26, 39, 78).Official sanction for the joining of social science to med-ical education was manifest in the first teaching institutes of theAssociation of American Medical Colleges (AAMC). In 1951, theAAMC Teaching Institutes were inaugurated with a conference on theteaching of psychiatry. The report of that conference, held inIthaca, reveals a strong favorable interest in the development ofa siguificant role for social science in medical education. (54)The same perspective was present in the second AAMC I stitute atColorado Springs dealing. with teaching of preventive medicine Inthe undergraduate medical school. For the report of the Ithacameeting, Norman Cameron was commissioned to write a prUpbsedcourse outline. The resulting chapter'in the Ithaca proceedings, (9) titled:\"Human Ecology and Personality in the Training ofPhysicians,\" was widely used in the next decade as a blueprint forpreclinical courses in the basic sciences of behavior, usuallytaught by psychiatry. Within the Cameron model, sociology wasallocated an equal portion of teaching responsibility withpsychology and psychiatry.The Cameron teaching model was an early watershed-of the 184 post-war behavioral science movement. Before turning to the post-war period Ln more detail, however, definitional questions aboutthe term, \"behavioral science,\" and the place of medical sociologyin behavioral science are germane. Sociology and Behavioral Science: Some Isiues of DefinitionAs used currently, behavioral science (or, synonomously \"thebehavioral sciences\" -- no specific distinction appears to be im-plied by the use of either the singular or plural term) has anoperating history of only about twenty-five years. Tbls designa-tion is not derivative in any sense from the psychological theorycalled \"behaviorism.' About its general intent, there is no disagreement. Be-havioral science, as a field gLinquiry, represents an attempt tointegrate several older parent or basic areas of scholarly workwithin a more comprehensive and up-to-date approach to the studyof man.Its integrative and interdisciplinary character is clear.Opinions differ, however, concerning which scientific disciplines should be inclucisd within its rubric.Of the two major` definitions which are distinguishable, oneis a comprehensive view including an array of biological, psycho-logical, and social sciences in collaborative inquiry concerninghuman behavior. The other usage involves an interdisciplinaryview in a much 7.:.ore limited sense, restricted to collaborationamong the fields of sociology, anthropology, social peychology,and the psychOlogy of human growth and development.The comprehensive approach tolehavioral science started in 185 1949 when, \"a group of scientists at the University of Chicago,some of whom ... moved (as a group) to the University of Michigan,began to consider whether a sufficient body of facts exist tojustify developing an empirically testable general theory of behavior.\" (50) The leader of the group, James E. Miller, explainsthat the term \"behavioral sciences\" was coined with the intentionthat its apparently neutral connotation would be acceptable to bothsocial and biological scientists, and that it would supersede thealternative, \"social science,\" which some might confuse with socialism.Later, the Center for Advanced Study in the BehavioralSciences was established at Palo Alto; and in 1956, a new journalBehavioral Sciencq, appeared. The Mental Health Research Instituteat the University of Michigan became one of the best known corner-stone groups.As a division of the Department.: of Psychiatry in the medical school, it developed a-;taff drawn from psychiac.ry, ipsy:.noanalysis, p,eneral psychology, social psychology, neuro-physiology,tlitical scicice, economics, mathematical biology;and education. Sociologists and anthropologists were added laterIn its history.The second definition of behavioral science equates this fieldmure closely with social science. Anderson and Seacat conclude thatthe term \"social science\" was dropped in favor of \"behavioralscience\" in to study of health and illness because social sciencewas regarded as too generic, including not only sociology, anthro-pology, and social psychology but'also economics, politicalscience, and history. (1) Here again, in this limited definition 186- of behavioral science, the choice of the term was influenced by a reluctance to confuse \"social\" with \"eocialism.\" Although these two,ire the major applications of the phrase \"behavioral science,\" theyare not the only ones.' For our purposes, it need only be addedthat medical schools, in the increasing effort to include thisarea of study, generally have sought to operationalize a thirddefinition which, in the words of one study group, is:In a medical context, the minimal conno-tation of behavioral science should be an in-tegrated study of biological, psychological,and socio-cultural facets of human behavior.The term \"sciences basic to human behavior\"might therefore be more appropriate. (29)Beth the comprehensive (psychosocial-biological) and the morerestricted (social) interpretations were applied and deVelopedseparate histories of their own, parallel to each other. The sective emphasis depended upon given institutions and people.Whereverformal codification was required, definitions weresufficiently broad to allow both interpretations to flourish,either separately or together. For example, when, in 1958, theNational Institutes of Mental Health offered grant suPport tostimulate the expansion of medical school teaching programs\"leading to aAroader,understandift of human behavior as it re- .,lates to healthland illness,\" the purposes of the program weredescribed in the official announcement as follows:1. To bring more knowledge of human behavior to-thestudent and to acquaint aim with the ways and means,by whithis knowledge is acquired. 187 2.To develop research models for the study of behaviorwhich will be as meaningful and strong in their impacton medical education as those presently availaotefor teaching in-long established basic science depart-ments and in other branches of medieme. 3.To provide :improved ways and means for the student tolearn about the nature of the multiple factors - social,psychological, and biological - which affect the main-tenance of health and the prevention of disease and disability. 4.To make possible the development of behavioral scienceteaching as: an integral part of the modern physician's educPtion..Under this very broad mandate, it would certainly seem possi-ble for both types of behavioral science emphasis to be supported.Or course, to assess the trends of actual events, one must looknt. the types of programs which were actually supvrted after the NIMHgrants for teaching of human behavior in medical schools wereactivated in July of 1960. .Other government programs, of course,also adopted this broad definition of the field. NICHD (TheNational Institute of Child Lealth and Development) is an example.The open character of the definitions, however, did notnecessarily have-liberating effects. One body of opinion arguesthe opposite; namely, that the variety of definitions had a con-straining effect upon the field. The term, behavioral science,implies (in the latter view) a certain misplaced.concretcness 188 which in fact does not exist in the body of concepts and methods.As a consequence of the ambiguity of the term, individual be-havioral scientists are said to exist only mythically by label and,as such,.are uniquely vulnerable to misrepresentation and impossible demands.This is essentially the basis of the rejeCtion of the termby sociologists like C. Wright Mills who charges that:The (field) Behavioral Sciences is simply im-possible; it was thought up, I suppose, as a pro-paganda device to get money for social researchfrom Foundations and Congressmen who confuse \"socialscience\" with \"socialism.\" (51)\"Medical sociology,\" is an altetnate -,arm preferred by somescholars who otherwise might be called behavioral scientists. Itis by this name that most of the contributions by sociology toteaching and research in medicine have been identified. Here,too, an undue constraining effect has been charged to a labelwhich some sociologists have decried as placing an over-emphasison the physician and his role in medicine to the exclusion ofother components in the health system.The Sociology of Health Whcinwe speak of the sociology of medicine today, (thesociology of health is increasingly preferred) we mean theapplication of the concerts and methods of sociology as a socialscience to the systematic study of medicine as a social insti-tution, the fabric of the health system, and problems of health and illness.Earlier conceptions were quite'different.Europe in the mid-nineteenth century saw intense strugglesb5; the middle class for political and social rights. (68) With 189 reference to these struggles, Salomon Neumann, a German physician,asserted that \"medical science is intrinsically and essentially asocial science, and as long as this is not recognized in practicewe shall not be able to enjoy its benefits, and shall have to besatisfied with an.empty shell and .a sham.\" (58) This sentimentcaptured the interest of a group of p'-ysicians in Germany for ashort period, and inspired in their work a heightened socialsensitivity and social responFibility. As the middle class at-tained its objL.tives, however, the momentum of social concern waned.\"A revival of this spirit,\" Stern writes, \"appeared inEngland and the United States as a by-product of the pressures ofthe working class for social security legislation and for wider recognition of their democratic right to share more fully in thevast economic and cultural advances of the period.\" Chadwick'sextensive report of 1642, studying the sanitary conditions of theBritish people, was an example of \"an early crystallization of thisspirit in a sociological research. \"In boch\"(England and the UnitedStates),\" Stern adds, \"social medicine was associated with Rro-gressive movements that brought larger groups of people into theorbit of medical services, as they widened the conception ^f socialparticipation and resp(4,sibility and put greater detands uponthose who possessed political, social and financial power.\" (68)Social medicine; of course, is a distinctly different historicalphenomenon from the sociology of medicine (health). In the nine-teenth century, the distinction was unclear, but subsequently socialmedicine, espertally in the United Kingdom, was'used to designate P 190 efforts of the medical profession whereas the sociology of health relors more to the work of social scientists themselves. As lateas the 1950's, the concept of social medicine was regarded byscholars like Stern to be vague and 1-defined.\"In its mostdeveloped form,\" Stern wrote, \"(social medicine) remains largely agroping effort on the part of the medical profession and otherhealth workers to deal with the fact that the patient is a person-ality, has a family and is a member of society, when consideringhis health and diseases. It does not seem too audacious to assume:that since this is already taken for granted by sociologit.ts whohave not ber'n obliged to work their way tortuously from an absorp-tion with specific diseases of special organs to an understandingof the patient as a whole and to the social context of health anddisease, we may demand more mature formulations of principles andmore concrete guidance from a sociology of medicine.\" (68)In the United States, major pioneering contributions to thebeginnings of a social science of medicine were made by Stern (69,70) and Michael Davis (14) beginning in the late 1920's and byHenry Sigerist (16) and Shryock (62) on the 1930's. The writingsof all four, however, were mainly historical. Stern and Sigeristemphasized the influence of economical factors on medicine. Ashare of pioneering credit should also be given to Oswald Hall(30,31,32,33) whose work in the 40's provided a model for theapplication of sociological methods to the study of the careerand social role of the physician. As can be seen, all of thesewriters, though they conscientiously devoted themselves to a 191 rigorous application of social scientific methods, chose problemsfor inquiry which were of special interest to public healthspecialists and to social medicine. As a consequence, thesewriters are sometimes overlooked by modern medical sociologistswhile they are well known in the fields of preventive medicineand social medicine. There were, of course, other developments in both sociologyand medicine which contributed to the early origins of the fieldprior to World War II. Among these, Lawrence Henderson's seminaron Pareto, and the interest in the sociology of medicine which hestimulated at Harvard University in the 1930's deserve specialmention. (35,36,37,38,7) There were also studies of sociologicalaspects of work, and what has come to be called the sociology ofthe professions, both of which received a signigicant amount ofattention from sociologists but not with specific reference tomedicine.Meanwhile, a separate but related introduction of socialscience appeared in the field of psychiatry in the late 1920's and thirties.The work of Sullivan, probably more than any other,symbolizes this historical development, particularly his studies ofa schizophrenic ward. (74,75) Soon afterward, and heralding thedescriptive studies of informal social life in the hospital whichhave become so important recently, were the researches of Rowland(59,60) and Devereaux. (15) Vivid demonstration thus was providedto show how the ethnographic methods of anthropology could serveinquiry into the meaning of hospitalization as a therapeutic 192 !,rocess in itself. This approach was a radical departure from previousconceptions which saw hospitalization mainly as a custodial backdrop forthe specific therapy of medical procedures. Following quickly after thewar were similar hospital studies by Maxwell Jones (41) Stanton (77) and others.Since the mid-fifties, the volume and scope of studies in the fieldof the sociology of health have rapidly expanded. Sociologists whohitherto had focused their efforts in other areas as well as a growingnumber of their graduate students have contributed studies covering awide range of health related topics. Some represented continuities oftypes of inquiry which were long established, such as the social epi-demiology of disease. During the last several decades, such studiesrun into the hundreds. (26) Recent review articles also document studiesof patient-practitioner relations, the significance of social statusand deviance in the etiology of illness, the social organization of medi-cal practice and the delivery of care, the recruitment and sociali-zation of members in the several health related professions, and theorganization of the health system. it is notable that many issues are now being studied whichinitially were dealt with only indirectly or not at all, such as thepower structure of the medical school (8, 5), the role of professionalassociations in society, (71) and the dynamics of medical practice, (19, 20).Interest is also growing in cross-national and cross-cultural studies, (22, 57) encouraging hope that a comparativesociology of health systems will evolve. 193 These developments owe much to several organizations which markedthe sociology of health as a field for their special interest. Firstmention without any doubt should go to the Russell Sage Foundation.Their Department of Studies in the Professions was started in 1944.Much preparatory work, however, preceded this date. (23) To EstherLucille Brown, more than any other, this department owes its beginning.in more recent years Donald Young has joined Brown in the activepromotion of contributions to medicine by sociologists. Included inthe activities of the foundation, especially during the 1950's, were(a) a postdoctoral fellowship program for social scientists who wishto gain experience in professional settings such as medicine, socialwork, and law; (b) the sponsorship of research in the sociology of medicine;(c) the financing of new programs in medical education;and (d) the support of individual workers :tiring the writing ofspecialized books in the health field. (28, 61, 77)The Milbank Memorial Fund is another organization which has hada long-standing concern with the relationship between the socialaspects of illness and the organization of health services. Thisinterest dates to the beginning of the Fund in 1903, and includeactivities which have frequently combined the efforts of physiciansand social scientists. Among the projects Milbank has supported aredemonstration public health programs, pioneer work on the U. S.National Health Survey, the Hagerstown studies of. the 1920.'s, and the Montefiore demonstration project. Its more recent efforts havefocused on the social epidemiology of mental illness, and, in the1960's, shifted to the support of a broad range of activities by 194 social scientists and community oriented physicians in both the UnitedStates and Latin America. One example is the Fund's fiscal support toextend the activities of the Medical Sociology Section of the AmericarSociological Association. This sponsorship served as the cornerstoneof many of the Section's subsequent activities.The influence of the Commonwealth Fund has also been significant,although much less broad and continuous than that of either the RussellSage Foundation or the Milbank Memorial Fund. Particularly in thestudy of the sociology of medical education, The Commonwealth Fund has played an important part. The seminal studies by Merton and hisassociates, reported in The Student Physician, were stimulated andsupported by The Commonwealth Fund. They have also been instrumentalin such important projects and inquiries as are represented in the workof Hammond and Kern (34), George Miller (49), Lief (45), and others.If there is legitimately one organization which may function asthe spokesman for modern medical sociology in the U.S., however, it isprobably the Section on.Medical Sociology of the American Sociological Association.This organization had its origins in what was called theCommittee on Medical Sociology, which was started informally in 1955by a group of Yale sociologists led by August B. Hollingshead. TheCommittee, though independent, gradually developed unofficial ties tothe American Sociological Association. Not until 1959, however, wasthis relationship formalized in the creation of the Section on Medical Sociology.The growth of this organization has been rapid. By 1971,for instance, the membership had grown to over 800 members. Similardevelopments have occurred in the United Kingdom and Canada. (2) 195 Teaching Sociology in Medicine Clinical medicine is accustomed to benefiting from the division ofkihor In science, accepting specialists from different disciplines inits Leaching just as It accepts and applies their research findings. :;omv of these sciences, like pathology and biochemistry, work directlywith problems of health and disease; others, like physiology, do not.Sociology in medicine today has been compared with physiology nearly a century ago. (9, 56, 64) Like physiology, it is concerned with thedescription of human functioning, but in the social group rather 'thanin the individual organism. Like physiology, it has been assigned aplace mainly in the preclinical teaching of medicine, as a science ofnormal behavior which is basic for the full understanding of thosedeviations from the normal which are called pathological. As such, itis the most recent basic science adopted by the medical curriculum.Following World War II and for a decade after, sociologists joined_hands with medicine principally in research. This was a period of whatmight be called intellectual trial, in which the capabilities of thediscipline as a field of inquiry were being tested. The result, asdiscussed briefly above, was a wide range of research. The mid-fiftiessaw a shift from preoccupation with research to the effort specificallyto involve socthlogists in the teaching of medicine on a substantial scale.The character and growth patterns of this phase have beendocumented by Straus, (72, 73) New, (52) the Group for the Advancementof Psychiatry, (29) and Webster, (78) and others. Perhaps most important, a series of textbooks were produced, beginning withSimmons and Wolff (63), and including.Paul (53), Taco (40), King (43), 196 Susscr and Watson (76), Bloom (6), Freeman, Reeder, and Levine (17), Knutson (44), and Mechanic (47). This was a time of the synthesis of knowledge and the testing of methods to conununicute the special frameof reference of sociology as part of the education of physicians.There was considerable self scrutiny and analysis throughout thisperiod by sociologists themselves to record and evaluate the develop-ment of its role in medical education. In 1960, the Section of MedicalSociology of the American Sociological Association sponsored a pre-liminary study and in 1969, the study which is reported here was initiated.As stated in the early chapters, the decision of the present studywas that intensive analysis of a set of institutional cases would bemore appropriate for understanding the current state of the field thana complete survey of the field. It should be kept in mind that thesecase examples were chosen to represent a variety of approaches to thetask of teaching sociology to undergraduate medical students, and notas a cross section of the total effort. With one exception each ofthe programs included in this study was established since the mid-1960's.Each program typically has an interdisciplinary staff of between eightto ten psychologists, sociologists and other scholars and assumesresponsibility for instruction to medical students, and in some instances,other health professionals and Ph.D. students in sociology.Turning now to the findings of this study, discussion is predicatedon two assumptions about the nature of organizations. First, it isassumed that there are appreciable differences as well as similaritiesin the structures and processes of various medical schools. Although 197 a scholar's previous experience and ascribed attributes are vital con-siderations in his recruitment to a faculty, how he subsequently fares,his degree of isolation from or integration in the subcultures of thestudents and faculty, and his success in competing for scarce academicadvantages are primarily shaped by his work setting. The secondassumption made here is that a man's working conditions influence whatand how much he does, how he perceives his role and is seen by others,the extent to which he is exposed to stress and how he sees and resolvesdilemmas in his place of work.Recruitment.At the time when data were gathered, approximately90 full time social scientists were teaching in the seven schools whichwere studied.Certain attributes in this group are similar, and confirmpreviously reported trends. This is, for example, a youthful group with;t higher than average number of women than in parent social sciencedepartments (or for that matter, medical departments). Senior staff butalmost invariably never junior instructors have held one or more health -related posts. A strong interest in interdisciplinary collaboration,the repute of a particular professor or a university and the enforcementof taboos by other departments against institutional ince-t (particularlywomen) were frequent reasons given by individuals for joining these units.Unlike some of the earlier attempts at establishing these programs, manyof the staff held effective cross-appointments in departments of theirrespective specialties (e.g., anthropology, psychology, sociology, etc.)Despite the rapid growth of each program, the augmented staff sizehad not been achieved without considerable difficulties in membersaccommodating to working in interdisciplinary settings. 198 \"Nor the least of concerns is the intimate workingrelationship of a number of staff people withdiversified interests, different training backgrounds,split (if not divided) departmental allegiances. Thereis probably no easy short cut for numbers of hours oryears in contact to bring diversity of discipline andinterest under some comfortable rubric of 'behavioralsciences'.\"\"The difficulties...consist in the problems involvedin getting faculty members from the 'behavioralsciences' to work together sufficient for theparticular task at hand. Anyone from one of theconstituent fields well knows the difficulties imposedby 'academic tribalistic' boundaries. 1.1r,lile thistype of problem is to be acknowledged it is notinsuperable.It is in some respects a matter ofsplit loyalties, a type of conflict that each individ-ual faculty member has to work out for himself.\"Annual staff turnover rates (difficult to assess in certaininstances because of uncertain full-time versus part-time staffdenominators) averaging about 10 per cent reflect these difficulties.The main reason given by members leaving these programs (50 per cent)was to \"seek a stronger identity with a basic discipline.\"Curriculum. There is consensus about much of what should betaught to students as well as how this instruction should be provided.Lt was not always made clear in these studies, however, that thecurriculum which was oetlined refers only to those materialspresented by the social scientists involved in the study. Excludedfor each of the schools was that portion of behavioral scienceinstruction given by other social scientists who were not members ofthe unit being described or provided by clinicians in their contactswith medical students. Bearing this caveat in mind, all of theprograms included sections on: the social and cultural aspects of illness;doctor-patient relations which may or may not include 199 interviewing and communication; concepts of personality, and a range of social-pathological problems, and aspects of the health system.These represent a limited selection from a wider range of topics whichhave a potential relevance to medical education. For example, welldeveloped sub-fields like socialization, social deviance and thesociology of work or the professions are hardly noted in the reported offerings.Me Work Setting. Each of these faculties either had been recently established;or there had been substantive changes in the compositionand orientation of its staff resulting in a major restructuring of theschool's curriculum. indeed, it has been suggested that lack ofagreement in academic interests may be at stake in the uncertainty ofacceptance of social scientists in Canada's sixteen medical schools.\"In some medical schools professors are still skepticalabout the relevance or utility of these disciplines.Obviously in these settings such programs have not beenstarted.In other faculties two discernible trends haveevolved:some in which social science _programs have beenstarted;others in which a strong public espousal of themerits of these topics has not yet been matched by thecreation of relevant teaching units. In the latter casequestions of the professional competence of the academicnewcomers and the need to share responsibility for topicswhich have already been pre-empted by physicians may wellbe the issues at stake.\" (2)Considering the structure of a medical school and the compositionof its faculty, a complete integration of the activities of socialscientists with those of basic scientists and clinical physicians isimprobable, and perhaps undesirable. But there are various levels ofintegration and types of accommodation which may occur. The nature ofa scholar's institutional affiliation determines to whom he is unknownor with whom he associates, how he is accepted informally by other. 200 faculty members and under how much social stress he may work. The extentfor Instance to which there is equal access by discipline to informationand resources affecting the activities of a faculty varies in our subjectcases depending upon whether sociologists were in settings with: (1) ahigh degree of automony (e.g., an autonomous department); (2) a degreeof autonomy within distinct units (e.g., a division of a medical depart-ment); or (3) minimal autonomy (e.g., under the aegis of an inter-department-al committee).Certain portions of the curriculm content, as might be expected, varieddepending upon the setting in which social scientists worked. Human growthand development and interviewing skills and concepts were emphasized bysociologists working in psychiatric settings: these fields were relativelyignored by those in community medicine. The reverse trend holds forinstruction on social issues in health and the organization of health services.Also, in their health-related research, autonomy appeared tobe directly related to the nature of the research which was undertaken.More projects dealing with basic social science issues were reportedamong sociologists in autonomous units. Researchers in less autonomoussettings tended to report a register of research interests whichoccasionally approximated a short disease listing culled from IndexMedicus.Further differences are evident which appear to be caused mostbasically by the degree of work autonomy. Members of the more autonomousprograms were more likely to serve on committees with the highest levelof policy making power, on search committees for new chairmen of other departments, on committees on promotion and tenure, and on committees 201 ior laculty curriculm and examinations. Little criticism was voiced byscholars in these more autonomous units concerning administrativeprocedures, and allocation of space or of budget. Perhaps because oftheir more extensive involvement in a school's general activities and amore broadly gauged understanding of how decisions were reached and whatwere the school's concerns and priorities, the staff of these departmentsreported little if any personal hostility or criticism of the activitiesof the administrative hierarchies of their institutions.None of these conditions characterized the experience of sociologistswho worked under conditions essentially of dependent organizational statusand definitely restricted autonomy. Their involvement ili a representativerange of faculty committees was limited. They had few administrativeresponsibilities of importance which would provide them with Informationchannels, and they had minimal responsibility for the handling or planningof budgets and appointments. These conditions appear to reduce personalsatisfaction, vocational interest and career commitment. These conclusionsare drawn from the following type of data in the case studies:\"The behavioral science program has very littlefunding directly under its control...there is nocentral area where many or most are located; someretain offices in the given behavioural sciencedepartment; one has two office:. each representingone leg of the joint appointment; while others haveoffices located primarily in the medical school.Similarly, the base for teaching is widely diffusedthroughout the campus.Whatever administrative arrangement is ultimatelyarrived at, the behavioral scientists who are in-volved must be provided with the opportunity tointeract among themselves over a period of time; musthave a forum to themselves, a common meeting groundin which they can, in fact, hash out some of theinternecine quarrels that are endemic to the academicfractionalization of knowledge and which will sub- 202 sequently give them the chance to speak as a groupoutside and have impact on the decision-makingprocedure of that outside contact in matters whichaffect their professional standing and professionalcontribution to medical education. They need, in short,peer group support as the context for their individualendeavors.\"\"These approaches carry with them certain risks. Acontinuous process of negotiating between the knowledgebase of the behavioral sciences, the practice-orientedobjectives of the medical schools and student interestsmight tend to produce sacrifice in the academic contentof the course. This may actually have occurred in someinstances at this institution and the faculty arecurrently groping with this problem.\"\"No money is tagged by the department as belongingexclusively to behavioral sciences. The psychologistsand sociologists are well supported by the department,but teaching in the basic sciences program is notdirectly tied into such reports. Rather, the individualis supported for a variety of reasons, primarily havingto do with general contributions to the department andthe responsibility of the various teaching programcoordinators to try to obtain teaching time fromthese individuals on a cooperative basis. Controlof these funds then rests specifically with thechairman of the department. There is no formal pro-cedure or \"routing\" to the dean or other administrators.Behavioral sciences should be represented at thehighest level of administration by a behavioralscientist who is competent to understand the medicalschool culture and, indeed, may have experience as aphysician.Ideally, behavioral sciences should betaught as part of the clinical as well as pre-clinicalexperience...the most difficult part of this would beto set up a behavioral sciences program which wouldnot be competitive with a psychiatry department.\"\"Out of seven health center committees, social andbehavioral scientists are represented on only three,and specifically are not represented on the importantand powerful General Research Support Grant Committeewhich dispenses funds to various research projects andstudent fellowships...Certain key persons in the socialand behavioral science group appear to carry more thantheir share of responsibility in this regard, e.g.,nine appointments; six; five; five; five. It is ofinterest that none of these men is a \"pure\" socialscientist and that only two have specific training in a 203 4recognized social science discipline.\" (Seven membersulthis program referred to \"lack of facilities\" and\"administration support.\")Who criticizes whom and how criticism was acknowledged anddealt with varied by a program's degree of autonomy. Certain difficultieswere reported in each case study. However, particularly hostile oppositionappears to have occurred in reaction to those scholars who worked asrelatively isolated individuals in medical departments or who were affili-ated with broad-based interdisciplinary committees. The source of suchcriticism, it was reported, derived mainly from members of basic sciencedepartments.The objections made by the basic scientists have a familiar ring:the field was too soft; its practitioners were ignorant about theirown discipline or about medicine; and valuable curriculum time wasbeing wasted.\"The notable critics of the program have been thechairmen of anatomy, biochemistry, physiology, micro-biology and some segments of academic experimentalpsychology.It should be noted that none of these\"critics\" are outspokenly against the program'sexistence, but rather are critical that it should beincluded as a \"basic science\" program, and wouldargue for a more \"rigorous\" approach. A parallelargument is that (it is)... not appropriate in teachingbasic science and furthermore that this provides thedepartment of...which houses the behavioral sciences,over-exposure in terms of capturing the students'interest in furture career involvements.\"\"lt was from the basic biological scientists that thestrongest reservations came. A number of them sawlittle purpose in the behavioral science dimensionto the curriculum...Some specific individuals from thebasic biological sciences did make known--and continueto manifest--their antagonism in various settings,formal and informal.\"Central to the oppostion of the basic scientists in these settingsmay have been a potential threat perceived to their roles as scholars 204 and competition for curriculum time granted to social science.What emerges from these case studies is that while Behavioral Sciencehas typically been strongly supported by the administration of a medicalschool and certain chairmen of clinical departments, viable acceptancethroughout a school does not occur until social scientists constitute aprogram or department with essentially equal status to the other workingunits of a medical school. When this does not happen, the basic sciencedepartments may regard social science as the protected protege of a Deanor clinician, and as an intrusion into \"their curriculum time.\" Thus,social scientists may become lightning rods for otherwise veiled tensions between competing groups in the medical school. These may be basicscientists versus clinicians, as described by Bucker in her study of thefaculty ofthe University of Illinois School of Medicine: \"It is difficultfor a Ph.D. to work for long in a medical school without being burned afew times...Clinicians made absolutely outrageous statements aboutPh.D.'s (which) did rankle.\" (8 )It also happens between the pro-tagonists of educational reform and those who favor more traditional teaching.Whichever, the social scientist is a favored target just likeother newcomers to the scene before him unless he is placed in a positionwhich allows him to negotiate on fair terms.All of which proves only a dictum which is hardly surprising: thatstrong sponsorship is required to introduce a new discipline into thecurriculum of the medical school. Historically other innovations in amedical school such as biochemistry or psychiatry have faced stiffcriticism and have had a broad assortment of initial alignments priorto achieving relative institutional autonomy and stability. Until this 205 is reached for social scientists working in medical schools these scholarsmay feel that they are constantly \"on trial.\" In sum, from the case studies, it appears that those social scientists who were not in autonomoussettings are often relatively powerless to shape much of what is importantfor their own careers in a medical school or to influence its destiny. ItIs only when strong sponsorship is joined with a modification in thestructure of a medical school either in creating a discrete unit, adiviston or a departmentjthat a new discipline such as sociology isintroduced on terms that allow effective fulfillment of the tasks whichare being assigned to it.It is interesting to note that the dilution of basic scholarlycapabilities may well occur more in a slowly evolving situation whentime allows the buildup of great pressure for accomodation as comparedwith the introduction of a group of scholars, strongly sponsored, andestablished from the beginning in an organizational unit with viable autonomy.The Steps AheadThe position of sociology in medicine is, at this moment in time,ambiguous and subject to cross-pressures. On the one hand, never has thedemand for sociologists in medical institutions been greater. (78 )On the other hand, the cry of \"too many Ph.D.'s\" threatens to cut off the supply.A vitalized interest in the community and in the reorganization ofthe profession's delivery of care have stimulated an unprecedentedrequest for sociological consultation, research and teaching in community medicine.At the same time, the interest in the medical school curriculumhas persevered, and although definitions of this term vary, a role for 206 sociology is generally given a significant place. Against this background,it is particularly ironic that training programs are being reduced, caughtIn the general retrenchment of higher education. In this difficult and innovational field, the ideal response tomedicine's demand would come from a substantial number of very ablesociologists, knowledgeable and experienced in the actual functioningof health institutions. However, the impression gained from careful reviewof the current roster of sociologists in medical faculties is that we arefar fromachieving the desired ideal. The social scientists involved inthose case studies are a youthful group who typically have had onlylimited opportunities for interprofessional collaboration, the teaching ofmedical students or experience with the operations of medical schools. Someof their comments indicate the types of frustrations and obstacles, which they feel impede optimal work. As an individual.and institutional \"sift-ing out\" process occurs, in essence, as these men gain familiarity witha new work setting, their general scholarly contribution to the healthprofessions should become more cogent and valid. Their efforts in thisrespect, it would appear from the case studies, can be hindered orfacilitated by the type of work setting to which they are assigned,a question over which they usually have little control.Certainly, there are individuals who are able to combine attributesof basic scholarship and special skill in health areas, but a largemajority of the total are young and relatively inexperienced. Given thepressures for narrow specialization which, it must be recognized, doexist in health settings, the academic integrity of these young socio-logists is in jeopardy unless protected by strong organizationalstructures within medicine and by connections to parent disciplines. 207 Concerning this study itself, despite the aspirations of thescholarly and fiscal sponscrs, it can only be considered a small steptoward Its objectives. What Is called for is a much more comprehensivereview of the current state of the field. Essentially, this wouldinvolve examining programs which have failed as well as those whichhave survived, the nature and significance of the scholarship ofacademics working in different settings, the extent to which, whenaccomodations are made, they are functional or dysfunctional; and whatthese trends connote for sociology, the changing face of medicine and, ultimately, for the. well-being of society.What does acceptance of these programs connote for the values oftheir host Institutions? Among the various factors stimulating thesechanges may he \"an artificially fostered readiness\" in which behavioralscience in medicine may be perceived \"as an anodyne for anxieties fosteredby conflicts in society.\" (46)Certainly it cannot be assumed that theseschools because of their inclusion of a partitular community-orienteddiscipline are necessarily more liberal in outlook than other faculties,for historically medicine has been a pragmatic polygamist in testing thevirtues of \"would-be-mates.\" (48)That not all medical schools in theUnited States and Canada have as yet accepted this innovation suggests(as in the introduction of other specialties) that there is an acceptablebreadth of variability in medical education. Considering the profession'spivotal contribution to man's well-being, it is not completely self-serving to hope that these changes represent a creative effort to alignthe physician's role to society's changing circumstances. 208 BIBLIOGRAPHY 1.Anderson, Odin W. and Milvoy Seacat, The Behavioral Scientist andResearch in the Health Field, New York: Health Information Foundation:,1957. 2.Badgley, Robin, (editor), \"Social Science and Health in Canada,\"Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly, Vol. XLIX, No. 2, April, 1971, Part 1. 3.Barrabee, Paul S., \"A Study of a Mental Hospital: the E4'fect of ItsSocial Structure in Its Functions,\" unpublished Ph.D. d4 qertation,Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass., 1951. 4.Belknap, Ivan, Human Problems of a State Mental Hospital, Noll York:McGraw-Hill, 1956. 5.Bloom, Samuel W., The Medical School as a Social System, MilbankMemorial Fund Quarterly, Vol. XLIX, No. 2, April, 1971, Part 2. 6. ,The Doctor and His Patient, New York: Russell SageFoundation, 1963. 7.Bock, Arlie V., \"Lawrence Joseph Henderson, Memorium,\" the of American Physicians, 57: 17-19, 1942. 8.Bucker, R., \"Social Process and Power a School,\" inM.

Consequently there has been a growingutilization of behavioral scientists in medicine, and a recognition of the need to add behavioral science knowledge to the traditional basic scienceand clinical aspects of the medical curriculum. Before doing so however,it would be well to take a more critical look at the existing biologicalbasis of medical practice to which behavioral science is to be joined.At the present time, the biological basis of medical practice, asrepresented by the basic sciences of anatomy, biochemistry, microbiology,physiology, pharmacology, etc. is almost completely devoted to functional**biology.From the viewpoint of a biologist, functional biology representsonly half of the significant thought and theory in biology the other half constitutes evolutionary biology (2). In the absence of evolutionarybiology in the curriculum all evaluations of what is \"scientifically valid\"continue to be made with the criteria of functional biology. One consequence *Contribution from the Comparative Behavior Laboratory of the Human Develop-ment Center, Department of Psychiatry.**For example, a recent comprehensive work, entitle The Biological Basisof Medicine (1968) which runs to six volumes and over 3,200 pages, doesnot contain a single article devoted to phylogenetic or ontogeneticaspects of the human neuromuscular system, and the ontogeny of behavior,among its 85 papers. (1) 217 has been that the split in medical training between the \"hard-core\" clinicalareas of internal medicine, obstetrics, pediatrics, gynecology, neurology,surgery, etc., and the \"soft-core\" areas of psychiatry and psychoanalysisis continued and enhanced. Another likelihood is that the basic scienceand behavioral science curricula that are now being contemplated willconstitute two parallel but separate tracks which seldom meet. Indeed,those who have initiated behavioral science programs in medical schools havealready voiced this concern.From this it follows that one function of the biobehavioral curriculumwould be to provide (1) a background of biological mechanisms for linking thematerial of the behavioral sciences with that of medicine, and (2) a biologicalbasis for a rapprochement between the so-called hard-and soft-core areas of clinical medicine. These two goals are closely related.An evolutionary approach to the development and functions of the neuro-muscular system, as developed in ethology, the embryology and ontogeny ofbehavior, etc. is currently missing from most medical curricula. Neurophysiologyand neural science treat the neuro-muscular system almost exclusively within* a functional framework, rarely from an evolutionary viewpoint. Pediatricneurologists, however, are beginning to incorporate into their thinking andtraining programs a neuromuscular maturational perspective. (4), (5), (6).With the exception of a few programs in physiatry, such material as concernsitself with the ontogeny of neuromuscular patterns is relegated to the *The foreward (by one of the editors) to a large volume (almost 1,000 pages)on The Neurosciences warns of the \"specialist approach that fails to seethe forest for the trees.\" Nevertheless, pot a single paper is devotedto the phylogeny, ontogeny or maturation of behavior (as two editors havenoted), with the possible exception of one devoted to the postnatal growthand differentiation of the mammalian brain. (3) 218 training of occupational and physical therapists. The medical student is seldom exposed to its theoretical. foundations. What little evolutionarypermpective wax obtained from comparative anatomy is rapidly being obliteratedwith the reduction of hours devoted to anatomy in current programs. Even after they receive their degrees, most medical students and physicians areunable to consider the behavioral aspects of human development from a biolog- ical viewpoint.it is the thesis of this paper that all medical students will have tobe exposed to basic research findings and concepts in the biobehavioralfields, and their application to the various clinical areas of medicineif (1) they are required to translate behavioral science concepts intofunctional biology and (2) they are to cope with the future needs and devel- opments of medicine. Relevant materials will be drawn from the following areas: (a)Ethological research and concepts (b)Prenatal origins of vertebrate and human behavior (c)The postnatal, neuromuscular maturation of infant and child (d)Neuromuscular aspects of emotional behavior (e)The role of emotions'in maturation and development, includingprimate studies on separation, depression, etc. (i)The interrelationships of behavior, metabolism, and physiology (g)The shared homeostatic and heterostatic functions of behaviorand system (h)Biological clocks and rhythmicities (i)The biobehavioral basis of human character and social behavior 219 _ Another selection, or combination of topics might serve as well orbetter than the above one. To a considerable degree the curriculum shouldgrow out of and reflect the skills, interests and enthusiasm of those teaching it.The approach outlined here is one which reflects the writer's biologicaland behavioral interests and their relation to various clinical areas andproblems in medicine. Its intent is to stimulate medical students to considerand formulate a model of human development and behavior capable of beingintegrated with both the behavioral sciences and the clinical areas ofmedicine.ETHOLOGICAL RESEARCH AND CONCEPTSCurrent ethological research and concepts are the result of a comparativebiological approach to the study of animal behavior. They trace their originto Darwin's chapter on Instinct in the Origin of Species, wherein he pointedout that the concept of the gradual evolution of animal structure was equallyapplicable to a consideration of animal behavior. (7) Much confused thinkingabout behavior is directly traceable to the endeavors of various schools ofbehavior to separate a biological approach to behavior study from the relatedbiological approach to animal structure. The-problem is more one of sem-antics than reality, for at cellular and submicroscopic levels geneticchanges in behavior are equally structural. The validity and contributionsof the ethological approach reside in the fact that it is possible to observeand objectively record genetic changes in behavior at the motor level longbefore their microscopic base can be ascertained, just as in medicine be-havioral symptomatology was correlated with disease processes long beforetheir physiological base could be identified.It is precisely this molar approach which has provided us with biologicconcepts and insights regarding behavior which it is doubtful that neuro-physiology would have uncovered. It is doubtful, for example, that neuro- 220 physiology would have uncovered the fact that the concept of homologyapplicable in comparative anatomy is equally applicable to the behaviorof related categories of animals, that behavior patterns have taxonomicvalidity, i.e. behavior patterns may be used to identify taxonomic categoriesof animals, including species. Just as microbiologists have turned to thephysiological and biochemical characteristics of microorganisms, when theirstructural features were inadequate for identification, so zoologists suchas Whitman (8), Wheeler (9), and Heinroth (10) turned to the behavioralidentification of the animals they studied. To be used as a valid taxonomiccharacter, the trait selected, whether structural, physiological, biochemical,or behavioral, must possess only one feature genetic constancy within thetaxonomic category for which it is utilized. Once it had been ascertainedthat behavior patterns possess such genetic constancy, then it follows thatlike other characteristics, behavior must also be subject to evolution.Evidence derived from isolation experiments, in which an animal is rearedapart from any members of the species to which it belongs, but neverthelessperforms movement patterns characteristic of the species, further supportsthe genetic origin of such behavior.The basic approach of ethology to behavior is centered around thisfact, namely, that together with genetically determined structural, physio-logical and biochemical characteristics, animals possess a repertoire ofinherited or innate patterns of behavior. These range from the initialrespiratory, locomotory, and feeding behavior patterns of newborn animalsto complex sequences of courtship, mating and parental behavior displayedby adult animals. The methods and concepts of ethologists have beenindicated in numerous books (11),(12), (13), (14) and other publications, (15),(16) but their salient findings may be summarized as follows: 221 1.Ethology begins with the particulate units of movement and behaviorwhich have been termed fixed motor patterns, (17) or fixed action patterns.They may more accurately be described as geneticallydetermined neuromuscular coordinations. They are released by key stimuli of other animals, such as structures, color patterns, scents,calls, body movements, postures, etc., which uniquely characterizethe appropriate object for such behavior. These key stimuli aretermed releasers, or social releasers, since they frequently mediatethe social behavior of two or more animals. 2.Fixed motor patterns are discharged whenever the proper releaseris presented, even by \"dummy stimuli\", provided that the animal isin an appropriate physiological state. Thus, male sticklebacks inthe reproductive state will attack other red-bellied males that entertheir territories, or even bizarre-shaped dummies, so long as theirbellies are painted red, but when not in a reproductive condition they will ignore the same releasers. 3.Such responses to releasers suggests that fixed motor patterns arenormally inhibited by some other activity in the central nervoussystem, and that some neural mechanism undoes or uncouples the inhib-itory action upon excitation by the appropriate releaser. Thishypothetical mechanism has been termed the innate releasing mechanism or IRM. 4.By making use of various artificial models, or dummies, which possessone or more releasers, it is possible to experimentally quantifybehavioral responses, or to otherwise measure them with various recording devices, just as one quantifies other. physiological res- ponses.Such quantitative studies of fixed motor patterns show that 222 these behaviors depend upon the combination of the strength of the releaser and the internal physiologic state of theanimal.The internal state of the animal caninfluence or modify the threshold of a response. In extreme cases lowering of the threshold may give rise to vacuumactivity, in which the motor pattern is discharged in the absenceof a stimulus. 5.Fixed motor patterns are alsocapable of being elicited by artificial releasers, or dummies, with exaggerated key stimuli, which have a greater releaser effect than the normal releaser object.Such strong artificial releasers are sometimes referred to as supernormal objects, or supernormalsign stimuli. 6.Apart from their value as particulate units of behavior, capable of being objectively recorded, fixed.motor patterns havebeen shown to be subjectto or associated with various types of lawful behavior phenomena as follows: a) When twoconflicting sets of releasers are presented in equal intensity to an animalfor example,releasers for aggressiveand escapebehavior - theanimal frequently will not perform either its sequence ofaggressive or escape motor patterns, but will exhibit another, semmingly irrelevant motor pattern, whi_Ch is referred to as a displacementactivity. (18) Displacement activities arepredictable behavioral phenomena in specific experi- mental situations. This suggeststhat they arethe lawful result of physiologic activities within the central nervous system. Several hypotheses have been put forth to account fordisplacement activities, but their governing principle is still not fully understood. b) The social object which'releases a given sequence of motor patterns may displayreleaser stimuli for a singlefunctional pattern of res- ponse, or fortwo differentresponse patterns. Or we may experi- 223 mentally create dummy objects which contain two sets of releasers.For example, a herring gull will brood egg-shaped objects, but willcarry away broken egg shells which are bloodied and red. If weplace egg-shaped dummies, painted red, in the nest of a herringgull, either parent upon returning to the nest may initially siton and attempt to brood these egg-shaped dummies, but a little laterwill peck at or carry these red objects out of the nest, then again attempt to brood them. Such ambivalent behavior may thus be studiedat the perceptual-motor level of response. c) In addition to conflictand ambivalent behavior, the arousal of two separate sequences ofbehavior may result in their superposition, which gives rise to a newbehavioral combination or expression. For example, an aggressivegoose will extend its neck, while a fearful one will display a with-drawn, bent neck. In combination, an extended, but partially bentneck indicates a mood of fearful aggression. Dogs and other mammalshave likewise been shown to superpose the two responses of fear andaggression in varying combination. Superposed motor patterns areof significance not only in animal expressions, but in the evolutionand expression of human emotions.d) While the all-or-none law of physiology may be true for the motorunit, a nerve fiber with all the muscle fibers it supplies, itdoes not hold for sequences of motor patterns. When the stimulusfor a complete response is of low intensity, or is combined with alowered physiologic state of the animal, various incomplete sequencesof motor patterns may occur. Consequently, animals may displayany transition from slight indication of a specific motor pattern,referred to as intention movements, to complete sequences of an 224 I. FMP \"A'LAWFULPHENOMENAASSOCIATED WITH FIXED ' action chain. A bird may be seen to bend its legs, stretch itsneck or flutter its wings (all of which represent movements initi-ating the normal pattern of flight), without leaving the ground,thereby indicating an intent, or incomplete impulse to fly.e) In addition to the above, fixed motor patterns may be the subjectof regressive behavior, a reactivation of motor patterns normallyassociated with an earlier developmental period, as when the motorpatterns of begging food and feeding are utiliked-in'the adultcourtship of herring gulls. Another phenomenon observed in variedspecies of animals with a social hierarchy or dominance rank oris redirected activity, in which.a lower ranking animal in an t .abl-ished hierarchy directs its aggressivity not at the higher rankinganimal which aroused it, but at a lower ranking animal which happensto be nearby.One frequently finds that a given motor pattern ini-tiates two different behavioral sequences. As a transitional activityto either feeding or bathing, the motor pattern of dipping thehead under water in the midst of bathing carried out by shellducks,may result in a momentary bout of feeding. Stimuli from vegetationserving as food may contribute to this momentary feeding, even thoughthe animal is obviously in a \"bathing mood.\" 7.In addition to the above behavioral phenomena, imprinting (19), (20)which deals with rapid and frequently irreversible learning duringan early critical period of behavioral development, has been reportedin fish, birds and mammals and undoubtedly plays a significant rolein the ontogenetic development of human behavior. (21) There maybe two types of imprinting phenomena, as Schutz (22) has shown tooccur in Mallard ducks - a parental recognition type of imprinting, .226 and sexual imprinting the latter requiring a longer time to de-velop, but also occurring in the first two to three months in thelife of a male duckling. Bonding behavior, including mother-infantbonding and reproductive adult bonding has been studied ethologicallyin a variety of animal species, with the result that we are gaininginsight into the behavioral factors that result in strongly bondedrelationship among animals.These ethological concepts may be covered in a 2-3 hour lecture anddemonstration. No amount of talking about animal behavior to medical students,however, can be as effective as several demonstrations of actual behavioral phenomena.In this realm particularly, an effective demonstration of behav-ioral principles is worth a thousand words. The utilization of a ComparativeBehavior Laboratory in association with or in close proximity to the medicalschool is almost a prerequisite for such demonstrations. A certain degree of improvisation, however, is also possible. During a five week VisitingProfessorship at the University of Florida Medical School in 1963, I was ableto purchase pairs of four species of finches from a local five and ten centstore, and half a dozen, day-old Pekin and Muscovy ducklings. Within threeweeks it was possible to provide demonstrations of the rank order of bathing,the homology of bathing and preening motor patterns in the several species,imprinting in the ducklings and the innate aspects of bathing and preeningmovements the first time the ducklings were permitted in the water. Suchdemonstrations not only raise questions about the neural substrate of suchbehaviors, but arouse considerable interest and enthusiasm, even amongmedical students little disposed to take any interests in animals other than man.Slides and films are another important adjunct to such lectures. Tnaddition to several commercial films, a variety of animal behavior films 227 may be rented or purchased from the Animal Behavior Film Laboratory of thePennsylvania State University in College Park, and the Max-Planck-Institutfur Film and Bild, Gottingen, Germany. A behavioral film library is alsoavailable at the Rockefeller Foundation in New York.The material selected for presentation should (1) provide a backgroundof biological concepts and principles utilized in the study of behavior suchas the specificity of behavior patterns in species and other taxonomic groupsof animals, the genetic, phylogenetic and ontogenetic aspects of behavior, andthe lawful phenomena associated with fixed motor patterns, and (2) pointout ethological considerations relevant to clinical problems and issues in medicine.For example, Gunther (23) has shown that the correct positioningof \"an elongated nipple and anterior breast area in the posterior of theinfant's mouth acts as a strong releaser for vigorous sucking.\" Some follow-up studies suggest that low intensity sucking experiences during the firstmonths of life may be continued as an apathetic response to food and feedingactivities during subsequent years of childhood. Blauvelt and McKenna (24)have shown that without prior instruction primiparous mothers will orienttheir newborn infants in a typically primate, belly-to-belly position.This position is conducive to the initiation of side-to-side rooting move-ments by the infant, which signals the mother that her offspring is ready to feed.Such interaction is the beginning of an important non-verbaldialogue between mother and infant, conducive to developing the mother'sconfidence in the relationship with her child. This can lead to a fruitfuldiscussion regarding the effects of hospital routine and nursing procedureswhich often interfere with or postpone the development of this relationshipduring the mother's stay in hospital. 228 The earlier comment about the lack of an evolutionary perspective inthe traditional neurophysiology or neural science curriculum is in no waymeant to disparage the valuable and unique contributions which neurophys- lology has made to medicine. It was meant to emphasize the fact that theapproach of ethology which concentrates on behavior patterns is capableof providing biologic'insights equally as important as those of neuro-physiology which centers its research and thinking o 'the motoneuron. AllLou often, when the medical student's training in behavior is derived exclus-ively from a neurophysiological curriculum, he receives a one-sided andunbalanced background which leaves him incapable of thinking about the biologyof behavior in all its ramifications.Movement patterns constitute a fundamental biologic aspect of bothhuman and animal behavior in much the same way that cells are fundamentalunits of animal structure. Even before Darwin's-volume on expression, andbefore ethologists emphasized their significance, the French physiologistand anatomist Duchenne (25) (1967) completed a functional analysis of theentire muscular system of man as well as supplementary studies with animals, tiand concluded that the \"isolated action of the muscle is not in the natureof things.\"Even a simple reflex does not result in the contraction of aparticular muscle, but in the performance of a significant movement.Hughlings-Jackson (26) (1882) likewise concluded that nerve centers rep-resent movement patterns, not muscles. We are in fact unable to moveindividual muscles, but we perform complex coordinations of muscles instantly.In this context, the significance of a phyogenetic and ontogenetic under-standing of the maturation of movement patterns for the work of the physicaltherapist, the physiatrist, or in the treatment of the cerebral palsiedchild may be profitably discussed. 229 PRENATAL ORIGINS OF VERTEBRATE AND HUMAN BEHAVIORStudies dealing with the embryological origins of behavior are essentialIi medical students are to understand and deal with the maturational aspectsof beLlvLor.In addition, however, such embryological studies provide addit-ional support for the genetic origin of much of behavior. Underlying theconcept of the fixed motor pattern of ethology is the assumption that thereis not only a genetically determined pattern of neural impulses emanatingfrom the central nervous system, but also a genetically determined neuralorganization which provides these behavior patterns with their specificity.The subject has been extensively reviewed by the psychologist Carmichael,(27) who recognized the importance of an understanding of the early develop-ment of behavior patterns for psychological theory, as did the pediatrician Gesell. (28)Just as the functioning of behavior patterns is essentialto balance neurophysiological theory based on the motor unit, so the embry-ological maturation of behavior patterns is required to counter the exclusivereliance of so many psychologists and behavioral scientists on learning theory.This subject will be discussed more fully in a later section ofthis paper.Much of the impetus for today's understanding of the development ofinherited behavior patterns is derived from the studies of the anatomistCoghill, (29) who possessed a curious psychological bent. \"How does it come about?\"Coghill asked, \"that as soon as the larval salamander hatchesfrom its egg, it is at once capable of those neuromuscular coordinationswe term swimming behavior?\" By carefully observing and filming the sequencesof movement patterns that occurred in the transparent egg of the tigersalamander, and correlating these sequences with the histological study ofthe maturation of neurons, muscle bundles and neuromuscular functions, Coghill 230 was able to demonstrate that the sequence of movements which gave rise toswimming was entirely dependent on growth and maturation processes in the embryo.Carmichael (30) demonstrated subsequently that if the embryosdeveloped in the presence of the anesthetic chloretone, which did not Inter-fere with development but prevented the earlier behavioral movements, theystill swam normally when the drugged embryos were placed in fresh water atthe proper stage of their development.As the result of these studies on the maturation of behavior Coghillformulated two hypotheses which are seldom discussed, but which continueto possess relevance for both the evolution of behavior and certain devel-opmental behavior anomalies, Coghill found that early in development anysensory Input or stimulation capable of being conveyed to the developingcentral nervous system excites the entire nervous system and existing neuro-muscular functions, resulting in what he termed a total pattern of response.During subsequent phases of maturation central inhibitory mechanisms developwhich limit the total pattern and give rise to local responses. When thesalamander develops legs it begins to walk with the total trunk patternassociated with swimming, then gradually the trunk pattern is inhibited andthe legs appear to function autonomously, independent of the trunk, (i.e.the trunk action is inhibited and it is left with the limb pattern). Througha similar process of individuation, local reflexes develop within individual limbs.Note that in this early maturational schema reflex behavior comesabout through the operation of central inhibitory mechanisms on the remainingnervous system, rather than through the initial building up of simple reflexesinto more complex patterns of behavior. In view of Sherringon's (31) earlyrecognition of the existence of some type of inhibitory mechanism in thecentral nervous system, and Eccles (32) more recent demonstrations of post-synaptic inhibitory neurons acting on motoneurons in various portions of the 231 CNS, the demonstration of maturational inhibitory mechanisms on the molarlevel by Coghill should be of more than passinginterest. They suggest thebehavioral adaptations which led to the evolution and incorporation of In- hibit.-y mechanisms into the central nervous system.Since the above studies, students (33), (34) of Coghill and others(35), (36) have demonstrated similar sequences of behavioral developmentin the embryos of other amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. Hook_r(37) has carried out an exemplary study of the sequential development ofbehavior in the human fetus. He pointed out that since vertebrate embryosin general develop strueturally in phylogenetically determined and regulatedsequences, it would be surprising if the fetus failed to show similar se-quences of behavioral maturation. Not all students of behavior developm :have agreed with Coghill and Hooker's interpretations. (38) Kuo, (39) forexample, in presenting an epigenetic view of prenatal behavior developmentin mammals and man, suggests that we not confuse species-specific structureswith species-specific behavior patterns. While Kuo recognizes geneticinfluences on morphogenesis, he stresses the importance of environmentalfactors in the development of the individual behavioral repertoire. WhileIt must be admitted that the environment is capable of playing a decidedrole in the development of behavioral phenotypes, it is not less capableof creating structural phenotypes, an extreme example of which might be thethalidomide babies and other teratologic anomalies. It is doubtful thatKuo would reason that since the environment can produce structural pheno-types, genetic factors for morphogenesis are nonexistent. His reasoning,therefore, appears to be an artificial and biologically indefensible en-deavor to consider the development of structure and behavior from two separate viewpoints. at. These differences in the interpretation of behavioral development,notwithstanding, medical students should be familiarized with the fact thatthe human embryo and fetus displays a relatively stereotyped sequence of behavioral development. Until about 6 1/2 weeks of menstrual age the humanembryo appears to be incapable of any reflex activity. At 6 1/2 - 7 weeksof age, it responds with a typical contralateral flexion of the neck anduppermost trunk to light stroking of the upper and lower lip. At 8 1/2weeks of age this response is followed by extension of the arms at the shoulder,and rotation of the pelvis toward the contralateral side. Spontaneouslyexecuted movements of the above type first to one side and then the other,are seen to occur in the 9 9 1/2 week old fetus. At 10 1/2 weeks, thepalm of the hand first responds to light stroking, with partial closureof the fingers, plantar flexion of the toes in response to stroking of theside of the foot. At 11 weeks, trunk extension either alternates with oris partially combined with lateral flexion; at 11. 1/2 weeks quick, kick-likeextension of the knee occurs.. At 12 - 12 1/2 weeks of menstrual age a\"total pattern of response\" occurs involving a wide variety of movements,but partially fades after 12 1/2 weeks of age. Thereafter more and more\"partial patterns\" or localized reflexes begin to make their appearance.Grasping, respiratory movements, phonation and sucking appear later in development.Apart from their demonstration of the prenatal human behavioral reper-toire, Hooker's studies deserve consideration for several other reasons.Of the 131 human fetuses made available to him, 14 failed to show responsesbecause of deep anesthesia or injury, while the responses of another 31were so reduced or modified by the administration of anesthetic or hypnoticdrugs to the mother that their behavior, even in the fetal stage, was alreadyconsidered abnormal and therefore eliminated from the study: Desmond, et al, (40) have indicated that anesthesia and analgesia administered to themother In labor can affect the temporal sequence of the events of theInfant's postnatal transition period In the first six hours of Its life,and even influence the time of meconium passages.. Disturbance of this patternwhich occurs in the first few days of life may remain as a correlate ofbehavior and disease throughout the subsequent lifetime of the individual.Obstetricians, pediatricians and others have written about this subjectwith growing concern.Another reason for considering these fetal behavioral responses isthat they indicate the occurrence of lawful behavioral responses withinthe central nervous system, which can in no way be considered as due to learning.The fetuses which Hooker obtained were examined in carefully re-gulated constant temperature baths of physiological saline solution, orchambers under oxygen pressure. Nevertheless, all fetuses suffer fromprogressive hypoxia and eventual asphyxia. It was noted above that by13 1/2 to 14 weeks fetuses have advanced to specific reflexes, or partialpatterns of response to stimulation. But just before asphyxia sets in andactivity is eliminated altogether, the 13 1/2 week old fetus tends to returnor regress to the 12 /2 1/2 week total pattern of response.At 18 1/2 weeks, weak chest contractions, later accompanied by abdom-inal contractions and expansions indicative of diaphragmatic activity, beginto appear either spontaneously, or in response to stimulation. Nevertheless,Hooker has observed that when gasping occurs as a terminal agonal phenomenain the 13 week old fetus, it is accompanied by chest contractions indicativeof respiratory movements, even though they are physiologically ineffectual.Initiation of chest respiratory movements which ordinarily would not occuruntil some 55 1/2 weeks later further suggests the existence of lawful 234 interactions of different neuromuscular patterns within the central nervoussystem itself, independent of learning.Furthermore, it has become evident that all the vertebrate respiratorypatterns exist within the central nervous system of man - not only the fish-like pattern of gasping. A gasp is the first breath of a newborn infant,and among the stimuli that have been implicated in iniating this response,asphyxia Is considered to be the principle driving force (just as a fall inarterial oxygen tension and pH, together with a rise in carbon dioxidetension induce gasping in utero). Normal newborn infants have a typicallymammalian type of abdominal respiration. In 6 month old infants there isa gradual development of thoracic respiration which becomes deeper and slower,until typical pneumotaxic respiration predominates in the 7 year old child.In the course of phylogenesis, typical higher mammalian respiratory patternsgradually superseded the different partial centers found in lower vertebrates.During human ontogeny, respiratory development follows the general phylOgen-ctic pattern.In the infant these centers appear to be quite labile, andimmature patterns of respiration may take over during stress, disturbance,or anxiety.Premature and mature infants about to die, apparently \"regress\"to the lower form of gasping respiration prior to suffocation. Gaspingand the swallowing respiratory pattern of amphibians are frequently seenas \"symptoms\" of various severe illnesses, especially pneumonia.According to the pediatric neurologist Peiper, these phenomena rep-resent regression to ontogenetically earlier, and phylogenetically \"lower\"stages of respiration, still present in the central nervous system of manand released from the inhibiting control. and domination of the more recentlydeveloped respiratory centers. There is no better way of demonstratingto medical students that the term \"regression,\" commonly used as a descriptive 235 term In psychology and psychiatry, is as much a physiological event. Crying,screaming, laughing, sucking, separation from the mother, and anxiety allInlluence the pattern of respiration. Eventually these altered respiratorypatterns influence growth and posture. I have seen two and even four yearold children whose relationship with mother or parents was so disturbedthat they were thrown into spastic respirations so severe as to be mistakenfor symptoms of cerebral palsy. The psychoanalyst Bell (41) has suggestedthat the postpartum piratory difficulties may be reactivated by stressfulexperiences during severe toilet training and other phases of development -and that the repetitive arousal of these initial respiratory spasms mightwell provide the background for asthmatic disturbances. Indeed, Erikson(42) appropriately referred to the first stage of human development as themoral 7reulratory-sensory stage.Studies of the embryology of behavior, therefore, can provide muchfruitful material for discussions of (1) the maturation of behavior, (2)the lawful interactions and responses of behavior within the central nervoussystem, independent of learning, (3) the relation of metabolism and behavior, (4)the concept of \"regression\" as the reactivation of motor patterns andresponses associated with an earlier ontogenetic phase of development, and (5)the relation of the modification of early patterns of response to laterpsychosomatic and psychosocial disturbances.In this connection it would also be appropriate to utilize the studiesof neurembryologists on the neural organization of the central nervous system.Sperry, (43) for example, in reviewing the subject of the embryologicaldetermination of behavior sums the matter up as follows:\"The development of behavior is directly dependent upon an orderlyassembling of the neurons of the nervous system into appropriate patternsof interconnections .... In the course of growth, sensori-neuro-motor 236 ;IssoelatIonH are somehow laid down in a consistent orderly manner. How aresuch patterns organized in development? .... a survey of the evidence as itnow stands Leads to the conclusion that the basic patterns of synapticassociation throughout the vertebrate system are organized for the most partby intrinsic forces of development without the aid of learning.\"THE POSTNATAL, NEUROMUSCULAR MATURATION OF INFANT AND CHILDA sequential development and maturation of reflexes occurs postnatally,as well as prenatally, in the human infant. These are normally utilizedfor the evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of children with central nervousdysfunctions (Fay) (44), (45) (Bobath and Bobath) (46), (47) and (Fiorentino) (48).Fiorentino has classified these reflexes as roughly belonging to threelevels of central nervous system maturation as follows: 1)Apedal - with a predominance of primitive spinal and brain stemreflexes reflecting the motor development of a prone or supine-lying creature. 2)Quadrupedal - with a predominance of righting reactions belongingto the mid-brain, and the motor development of.a child who canright himself, turn over, and assume crawling and sitting positions, and 3)BiRedal - with the development of a cortical level of control, andthe equilibrium reactions of the child who can assume the standingposition and walk.The above classifications represent rough descriptive levels, ratherthan sharply defined categories. Furthermore, many of these primitivereflexes are present only for brief periods of early development, after whichtime they can no longer be elicited. Thus, flexor withdrawal of the legupon stimulation of the sole of the foot of an infant is a normal spinal 237 reflex up to approximately two months of age, but if displaced appreciably .beyond this age may be an indication of delayed reflexive maturation. Thesame is true for other spinal reflexes, such as extensor, and crossed exten-sion of the leg upon appropriate stimulation. It has been demonstratedin various vertebrates that when the brain is separated from the spinalcord these reflexes continue to be displayed. Consequently, they are con-sidered to be spinal in origin.Brain stem reflexes effect changes in the distribution of muscle toneassociated with posture, and occur in response to a change in the positionof the head or body in space. They can be elicited in the normal childduring the first four to six months of life. When they persist beyond thefirst six months, this may also be indicative of delayed maturation of thecentral nervous system.Righting reactions, mediated by the midbrain level and associated withquadrupedal locomotion, result in the establishment of the normal head andbody relationship, both in space and in relation to each other. They developsoon after birth, and are involved in such activities as rolling over (theneuromuscular pattern for which is already present, in part, in the fetus),in sitting up, in getting on hands and knees and crawling, or in quadrupedal locomotion.These reflexes exert a maximal influence from 10-12 months of age.Thereafter, they are gradually inhibited or modified, and disappeartowards the end of the fifth year.Apart from their utility for diagnostic purposes, this sequence ofreflexive maturation has important biological and neurophysiological impli-cations for the growth and development of the child. First, these reflexesare unlearned - many of them have already been established during prenataldevelopment.Second, they become functional and normally inhibited in arelatively orderly sequence, and their functioning in this sequence may be 238 a requirement for the further growthmaturation and integration of the nervous system itself. Where brain damage, or lesions, prevent the inhib-iting action of other \"higher\" centers, these primitive reflexes and dis-tributions of muscle tone may continue to dominate and interfere with normalbehavior and development, as in the cerebral palsied child. Most important,from a theoretical viewpoint, these reflexes which appear and disappear duringontogeny are another indication of the presence of phylogenetically oldvertebrate neuromuscular coordinations in the central nervous system of man.In addition to the ontogeny of respiratory patterns, of spinal, brain-stem and mid-brain reflexes, and cortical, inhibitory control mechanisms,the ontogeny of locomotion also appears to follow a phylogenetic pattern of development. Swimming is undoubtedly the oldest vertebrate method of locomotion.McGraw (49) has demonstrated, on the basis of 445 filmed obser-vations of the aquatic behavior of 42 infants, ranging in age from 11 daysto 2 1/2 years, that the swimming pattern is a normal and regular behavioralresponse of the newborn infant. There is an initial phase of reflex swimmingwhich occurs and gradually fades out over the first 3-4 months of age. Thisis followed by a period of disorganized, or struggling activity which reachesa peak at about 6 months of age. Voluntary swimming makes its appearanceat seven months of age and reaches a moderately good level at 12-14 months of age.in this connection it is interesting to point out that the month-old, embryo-like offspring of marsupials, which have been observed to maketheir way unaided from the vaginal orifice to the marsupial pouch, utilizea side-to-side, swimming motion of the trunk to achieve their goal.Between birth and approximately one year of age, the infant goes througha development of various movements which permit him to roll over from hisback to a prone position. Within a few weeks after birth he extends hisneck, then eventually his entire trunk, and after some 3-6 months auto- 239 matically completes an entire turning movement, but without specific pur- pose.From 6-12 months of age he utilizes turning over to the prone positionin a deliberate fashion as the preliminary to some other activity, such as (:reeping or standing up. It should be pointed out that Hooker's studiesalready reveal the presence these movement forms in the central nervoussystem of the human fetus.Once in a prone position, the infant develops an orderly progressionof movements from creeping and crawling to walking on all fours, and finally,bipedal locomotion. Creeping, in which the arms alone are used, and theabdomen is dragged along, is often a preliminary stage to crawling, especiallywhen the arms are moved alternately instead of simultaneously. In crawling,the Infant progresses with all four limbs in a pattern of crossed coordinationi.e., the right arm and the left leg move together, then the left arm and the right leg. Crawling appears at 7 1/2 to 8 months of age. Like swimming, quadrupedal locomotion, with the legs as well as 't..hearms extended, is not seen frequently in young children, but it does occurwith some regularity. I have observed an 11 1/2 month old boy walk on allfours with remarkable speed and proficiency, whenever the youngster wantedto keep up with or remain in the company of an older sister or his mother.In another instance a 13 1/2 month old boy who could both crawl and walkbipedally (he had been doing so for two weeks) returned to a quadrupedalgait whenever he wished to move quickly, since quadrupedal locomotion washis most rapid means of movement. He made a smooth transit from eithercrawling or dipedal walking to walking on all fours. The factors for therelease of quadrupedal locomotion are not understood, but are being studied in our laboratory. 240 It is frequently claimed that infants will not walk bipedally unlessthere are adults in their environment that they can observe in this position.Certainly the ability to observe a form of locomotion does not play a rolein the maturation of swimming, creeping, crawling or quadrupedal locomotion,since first born children with no opportunity to observe these movementsin their environment nevertheless utilize all these forms of locomotion.Thus while children are imitative, there is no evidence that imitation isa factor in the development of locomutory sequences. Further, as is wellknown, newborn infants are capable of the basic neuromuscular coordinationsof stepping, if they are held under the armpits and their feet. touched tothe walking surface. They will also show step-climbing movements. It isthus apparent that their central nervous systems already possess the neuro-muscular coordinations of stepping along at birth, even though unable tosupport their bodies in an upright position at this time. These walkingreflexes increase in incidence during the first two weeks of life, butdisappear in normal children at 3 or 4 weeks of age. Furthermore some young-sters walk bipedally unaided the first time they attempt this form of loco- motion.One mother, who had providri no aide of any kind in the maturationof his various forms of locomotion, reported that her 14 month. old son whohad never previously walked, suddenly stopped crawling, rose on two legswithout pulling himself up on any nearby object and effectively walked some3 1/2 to 4 yards toward her. It would appear that what is required forwalking in children is the requisite muscle and bone development, togetherwith the subsequent integration of the bipedal pattern with the erect posturalpattern.In addition to elicitation of the swimming and bipedal patterns at birth,it has been shown that newborn infants are capable of the support of their 241 .1,_ -. ,,.

Bipedal walking pattern in a 6 day old girl. 242 ,bodies la primate fashion, by grasping and hanging from their hands, orutilizing their hands and toes (Figure 2). Likewise the movement patternof crawling may be elicited as a reflex in all healthy newborn infants, ifthe Infant is placed on his abdomen and continuous pressure is app lied tothe soles of his feet with the examiner's hands. Such reflex crawling alsodisappears by the fourth month of age, and cannot be prevented from disap-pearing by practice. It would appear that most of the neuromuscular coordin-ations of locomotion (1) are already present at birth; (2) that the develop-ment of locomotion in the child occurs in a regular sequence; and (3) thatthe ontogenetic sequence of locomotion reflects the phylogenetic developmentof the vertebrates. Not only does develop a pattern of terrestral quadrupedal locomotion by firstusing the limbs in a swimming pattern, but man likewise attains bipedallocomotion after repeating, during early ontogeny, ancestral vertebratepatterns of locomotion as functional stages in the maturation of his centralnervous system.While the various organ systems, the circulatory, the respiratory, theexcretory, the nervous system, etc. are presented in detail to the medicalstudent, the evolutionary aspects of the neuromuscular system, and therule of behavior patterns in human development and in mediating all aspectsof social behavior, is neglected in both the medical and behavioral science curricula.The occurrence and expression of such primitive and phylogenet-icallY ancient neuromuscular coordinations during the course of ontogenyconstitute part of the normal developmental sequences toward maturity. (50)Without consideration of this aspect of the \"behavioral system,\" it isdoubtful that an understanding of biosocial interrelations, so crucial tothe development of a medical-behavioral science curriculum, will be attained. 243 NEUROMUSCULAR ASPECTS OF EMOTIONAL BEHAVIORThe fact that we have so many different words, such as postnatal re-flexes, behavior patterns, locomotion, manipulation, respiration, posture,attitudes, etc., prevent us from realizing that what all these terms havein common is the integrated activity of the neuromuscular system. This isparticularly true with regard to any consideration of emotional behavior.While the approach of physiologists, psychologists and psychiatrists maydiffer in either their treatment or research in regard to the emotions, all %/ill agree that no emotion occurs in the absence of neuromuscular andautonomic nervous system changes. This, in fact, provides the physiologicalbasis for all so-called \"lie-detector\" tests. From a biological viewpoint,.emotional responses are adaptive patterns of behavior and, as with otherbehavior patterns, can be understood from an evolutionary perspective.An excellent biological, evolutionary consideration of behavior has beenoutlined by Plutchik (1962) (51).Beginning with the studies of Duchenne (1862) (52) and Darwin (1872)(53), we have accumulated considerable information about the neuromuscularcomponents and expression of the emotions, their physiology (Cannon 1929,1932), (54), (55) the role of the hypothalamus (Bard, 1934) (56), the neuralsubstrates which mediate emotional behavior (Papez, 1937), (57), (Arnold,1960), (58), and the role of the autonomic nervous system in emotion andemotional disturbances (Gellhorn and Loofbourrow, 1963) (59), etc. Theproblem is presenting the role of the emotions in health and disease to medicalstudents, therefore, is not a lack of information, but the crucial questionsof what information to select and how to organize a balanced presentation.Not only psychiatrists, but all future physicians will require an under-standing of the role of the emotions in human development, the specific 244 pa; Carus of emotional behavior they will meet and deal with among theirpailents, the ways in which much Individual patterns of emotional responsecan contribute to so-called organic illnesses, how to recognize emotionaldisorders, and the available resources required to deal with them.The subject of emotional behavior then affords a unique opportunityfor the medical curriculum to integrate the so-called hard and soft-coreclinical areas of medicine. The usual practice of calling on the neuro-physiologist to present the neural substrate of emotional responses, andthe psychiatrist to separately present the developmental and subjectiveaspects of emotion, has seldom been effective. The medical student is thusInvited to choose between, rather than integrate, the two models of emotionpresented in this fashion. It is essential that staff members from thebasic, clinical and behavioral sciences get together and work out an inte-grated model for presentation. However much the presentation of such anintegrated concept of emotional behavior differs in the various medical schools,such effort will do more than anything to further the concept that an inte-grated understanding of emotional behavior is not only desirable, but essentialin dealing with diverse clinical problems.Many first year medical students are reluctant to deal with the emotionalaspects of human behavior. Others, presumably those with a strong interestin psychiatry, are anxious to explore the subject further. On the otherhand, all medical students have some awareness of certain areas of theirown strong emotional responses, and wherever possible an endeavor shouldbe made to relate the subject matter to their feelings. An integratedapproach should cover the biological and physiological aspects of emotionalexpression in man and animals, the neural substrate of emotional behavior,the role of the emotions in infant and child development, emotion in family 245 structure and stability, emotional responses of patients to illness, totreatment, to the physician, and psychosomatic interrelations in illnessand emotional disorders (Reymert, 1950), (60). 1 have found the followingschema a useful one: A)Emphasize the evolutionary origin and the fundamentally adaptionalaspects of emotional responses, as indicated by the early studies of W.B. Cannon. If man or an animal is engaged in strenuous activity,as in working or jogging, autonomic homeostatic mechanisms followthe behavior and serve to correct whatever depletion of resourcesthe activity entails. In an emotional response, such as the fight-flight reaction of animals the sympathetic-adrenal portion of theautonomic reaction` anticipates the energy expenditure that would berequired to either escape a situation, or engage in a fight, leadingto increased respiration and facilitation of other physiologicalaspects of respiratory processes, circulatory adjustments includingheart acceleration, constriction of splanchnic blood vessels, dis-charge of extra red blood corpuscles from the spleen, breakdownof glycogen and release of glucose from the liver into the blood --even setting in motion a mechanism for the reduction of blood coagu-lation time, should the situation result in a wounded animal. Inother words, an emotional response in a potentially threateningsituation leads to a total pattern of response, which has (a) aneuromuscular component (modifying the muscle groups that mightbe required for an aggressive or escape response, and activatingthe perceptual reflexes directing the sense organs towards thethreatening object), and (b) an autonomic component which wouldsupport an ensuing behavioral activity. This approach provides an important connecting link between autonomically mediated homeo- 246 static mechanisms and the capacity of emotional patterns to upsetthese functions. B)Emphasize that all other vertebrate animal groups have similar\"emotional\" mechanisms. A fish, for example, will likewise respondto a threatening situation with a combined neuromuscular pattern -either escape swimming, or remaining perfectly still in a corneror near other cover - together with an autonomic nervous systemresponse resulting in the \"blanching\" of the fish (due to concen-tration of pigment granules in the melanophore cells) or it mayassume a darkened pattern, together with erection of dorsal fins,expansion of gill covers, etc. preparatory to an aggressive responsetowards an intruder. We need not get lost in the problem of whetheror not fish and other vertebrates \"feel\" emotions subjectively.What is important is that our own emotional responses have evolvedfrom these combined neuromuscular and autonomic patterns of responsefound throughout the vertebrates. C)Utilize Darwin's analysis of the neuromuscular components of emot-ional responses such as crying (present in the newborn infant) andhow the inhibition of crying over a prolonged period of time leadsto the expression of a new emotion - grief. Especially relevantis Darwin's indication that the suppression of crying requires theactivity of the frontal muscles to counteract the contraction of theorbicular, pyramidal and corrugator muscles normally activated inthe process of crying. This demonstrates two overlooked aspectsof emotional expression, first that combinations of neuromuscularpatterns (the superposition phenomena of ethologists) are capableof evolving into complex new or 'subtly. modified nuances of emot-ional expression, and second, that the inhibition of emotional 247 expression - an aspect of the development of all infants and children -requires the activation of counteracting neuromuscular responses.Thls Is an all too often completely overlooked, but important phys-iological aspect of emotional expression. The particular patternof emotional suppression which each child goes through results inthat child's pattern of body (neuromuscular) tension later in life.Huber's (60) excellent treatise on the evolution of the facial muscu-lature, and expression, may be brought into the lecture to indicate how por-tions of the neck musculature of reptiles gradually spread over the headand face of mammals, primates and men and led to the more refined movementof the perceptual organs (the eyes, ears and nostrils) and the mouth and lips.This constituted the primary function of the facial muscles. Onceevolved, however, these muscles were secondarily drawn into their presentsignalling and communicating function as facial expressions. This is anotheropportunity to indicate how the evolution of structure and the evolutionof behavior go hand in hand. Various ethological studies of the subtlecombinations (superposition) of two separate facial expressions such as fearand aggression, have been delineated in dogs, cats and other mammals.The intent of this section should be to demonstrate (1) that emotionalpatterns of response are present throughout the vertebrates from fish toman; (2) that emotions are essentially biologically adaptive, (3) that froman evolutionary viewpoint emotions appear to have had their-origin in neuro-muscular coordination of intended behavior together with an autonomic nervoussystem component designed to support the intended behavior; and (4) thatalthough emotions may be considered or treated in a subjective context,that they always involve physiological consequences. 248 This is a good point at which to present experimental material onthe neural substrate of emotion, including the studies of hypothalamicstimulation of animals in social situations by Delgado (61), the studiesof sympathetic and para-sympathetic tuning of Gellhorn, the mechanism ofemotion proposed by Papez (1937), Arnold (1968), and others. It shouldbe emphasized that in all such animal studies, the determination of emotionalresponses rests on a knowledge of the special neuromuscular coordinationswhich characterize them, i.e., the arched back, open mouth and hissingof an angry cat, etc., as well as on the accompanying autonomic reactions.This biological viewpoint that emotional response or behavior orig-inates from a total pattern of integrated physiological response of afundamentally adaptive nature, sets the scene for later consideration ofthe circumstances under which it is possible for adaptive patterns tobecome maladaptive, to contribute to the development or maintenance of or-ganic illness, to interfere with the processes of convalescence, or to developinto emotional disorders.THE ROLE OF EMOTION IN MATURATION AND DEVELOPMENTWhile the biological, evolutionary and adaptive aspects of emotionalresponses provide us with background for understanding their physiologicalfunction, these considerations provide little understanding of the role ofemotion in human development, and in the day to day interactions with friends,colleagues, business associates, family or patients. Queries put to firstyear medical students concerning such everyday terms as emotional development,emotional stability, emotional maturity, emotional disturbance or upset,emotional behavior, etc. usually reveal the variety of connotations, valuejudgments, and confusion that these terms engender. Very little clarificationof this confusion accrues from presenting the neural substrate and physiologyof emotion on the one hand, and the psychiatric picture of early emotional 9AQ development, and psychotherapy, if no effort is made to connect these twoareas of Information. The connecting link resides in precisely what thesetwo pictures of emotion both omit -- the actual behavior patterns throughwhich infants, children and adults express their emotional reactions inday to day living. (Also see Jacobson, 1967), (62).To counteract any notion that emotional responses are largely disrup- tive, itIs useful to present Spitz's (63), (64) earlier studies on mortalityin foundling homes and other institutions for children, together with hisdescription of the syndrome of anaclitic depression. It is well to remindstudents that in the early part of this century many institutions for foundlingsand orphans reported 90% or higher mortality rates, but Spitz found thateven when conditions improved \"institutionalized\" children practically withoutexception developed subsequent psychiatric disturbances and became asocial,delinquent, feeble-minded or problem children. But apart from emphasizingthe significance of human emotion in the interaction between mother andchild,.Spitz's paper deserves to be reread for its description of the neuro-muscular aspects of the withdrawal pattern of the separated child.Depression and other psychotic disturbances of adults are normallycharacterized by delusions, disturbances of thought processes, abnormalthought production and mental confusion. Spitz pointed out that in the infantssuffering from anaclitic depression which he examined, the disturbances wereto be detected primarily by postural changes, changes in mobility and be-havior, and particularly in the facial expressions of emotion. It is throughsuch behavioral changes, especially through the neuromuscular coordinationsof locomotion, posture and expression, that this pathological process firstmakes itself known early in development. All 19 cases of anaclitic depres-sion which he studied showed one factor in common -- the mother had been 250 from the child for almost three months, between the ages of 6-8 months.A more recent clinical report indicates that in six cases of children hos-pitalized as the result of specific disturbances of maternal behavior andfamily organization (otherwise termed \"maternal deprivation\") a syndromesimilar to Spitz's anaclitic depression was found which not only includedretarded, psychomotor development, but severe growth retardation and delayed skeletal maturation. (65) This strongly suggests that what we term \"depression\"is not primarily a psychological response.The recent studies by Spencer-Booth and Hinde (66), and Kaufman and Rosen-blum (67), might well be introduced at this time. In two separate seriesof experiments wherein rhesus and pigtail monkeys were separated from theirmothers, they undergo comparable responses of 1) initial distress, 2) de-creased locomotion and behavioral activity, and 3) depression. Even whenthese infant monkeys were later reunited with their mothers, the effectsof this depressed behavior continued for several months to a year later.This suggests that what we term a \"depression\" is basically a biologicalpattern of response of separated primates, and not necessarily a unique human \"psychological\" response.Likewise, Sacket (68) has shown that early life experiences in rhesusmonkeys also produce persistent effects on behavioral development. Forexample, rearing infant monkeys without physical peer contacts producespersistent and damaging abnormalities in non-social, social, sexual andmaternal behaviors in later life. All attempts to reverse such pathologicaleffects of early experience proved to be uniformly negative. If reversalis not possible, do these early experiences represent \"learning\" or are theyincorporated into the growth process? According to him \"isolation per sefrom critical early social and non-social experiences appears to produce 251 permancilL anomalies within the animal which persist regardless of the degreeof adaptation to post-rearing test situations.\" He points out that the simi-larities in the motor pstterns of abnormal man and abnormal monkeys suggestthat the isolation-reared monkey is a valuable model for the development ofabnormal behavior among primates in general.It has been indicated that the developing infant and male child requiresa continuing, and unbroken emotional relationship with his mother throughapproximately the third year of life (through the oedipal stage) for normalpsychosexual development (69). What if the child, because of some earlytrauma in the second year of life, breaks the emotional relationship withhis mother behaviorally -- i.e. he no longer interacts with her emotionallyand behaviorally in a loving or aggressive fashion,but continues to fantasya continuing love relationship? Is this the beginning of the development ofan introverted, schizoid-type personality structure?What if the mother dies in the third year of life, and the fatherLakes over the mother's warm, loving role (instead of remaining as the power-ful competitor with the son for his mother's love and affection). Does thislead to interference of normal identification with the father, and lead tothe development of a strong, emotional, homosexual attachment to the father.And does this provide the psychosexual background for later physical andemotional homosexual relationships?This is a good point at which to take up the normal psychosexual devel-opment of both infant girls and boys. Actual case histories, in which notmerely theoretical constructs, but a knowledge of the actual early lifecycle behavior patterns are known to-a considerable degree, should be utilized. (70)In addition, studies of actual early behavior patterns in infancyand childhood should be introduced to indicate that the theoretical meta- 252 psychological constructs of psychoanalysis have their origin in observable behavior.THE INTERRELATIONSHIP OF BEHAVIOR WITH OTHER PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESSESThe amount of time devoted to neuroanatomical, neurophysiologicai,neuroendoorinological and the muscle biochemistry substrate of behaviorIn the curriculum is undoubtedly a factor in the one-sided viewpoint which somany medical students develop regarding what \"causes\" what. Little wonderthat they become fixated on the molecular causes of illness and neglectthe equally Important behavioral regulation or disturbances of human physiology.In so many instances, the social, cultural or even the hospital or institutionalenvironment does little to directly influence or change the organism'sbiochemistry, but by modifying behavior it is capable of bringing about far-reaching biochemical, physiological and even structural changes. Thereforespecific clinical instances and case histories should be provided whichemphasize the mutual ways in which behavior and physiology are inter-related.A good starting point is the bed-rest patient (71), (72), (73). Ithas been shown that even when healthy medical students are put to bed, wastingof muscle tissue, leeching of bone calcium, and a decrease of blood volume,capillarity and other circulatory reductions begin very shortly. The normalnitrogen balance of the organism is upset, as detected by increased excretionof nitrogen in the urine within several days and this, regardless of howmany steaks or other protein supplements these bed-confined medical studentsmight eat.These changes in the bed-rest patient are therefore not theresult of illness, but due to inactivity of the individual.This remains one of the unsolved problems with which today's andfuture astronauts will have to cope, since in their case, as well, prolongedinactivity carries with it the hazard of physical deterioration. 253 BEDRE STHealth), Medical biologist H.S. Jennings quite appropriately defined behavior asthe method of regulating the internal processes by means of external movements.\"To keep the internal processes going,\" he pointed out, \"the animal must docertain outward things. Thus behavior and the internal processes are not twothings; they are aunit and cannot be understood separately.\" As animalshave adapted to their particular environments and modes of life, patternsof behavior have evolved and have been \"wired in\" to the nervous system,thus providing a regulatory role for numerous physiological, biochemicaland autonomic functions.An opposite response from that of the inactive, bed-rest patient isexemplified by the athlete in training. When an individual engages inrunning, swimming, or other vigorous exercise, an immediate physiologicaladaptation takes place. The tremendously increased energy expenditureinvolves respiratory, circulatory and other adaptations, so that almost atwenty-fold increase in the volume of blood flowing through the muscularsystem may take place during maximal exercise, together with correspondingchanges in pulse rate and stroke volume of the heart. As is well known,these changes are largely mediated by respiratory and cardiac centers inthe medulla acting through the autonomic nervous system.What we term \"training\", however, involves several distinct but inte-grated processes. These include, of course, both the performance of theparticular neuromotor activities involved, and the special skill with whichthe partial motor patterns are put together to bring about the end result.Secondly, there is a transition from the normal, relative resting state ofthe autonomic nervous system, to the very different autonomic patternassociated with the athletic activity. Jokl (74) refers to this.transitionas a change from homeostasis to heterostasis. 255Homeostasis relates to the tendency of the organism to maintain a constant inner environment duringnormal non-athletic activity, whereas during exercise, pulse rate, bloodrnte, body temperature, blood sugar, muscle tone and oxygen intake andutilization undergo a marked \"heterostatic\" change.The remarkable effect of training, however, is that over an extendedperiod of time, such exercise brings about deep-seated structural changesin the body of the athlete. Through training the neuromotor patterns andthe new autonomic patterns are integrated, or to be more accurate, they are\"grown\" together. The amount of myoglobin in the muscle, which acts as anoxygen reservoir, increases. The muscles themselves increase in size, thecapillary blood vessel bed in the muscles is enlarged, the volume of the,blood increases, and structural changes occur in the heart itself. Notonly his skill, but these changes in the structure of the body of the trainedathlete provide him with the necessary endurance power required for anoutstanding performance.The fact that behavior and growth, or structural modification areintimately related has not been lost on swimming coaches, so that athleticactivity and the training of athletes is now begun earlier and earlier, whileactive growth is going on. This undoubtedly accounts in considerable measurefor the fact that world swimming champiohs are 14, 15 and 16 years old,and that athletic. records have continually improved over the last several decades.While this capacity for growth is greatest during the first twodecades of life, it never ceases, with the result that training and exerciseprograms are now being utilized in cardiology to treat 40-60 year old patientswho have suffered myocardial infarcts.These examples emphasize the unique capacity of behavior tc bring aboutchanges in physiological function and structural modification. The rationale 256 behind the training program for cardiac,_patients resides, in part, in themodification of peripheral circulatory mechanism which such training brings about.But although these instances of the ability of behavior to initiatephysiological change are well documented, they are thought of as exceptionalinstances, rather than representing end-points of a continuum of relationshipsbetween behavior, physiology and growth.The afferent pathways initiating complex neuroendocrine functions may be triggered by behavioral activities. (Scharrer and Scharrer, 1963) (75).Thus, the presence of a strange male in a female mouse's territory may intro-duce olfactory stimuli which depresses the secretion of prolactin and results in blocking of pregnancy. Copulatory behavior, which appears to involveafferent Impulses from a multitude of receptors, initiates ovulation in rabbits and cats. Copulatory behavior in the rabbit apparently also leadsto reflex liberation of oxytocic substances from the neurohypophysis, sincestimulation of the vulva, vagina and cervix of rabbits produces activemovement of the reproductive tract, which in turn speeds up the transit of sperm to the Fallopian tubes. Lehrman (76), (1958 a,b) studies the effectsof courtship and nest-building behavior on the induction of broodiness (egg-incubation) in the ring dove, Streptopelia risoria. His experiments led him to suggest that courtship behavior of the male stimulates estrogensecretion in the female, and that estrogen stimulates turn encourages progesterone secretion which stimulates incubation behavior.While the hormones play a role in influencing the readiness ofthese doves to behave in a particular fashion, the fixed motor patterns ofthese various behaviors are unlearned.Likewise, in woman an infant suckling at the breast, and the frequentremoval of accumulated milk, influences the amount of milk produced. Suckling 257 leads to a reflex increase in the secretion of prolactin; accumulated milkremoval to the liberation of oxytocin (77). The latter hormone, also influ-enced by suckling, plays a role in the free flow of milk called \"let down.\"Thus, and similar biobehavioral phenomena require emphasis if medical studentsare to gain an understanding of the neglected concept that behavior influencesphysiological processes in a variety of ways. (See also Beach, 1948) (78).THE SHARED HOMEOSTATIC AND HETEROSTATIC FUNCTIONS OF BEHAVIOR AND THE AUTONOMICNERVOUS SYSTEMThe above material, which can be covered in 12-14 hours of class lectures,should provide medical students with the realization that at the very leastperiods of sleep, rest, moderate or strenuous activity, and emotional be-havior all involve changes in both neuromuscular and autonomic nervous systemactivity.This provides the groundwork for the fact that the autonomicfunctions of the various activities may conflict with each other, supporteach other, or summate in a fashion which leads to pathology. The followingmaterial may be taken as illustrations; other examples can be utilized aswell to start medical students thinking along these lines.The homeostatic mechanism which shifts a considerable volume of bloodto the Intestinal tract following a meal may conflict with the mechanismthat shifts blood to the peripheral circulation during moderate or vigorous activity.Th;:s, if a heavy meal is abruptly followed by strenuous swimmingin an untrained individual, muscle cramps may result from the inabilityof the organism to adequately meet both needs. Likewise, an emotional re-sponse may either conflict with the blood volume shift to the internal organsor augment an autonomic response to either the physical environment or topathogenic microorganisms. (79a), (79b).A case in point is a study of Hinkle (79) who has carried out somethorough investigations of human ecology during the past 20 years. Followingthe studies of Holmes (80) and others, who demonstrated that the nasal mucosa 258 not only responds with a reaction of engorgement and nasal secretion to awide variety of noxious and threatening stimuli but also to the :motionalresponses of crying or even feelings of sadness, Hinkle undertook a studyon the effect of such responses in acute respiratory illnesses. He carefully selected a group of 24 women from over a thousand who worked in two largerooms in an office building in New York City and followed them carefullyover the course of an entire winter, with observations of their generalhealth, their nasal symptoms, the color and secretion of their nasal mucosa,clinical signs of respiratory illnesses, viral and bacterial cultures oftheir noses and throats, observations of their social background, and theirgeneral moods and behavior during the daily rounds of their work and home life.Needless to say, such an investigation required a unique collaborationof physicians, epidemiologists, virologists, bacteriologists, sociologists,and clinical psychologists. According to Hinkle this study \"producedevidence that the nasal secretion which is referred to as 'common cold'occurred among these women most frequently and in its most florid form, attimes when their nasal mucosa were already engorged for other reasons. In the winter, differences in the temperature of ambient air, between in-doors and outdoors, appeared to be an important reason for this; but a moreimportant reason appeared to be changes in the mood and pattern of activityof the woman, in response to changing relationships to people around her and the events which she encountered. Apparently viral infection of the nasalmucosa of a woman, sad, tearful and fatigued often produced florid illnesses;while infection of another woman, well rested and not aroused, produced little or no illness.\"Ecologically speaking, responses to the social or interpersonal environ-ment are not fundamentally different from responses to the physical environ-ment, or to internal responses of the organism to invasion by noxious 259 organisms or substances. Relevant to medicine is the fact that these res-ponses involve, in part, the same physiological systems, and sometimes nearidentical mechanisms of reaction.Furthermore, just as the athlete in training may shift from homeostasisto heterostasis in r.gard to the activities of the autonomic nervous system,so the individual may shift the normal balance of central (hypothalamic)autonomic reactivity, to one which favors either a more vigorous sympatheticor parasympathetic response. Gellhorn (81) refers to such alterations assympathetic or parasympathetic \"tuning.\" Theexternal environment, emotionalreactions, drugs or other conditions may read to increased sympathetic,discharges and central sympathetic tuning. During such a state of sympa-thetic tuning, the response of the parasympathetic division of the autonomicnervous system to stimulation becomes reduced. Likewise, sympathetic excit-.ability to stimulation is reduced during parasympathetic tuning. Chronic,or permanent pathological changes may result, if alterations of this kind persist long enough. Instead of working towards a balance, sympathetic orparasympathetic responses may dominate an individual.Claude Bernard (1859) first described the internal steady stateMechan-isms which permit mammals to live and thrive under widely varying external conditions.Cannon confirmed and extended this concept which he termed homeostasis.He also pointed out that the steady state is not a rigid one,but relative - the steady state itself is subject to change. Thus the homeo-static mechanisms vary considerably during the rapid growth of the fetus,the infant and the child, and again during maturity, middle and old age.There are fluctuations of the steady state due to seasonal or geographic changes, or to special conditions such as pregnancy and lactatiQp,r Inother words, homeostasis itself is a dynamic system, changing with time,activity and environmental conditions. 260 The value of the homeostatic concept in the curriculum, is that itpermits the student to grasp a physiologic principle without having to learneach and every example of it at once. On the other hand one deficiency ofON concept as presented in the medical curriculum, is that emphasis Isplaced almost exclusively on neural, physiological, hormonal or other chemicalregulators.The way an organism behaves, however, serves as an additionaland equally critical regulator of an individual organism's internal environ- ment.This aspect of organismic regulation is generally minimized or over-looked entirely.Richter's (82) experiments provide an excellent demonstration of howbehavioral regulators interact with neural, hormonal and other regulatingmechanisms, and thus contribute to the maintenance of a constant internal environment.These behavioral regulators become evident when eliminationof the physiological regulators lead to specific changes in the animal'sbehavior.For example, if the adrenal glands are removed from rats, they losetheir ability to regulate their sodium metabolism. Without adrenal aldoster-one large amounts of sodium are excreted as salt in the urine. If providedonly with their normal stock diet these rr,ts die in from 8-15 days. (Fig. 4A)But if these animals are provided with two water bottles, one containingnormal tap water and the other 3% NaC1, they will drink sufficient saltwater to not only keep themselves alive, but free of symptoms of Na depletion. (Fig. 4B)When offered a variety of mineral solutions, such adrenalectomizedrats increase their intake of all sodium salts, but show no appetite for chlorides.In other words, \"drinking behavior\" changes as the physiologicalregulators change.Likewise, rats are able to maintain a constant body temperature, whenprovided with adequate nourishment, with the aid of a physiological heatregulating mechanism in the hypothalamus. But with a marked reduction in room 41-1.;,..1300 fl., `25040200YXtDP- 3 0 L1150220 oI00u.1050 0 C. 7,000 6,000 5,000 4,000 3,000 2.000 1,000WITHOUT SALT CHOICE BODY WEIGHTpaRrc?(PIce,?;t:1,'000,,14;q; o0 BUILDINGAND HYPOPHYSECTOMY 165175185195205215225235245255265275285295THYPOPHYSECTOMY 'NEST BUILDINGACTIVITY temperature, rats resort to increased nest building behavior in an endeavorto maintain their normal body temperature. By placing a roll of soft paper---outside their cage, together with a cyclometer to measure the amount of paperused o.ach day, it can be shown that when room temperature drops from 80 to45%egrees F., the amount of paper used daily for nest building increasesfrom 500 to 6,000 centimeters. (Fig. 4D)Likewise hypophysectomized rats,unable to produce adequate amounts of body heat, build much larger neststhan normal rats, as can be seen from Figure 4C. The average length ofpaper utilized for nest building increased from 700 to 3,500 centimetersdaily, and when provided with paper such rats maintain an almost normal bodytemperature and remain alive. If the hypophysectomized rats are denied paperwith which to build nests, they die within a few weeks after a considerabledrop in body temperature.Additional experiments reveal the action of behavioral regulators inconjunction with a variety of physiological regulators. Parathyroidectomizedrats, unable to regulate their calcium metabolism develop tetany and usuallydie within a few days on a regular diet, but will keep themselves aliveIndefinitely if given access to a solution of calcium lactate, as well as water.When pancreatectomized rats develop diabetes, and are offered carbo-hydrates, fat and proteins in separate containers instead of a mixed diet,they refuse carbohydrates and feed on fat and protein. As a result they losethe symptoms of diabetes - their blood sugar falls to its normal level,they gain weight and eat less food. To assist in eliminating unoxidizedglucose, diabetic rats ingest large amounts of water, but when permittedto omit carbohydrate from their diets, pancreatectomized rats return todrinking normal amounts of water.This is as good a point as any to emphasize that behavioral symptomologyis an equally valuable diagnostic aid in a variety of disease syndromes. 263 Likewise the possibility should not be overlooked that phenomena oftenregarded under the category of perverted appetites such as coprophagy,phicenta 4,:alny,, bone eating, etc. may be Instances of self regulation activl ty .Feces eating and urine drinking is frequently observed in an i mo Isespecially those on deficient diets. There are a number of experiments toindicate that infants and children, like animals, are capable of selecting a balanced diet , if given a free choice of a wide assortment of natural foods.Children with a vitamin D deficiency will voluntarily ingest varyingamounts of cod liver oil if given free access to it.Besides the polydipsia associated with diabetes, there is a markedcraving for salt or food with a high salt content in patients with Addison's disease.Wilkins and Richter (83) have described a 3 1/2 year old boy, withdestruction of adrenal cortical cells, who kept himself alive for more than2 years by eating large amounts of salt orsalted crackers. When admitted toa hospital for hormonal evaluation in connection with another condition,and confined to the regular hospital diet, he soon developed symptoms ofinsufficiency and died. Only after his autopsy was his salteating behaviorpattern revealed.Thus it would appear that apart from its value as a diagnostic aid inknown disease syndromes, behavioral symptomatology often serves as a clue orindicator of lesser known physical disturbances. And apart from these instancesin which physiological or chemical regulators are experimentally removed,it would appear that behavioral, physiological and chemical regulatorsare combined in the normal individual's quest for homeostasis. (See Figure5 for a conceptual model of health based on the individual's capacity fornomeostasis) 264 RIMOGICAL CLOCKS AND ROTHMICIT1ESThe term \"biological cluck\" has been applied to the unknown, underlyingmcchunism or mechanisms responsible for the many biological processes, bothat cellular and multicellular levels of organization in plants and animals,which demonstrate regularly recurring changes or rhythms. These rhythmsmay show a daily, monthly, annual or other recurring pattern of change.Since these rhythms were demonstrated to continue in organisms, even afterthey were deprived of obvious external cues, the organisms were consideredto be capable of keeping time by means of some internal biological clock.(84),.(85),(88).A number of basic properties of biological clocks and rhythms havebeen delineated: 1)External cues such as light and darkness can set the phase of rhythmicprocess, i.e., can alter the time when the process is initiated,but cannot appreciably alter the interval of the clock. One canexperimentally shift the phase so that it begins 3, 6 or 12 hours later,but. once begun it then persists at the normal time interval andsubsequently continues to run at that interval, in phase, under con-stant conditions. 2)Under constant conditions of light, temperature, etc. a so-calleddaily rhythm may run slightly longer or shorter than 24 hours.(They run approximately 24 hours) hence the term circadian (abouta day) rhythm. 3)Light cycles can be altered so that circadian rhythms run as long as27 hours (long days) or as little as 18 hours (short days). Whenthe circadian rhythms are stretched or shortened in this fashion,and the organisms are subject to constant conditions, the rhythmsreturn to their approximate 24 hour interval. In nature, however, INTERNAL.4--ENVIRONMENTI conceptual model illustrating, in part, the interacting fac-tors bask for an understanding of the patient. Helping the student toconceptualize this interaction is one of the challenges to clinicaltraining.Souacz: J.13. Richmond and S. Med. Educ. such rhythmic phenomena are locked or entrained into a 24 hourfrequency by the daily light-dark cycles. 4)CIrcadian rhythm periods are very little affected by temperaturechange, suggesting that the clock itself is independent of blochem-,0-?ical process.A 10orise in temperature might be expected to doubleor triple the rate at which a biochemical system might run, but thetemperature coefficients of circadian rhythm periods are normallyin the range between 0.9 1.2. 5)Another argument against biochemical processes being responsiblefor the internal clock of the organism Is that they are little effectedby a variety of chemical inhibitors. A physiological process might bereduced greatly by the addition of cyanide (metabolism may sinkas low as 5% of normal) but the ,eriod of the rhythm remains stable. 6)Raising organisms under constant laboratory conditions results intheir becoming rhythmic without light cues, or remaining arhythmicuntil subjected to a single, non-periodic stimulus, whereupon theydemonstrate the organ's normal rhythmicity. This indicates that theperiod itself is unlearned, i.e. genetically determined.Investigators of biological clocks are by no means in agreement withregard to all the properties enumerated above. Frank A. Brown, Jr., ,(86)one of the pioneer investigators of biological clocks over several decades,has brought forth evidence to suggest that even under so-called constantlaboratory conditions, organisms are utilizing subtle, rhythmic geophysicalforces to establish the period of the clock itself. Colin S. Pittendrighand others consider that rhythmic perieds.are entirely endogenous, while J.Woodland Hastings and his colleagues are attempting to establish a biochemicalbasis for the clock. Notwithstanding these endeavors at providing an under-lying theory, the fundamental nature of the clock remains unknown. 267 On !he human level both laymen and physicians are familiar with theI.ri IVIluctnaLlons of temperature and fever in both normal Individuals and sickp:Itftn(!;, the rhythms of activity ano sleep, the diurnal and nocturnalwirlatIons In output of urine, the regular occurrence of menstruation, etc.During the past twenty-five years sufficient research and information haveaccumulated to demonstrate the pervasive nature of these clocks throughoutthe biological world, (87),.(89) as well as the highly adaptive nature of therhythmic biochemical, physiological and behavioral processes with which theyare associated. It would not be an exaggeration to say that rhythmic processesare a fundamental characteristic of living things. Both the researcher andthe practicing physician needs to understand that biological processes donot always proceed at a constant rate when studied in the laboratory orhospital under so-called standard, unvarying conditions. Homeostasis itselfis subject to a circadian rhythmicity, and many experimental findings mayprove to be suspect if the investigator fails to. take into account f.he normalcyclic fluctuations which many processes undergo during a given 24 hour period.Medical students should be given an understanding of (1) the kinds ofclocks and physiological fluctuations to be.encountered in both somaticand mental illness, and (2) the ways in which modifications of cyclicbehavior can alter deep-seated physiological and biochemical processes.All clinical and laboratory data, such as body temperature, pulse rate, urineoutput, blood counts, cell division, glucose tolerance, etc. are subject tocircadian and other rhythmic fluctuation in a variety of somatic illnesses.Also, responses to drugs, toxins and pathogens vary according to the pointof the cycle in which they are introduced.In addition to circadian rhythms, some mental patients exhibit 48 hourclocks, and appear to lose their symptoms for a part of this cycle: Richter(90) cites the case .of a schizophrenic patient who showed intense symptomology 268 for a 24 hour period, then became almost normal for 24 hours, then had intense symptoms, etc. Another depressed patient alternated suicidal tendenciesduring one 24 hour period with nearly normal behavior during the next 24 hours.A catatonic-schizophrenic patient may also show regular attacks at20 day Intervals, but while thyroid treatment eliminates the cycleS ofsymptoms, such treatment does not eliminate the patient's catatonic-schizo- phrenic condition. Thus while periodic mechanisms may not be responsiblefor the basic illness, phases of the clock cycles may play a role in theexaggeration, reduction or elimination of symptomology.Other idiosyncrasies of clock-correlated symptomology are evidencedin cases of intermittent hyroarthrosis. In some patients swelling of thejoints occurred at weekly intervals, but in one patient swelling of somejoints reached a peak every Thursday, while other joints swelled every Friday.In still another case the right knee reached a peak of swelling on theaverage of every 10.0 days, while the left knee swelled every 10.6 days. (Figure 7)Richter considers that homeostatic mechanisms, central nervous mechan-isms or peripheral factors may underlie the periodic mechanism of symptom manifestation. Peripheral factors may be operating where different partsof the body are demonstrating different periods, or the same period manifestsdifferent phases in different parts of the body, as in the cases of intermittent hydroarthrosis above. Where the clock mechanism is altered by interferingwith or eliminating the activity of one or more endocrine glands, however, a homeostatic clock may be operating. On the other hand, some clocks appearto remain constant regardless of internal changes within the organism, or environmental changes outside it. The 48 hour clocks of certain mentalpatients mentioned above may fall into this category, and it is believedthat the hypothalamus, as well as other regions of the central nervous system,may harbor clocks of this caliber. 269 LEFT KNEECASE ItC MALEto1,to,so'tou iloIIIIIttr12ItINTERMITTENT HYDROARTHROSISGAR NOV.D,EC.JAN.19056\"11,0*II10,II 212224142.431321331323 MAR.APR.MAYDAYS11,II,11 FEB. 4 Figure 6.Graphic representation of the occurrence and duration of swelling of the right and left knees in a patient with intermittent hydroarthrosis. (After Garrod, 1910) There is also increasing evidence that interference with many normalphysiological processes may result from interference with the behavioralmanifestations of clocks. The sleep-dream cycle is one of the body's basicbehavior cycles. Not only elimination of sleep, but the alteration of itsonset may interfere with a variety of endocrine and metabolic processes.This has become increasingly apparent with the rapid movement of air passen-gers from one time zone to another. A move involving as little as 2-3 hoursof change of time zones, may require several days or a week before ail theinternal physiologic and endocrine processes are recoordinated with the newsleep-activity cycle.Not only is the sleep cycle correlated with various metabolic functions,but it appears that the dream state (D-State) is a normally cyclic phenomenonwithin sleep, characterized by a peculiar activity pattern involving rapideye movement (REM) and a ninety minute cycle of its own. (91) It has beenshown that when sleep subjects are given adequate hours of sleep, but dreaming Is interfered with these subjects become D-State deprived. There is someIndication of mental instability following experimentally Induced dreamdeprivation for 10-15 days. Dream deprived sleep subjects \"make-up\" previousnights of dream deprivation by dreaming for longer periods after severalnights of deprivation. This appears to be especially true of the earlier stagesof the human life cycle. Thus a week old infant will spend over 37 per centof the day inD-state and 25 per cent in the D-state at 6 months of age,while a 20 year old adult will spend 12 per cent of the day in the D-state,and less than 10 per cent dreaming may be shown at 60 years of age. DreamingItself may be a biological need, rather than a chance idiosyncrasy. Hartmannconsiders that the D-state plays an important role in the neurochemicalhomebstasis of the central nervous system. 271 There appears to be a very definite sequence of cycles of sleep, rest,and activity in the newborn infant correlated with alternating periods ofparasympathetic and sympathetic activity in the autonomic nervous system. .There Is a marked change in these sleep and activity cycles over the first2-3 years of life, and a less marked but no less definite change over thefirst 18 years of life. As noted, the D-state occupies a considerable portionof the sleep state of the first two weeks of infant life - as much as 45-65percent of it. The extremely large values of D-time in the neonate and youngchild suggests that it may have an important developmental function, in whichcase interference with early sleep activity cycles in the infant and childmay possibly be correlated with later developmental disturbances. Thisremains to be more fully investigated.Also under investigation is the extent to which periodic bouts of alco-holism, allergies, histamine skin reactions, periods of forgetfullness, stressreactions, etc. may be correlated with biological clock mechanisms.THE BIOBEHAVIORAL BASIS OF HUMAN CHARACTER AND SOCIAL BEHAVIORNotwithstanding the role that fixed motor patterns play in animal socialbehavior, the behavioral scientist is unlikely to recognize any connectionbetween the functions of the human neuromuscular system and the behavioralscience disciplines. The biobehavioral relationships covered thus far aremore apt to be considered a part of human physiology and clinical medicine,rather than of relevance to anthropology, psychology or sociology. Thissection is designed to correct this msconception.Apart from indicating connections between the neuromuscular system,other physiological processes and clinical syndromes, the previous realmsof material should establish facts and principJes capable of altering theway we look at man and human development. To begin with, all organismswith a complex nervous system contain a repertoire of genetically determinedneuromuscular coordinations, or fixed motor patterns, which are subject 272 to evolution.On principle alone, therefore, one would nOt expect that thecntral nervous system of man, evolved from the nervous systems of ancestralvertebrates, mammals and primates should be devoid of such motor patterns.Indeed, embryological, observational, and early development data amply supportthe fact that the human central nervous system contains a wide range of behaviorpatterns which enable the infant to form a relationship with its mother, toengage in emotional interactions and other non-verbal communication, to carryout sequences of locomotion and posture, and to begin manipulating both thephysical and social environment. (92)It is during the intensely biological relationship between the motherand infant that these phylogenetically determined motor patterns are shaped,\"programmed\" or secondarily integrated in each individual. That is to say,the mother plays a crucial role in facilitating, repressing, or even over-exciting these various patterns of response. (93) She is the most directprogrammer of these behaviors. As the child grows, however, the father andvarious siblings, or other members of the extended family also play a rolein shaping these early, primitive animal response patterns. The father (alsovarious grandparents) by his dynamic interaction with the mother alsoinfluences what behaviors of the infant will be supported or suppressed.From the point of view of what is contained in the central nervous system,the infant is phylogenetically_programmed at birti. As a result of utilizingthese specific behavioral interactions with the mother, then other familymembers, the infant's basic neuromuscular responses are secondarily orontogenetically integrated,During the early years of childhood and subsequently, these earlyresponse patterns become the characteristic way in which the child, thenthe adult relates to other people. The child's capacity for intimacy and 273 relatedness, how passive or active the child is in seeking social needs andmaintaining social relationships, the manner in which it handles frustration,anxiety and disappointments, its ability to express emotional responses,its capacity for pleasure and the sharing of pleasure - these are all partof these early response patterns, and form the basis of later social andfamily behavior. The fate or programming of these human fixed motor patternsis central to psychiatry, psychosomatic medicine and the behavioral sciences.Several features of these early mother-infant interactions should be emphasized.First, these early behavior patterns are taking place simultan-eously with the rapid growth occurring during infancy and childhood. Thereis abundant documentation that physiologic modification during active growthmodifies the nature of that growth. Behavioral modification, alwaysinvolves autonomic, endocrine and other physiologic changes i, 4:,.=Ally capable of modifying growth processes, with the result that these ear'',, 1,clviors become anchored in the total somatic changes which are occur,'. .Q at time.The early behaviors are theref-)re \"grown\" into the organism, a.id not merely Learned.There is no separate development of somatic and psychic structure,which pediatricians and child psychiatrists would lead us to believe, but a ,unified integration of behavior with growth processes throughout the life cycle.The several aspects of this early growth cf behavior into the organismwould include a) neural growth - the growth of dendrites, and the synapticknobs and spines (as revealed by recent electron microscopy studies) bywhich inhibiting or excitatory synaptic connections are made in the cortex;b) the influence which_the neuromuscular tonus changes (associated with theinfant's changing attitudes, posture, etc.) exert on the entire skeleton andits growth; and c) the previously mentioned influenCe that these early behaviorsexert on endOcrine, respiratory, biochemical, autonomic and other physiologic 274 processes.The net result is that not only the psyche, but the somaticstructure of the individual is altered by these early behaviors. Thesecharacteristic modes of responding, together with their structural changes,results in the formation of human character structure. (Figure 7), (96).Character structure is the resultant of all the significant behaviorsthat have been integrated in a tharacteristic way during early development.Biologically speaking, it constitutes a phenotypic modification of the neuro-muscular responses of man. Although the oral, anal, and genital functions,as well as early emotional responses, play a preponderant role in this inte-gration, they are not the only motor functions which contribute.to its devel- opment.For example, the early respiratory pattern of the newborn infantis extremely vulnerable to perinatal insult, postnatal trauma and subsequentenvironmental modifications. The psychoanalyst Erikson (94) recognidthis in referring to an initial oral-respiratory-sensory stage of human development.Furthermore, just as Freud linked the psychological traitsof orderliness, frugality and obstinacy to anal character structures, soErikson links such traits as basic trust, shame, doubt, initiative, guilt,a sense of incompetence, confusion, etc., with the outcome of specific behavioral(motor) stages of early development. It is in this psychobioiogical area ofneuromuscular development that the hard-core clinical areas of medicine,psychiatry and the behavioral sciences meet. In a sense Karen Horney (95)recognized this behavior-growth relationship when she spoke of neurosesas being altered forms of growing.Support for this neuromuscular aspect of development may be seen inthe abreactive phenomena which emerge during psychotherapy, when the longforgotten emotions of childhood - aggression, envy, hate, jealousy and loveemerge as intense displays on the motor level. Very early aspects of theseAisreactive phenomena emerge even more intensely when lysergic acid human fixed motor patterns,the mother, family, the social and cultural environment,and the formation of character structure. (After Kramer,1972) Jaris used as an adjunct to psychotherapy. For example, infantilesucking behavior emerges in almost all such patients with such intensitythat therapists have felt compelled to respond to this primitive need byproviding patients with a pillow, a finger, on which to suck. When thisis done, patients frequently recall the nature of their early suckingexperienceswhether pleasurable, frustrating, or unavailable at times oftheir greatest need. Aggressive biting and kicking, or clinging behavioralso emerge, as well as ambivalent patterns of behavior such as aggressivebiting during attempts at a.loving embrace. It would appear that none ofthese early behaviors are actually ever lost from the adult nervous system,if we are to believe the therapeutic responses of patients ranging from 18-54 years of age.Once formed,'adult character structure then provides a) the basis fortho individual, pattern of emotional responses which acts as a mediator ofinterpersonal and family behavior; b) the mechanism through which the socialenvironment influences social behavior; and c) the psychosomatic backgroundfor response to stress, the invasion of pathogenic organisms or other. noxiousagents, to drugs, for convalescence, wound healing, etc.The way in which a given mother prOgrams her infant's fixed motorpatterns is only indirectly influence.? by the culture or subculture towhich she belongs. The ontogenetic programming of the infant and child is ordirectly and specifically the result of her own capacity for related-ness, and her own character stiucture. It is largely through the characterstructure of the parents that the social environment pr culture exerts itsinfluence on the developing infant.and child, as fear as the ilatterning ofits basic responses are concerned. The character structure of the father,the relationship of the father and other members of the extended familyto the mother, and other factors are all capable of influencing what 277 hehavlort; the mother will respond to, facilitate or suppress in the infant.Likewise, the socio-economic, political and technological environment,H Influences family structure and_dynamles, ts also capable offolluenclhg man's biopsychosocial behavior and the formation_of character structure. (96)We have now slipped into the field of human psychodynamics. (97) Atthis biol)gical level, the behavioral relationships which surround the infantand child differ little from the ecodynamic determinants of behavior whichethologists deal with when analysing the evolution of social behavior andorganization in animals. The patterning of early behaviors in the infant and child, character formation, intt.trpersonal behavior, family psychodynamicsand social behavior form a continuum which underlies all social organizationand every culture. (See Figure 8 for a related conceptual model utilizedby the sociologists Gerth and Mills).Lt is these essentially phylogenetic and ontogenetic considerationsof the human neuromuscular system which provide the basic hard data forthe clinical problems with which psychiatrists and psychoanalysts deal.Without a background in evolutionary biolOgy, it is doubtful that psychiatryand the hard-core clinical, areas of medicine will ever be able to communicatewith each other. Although a few anth.!opclogists (98), (99), (100) andsociologists (101) have drawn attention to this'negle red area, .themainstream of behavioral sciem still disregard, both in theory andresearch, the evolutionary aspects of'the human neuromuscular system, itsrole in the formation of character structure and in mediating social behavior.Some indication of the structural aspect of character fOrmation may be gleaned frcim Figure 9. The neuromuscular programming that takes placein the first years of life results on the one hand in an individual patternof emotional responses and social behavior, and on the other in an individ- 278 ORGANISMCharacternyancStructuresmucruRE.

Although we continueto assign disturbances of emotional and social behavior to psychotherapy,and disturbances of movement or posture to physical therapists, these twotherapies have more in common than generally acknowledged.The psychotherapist endeavors to change an individual's attitudes andemotional (neuromuscular and autonomic) responses, and the ultimate successof therapy is based not on how much the patient has learned (an intellectualresponse to therapy is destined for failure), but on the actual alterationo; xis behavior patterns. Gellhorn has pointed out that underlying allpsychic disturbances there exists an alteration of autonomic functions,and suggests that the basic problems of psychotherapy are in this realm.Character analysis and vegetotherapy, a somatic approach which evolvedfrom psychoanalysis, utilizes the relationship existing between neuromuscularpatterns, respiration and other autonomic functions in its system of psycho-therapy. (102) And it is of interest that most psychotherapists will tella patient who has apparently completed his course of therapy, that he willrequire a year or two to \"restructure\" his new insights and behaviors inactual living experience. The physical therapist or training coach startswith a program of movement, and ultimately changes the autonomic functionsand structure of the trainee.The significance of the concept of character structure might be deline-ated from the following,, r similar examples. Some years ago Funkenstein(103) and his coworkets found that two groups of psychotic patients respondedwith a different pattern of blood pressure modification to injection of thedrug mecholyl. These two group: differed in their projective psychological 280 ICHARACTER STRUCTURE INDIVIDUAL NEUROMUSCULAR PATTERNINGDURING EARLY Patterns(Altered Behavior)Altered Autonomic Functions Relation of character structure to psychotherapy andphysical therapy (After Kramer, 1969). test,-;,uheir response to electric shock treatment, etc. Independent psych-iatric evaluation indated that these two groups differed emotionallyone group was generally angry at other people, the other group was usuallydepressed or frightened.Are there similar patterns of emotional difference in normal,: healthy people?While a group of medical students were in a situation of personalemotional stress (awaitin thgdecision of hospitals to their applications:r for internships) they wer injected with mecholyl. Their blood pressureresponses likewise fell into two groups, indicaing that some students wereangry at other people during this period, others'were angry at themselves.After the decisions on internships were made, all students showed similarblood pressure responses to mecholyl. Additional experiments indicated thatstudents who directed their,anger outward had a higher secretion of 'redren- a!in, while those who reacted with depression and anxiety had a higheradrenalin secretion.Although Funkenstein did not describe them in so many words, it seemsclear that he was dealing with roughly two differen, groups of studentsand that t.e different blood pressure responses to the same drug, mecholyl,were due to the students' different character structures, which includenot Ally their emotional and behavioral differences, but their neuroendo- crine and physiologic re9.)onses.At earlier stages of childhood there is a greater tendency to directanger outward, but with age anger tends to bri suppressed or directed towardsself.Hokfelt and West have shown that the ratio of noradrenalin to adren-alin is higher in infants than in older children, who have been subjectedto \"socialization.\" The character structures of the medical students, then,included those that had maintained-their outward-directed responses ofanger, and those tha-hadn't. It: should be noted that the two different 282 character structures failed to show a differential response to mecholyl .under normal circumstances: it was only when these-character structureswere under a stressful situation* that two different cardiovascular res-ponses to the same drug were revealed.The phenomenon of growth --biological growth is the single mostneglected phenomenon in all considerations of man's psychological develop- ment.Behavior and growth are traditionally considered as separate realms,with the result that we have almost completely lost sight of the mutualinteraction of behavior and growth processes throughout the human life cycle.From the moment of conception, any interference with the growth processis capable of modifying individual development. Figure 10 represents aschema to suggest some of the growth-environmental-interactions of the human organism.Except for the presence of certain embryological \"critical periods,\"it may be said that the earlier the interference, the more marked the change in growth.The distinctior1 between prenatal and pos-natal growth moeif-icaticns, of whatever origin (hormonal disturbances, the presence of micro-organisms, the mc.her's use of drugs, or stressfulemotional reactions,etc.) are More apt to be revealed as structural anomalies of the growthprocess, and are considered to fall within the province of the biologist,embryologist, or teratologist.A significant portion of the child's growth processes, however arealso affected postnatally through modification of its behavior in the social *Likewise Brady has shown that electric shock alone will not produce ulcer-ative colitis in rhesus monkeys. When one (\"executive\") monkey is in thestressful situation of making decisions to avoid shock, however, and thedecision-making periods bear,a specific time relationship to the ormalbiological rhythmicity of HC1 secretion, ulcers are produced in the eicec-utive monkey with predictable regularity.

All interference with growth processes is capable of modifying individual development. While the distinction between prenatal and postnai=s1 modi-fication is largely an arbitrary one, the earlier the interference the more marked the change, except forthe presence of certain \"critical periods.\" The earlier the interference, the more evident are the stru-tural changes; the postnatal interferences are more apt to be characterized as \"behavioral disorders.\"disciplinary distinctions for studying this continuum is likewise an arbitrary one, 13;:t the individual*:rur\"Wte''f.amr----196\" environment.This is traditionally the realm of the anthropologist, socio-logist and social psychologist. These behavioral m:d.Zicationa are considered\"psychological\" but are no less physiological and structural. They providethe basis for human character formdtion, which in turn underlies socIabehavior, ana ultimately plays a role in the fluctuating changes in socialstructure.It is puasible, therefore to view all these phenomena as partof the growth-environmental-interaction continuum, rather than as distinctentities which fall within narrow disciplinary considerations.DISCUSSIONThe medical areas with which anthropologists (105) and sociologists(106), (107) have concerned themselves include: 1.How people perceive, cleiine and respond to symptoms or illness.' 2.The relation of age, sex, race, sociueconomic status, and otherfacts to mortality. 3.The social etiology and epidemiology of disease conditions; thesources of stress in social life and the relation between social!stress and illness. 4.The sociology of medical education and the social values of medical students. 5.Practitioner-patient relationships, and-the organization of medical'service and practi'e under various medical systems. 6.The increasing tecnnology and bureaucracy, intraprofessional rivalry,power relationships, decision-making, and other factors that influencehospital, organization and Medical service:. 7.The relationship between the various health agencies in the community. 8.The relationship of social influence, community growth, change andconservatism to public health and preventive medicine. 2g5 9.The relationship of medical policies, politics and economics tothe development of health systems and policies.Medical faculties, administrators and medical organizations have viewed .\u00b1-1-reresults from the first four or five of the above areas with considerable interest.it is not surprising, however., that the insights derived fromthe last-mentioned realms often meet with resistance, even thuugh capableof contributing to the more effective operation of the medical institutions involved.For example, power relationships often so outweig objectiveconsideration of curriculum content that curriculum change is regarded astool for maintaininp or shiting the power quotients of various departments_or individuals.Valuable as all these areas may be to medical problems and services,it can be seen that only items 2 and 3 are relatable to, the functional,physiological processes which medical students focus upon, and which underlie illness.In general, behavioral scientists'olo not make these connections -and most often basic scientists and clinicians assume that since such materialis being covered by behavioral scientists, they can emphasize the biochemical,cellular pathology and symptomology aspects alone. In this way the middlearea of bridging mechanisms is neglected or treated superficially.5 4e behavioral scientists.have been able to provide insights aboutmedical problems, often with minimal training in the biological or physio-logical sciences - even as Skinner with his \"black box\" methodology wasable to develop :.earning theory with no consideration of what takes placein the nervous system of his animals - it might be argued that they neednot support their insights with an understanding of the biobehavioral,mechanisms underlying the processes they examine. This is partly true.After all, the unique characteristic and contribution of the behavioral sciences to, medicine is the ca acit for turnincorrelations or indica- 286 tions of the influence of the social environment on health and illness whenthe biological and physiological mechanisms are still unknown. A little re-ftection, however, will indicate why this is not a valid argument withinthe medical school environment.Part of the difficulty lies in the fact that the sociologist oftenviews human behavior within the framework of human adaptation, learning theory or role theory.' He rarely views behavior from a biological, evolut-ic-iry or developmental perspective. There are exceptions* but in generalthe diverse emphasis of sociologists Ire social-psychological in orientationand very often are opposed to any consideration of psychoanalytic-develop-mental concepts, with the result that biological concepts of development' arc given minor considen,,cior, or are entirely ignored. It is doubtful,for examplo, tha: the role theory corrcept of personality of the sociologistwill e,Yer be acceptable to the psychiatrist. The latter's daily clinicalcalendar throws, him into contact with the ever-present emotional responsesof the interpersonal interactions of his patents.- he cannot deal in \"roles.tNor should he. Emotional reactions enter into every interpersonal or f,*roupinteraction, and the physician focusing on the many psychosomatic aspectsof illness cannot afford to ignore either personality or characterological considerat.,.ms, as well as the emotional responses, of his patients. Atthis. level, at least one group of physicians and behavioral scientistswill talk past or around each other;- rather than to each other. Likewise,*Hans Gerth and C. Wright Mills have endeavored to integrate the biologicalaspects of man, his psychic structure and his social roles under theconcept of character structure, and suggest that social psychologists andsociologists pay more attention to this bio-social entity, in studyingsocial structure than they have in the past. Nevertheless most sociologistsstillthe person primarily as a player of socially determined roles.(See Figure 8 ).Fletcher has also put together a comprehensive modelof the ethological-psychological basis of human nature, and indicatedits implications for sociologIcal theory. 287 most psychologists utilize the learning theory model, rather than a matur-ationaJ-duvelopmental model which the psychiatrist and psychoanalyst rely 'won.( 108)It would therefore be a mistake, even arrogant, to assume that thesociologist or physician-behavioral scientist team can \"teach\" the patientwhat other educational and social institutions have failed to do. Thisassumption is inherent in the endeavor of so many behavioral scientiststo substitute an educational model for a medical model, especially whendealing with the mentally ill. Indeed, this sometimes leads medical studentsto view the activities of behavioral scientists as a threat both to theirprolessional roles and to the organization of medical institutions. Socialscientists have' done much to remove the myth of the omnipotent physician,but omnipotent behavioral scientists will not replace them. What is requiredis an expanded clinical model which will take into account the importantsocial processes which behavioral scientists can clarify for us. To do thiseffectively, medical students require a biological link which relatesphysiological and biochemical events in the organism to the social environ- ment.That link can best be provided by the biobehavioral events whichenter into the responses which are part of every interpersonal and socialinteraction. (109)Purportedly, the behavioral sciences are being introduced into themedical curriculum to enable medical students and future physicians to dealwith the psychological and sociological aspects of human health and illness.Many of today's medical students are expressing a desire to deal moreadequately with the social environment as it relates to health, but for allpractical purposes the average medical student will have little or noappreciation of the biological mechanigms acted on by the biochemical andcellular systems he normally focuses upon from the viewpoint of functional 288 biology.Chalke (110) also emphasizes that a greater contribution frombiology is required in the science of \"behavior.\"The neuromuscular system is the behavioral system of man. Itt'onlythrough movement that the human \"mind\" can communicate with other minds.Except in instances of nutritional deficiency, or in terms of environmentalpollution, the social environment does not exert a direct action on the biochemical and physiologic processes within the individual. Whatever thesocial environment's influence on man's physiologic systems, it accomplishesindirectly by acting on man's behavioral system. It is largely this factwhich provides the evolutionary and continuing basis for man's capacityto be the social animal that he is. When interpersonal or family relation-ships are disrupted, It is largely to processes at this primitive, biologicallevel of behavior that the psychiatrist turns for an understanding of whathas gone wrong -- processes begun with the extended mother-infant relation-ship and initiated long before the child acquires a verbal language.These processes play a central role in human development, and result,through the social repression of behavior in the development of humancharacter structure - a phenotypic modification of the neuromuscular system of man.Without this behavioral modification of each individual, human socialsystems, as we know them today, would not be possible.It is this behavioral system which has shown itself to be capableof influencing all the physiological, functional processes of the hard-core:clinical areas of medicine. It is this behavioral system which lies atthe heart of those psychodynamic constructs with which the so-called soft-core areas of psychiatry and psychoanalysis deal. And this behavioralsystem, through the operation of human character structure, provides theunderpining for human social systems and the institutions about which anthro-pologists and sociologists have something to tell us. If the information 289. explosion in the biological medical and behavioral sciences supports thisviewpoint, and I believe it does, then the medical curriculum can no longerafford the fragmented approach to the study of behavior which has traditionally preva fled Iknow a number of very capable medically oriented behavioral scientists0who will reply to the above by saying: \"It's not necessary that these bio-behavioral mechanisms be taken into account for us to teach behavioralscience or sociological concepts effectively to medical students. Give meas block of time - say 80, or 120 hours in one year, 20 or 30'hours in anotheryear, and we will effectively channel the future physician's orientationalong biosocial lines.\" Even if this statement were true (and we will notknow the answer to this until physicians have effectively changed the patternof medical care, the distribution of medical services, etc.) can we affordto simply add blocks of time to the existing curriculum? Just as therehas been an explosion of knowledge in the behavioral sciences, so therehas been an information explosion in biology and in medicine itself. Programsin rehabilitative medicine, community medicine, cardiovascular and stroketherapy, surgery, etc. have also witnessed tremendous developments in knowledgeand techniques, and are also requiring more time in the curriculum. Wecannot solve this problem by simply adding blocks of time to what manystudents and faculty already consider to be an overburdened curriculum.\"The tendency to.expand the medical school curriculum by accretiondoes not seem rational,\" writes Richmond, (111) Dean of the College of Medi-cine at the.Stete University of New York at Syracuse. The material in thebiobehavioral curriculum outlined herein could be presented in 18-20 hours.One would prefer that it be woven into an interdisciplinary course (includingbasic, behavioral and clinical sciences) designed to provide a conceptualmodel of the nature of the human organism. A comprehension of the roots 290 of human behavior should provide the medical student with self-knowledgeof his own biological, psychological, and social nature. (111a)A considerable amount of curriculum change has already taken placein medical schools throughout the United States during the past decade. Itis generally recognized that many curriculum changes are ultimatelydetermined by departmental territoriality and power quotients. (112) Evenwhere interdisciplinary courses are organized by groups, it frequentlyhappens that the habits associated with departmental and disciplinaryautonomy carry over to the interdisciplinary groups. Little wonder, then,that behavioral scientists are requesting, and receiving, departmentalstatus and a valid share in the decision-making that enters into curriculum change.There is some tendency to avoid these power disputes by appointingsuch interdisciplinary groups directly under the dean of the college, but itIs still difficult for such groups to function without the cooperationof the departments.One can hardly avoid the conclusion then that departmental statusis required to provide behavioral scientists with a setting conducive totheir growth and integration within the medical school. (113) Tyler (114)has noted that while most efforts to rebuild the curriculum show greatpromise for a while, they are generally abandoned after five or ten years.\"This is largely due,\" he notes, \"to the institutions failure to make thosechanges in its structure and functioning that will support and promote,rather than oppose, a dynamic process of curriculum development.\" Withoutsuch changes, the energy involved in new curriculum undertakings diminishesand the effort itself ceases.Granted that behavioral science teaching is desirable, and that behav-ioral science departments are required, such departments as have been formed 291 in medical schools deserve closer examination. One glaring deficiency ofsuch departments is that behavioral science is being interpreted along thetraditional Lines of the disciplines of psychology, sociology and anthropology.bioiogIcal approach to behavior as represented by ethology, is generallyabsent, as is the anthropological, ethological, psychological and experimentalapproach to exciting developments in the field of primate social behavior.Another tendency is for such departments to be either largely anthropo-logic-sociologic, or psychologic in personnel and orientation. Unfortunatelybehavioral scientists, like neurophysiologists or clinicians, feel morecomfortable with personnel of their own kind. Perhaps future departmentswill include one or more biologically oriented or trained behavioralscientists.One function of existing behavioral science departments willundoubtedly be to train anthropologists and sociologists with a strongerbackground in human biology. In recognition of this need, a cooperativedevelopment currently initiated between the liberal arts college and medicalfaculty at Stanford University involves the formation of an undergraduatedepartment of human biology. Those majoring in human biology will go onto take graduate study in anthropology, psychology, sociology, medicine, law, etc.It is anticipated that graduates in diverse, but now increasinglyrelated disciplines, will share a common base of understanding about humandevelopment and behavior.When Grantly Dick Reed finally won approval for his method of naturalchildbirth, he discovered that his problems were by no means over. Obstetricand pediatric nurses were so set in their ways that they interfered at allstages with the processes and aftermath of the natural childbirth method.He concluded that if his methods were to be made widely effective he wouldhave to train his own \"natural childbirth nurses.\" Similarly, new curriculafor the training of medical anthropologists, sociologists and clinical 292 psychologists will have to be encouraged and explored.Yet another outcome of such behavioral science departments, or effortsas exist, is that when a given behavioral science or interdisciplinary courseis examinedthe psychiatrists are presenting a maturational-developmentalmodel of psychodynamics, the psychologists are presenting a learning theory-behavioral reinforcement model, and the sociologists a role-theory model.Such a course might better be described as \"multi-disciplinary\" rather thaninterdisciplinary. But whatever the appellation, students are often presentedwith conflicting models of human development and behavior and required tochoose between them or hopefully integrate them. \"Basic to the practiceof medicine,\" write Richmond and Lustman, \"is a comprehensive view of the humanorganism and its relationship to the internal and external environment.\"Needless to say, these separate models do not offer the student any suchcomprehensive view of.the human organism.It is clearly the faculty's responsibility to develop and encouragea comprehensive clinical model and to build a curriculum around it. I havefrequently noted at conference workshops that such a model often emergesspontaneously after a day or two of the most conflicting discussions. Withinthe confines of a medical school, however, where knowledge generally takesa second or third place compared with department territoriality and indiv-idual power quotients, the difficulty in working out such a model is, alwaysconsiderably greater.The incorporation of behavioral science and biobehavioral knowledgeinto the medical curriculum will undoubtedly mean that the disproportionof molecular-cellular time in the,curriculum will have to be curtailed -even as the heralded place of anatomy in the curriculum has given way to the growth of other contributions to medical practice. The structure of 293 the medical school will also come in for change, but probably not untilpresent day medical students, who will shortly make up future medical schoolfaculties, will be prepared to make, and feel both secure and effective with,those changes.Historically, behavioral scientists were often brought into medicalschools under the support of departments of psychiatry. This had two draw- backs.First, over two thirds of existing members of the hard-core clinicaland basic science departments have negative attitudes towards psychiatry as a-scipline, and second the knowledge and techniques of behavioralscience are more broadly applicable to medical problems in general, ratherthan confined to psychiatry. Following this dilemma, we are seeing two new trends emerge. Departments of pediatrics are showing increasing interestin Incorporating behavioral scientists into their teaching and research activities.It is doubtful that this departmental utilization of behavioralscientists will prove any more feasible than that attempted by psychiatry.Furthermore, one suspects that pediatricians, who only rarely show a capacityfor cooperative activities with child psychiatrists, are endeavoring toutilize behavioral science approaches in place of those of child psychiatry.This could only result in a more fragmented, rather than unified medicalcurriculum.We need new conceptual models, not the discarding of older butvalid knowledge and methods. (115)Another development that would narrow the necessary contributions ofbehavioral science to medical schools is the growing number of new depart-ments of community health and medicine. Since federal support for theactivities of such departments is generally contingent on the utilizationof behavioral scientists, a tendency will be to incorporate behavioralscientists into such departments, and to look upon their presence in thecommunity area as fulfilling their functions in medicine. In my opinion 294 this would I)a mistake while community health faculties and teaching willrequire the cooperation of behavioral scientists, one might legitimatelyquestion their narrow confinement to this one aspect of medicine, and theirsubordinationto clinicians.An historical perspective is also useful in considering the changeswith which medical schools are now faced. Every advance in medical knowledgeand skills has ultimately acted as a brake or hindrance to the next advance.Pasteur's germ theory of the origin of disease, together with Koch's postulatesled first to the development of the science of bacteriology, then to immun-oiogy, which put medicine itself on a scientific basis. Nevertheless, thegerm theory of disease played a role in resistance to the theories and dem-onstrations by Manson, Ross and Grassi supporting the mosquito- vector trans-mission of malaria. Residues of \"germ theory\" interfere even today withdevelopments supporting the contribution of emotional factors to illness,chronic degenerative diseases and psychosomatic disorders. Virchow's cellularpathology initially contributed to the advance of medicine, but also preventedmany physicians from seeing their patients as whole persons - patients whose\"psyche\" could contribute as much to disabilities as germs and cellularpathology.While the 1925 Flexner report did much to create medical schoolsof scientific excellence, and a necessary research orientation with eventualfulltime basic science departments in microbiology, biochemistry, etc.,that very \"scientific excellence\" and basic science strength has distorted the medical curriculum. Whereas pestilential, viral and bacterial diseasesprevail in underdeveloped countries, degenerative illnesses are responsiblefor the majority of deaths in medically advanced countries. Somehow society'smost pressing health problems were overlooked in the shift from the anatomicaldissection to the biochemical analysis of man.I have suggested that the development of the biological basis of medicine 295 w111.11thc Flexner Report win.; narrowly confined to thc othor hall -cvoltithlology 'd.flat faloaf may be better than none, but knowledge of halfof man's biology can never provide an adequate basis for medical practice.Nor should it be overlooked that the most fundamental advances in medicinehave been derived from increments and refinements of knowledge in humanbiology. (116) The practice of what is euphemistically referred to as\"humanistic medicine\" will not cupe with this situation. Only a return to, the totn1 i ty of human biology will do so.SUMMARYThis paper outlines the need for a biobehavioral curriculum to bridgethe behavioral science role in medicine. It points out the fallacy ofutilizing functional biology as a basis of medical practice, to the almostcomplete exclusion of evolutionary biology. It further suggests that nosimple addition of behavioral science time in the curriculum will solve thelarger problem which medicine faces today namely, the development of acomprehensi ve view, or expanded clinical model of the human organism, whichincorporates a behavioral science understanding of man.A knowledge of the phylogenetic and ontogenetic aspects of the neuro-muscular system, which lies at the heart of the mother-infant relationship,is essential for an understanding of the phenotypic modification of man which istermed character structure. A biologic understanding of character structureis in turn necessary (a) for establishing a bridge between the functional,biological processes normally emphasized in the curriculum and the behavioral sciences, and b) for bridging the continuing rift between the hard-coreclinical areas of medicine, and the soft-core areas of psychiatry andpsychoanalysis.Relevant materials may be drawn from the areas of a) ethological re-search. and concepts; b) the prenatal human behavicr; 296 v)the postnatal neuromuscular maturation Infant and child; d)neuromuscular aspects of emotional behavior; e) the role of emotions inmaturation and development; f)the interrelationships of behavior, metabolismand physiology, as well as the shared homeostatic and heterostatic functionsof behavior and the autonomic nervous system; and g) the interrelationshipsof biological clocks, rhythms and behavior.An adequate curriculum is but one of the formidable problems whichmedicine faces. Existing medical school structure has not been able to copewith the information explosion in the biological, behavioral or medical sciences.Some Implications and comments regarding the introduction ofbehavioral sclentists, the formation of behavioral science departments,etc., Into medical schools, are also discussed. 297 REFERENCESIntroduction:1.

Center for Health Services Research andDevelopment contracted with the American Sociological Association toundertake a study for teaching behavioral sciences in schools of medi- eine.The original scope of the study was designed to include anthro-pology, psychology, and sociology. During the second year of the studythe sponsor decided to expand the scope of interest to include behavior-al biology, economics, and political science. The author agreed to pre-pare a position paper on the teaching of economics in schools of medi- cine. The National. Center for Health Services Research and Developmentrequested that the author complete six specific tasks. The first threetasks arc general and serve to outline the scope of the position paperon the teaching of economics in schools of medicine. Specifically, theauthor was requested to (a) draft a model curriculum for the teaching ofeconomics in schools of medicine; (b) rank the content of the curriculuminto categories of essential, desired, and specialized; and (c) discussthe rationale for the selection of content and its ranking.The remaining tasks were presumably designed to coordinate the con-sideration of economics with the specific study for teaching behavioralsciences in schools of medicine. The contractor developed a self-studyprotocol and seven medical schools agreed to participate in the studyby undertaking a self-study of the Behavioral Science Program at their 313 j school.The self-study was designed to include consideLation of the be-havioral science program in terms of its social and historical context, t(,auhinp, activities, staffing and facilities, objectives of the prow'am, an evaluation of the program and a variety of other relevant considerations. The fourth specific request was for (d) a disucssion Pfsections of the self-study protocol insofar as they impinge upon theproposed content and procedures.Next the sponsor asked that the author (e) discuss the proposedcurriculum relative to the curricula which, to his knowledge, iscurrently offered in medical schools. The author'syrior knowledge waslimited to an exceedingly small sample of medical schools and individ-uals who taught courses in medical schools. Fortunately, the projectstaff of the general study had undertaken a survey of course offeringsof medical schools in the United States and Canada. The project directorprovided the author with a list of schools which specifically mentioncourses involving economics in some-form.Finally, the author was asked to (f) correlate his paper whereappropriate with a recent statement of the Economics Panel of theBehavioral and Social Science Survey. This statement was published as'.nomics: Behavioral and Social Science Survey by Prentice-Hall in 1970. introduction-Economics is the science of scarcity. The relevance of economicsderives from the fact that on the one hand productive resources are ex-ceedingly scarce while on the other hand the of men and societyare virtually unlimited. 314 Even the most affluent society is faced with the basic economicprohl0m 01 how to allocate scarce resources. What goods and services :;hould he produced? Which members of society should receive what goodsand services?These questions are serious ones because the .choices are real ones.A society can choose from among alternative allocations of resources.A society can choose to have more of certain goods and servicesand less of other goods and services. And a society can choose to alterthe pattern of distribution of the goods and services produced over itsmembers and/or over time. These choices are relevant at virtually all levels of, aggregation. The magnitude of the problem is different but thenature of the problem is the same.Productive resources are usually classified as land, labor, and capital.Land includes all those resources which are found in a natural state; laborincludes any human effort; and capital is any produced means of production,that is, anything that is used in the production pro-less that itself wasproduced at an earlier stage.in any context, these resources are limited. In any context, we needto concern ourselves with how much we get from using up scarce resources.In a general sense we have to be concerned with which and how many of thewantsolmen and society are satisfied by a particular allocation of re- sources.in the last analysis our objective is to use resources in such away that we get the most out of them is terms of the satisfaction of wants.The United States is a relatively affluent society and has an envi-able endowment of resources. In rather rough orders of magnitude theamount of land as a resource in the United States can be approximated fromits 3 million square miles. The labor force of the United States: is. 315 approximately 80 million persons. The capital stock of this country, the.produced means of production, the machinery, buildings, inventories, andthe like, is something in the order of 2 to 3 trillion dollars. But eventhis endowment of resources is scarce relative to the collective wantsof the 200 million plus members of the population of the country. Theprevailing allocation of these resources generates an output of goodsand services with a market value of approximately $1,000 billion. Thisoutput represents the greatest absolute and per capita level of pro-duction attained in the history of the world--yet consider the unsat-isfied wants in this nation.This is a rather simplistic overview of the economy of the nationbut ii does serve to outline the framework-of the concern of economics.The resources of the nation are limited. The nation is faced with aseries of choices. The most obvious question is whether or not theexisting allocation of resources is the appropriate one to produce theparticular mix of goods and services being produced. If an alternativeallocation of resources would allow for an increase in output then theprevailing allocation is an inappropriate one.A somewhat more complex question is whether or not the prevailingmix of goods and services is the most desirable mix. Would the societybe better off in some sense if the mix of output were characterized bymore of certain goods and services and less of other goods and services?An even more complex question is whether the present pattern ofdistribution of goods and services among the members of the populationis an appropriate one. Would the society as a whole be better off insome sense if a redistribution among the individual members of the 316 society took p] ace.The first two questions refer to the relative efficiency of theallocation of resources. The last question refers to the equity of thedistribution of the produce of those resources.Al] of these questions are relevant as. well for the health servicessector of the economy. In fact, a significant proportion of the nation'sscarce resources are employed to produce health services.in fiscal 1970 the aggregate national health expenditures were some $67.2 billion. This represented some 7.0 percent of the market value oftotal outputthe Cross National Product. Health care expenditures havebeen rising dramatically in recent years. Expenditures in_fiscal 1970 weretwo-and-one-half times greater than they were in fiscal 1960 and five timesgreater than they were in fiscal 1950. The growth in the relative share ofhealth care expenditures has been equally dramatic. In fiscal 1950 healthcare expenditures represented some 4.6 percent of Gross National. Product,in Fiscal 1960 they were some 5.3 percent of GNP, at present they exceed 7 percent of GNP.Giver) the volume of the nation's scarce resources employed, theallocation of resources to and within the health care sector should be ofsignal concern. Is the present allocation of resources to the health caresector an appropriate one? Could we get the same.output of health servicesfor less resources, or-could we get more health services for the sameresources, are alternative ways to phrase the question. If the answer tothese questions is yes, then the existing .allocation of resources is clearlyan inappropriate one.Of course, in general, consumers do not want health services per se, 317 the real want is for better health. Medical care or health services aredesired only in as much as they contribute to the satisfaction of a morebasic want_Is the prevailing mix of goods and services in the health caresector the most desirable mix? Would the society be better off in some sense if the mix were characterized by more of certain goods- and servicesand less of others? Could we have the same health with fewer resources ifwe had more outpatient visits and less hospital inpatient days, for ex-ample?A related question, of course, is would society be better off if therewere more or better housing and nutrition and less health services?Finally, of course, there is the most complex question of whetherthe society would be better off in some sense if the health services wereredistributed among the individual members or groupswithin the population.These questions are not unique to health.care, of course. In a basic-ally market-economy the allocation of resources is generally left to theinteraction of buyers and sellers in the market place. External interventionis required when society decides that the pattern of distribution is in-appropriate.External intervention is also allowed for when the allocationof resources is quite inappropriate.Each time a particular good or service is produced some of the scarceresources are used up. The production of more of one good implies that lessof some other good can be produced since the resources used for the onecannot be available for the other. Hence, the \"cost\" of any good or serviceis appropriately described as-the foregone opportunity of using the resourcesto something else--the \"opportunity cost.\" This, in the jargon ofeconomics, is the supply side of the problem of resource allocation.On the demand side, consumers go into the market with purchasing power 318 to express their preferences for certain goods and combinations of goods.In elivri, the purchasing power ol COntiuMerS represents their \"command\"over resources. By expreHsing their willingness to purchase a particulargood, consumers indicate the \"value\" to them of the resources used in theproduction of that good.This is the general framework of the market solution to the researchallocation problem. Since the basic objective is to utilize resources insuch a way that we get the most out of them in terms of the satisfaction ofwants, a reasonably well working market can do a reasonably good job of allocating resources. The profit motive Hugger:its that producers will try to maximizethe difference between what consumers are willing to pay for their pro-ducts and what they in turn have to pay to acquire the resources to pro-duce these products. It seems reasonable to expect that consumers, on theother hand, will purchase those products which tend to maximize their sat-isfaction.This interaction will tend toward a balancing of opportunitycost and value in consumption. Since opportunity cost reflects re-source scarcity and value in consumption reflects want satisfactiOn sucha balance is appropriate.This is admittedly a somewhat simplistic overview of the'process butit does serve to point up quite well the special relevance of concernfor resource allocation in the health field and the importance of thescience of scarcity for medical education.Staying with the simple overview, what happens when there is noprofit motive acting as an incentive to producers to minimize the oppor-tunity cost of their output? What happens when the consumer is not 319 r(!ally able to judge the capacity of a product to contribute to his want :;athiraction?Row is opportunity cost to be compared with value inconsumption?How indeed is the problem of resource allocation to hesolved?A consideration of the central role of the physician in the de-cision making process in the health sector suggests that he has a criticalroll to play in solving the problem of resource allocation.Hospital care is by far the largest single industry in the health care sector.In 1970 expenditures on hospital care were some $25.6 billion.Totai employment in the hospital care industry was 2.6 million or some3.3 percent of the total civilian labor force in the United States, Some-thing in excess of $36 billion of capital was also employed in the hospit- al industry.Decisions invloved in the production of hospital serviceshave significant implications for resource use.Physicians do not make all the decisions regarding the production ofhospital services but they do make many with significant implications.The decision to hospitalize or not to hospitalize is usually within thecontrol of a physician. The length of stay is generally decided by the physician.Since the physician usually determines the treatment sodalitya variety of decisions that directly affect resource use are under hisdirect control. Do physicians take resource use or opportunity cost into account?In some cases perhaps they do, in many cases there is evidencethat they do not. Would the physician make the same decisions concerninghospitalization, length of stay, and treatment modality if he were aware of the opportunity, .cost of his decisions? This seems a reasonable question.Physicians' services is the second largest component of national 320 health expenditures. In 1970 some $12.9 billion was spent on physicians' services,1n addition to the physician manpower employed in this industrydirectly, just under 200,000, nonphysician employment was almost 300,000,and $7.5 billion is a conservative estimate of the capital employed byphysicians in the provision of physicians' services. -Obviously thephysician makes decisions with significant resource use implications in Isis own practice, What tasks do physicians perform? What tasks do non-physicians perform? Should the production of physicians' services be more labor intensive? More capital intensive? Perhaps the physician pays moreattention to opportunity costs in the context of his own practice, but doeshe pay close enough attention?The physician has a central role in the decision making process thataffects resource allocation in other parts of the health services sector as well.The drug industry and nursing home care are obvious examples.The size of the health care sector, the proportion of the nation'sresources devoted to the production of health services,.. the special natureof much of the sector, and the central role of the physician in thedecision making process taken together suggest that physicians should bemuch more aware of the problems of resource allocation. The science ofscarcity should be an integral part of the education of physicians. Economics in the Medical CurriculumThe primary purposes of this paper were to draft a model curriculum,rank the content of that curriculum in terms of priorities, and discussthe rationale for the content and its ranking. Actually, each of thesetasks was begun in the previous section. In this section we shall out- 321 line and identify more specifically the concepts and applications ofeconomics that would be appropriately included in the medical curriculum. In tIunext section we shall attempt to rank the content in terms of thepriorities of inclusion and further develop the rationale for the in-clusion of economics in the medical curriculum.This is obviously not intended to be treatise on economic theory.Rather, we will Aly attempt to present a broad overview of the relevant concepts.In a sense this is more a glossary of relevant terms.Every graduate of medical school should be exposed to the generalconcepts of economics and should be made aware of the implication of theeconomics of medical care or health services. Many entering medical studentshave had prior formal academic exposure to the discipline of economics, afew have had courses or seminars that involve the application of economicsto medical care and health care problems. Medical schools ought to makeprovisions for those students without priorexposure to gain exposure duringtheir medical education.A model curriculum would build upon a base of a formal introductionto the haste concepts of economics. Economics is concerned with the allocation of scarce resources. Because the resources are scarce a numberof choices have to be made. Decisions to t:llocate resources involve choicesamong alternatives. The decision to produce one good implies the resourcesare not available to produce alternative goods. The next best alternativeforegone is the real cost of production--the opportunity cost. These areall fundamental concepts.Supply and demand are familiar terms. Students should learn thetheories of production and consumption. Of particular concern should be 322 the concept of alternatives in production and consumption. in most casesthere are a number of different ways to produce a particular good or Service.There are substitution. possibilities in production. Capital canbe substituted for labor, skilled labor can bL substituted for unskilledlabor, and so forth. The choice of production technique should reflect therelative scarcities of different resources. There are also substitutionpossibilities facing the consumer.The interaction of supply and demand, the theory of markets, is basicmaterial for economic analysis. Market imperfections and market failureswill probably be of particular Interest to medical. students concerned withthe broader social aspects of medicine.Economic efficiency has a particular significance. Often economicefficiency is confused with technical efficiency by the uninitiated.Efficiency in production requires that resources are allocated in such away that no change could result in an increase in the output of any oneproduct without a decrease Ln the output of at least one other product.Efficiency in exchange (consumption) requires that goods and services aredistributed in such a way that no change could result in any one personbeing made better off without at least one other person being made worse off.Overall efficiency requires not only efficiency in production andexchange but further that the opportunity cost of producing each good isequal to its value in consumption. lfiese are the basic concepts of economics. A course in basic eco-nomic principles should be at the core of a model curriculum. A number ofadditional blocks can be added to the base. One such block that is ofimmediate concern would be the application of the basic 'concepts to the 323 health care suctor.The decision to allocate resources to health implies the decis onnut lo allocate resources elsewhere. Bence to increase the allocation ofresources to health is to decrease the allocation of resources to education,housing, or other sectors. The opportunity cost of more health will be lesseducation, less housing, or less of something.The same is the case for allocations within the health sector. If moreresources are to be used for the provision of acute care less resources willIse available for the provision of chronic care, and so forth. The oppor-tunity cost of an additional day of stay for maternity cases may well be asomewhat lower level of intensive care for cardiac cases, and so forth.Much can be done with the application of supply and demand to thehealth sector. The supply of medical care affords many substitutionpossibilities in production. The substitution of various types of medicalmanpower within the production process is a.favorite example but there aremany others.Outpatient care, home care, and visits to a physician's officecan be substituted for inpatient care in certain cases, for a furtherexample. What are the factors that affect the demand for medical care? Oneof the most obvious with a timely implication for public policy is insurance.The theory of markets can contribute significantly to an under-standing of the health care sector. What is the market for medical care?How does this market function? Actually, the health care sector is com-po3ed of a number of markets, many of which are interrelated.If anything characterizes the health care sector in an economic sense 324 itis the number of market imperfections and the magnitude of market Failures.Recognition of the existence of market imperfections and Failures and more especially an awareness of their implications can providea significant-insight to the problems of the sector.How efficient is the health care sector? In what ways might the level of efficiency be raised? These are the questions that. matter in the last anaylsis.An application of the basic concepts of economics to the health caresector can provide the Medical student with a stimulating educational experience.it would also increase his capacity to perform within the system.another block in a model curriculum would be a course whichsystematically analyzed the economic structure of the health care sector.Such a course would parallel the industry studies of the sub-discipline ofeconomics known as industrial organization. The major industries within the health sector could be studied in depth. In essence this carries theapplication of economics to the health care sector somewhat further. Insuch a course it is possible to analyze the structure, conduct, and per-formance of the major industries within the sector--in effect an applicationof the basic principles of economics in more depth and in more detail.3ecause the study of markets and market behavior is central to eco-nomics, market imperfections and market failures have concerned economists for some time. The field of public finance is a well developed sub- discipline.External intervention to correct imperfections or to overcomemarket failures is a primary concern of the field of public finance.Public health certainly implies a public role in the health field. 325 When public health was essentially concerned with sanitation and theniniectious diseases the public role was more limited. In recent yearstho public role has been expanded to include concern with the production,delivery, and financing of personal health services. This expanded publicrole was undoubtedly stimulated in large part by the number and magnitudeof market imperfections and market failures within the health care sector.lhis aspect of the economics of health services suggests additional blocksin a model curriculum.Health Planning is an area of concern that has recently received support from many quarters. From an economic point of view planning is an alternativeto the market as a mechanism for allocating resources. A major problem that planners must overcome is the lack of market information in the form of pricesto reflect opportunity' costs of resources and values of goods in consumption.Cost-benefit analysis has been around longer than health planning, but it is all important planning tool. Essentially cost-benefit analysisis designed to serve as a criterion for-resource allocation. The object isto identify and measure the costs and benefits of a particular program.Programs can then be ranked by the excess of benefits over costs forresource allocation decisions. Unfortunately, programs which are usuallysubjected to cost-benefit analysis are those which are to be undertakenbecause the market is incapable of providing the particular good or service.This means that in most cases the need for the analysis is coincident withthe lack of required information to complete it. But the resource allocationdecisions have to be made. Choices have to be made anc cost-benefit analysiscan be a valuable input to the decision making process.In the past health programs (and other programs as well) were all too 326 often continued without any systematic attempt to determine their worth- whileness.In the last few years funding agents, particularly theFederal Government, have made it clear that evaluation of health programswas relevant and presumably would be considered in the funding process,which is after all a resource allocation decision process.Taken together these several blocks can serve as a model curriculum.First, an introduction to the basic principles of economics. Second, ageneral application of economics to the health care sector. Third, ananalysis.ef the economic structure of the health care sector. Fourth, aseries of applications of economic analysis specific to the public role inthe health care sector. Curriculum Content: Ranking and RationaleAL this point we must practice what we preach. It may be tempting tosimply conclude that all four blocks outlined above are important and oughtto by required in the curriculum, but the time of medical students is ascarce resource and it too must be allocated efficiently.Perhaps the optimal solution would be to make each of these fourblocks nvnilable in the curriculum, explain -the relative importance of each to the student, and let him balance the opportunity cost against the valuein consumption. Be that as, it may, we have been- asked to rank the curriculum contentas \"essential,\" \"desired,\" and \"specialized.\" These are somewhat arbitraryterms but the.intent of the request is.clear enough. As a first approxi-mation we would classify an introduction to the basic principles of eco-nomics as \"essential.\" It is certainly essential in the sense that each 327 of the other parts of the model curriculum build upon it.A general application of economics to the health care sector wouldhe our second order of priority. It is most likely that most medical studentswould Find this a stimulating edUcational experience. Further, the pri-mary payoff of including economics in the medical curriculum may derivefrom this source.For a number of years we have offered a seminar that deals in gen-eral with the economics of health care. Among the participants haveusually been a number of physicians and medical students. The firstsession of the seminar is designed to deal with the goals and objectivesof the health care system. The medical participants often respond with,\"the highest quality medical care for anyone who needs it,\" usually im-plicit and occasionally explicit is the qualification, \"whatever the cost.\"As the seminar progresses, and the concept of scarcity is discussed,and it becomes obvious that the decision to allocate resources to healthimplies the decision not to. allocate resources elsewhere or that theopportunity cost of an additional day of hospitalization for one patientmay be nonhospitalization of another patient, there is a marked change inthe medical participants' perspective. Given the central role of thephysician in the decision making process in the health sector, such achange in perspective is probably desirable.The remaining two blocks are somewhat specialiZed. A select groupof medical students might desire to pursue the application of economicsto the health sector somehwhat further. A course which offers an indepth and detailed analysis of the economic structure of the health caresector should be available for them. The author has offered such a 328 course for the past few years that is taken primarily by physicians and medical students. In fact it has been possible (necessary) to combinethe introduction to basic economic principles with an analysis of the economic structure of the health care sector in a one semester course.The results have been encouraging and the student reaction is quite favoralrge.The final block, a series of applications of economic analysisspecific to the public role in the health care sector, is of specialinLerest to those students who intend to pursue careers outside thetraditional private practice of medicine. Certainly those who intend toenter the field of public health will have an interest, but so too willthose who intend to pursue careers in a -fariety of areas for whichhealth planning, health evaluation, and the like will be more relevant. Economics and Medical Education and the Self-Study ProtocolThe self-study outline was presumably devised to provide a formatfor a systematic response specific to a single program. Thus, at oneextreme, one could take thr position that there are no sections of theprotocol that are relevant for a general discussion. At the otherextreme, it would be equally appropriate p'rhaps for one to take theposition that since any given medical school could theoretically beasked to complete the same self-study for the teaching of economicseach section of the protocol is relevant. For present purposes there issomething to be gained by taking an intermediate position. 329 Table 1 Self-Study OutlineBehavioral Science Programs in Medical Schools IOverview of Behavioral Science Program IISocial and Historical Content of the Behavioral Science Program IIICurrent Teaching ActivityIVCurrent Staff and Facilities V.Formal and Informal Objectives of the Behavioral Science Teaching VIIllustratire Learning Experiences VIIEvaluation VIIIAdditional Descriptions of Your Teaching XIPreparatior of this Self-Study XIISupporting Documents 329a No attempt will be made to respond in kind to each item withi the com- plete outline.Rather, it should serve the presQnt purpme to provide anormative response to the general outline.In general the basis for the following response assumes that the gen-eral principles presented in the introduction and the model curriculumoutlined are accepted as appropriate. The specific course material re-ferred to in the response is essentially that offered by the author andothers and available to and taken by a number of medical students andphysicians. (I)Overview of Economics Program:Every graduate should be exposed to the generalconcepts of economics and should be made aware of theimplication of the economics of medical care or healthservices.Since the model curriculum builds upon a baseof a formal introduction to the basic concepts of eco-nomics a basic course should be offered for those with noprior exposure. The basic course offered in the arts andsciences component of the university will often suffice butif there is sufficient demand it may be more appropriatefor a special section of that course to be offered in themedical school.A course that is concerned with the application of thebasic concepts of economics to the health field is centralto the economics program. A'seminar is a preferred modefor offering this course. 330 In addition the economics program should include certain\"elective\" courses such as, (a) The Economic Structure of theHealth Sector, and (b) The Economics of the Public Role in thehealth Sector. (1 I.)Social and Historical Context of the Economics Program:A number of factors have interacted in the social andhistorical context of the economics program relevant for amedical school. The relative importance of health and medicalcare as a sector of the economy is an obvious factor of concern.Further, since the health sector has been growing dramaticallyin recent years, it is a factor of increasing relevance. Ifone considers the fundamental questions of economic analysis--What goods are to be produced? How are these goods to be pro- duced?Who should receive which of the goods produced?--theyare of signal concern in the health and medical care field.in recent years there has been concern with the relativeposition of this nation in terms of life expectancy, infant-mortality rates, age adjusted mortality rates and the like,particularly in contrast with the relative proportion ofnational resources devoted to the production of health care.This concern has contributed in no small way to the introductionof economic considerations to health problems.A number of questions are being asked about the productionand provision of medical care that in the past were not so often raised.Many of these questions have a significant economic content.Medical students and others are. increasingly aware of 331 the economic aspects of problems in the health sector and con-sequently increasingly conerned with them.Just as there are important questions that concern what isbeing produced, there are questions that concern the productionprocess per se. Is the present organization of the health careProduction and delivery system an appropriate one? Is it anefficient production process? 1.:ate of inflation of medical care prices, particularlythe cost of hospital services, has been under scrutiny for a number of years. What causes this inflation? Is it symptomaticof a basic inefficiency? How can the rate of inflation in thehealth sector be moderated? These and other questions relatedto the organization, delivery, and financing of health servicesconcern the health professionals as well as others and serve tointensify the significance of the-role of economics within medical education.The distribution of health services is an additional area of concern.Certainly the legislative history of the past decadeis indicative of a degree of dissatisfaction with the pattern ofdistribution that has prevailed in the recent past. This is anation characterized by poverty among affluence. This character-istic is perhaps nowhere as obvious or as burdensome to the socialconscience as in the realm of medical care.It is certainly the case that in recent years some in medicalschools have become more concerned with the broader social aspectsof health and health care. As this concern has expanded it has 332 been reflected in part through a recognition that the behavioraland social sciences have a contribution to make within the con-text of formal medical education. Neither the concern nor therecognition is ubiquitous either among medical schools or withinmedical schools but the trend is distinctly apparent. It isreally within this context that the economics program will evolve.As the concern with the broader social aspects of medical educa-tion leads in turn to a more clear recognition of the potentialcontribution of the behavioral and social sciences, the role ofeach will expand. (III)Current Teaching Activity:At this point it seems appropriate to outline four coursesthat are currently offered that coincide roughly with componentsof the model curriculum outlined above. 1.\"The Economics of Health Services\"This course is designed to provide an examination ofsome of the economic aspects of the production, distribution,and organization of health services. The basic approach inthe course is to provide an introduction to economic analysisand an application of that analytical framework to healthservices.In essence. this course combines the introductionto basic economic principles with the systematic analysisof the economic structure of the health care sector. Assuch it represents both the first and third blocks in themodel curriculum. It is not necessary to combine the_ aoblocks into a single course but since the former is 333 essential for the latter it has been a reasonably efficient combination.In practice it has usually been the case thatapproximately one-half of the students enrolled in the course(primarily medical students and physicians) have had priorexposure to basic economics, and one-half have not. Hence,the first part of the course serves as an introduction tosome and a (welcome) review to others.The general outline of the course is as follows: 1.Economic Analysis A.IntroductionH.Supply, Cost, and ProductionC.Consumer TheoryD.The Theory of MarketsE.Economic Efficiency El.The Scope of the Health Services Sector A.An OverviewB.The Magnitude of the Health Services Sector III.The Economic Organization of the Health Services Sector A.The Product of the Medical Care SectorB.The Market for Medical Care FacilitiesC.The Market for Physicians' ServicesD.The Markets for Other Medical ManpowerE.The Markets for Other Goods and Services IV.The Financing of Medical Care V.Planning for Medical Care ServicesThis general course outline represents a basic, butflexible, framework for discussions and analysis throughout the course.A copy of the course outline and reading list isincluded in the appendix. 2.\"Economic and Administrative issues in Medical Care\"This course is designed to expose the students to an 334 application of the basic concepts of economics to medicalcare and health care problems. This course is offered as aninterdisciplinary seminar and the participants come from avariety of academic and professional backgrounds and includemedical students and physicians. In essence this course isa possible form for the second block in the model curriculum.No systematic effort is made to \"teach\" basic economics, andmany students start the course with no previous formal ex-posure to the field.The general outline of the course is as follows: I.Goals and Objectives of Medical Care II.Constraints 1,Economic2.Political3.Socio-cultural4.Technological III.The Distribution of Medical Services 1.Geographical2.Population Groups IV.Poverty and Health V.Cost and Inflation VI.The Quality of Medical Care VII'.Alternative Health Care Systems VIII.Financing Systems IX.Planning X.Student Policy ReportsEach of the major topics in the outline is the subjectmatter of a separate seminar. The participants are expected 335 to read certain background material and come to each sessionprepared to discuss the topic from relevant points of view.The varied backgrounds of the participants in the actualseminars contributes significantly to the general level of discuss:to the overall interest of the participants, andto the general success of the course.In general it would be desirable to offer such a courseas an Interdisciplinary seminar. it could, however, beoffered essentially as a medical school seminar as the secondblock of the model curriculum. As evidence it might sufficeto note the varied interests of the present generation ofmedical students and their increasingly varied undergraduateacademic backgrounds.The last topic of the general outline has bee particularly sucessful.The students in the course were groupiA into anumber of task forces. Each task force dealt with a specificsignificant issue in health or medical care. The task forceswere charged with investigating the complexities of the issue,analyzing the several policy alternatives for dealing with theissue, and outlining the implementation of a preferred policyalternative.Each task force made a formal presentation anddefended its findings in the context of a critical review bythe other participants in the course. Among the task forcereports have been: 1.Alternative Approaches to Health Manpower Allocation 2.Criteria for Effectiveness of Consumer Participationin Health Delivery Programs 3.Evaluation of the HMO Proposal 4.A Cost-Effectiveness Look at Neighborhood HealthCenters 5.Evaluation of Alternative National Health InsuranceProposalsA copy of the course outline and reading list is included inthe appendix. 3.\"Economics of American Health Care Policy\"This course is also designed to expose the students to anapplication bf economics to health care problems. It is alsooffered as an interdisciplinary seminar and the participantscome from varied academic and professional backgrounds. Thereare two significant differences between this course and the previous one.First, this seminar invloves a formal presenta-tion by a series of speakers. Each presentation is usuallyfollowed by a general discussion but this is obviously aquite different format from that of the seminar described above.Second, it is usually expected that the students en-rolled in this seminar have had prior formal exposure to atleast the basic principles of economics.The general outline of the course is as follows: I.Physicians II.Paramedical Personnel III.Cost and Productivity Measurement IV.Insurance and Prepayment V.Medicare and Medicaid VI.Group Practice and Integrated Provision Schemes 337 VII.The Role of the Market and Planning VIII.Cost Benefit Analysis IX.Hospitals and Nursing HomesEach of the topics is the subject matter of a separate seminar.The participants are expected to read certainbackground material but a formal paper or presentation ismade on each topic by someone with particular expertise in the subject area..This course or a similar one could serve as the secondblock in the model curriculum. It would be especiallyappropriate if the \"essential\" first block were available as a prerequisite. 4.\"The Economics of Health Planning\" 12This course is' relatively new. It was developed by theauthor only last year in response to a perceived need for acourse that dealt more specifically with the economic aspectsof the public role in the health sector.The course was designed to provide an introduction toplanning as an alternative to the market as a mechanism forresource allocation. The course is roughly divided into three parts.in the first part of the course there is anattempt to introduce the fundamentals of macro-economics,especially as they relate to income determination, invest-ment, economic growth, and stabilization policy.The second part of the course involves a survey ofnational economic planning. Essentially the survey is 338 designed to familiarize the students with the potentialrange of economic planning from that that prevails in theSoviet Union, for example, through French State Planning, tothat that is characteristic of a basically market economysuch as the United States.The third part of the course is designed to concentrateOn health planning and the relevant tools available for the planning effort.The general outline of the course is as folloWs: I.Introduction to Macro-economics A.Income DeterminationB.Economic Planning III.Health A.ProblemsB.ProspectsC.Specific Applications V.Evaluation of Selected Health ProgramsAs is the case with most new courses, at least threegeneral principles obtained. First, the instructor probablylearned more than the students. Second, the instructor wasnot completely satisfied with the way the course turned out.Third, the course will be different the next time it is offered.On balance, however, this course, or rather a 339 similar course, is probably an appropriate one for medicalstudents who have a particular interest in the public rolein the health field. It could be an appropriate course forblock four in the model curriculum. A copy of the readinglist for the course is included in the appendix. (IV)Current Staff and Facilities:There is really no particular benefit to derive from a specific response in this category. A couple ofgeneral principlesmight be cited. First, it is probably not appropriate for non-economists to try to introduce medical students to basic economicconcepts or to the application of economics to the health care sector.In some instances attempts have been made to include. aneconomic content to certain courses in medical schools by facultyfrom disciplines other than economics. In general these attemptshave not been successful. Second, it is probably not sufficientto attempt to incorporate economics into the medical curriculumby means of an occasional lecture by a visiting fireman, even ifthe fireman happens to be a professional economist. (V)Formal and Informal Objectives of the Economics Program:Essentially we return here to the basic rationale for inclu-sion of economics in the medical curriculum. The primary objectiveof the economics program is to expose the medical students to thegeneral concepts of economics and make them aware of the implica-tion of the economics of medical care and health services.The magnitude of the health care sector, the proportion of 340 our scarce resources devoted to health care, the special charac-teristics of the health sector, and the central role of thephysicians in the decision making process taken together suggest'that physicians should be more aware of the problems of resourceallocation.The science of scarcity should be an integral part.of the education of physicians. 'rue remaining sections of the self-study protocol do not reallyrequire any particular consideration in this general response. (SectionXII deals with supporting documents such as course outlines and reading lists.As indicated above the course outlines and reading lists for each olthe four courses discussed are included in the appendix.) The Proposed Curriculum and Existing_ CurriculaShort of undertaking a rather complete survey of the economic offeringsof medical schools, any comparison of the proposed model curriculum to thecurricula which are currently offered in medical schools would at best be in-complete and at worst superficial and possibly misleading. Given this dis-claimer there is a variety of evidence upon which to base a rather Acneral,albeit tentative, comparison of the proposed and prevailing curricula.The author has a prior knowledge of a small sample of medical schoolsand individuals who have taught related courses in medical schools. Inaddition, the author has discussed the question with a few colleagues withsimilar knowledge. The general consensus seems to be that appropriateexposure to basic economic concepts and to the implication of the economicsof health and medical care is not widely available in medical schools.There are very few courses, if any, which are offered in medical schools 341 that approximate the depth of content implicit in the model curriculum.Although the field has expanded rapidly in recent years, the numberof academic economists who are in the subdiscipline of the economics ofhealth or medical care is still somewhat limited. Of this limited num-ber some are in departments of economics, a few are in schools of publichealth, and a few are in medical schools. There are certainly not full-time academic eonomists on the faculties of most medical schools. Thisphenomenon tends to support the general consensus that appropriate expo-!mre to basic economic concepts and the application of economics to thehealth field is not widely available in medical schools.Some medical schools have appointed economists to their facultieswith an apparently part-time commitment. In some cases academic economistshold joint appointments in the faculties of medicine and other faculties of the university. These are relatively recent practices and should serveto increase the exposure of medical students to economic concepts and applications.It is unlikely, however, that a single economist on a part-time basis will suffice to staff the full range of the model curriculum.There are alternatiVes, of course. The four courses outlined inthe preceding section are available within other parts of the universityand open as electives on a cross registration basis to medical students.in effect, it is possible to offer the full range of the model curriculumwithout specifically providing it within the curriculum of the medical school.In practice, however, unless the model curriculum is part ofthe medical school curriculum the impact in terms of desired exposure isbound to be exceedingly limited.Some direct information on economic content of medical school coursesis available from a survey of course offerings undertaken for the:Study for 342 Tcachiny, Behavioral. Sciences in Schools of Medicine. The projectdirector provided the author with a list of medical schools which specifi-cally mention courses involving economics in some form. This list IF ,ro- sentel in Table-2. The list is obviously not complete, but it is prc, ,,ply representative.A careful inspection of this list tends to reenforce the conclusionthat exposure to basic economic concepts and the application of economicanalysis to medical care and health care problems is not widely availablein medical schools.

(9 medical schools) 346 There are certainly no cases that imply that the full range ofthe model curriculum is available. In only one instance is thereNiwcilic reference to a systematic introduction to basic economicprinciples.There may be others but it certainly does not appear tobe the case.Most of the references imply that a small number ofsessions of particular courses are given over to discussion of economic factors.Only a few cases can even be sympathetically-interpreted tosuggest that a major component of the curriculum includes a coursethat approximates the second block of the model curriculum. There isno case of a course that is designed to systematically analyze theeconomic structure of the health care sector.The general impression that one gets from reviewing the listis that it is perhaps representative of the trend that was alluded to above.As the level of concern with the broader social aspectsof health heightens there are certain courses and certain departmentswithin medical schools that reflect this concern. One suspects thatthe impact of this concern on the curriculum follows a pattern.First, concerned medical school faculty who recognize the relativesignificance of economics, for example, try to reflect that themselvesin their courses. When they recognize the relative significance andsophistication of the economic aspects of the problem they tend toinvite economists to give a specific lecture or set of lectures intheir courses.This is certainly an appropriate trend. It undoubtedly precededthe appointments of economists to faculties in those medical schoolsthat now have economists on their faculties. On the other hand, itis certainly the case that there is some distance to go before theprevailing curricula approximates the model curriculum. 347 Economics and Medical Education and the Behavioral and Social ScienceSurveyThe editor of the Economics volume of the Behavioral and SocialScience Survey summarized the goals and achievements of economics as:in summary, the long range goal of economics has beenthe understanding of the operation of the economic system.The acquisition of this understanding has been cumulative,and there now exists a well-established core of economictheory and an economic accounting framework which providesthe economist with his basic working tools. The economist'smethods of analysis have been used in a number of appliedfields.Considerable success has been achieved in designingpolicies to improve the stability of the economic system andincrease its efficiency in specific sectors. Currently,economics is beginning to be more responsive to the majorsocial needs which are being increasingly recognized.The economics of health is an applied field of economics. Thereare similarities between this applied field and other applied fields of economics:A particular case in .point is the similarity between'the economics of health and urban economics, for example. In generalthe objective of the application of economic analysis to the fieldof health is the same as the applications to other fields. Health is-a specific sector and a significant sector and the economic systemand hence society would benefit from a increase in the efficiency of the health sector.There is Much that remains to be learned before it can beclaimed that we understand the operation of the health sector as aneconomic system. A major gap in theoretical knowledge is the reallack of a theory of nonprofit enterprise. Traditional economictheory does not really contain a satisfactory model of nonprofit behavior.There are empirical gaps as well. Much more needs to beknown about the technical production relationships in health, forexample. 348 Still there is much to be gained by applying economic analysisto the health sector. A number of questions remain to be answered.Is the present allocation of resources to the health care sector anappropriate one? Could we get the same output of health services forless resources or could we get more health services for the sameresources?Is the prevailing mix of health services the most desirable mix?Could we have the same health for fewer resources if we had moreambulatory care and less hospital care, for example? Would the generallevel of health be higher if there were more or better housing andnutrition and less health services?The real objective of including an economic content in themedical curriculum is to expose the future physician to the generalconcepts of economics and make him aware of the implication of theeconomics of medical care and health services. The future physicianshould concern himself with the preceding questions. The model curric-ulum is designed to confront the medical school students with manyof these most relevant questions. It will also provide him with partof the basis for beginning to find some of the answers. 349 APPENDIX The Economics of Henith Services This course is designed to provicle an examination of some of the economic aspects of the production, distribution, and organization of health services. The course outline is intended to provide a basic, but flexible, framework for our discussion and analyses throughout the course. The reading list contains a representative collection of relevant literature. For specific topics the interested student will find a more complete bibliography contained in The Economics of Health by Herbert Klarman.Neither the course outline nor the reading list is intended to reflect relative weights for the several topics. The basic approach in the course will he to provide an intro- duction to economic analysis and an application of that analytical framework to health services. All students should be familiar with the material presented in Prices & Markets by Robert Dorfman and this text will serve as the basis for the introduction to economic analysis.It is suggested that each student obtain a copy of this text.(Prentice-Hall, 1967.)While not required, the following books are recommended in addition to the material given on the reading list.Caves, R.American Industry: Structure, Conduct, Performance,1967.Fein, R.The Doctor Shortage, of Health, 1965.Somers, ii.

However true in the abstract, any actualtransference of knowledge from one discipline to the other must take placewithin the context of the unique structure of each.Tf knowledge transfer is our goal, it probably ought to be admittedthat disciplines are by nature self contained, that there is inherentresistance to interpenetration, and hence careful provision must be madefor the transference -- if it is on a scale that could disrupt medicine'sexisting structure.Knowledge about public-policy making has already come to have a placein one of the fields of medicine, public health. But public administration-- the field with which public health has an interface -- is but one ofhnif a dozen diverse and largely autonomous fields that together constitutepolitical science.* In the same way, public health is but one of a numberof organic fields of knowledge comprehended by the class name, medicine.Why then hasthe interpenetration of political science and medicinebeen largely confined to a single field in each discipline? Why is itthat the precepts about the ways organizations should be designed and theways in which they operate have so little interest outside the schools ofpublic health? *American government, International Relations, Subnational Government,POlitial Theory and Methodology are illustrative of coequal fields. 376 First, the private practice of medicine is still the most prevalentmeans of providing care and, as such has an interface with business manage- ment.But more persuasive is the argument that medicine must resist thedilution of its traditiOnal concern with disease and treatment. Otherwise,future patients will be deprived of the care they need, deserve and should have.P:a this way, it is difficult to challenge what ought to be the concernof medical education. The you ex11-:tence of the STUDY FOR TEACHING BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE INSCHOOLS OF MEDICINE suggests that there is at least some question, however,about the traditional conception of the physician as an autonomous healer,committed solely to ministering to the Ill. Medicine, by concerning itselfwith preventive medicine, has seemed to disavow this posiAon. To a disci-pline where the dilemma of how scarce re-Sources should he allocated, thequestion Is raised as to the optimal balance of support for the preventionand the treatment of disease.Institutionalized medicine, elevated by the American public to a pre-eminent position in our society as the instrumentality by which the histor-ical threats of\u00b0disease are reduced, if not irradicated, now faces difficulty,perhaps serious.First, since America is a society in crisis, medicine, like all othermajor institutions, has come under a level of social pressure it has notknown before.Second, paradoxical forces such as the 'miracles of modern Medicine'are asxociated with certain crucial problems which overwhelm us, (i.e.longevity vs. the population explosion). Third, medicine,. never a static institution, is approaching a pointwhere mutational change resulting from the accumulation of these developmentsmfthtvell be a necessity. 377 As a result, poli tical science may have acquired an unexpected relevanceto medicine, since its knowledge is pertinent to methods of coping withinstitutioal disorganization and change. More important, a perspectivewith the kinds; of problems associated with these difficulties has evolvedfrom the systematic study of politics.Points of RelevanceTo provide a jumping off place for discussion, there seems to be meritin listing three points at which the knowledge<and perspective of politicalscience has pertinence to the underlying problems institutionalized medicine. 1..DayTto-day.Operations of Medical-Care Programs: Program frictions,dealinE, With_publiciurisdictions, interagency strife are all areas where political. science can bring techniques and knowledge to bear. Identifying.!urces of ,,tress resulting in program friction which curtail treatmentcapability; presenting alternatives to dealing with arbitrary governmentaljurisdictional actions; assistance in untangling seemingly contrary or evencontradictory injunctions of agencies linked into a ].heal health program,are some of the ways in which political science has pertinence. 2.Tactical Manc-,!ment of Medical Care Programs: Organizational conflict-- that is, political science can have a good deal to. say about the accomo-dation by means of which disparate aims of the component parts of fnstitution-alized medicine can be pursued. Also, medicine, although traditiorallyconnected. with the business or private sector of our economy, now feels thepressure to derive a set of health coals where the interests of all thepeople are at least considered. Lad finally, medicine is confronting theproblem of,determining an optimal balance between what we would like to doin terms of medical care and what we are able to accomplish which shall belabeled the transactional balance. How can thisiptimalization best besought? 378. 3.Strategic Considerations in Medical Care: First, at one time,treatment of diseases of the body was the pre-eminent concern of medicine.In time it began to concern itself with diseases of the mind, then environ-mental health, and now the whole thrust of preventive mdeicine is upon us.As new health care demands develop, stemming from emergent conceptionSof health that are only now crystalizing, how does institutionalized medicinereconceive and reconstruct a program of action (adaptation) instead of merely compromisin,7, its existing goals (accomodatint)?Second, is it not possible that in some inchoate way the thrust of inst..._tutionalized medicine is no longer attuned to national character(actual or emergent)? That the 'sound-and fury' of public concern withmedicine reflects not some rationally processed anxiety about its efficacyh.t a sense that death avoidance is only palliative for our inability toembrace the essential (non-materialistic) challenges of ife.Third, medicine has struggled willt some of mankind's hiotorical veritieswhich are in the process of coming unglied. Hundred year life span maybecome common place, death can be forestalled, interventl, in the processof conception may allow us to determine important characteristics of the newly born.The dynamics -through which institutions can meet challengesof this depth can come from the well formed models derived by studying .political developments. AWhile political science has much it can offer to curtail the problemsand pressures confronting medicine, yet we must be prepared to contributesomething more durable. Our concern is with the phySician who will be.trainedunder curricula fashioned and instituted in the late nineteen seventies,whose career will not begin until the nineteen eighties and whose impacton mcdicine will-begin to be felt only at the end of the century. 379 Since our concern her is to identify an interface between medicine and political science we shall. seek a more -analytical construct.Analyt c Dimensions of Interface Between Medicine and Poliiical ScienceTo arrive at some of the basic analytical dimensions which make us) Lluinterface between medicine and polit)cal science some definition of termsrelevant to concepts from both disciplines need to be set down.The concept medicine-health is so deeply rooted in the thinking of institutionalized medicine that it deserves, comment at the start. Whatwe have is a term \"medicine\" linked with a more generic term \"health\" thatindicates the context in which medicine is the core or focus of helath.The perspectives of political science which accept strain, tension andconfrontation as indigenous; introduce a different kind of concept -- onewhich suggests the presenCe and impact of these kinds of forces, and isneeded if the richness,of its formulations are to be brought to bear inrelation to institutionalizedmedicine.Now we can move to more elaboration in our thinking. One of the most.-central conceptions of political science makes distinction between the needs'of a public and the instrumentality through which activities are mountedto provide for these needs. The elements can,then be,combined into a single concept -- 'a program and its puhldrevb First, however, there is a hiatusbetween what is aspired to for any given program, and what are the actual-ities of those charged to carry on its name; second, clients at some pointwill object to what agencies have been able to achieve in light of whatis expected of them. Medicine is now beginning to utilize a concept thatsuggests this discrepancy between program actualities and clientele expec-tations; what follows employs this new ccacept.Provider-Constituaney:- Various terms can be used to denote the _ prog-ramatic.and- clientele components of institutionalized cun.mmor., providerpatient, program-constituency, all have similar denotations.We have opted to combine the term provider, from medicine, with the termconsiituency, from political science, to produce the polarized conceptprovider-constitueney. This will suggest: both the interdependency betweenpatients and medical programs and at the same time the dichotomous relation-ship between them, implying the impossibility of a fusion of interestsand objectives.Another dimension of the functioning of medicine in our society whichwe must consider to be equally critical from the perspective of politicalscience is the presumption of the enduring viability of our societal insti- tutions.For It would be not only intolerable, it would violate one ofthe primary values of medicine were there any reasonable doubt About theavallohility of quality health care on an uninterrupted basis.lnstitutionalMaintenance InsL.tutional Change: We seldom take thenext stdp in logic, however, and realize there is nothing inherently enduringabout our social arrangements. They are subject to erosions of confidence,structurul disintegration, procedural malfunctionand a host of otherbreakdowns,-yet we yesist the imperative that whatever we have built, wemust maintain. Through a combination of 'holding the line' or-resistingchange in some' instances and 'tinkering' in others, change or refusal tochange can be made to sustain the viability of an institution and perpetuateits historical mission in our society.However.. real change -- change which breaks the thread of historicalcontinuity and marks the end of one kind of institutionalized medicineand 'the initiation of another -- is sometimes the only vay to survive acrisis in institutional. arrangements.We shall use the terms Institutional Maintenance and InstitutionalChange to represent these two great concerns. In juKtapc,:ing system change 381 and !;yfitem w:lintenance we intend to\\stress the interdependence between sta-bility, continuity, coherence and durability on the one hand, and change,disrup ion, displNcement, and terminality on the other. A reliable organ- izatitinneither unchanging nor always changing; rather there is a. balance,one with the other. A viahle inst.!.tution, to invoke one of political science's.favorite precepts, is one where program leadership has developed ways ofmeeting the challenge of change.Ulat suggests itself -now is the proverbial 2 x 2 matrix where thesetwo polarized concepts are plotted against each other to produce the familiarfour cells into which plenary concepts can be inserted. Part II,RATIONALE FOR SELECTION OF COURSE CONTENTThe problem now is to analyze the subject matter comprehened by thefour conceptual spaces defined by the matrix. As we have noted, in themost general terms- political science offers mediCne a perspective fromwhich to monitor the maintenance and development of the institutionalizedstructure within which the practice of medicine is housed. Keeping in mindthat a casual analytic framework will be of the most use, what are the topicsaround which the maximum of materials could be most usefully organized?By returning to the matrix.we can, derive four broad headings, andthese can be used to group sets of topics together. (See Figure,1).I. Program LeadershipThe quality of medical care is directly dependetlt upon the relevanceand reliability of ristitutional arrangements; that is, extensive andintensive organizational technology. The physiciah can in no way be con-sidered an autonomous healer. lie function, with an intQrdependent relation-ship in the community both horizontally Liaison Figure 1. If medic:LI technology as prmetieed by the physician in the treatment roomof his office is considered to be the primary technology of institution-alized medicine, then there arc several ancillary or secondary technologieswhich, while they may not determine treatment prescription, are just as important to the \"patient's well being in their support capacity. What countsthe balance between the primary and secondary technologies ascomplementary but distinct forms of productive behavior.Coordination and control are terms that begin to bring the matter of'balance into operational focus. What we are dealing with here are the con-cerns of providers (the physicians) with the maintenance of a stable instit7utional context for the practice of medicine and the organization of careand treatment activities generally. We shall use Program Leadership todesignate this kind of activity. There are a number of elements to be considered in this, regard: A.Horizontal Integration' of Structure: At the local as well as thenational level of institutionalized medicine, a multiplicity of organi-zational mechanisms are relied upon. First, physicians are generallyorganized into one or another form of commercial enterprise (i.e., thesolo office, the partnership,. the group practice, the clinic, etc.). Second,there are formally sanctioned public agencies such as county health depart-mentspresiding over various aspects of institutionalized medicine. Foreample, the service area of environmental health is one. Third, thereare quasi-Lpublic arrangements, such as United Fund agencies (i.e., Heart'Association, American Cancer Society, some blood banks).There could be a good deal of program coherence gained from the impo-sition of some comprehensive ,overhead agency -- such as a Health Mainten-ance Organization -- on the whole of a community's efforts in medicine.Much would depend on the details of its social technology, that is, themix of fora. 11 bureaucracy and 'volunterism,' and how puch 'contro3 of thepurse' ought to devolve to an H.M.C.At the national level an even more challenging set of problems occur,for there is then the matter of competing agencies maintaining alternativeways of organizing institutionalized medicine.. _B.Vertical Integration of Structure: Beginning with the countyhealth nurse and working up through the layer_of local-, state and nationalhierarchy ono can easily count more than a dozen levels in the verticalortani%atien of medicine. The economies of scale that would be achievedthrough the elaboratien of these vertical relationships are substantial and 384 inviting.Proposals for the regionalization of medicine reflect attemptsco achieve a higher level of coordination among agencies.Few move-ponderous issues face program leadership-than.when, where andhow to strike for increased economies of scale without activating the neg-ative forces: associated with decentralization of controls. C.Staffing: Medicine is now finding that ran].- distribution of t,:dicalpersonnel indicates the .need lor program plannino of a. kind somewhat aliento its traditions. lf physicians are to acquire all the knowledge andskills available to them, Choy mn,lt have more intensive training; yet ifthe charnrtc.r or the physician is to mutate several times during the courseof a normal career, highly specialized and intensive training amounts tobuilding obolescence into medicine's most expensive resource. Balancinglevel:; of care with future p;Aterns of care becomes only one of thechalionges in the ol;eral: staffing of medicine.D. Mix of Organizational Types: Pluralism means a variety of competing,sometimes even contending, types of enterprises. Medicine is nothing ifnot pluralistic. Clearly the advantages of half a dozen different ways ofsustaining the physician far outweigh the possible disadvantages (a casecan be made for public, proprietary and teaching hospitals competing), butat some point, such pluralism comes to amount to an indulgence. Principlesthat elucidate the balance between purpose and prospect, between stabilityand flexibility, and. between shunt and long -range economies are the onlybasis upon which 'these matters can be decided; and experience has shown itimprudent t:u attempt to decide them once and for all. time. Monitoring andperiodic re-examination ought to he the rule. E. Links Between Medicine and Other. Institutions in Our Soci,Lty: In ....an attempt to concern itself with the 'whole man,' medicine long ago beganto co-opt public education into its attempt: to prepare children to providefor their own health needs. Mental health programs concern themsalves.with churches and church-related facilities in an attempt to penetrateotherwise impermeable sectors of individual.experience.- The increasingneed for ties between previously autonomous institutions in our societywill. be .felt whatever the shape of medicine in the future.II. Consumer ParticipationThe focus, of our concern under this heading is clear: if medicine isto serve the basic needs of the largest number of people, there must besome effective means of identifying patient needs' and focusing these frog-ments of interests into coherent goals. It is our position, however, thatinstitutionalized medicine does not include communication networks throughwhich these interests could be identified and crystaliied into a coherent Via.and widely understood assertion of central purposes. c. For exawle, from the constituent's point of view, when the patientdealt directly with 'his physician,' the doctor could take account of hisdisease, his state of mind, his family situation, his pocket book and manyother nnas of his life that impinged upon his health. The coming of the specialint, third party payments, and group practice all have changed thecontext of the transaction bet 7ri physician and patient.And the fact that the physician found himself in a deficit positionin pract:leing medicine (especially in terms of the quality of his domesticexperience, the freedom to pursue avocational interests, and in other areasof life style) was unperceived by his constituents.What, then, are the penultimate interests of patients? Is deathavoidance the single, dominant criterion of wellbeing? What would othersalient program values be? And what of the physician's interests? Whatgood is an office full of expensive hardware and a mind overburdened with-knowledge when third parties and a multiplicity of bureaucracies are increasingly more dictatorial of what can and cannot be done for a patient?Medicine could concern itself with such topics as these:_A. Informational Processes: People want to hear only reassuring thingsabout: medicine. As a society, we have come to expect, and demand a levelof performance from institutionalized medicine that actively works againstour real understanding of it. Hospitals illustrate what we have in mindhere; there is much said about 'costs being too high,' but almost nothingis said to suggest that we have come to expect every hospital to provide afull spectrum of services of unimpeachable quality without regard to cost.-- What would constitute an accumulative, and adequately funded programof information dissemination as a prerequisite for the layman's assimilationof information so that he could then express preferences from which healthgoals could be raised? B.Issue Articulation: Issues are expressions of anxiety about theway a program is operating. In the simplest sense, an issue is that concernwhich spans the gap between goal expectations and program accomplishments.As this gap grows, issues become more highly charged until they come torepresent a demand that 'something be done.' Institutionalied medicineneeds to find ways in which both physician and patient can effectivelyarticulate issues before they either fall latent or escalate into fullscalepublic problems. 386 C. Policy Altern.mives: The evidence. Indicates that concern surgesraid subsides In a collective response that typically reflects constituencyneeds, preferences and demands. They may or may not be realistic as formsof change linking goal expectations to real life accomplishments. Processingis,:nos so thatthey are transformed Into relevant and accoptabie alternativesiN11challenge to medicine's role in determining health care policies. D. yrpgr;nit MNiitoring: One of the most promising conceptions to emergeIn recent years proposes a self-conscious mechanism through which constit-uents would have the operation of a health care program monitored for themthrough Lhe services of fully professional, but other than establishedpersonnel.While proponents of procram monitoring sometimes present it asan alternative to the politics of'policy development, it may be that weshould think of it as no more than a means of sharpening and supplementingexisting processes for forming policy.III. Program Adaptation_ .Change is a necessity, even though it is expensive, disruptive and traumilic; change for its own sake, however, is a waste. How then do we distinguish between change, that promises an increment in institutional..capability from change that portends a dimunition?The underlying problem is that as the tempo of change picks up throOgh-out society, the pace at which change must be initiated at any one of its institutions mounts. Medicine has come to feel the pressure of these forcesas has every other institution in our society.What we have in mind here with regard to medicine has been labeledprollramadtion to emphasize the need for a social technology throughwhich change is instituted rather than the more immediate matter of whichchanges to undertake.Some topics under which all this might be discussed would be:A. Conceptualizin the State of the Medical'System: People in organi-zations have their particular orbits and once settled in they tend to knowrelatively little about what goes on outside their setting. This is truein local medical care programs. When things do not go as they are expected,most individuals. feel they 'know' what is wrong which is seldom the case.Unfortunately it is almost impossible to do-anything constructiveabout this without a reliable and well elaborated technology for eliciting,aggregating, and processing large amounts of mundane data. 387 Presentation of findings on the way things have changed is the challenge,one reliable analyses of the state of the system have been prepared. B. Deline:Itim4 Problems: The familiar rule of thumb that once a problem'has beta carefully defined it is half solved only serves to point up adifficulty with which medicine haj long contended; symptoms often havelittle connection with the underlying problems that must be dealt withif they are to be alleviated. Thus, cost controls have no relevance to thehigh cm;ts of hospitalization. Ultimately the only way to bring hospitalcosts down substantially is to face the secondary problem of the advisabilityof mainlaininsl the expensive life- support systems now available in hospitals.Defining problems such as these will require institutionalized medicineto develop conceptual models on the quality of care to be provided.C. Cr(stingjetsof.Policy:Makers: Once a reliable representationof institutionalized medicine's major probleMs have been prepared, the nextstep is to get them considered by sets of individuals who have the capacityto deal with these problems. This is not as simple as it sounds. Influen-tials in the network of policy-makers in institutionalized medicine are seldomin a position to dictate to their. constituents what problems they must beprepared to contend with. But creating sets of policy-makers whose concernscomprehend the roots of a problem is something political science has a gooddeal of experience with even though there are no ready solutions available.D. Deyel9Tmnit of Social Technolol y Our habit of blaming -those respon-sible for a program with its malfunctions is familiar to us all. But tohold someone responsible for accomplishing a set of formal goals requiresthat he have the means for meeting these goals. As anyone with programresponsibilities in health can attest, nowhere is this more often the casethan in institutionalized medicine. The prior question then concernsprecisely what kinds of social, medical and other technologies would berequired to 'solve' the problem. Unless there is careful research anddevelopment effort here it becomes an exercise in scapegoating to levydemands against those in positions of responsibility.E. Strategies.of Change,: Institutionalized medicine, like many othersectors of society, has tended to rely upon a strategy of change oftenlabeled incrementalism. Advantageous as incrementaliSm may be in many.situations, in this: era of super-specialization, ehe'mechanics of medicine,become cluttered, cumbersome and unwieldy as more and more is added to thestructure.Innovative change, adaptive change, and accommodative changeare only labels for some other basic strategies upon which those chargedwith the management of change must be prepared to rely.IV. Forging Policy AlternativesIn the context of change, it does no violence to medicine to .say thatwhile Americans have the greatest system of health care in the world, itmust: be continuously updated to maintain its relevance to the emergent needs of our. society. The question that presents itself, then, is what can 388 he done to prepiire adequately crystalized eonceptious of the future form.; a program could take? It shall take a great deal of effort :if pat Lents are persuadedtobestir themselves to contemplate what kinds of care they wouldprefer to those they now have available to them. What would be the most servi ceahl e pattern for constituent mobilizati on in medicine? Who would takethe initiative in developing iL? And what of the future of medicine i tsel I.?What balance should bestruckbetween death--avoidance and life-embracings t rotegi e:i?What of the sensitive matter c. f biasing medicine toward one oranother of its multiple constituencies children, elderly, minorities?For us the question remains, what arc the dynamics through which thekindsofprocessesmanifested in terms such as creativity, inventivenessandority go into operation wi th a cons tituency? What are the condi-tions under which imagination becomes active? A. Problym-Solving_Experiences : It appears to be an unstated law thatthe earlier problems are probed and formulated the more latitude there willbe in solving them. However this involves being exposed to larger and moreoverwhelming levels of uncertainty. So thei e are advantages in early probing, hut. alsoheavy costs; it is the manner in which program leaders resolve--this dilemma that determines how their cons ti tuents react in consideringalternatives as one line of response to strain. B. Relevant: Staff : One of the soundest practices for dealing withproblems Is to have at l.east a small staff assigned this responsibility.A planningstaff,or some. otherkindwill often serve this need. Thecrlt1cal. factor seems to be that there is a decisional point where difficultiescan be explored prior to their becoming polarized which precludes imaginativeinteraction.C. Data Base: There can be no reliable extrapolation of the futurefrom s terotypesabout the present; it is reliable reconstruction of whatexists that i.sthe essential condition for undertaking any plumbing ofwhat can be.Careful. compilation of the facts from which this can beaccomplished is a straight forward, more or less routine, and not particu-larly expensive procesS about which we have well founded conceptions.D. Participation-Consultation Networks: It is a truism, that planningis relatively more costly than the management of day-to-day affairs. To keep aconstituency informed re ;wires cons tant and sustained effort, butthe informational function is wi thin the capacity of most medical communities.The initeirequisite. inthis;case is the building of consultation networksby tie.ro; of which consumer participation can be forthcoming. It may bethat in thef i rat. instance those nets would serve as informational media,wi th planning and policy-making a function that evolves later. 189 E. Intra2medicalLiaison: Although physicians have a multiplicityor organi;:ations through which they coordinate the several facets of theiractivities, there may be little or no concerted effort to anticipate thefuture.More than this, there may be little that is done between or amongthe ar;,nrwithin which the monitoring of medicine is carried on.The pressureS of time and the preoccupation with 'keeping things going'form a constraint here. Dramatic as forging he future might be, there isthat is dreary in preparing fot choosing uetween alternative futures.It is resi:Itance to the drudgery that this involves which forms the mosteffective barrier to this kind of effort.Planningis the term for what we have in mind here, and politicals(71entits hove a unique and valuable contribution to make in this matter. Part IIIINSTRUCTIONAL MECHANICSIt is the premise of this paper that of equal importance with theactual course content is the type of learning experience which can takeplace through various kinds of social science instructional techniques.The iu,;truetiontil technologies relied upon in higher education in general,. and medical education in particular, are largely obsolete; more effective,potent and flexible techniques are now generally available though they are not in use. Any curriculum change out ed as a vehiclefor beginuily the in,:roduction of as many of these techniques as can bebuilt into new subject matter areas.Some presuppositions regarding this line of argument will provide auseful point from which to begin:An elemental change in process within the structure of American societyis resulting in the interpenetration of many of our institutions by others.Thus it is our supposition that the medical institution of the future willbe involved in cooperation, collaboration and co- optation with such componentinstitutions as education, religion, mass media, and recreation, to name a fewThe accumulations of change in medicine achieves a critical mass suchthat it changes in some of its essentials every two or three decades. Wecan no longer assume that an intensive period of training with increments.of continuing education will maintain a physician's professional competenceover the-span of his career.Institutionalized medicine has previously been organized around theactivities of the primary care physician. The drift now is toward some 390 form of professional parity for nurses and medics in addition to professional.sanctions for a variety of Para- -medical. personnel. Tomorrow's physicianshall have to have interpersonal skills, a basic understanding of bothocio-economic and bureaucratic processes, and a multi - faceted role notalways anchored in the treatment room or hospital.Academia no longer stands isolated from society, and Schools of Medicinemust. be ready to penetrate the 'real world.' The teaching advantages ofdecentralizing medical. instruction far outweigh the traditional practicesthat have kept students from early and continuous contact with patients,medical practice, and the salient problems of institutionalized medicine.There are those who are increasingly skeptical about the learningefficiencies of the conventional. lecture 7.- discussion process, Even thoughwe cannot demonstrate that: a particular technique is superior to that whichwe have been relying on, there is good reason to argue that .experimentationmay be the most effective strategy for breaking the ritualistic bonds ofthe classroom.With this in mind, let us now discuss a number of teaching techniques,with which the proposed curriculuM can be elaborated. 1.CJassroom Instruction: Let us begin this inventory with the affir-mation that the classroom should not be discarded entirely, There are situationsin which students can prepare a bibliography, probably with the assistanceof one or more faculty. They can undertake a series of discussions basedupon their reading, with faculty being utilized 1) to provide specializedevaluations, summaries, or orienting talks and 2) to enable the group toperiodically take stock of its progress and its prospects.Case or patient presentation where students provide an analysis ofa patient's problems which are then reviewed with the patient and discussedwith a faculty member is surely one of the most useful ].earning techniques ever devised. 2.Programmed Learning:. This class heading coMprehends a range oftecLniques and devices running from the learner's manual that accompaniesa conventional textbook to computor-assisted learning processes. The essen-tials of prouammed learning are generally familiar to the reader. Thestudent and his teacher resource person identify a learning unit that the 391 student is required or wishes to undertake. The program typically includesreading and then some form of active processing of these materials. In the so-callcd'inreractive mode the student 'uses' what he has read for some purpose to achieve some learning objectives. This may involve solving a problemor it my involve analyzing some problematic situation or evolving a deriv- ative conception on the student's part. When the student sits down at acomputer remote and enters into a dialogue with one of the dynamic programswhere a secondary learning capability has been built into the computer,'interaction' takes on profound meanings.3. Secondary Data Analysis: One of the simplest and most profitablelearning devices ever discovered involves a student, a counter-sorter, apreNtred deck of data cards, and a manaul that takes him through a sequent-ially structured series of steps by means of which the student creates (orrecreates) for himself, concepts programmed into the data deck. The manual typically includes a series of questions accompanied by sheets where thestudent records,his findings-aftercompleting each sort of the cards.This procedure can be used for the processing of decks of cards which contain data pertinent to some_ aspect of health:4. Supervisted Field Research: If one takes the position that programleadership in institutionalized'medielne cannot calibrate its capabilities4to local kmperatiAs unless it understands the community from some morepenetrating perspective than that provided by local mores, an introduction.to superVised behavioral science research may enable the student to take a first 'step toward analytic understanding. One of the profound advantagesof this process is that the student literally disCovers certain salienttiugs about,lhe nature of reality for himself.Providing a community where access has been cultivated so that there is some degree ,of. mutuality of purposes between local medical leaders and 392 medical nchool faculty is a necessity Students, provided with a listof potential research enterprises that are' interesting and challenging tomedical pernonuel on the scene, who are given. tutorial assistance in theresearch urolect, and who can work 'In trams with other students, preferablyfrom the behavioral sciences and other fields outside of medicine, can probe,for example:Conceptions of major problems in institutionalized medicine amongthe local medical community;Distribution of time within the practices of throe or. four physicians(introducing the student to the variety of practice styles);Cash flow within a medical clinic or group pract ice;Interaction betweim local medical community and third party paymentagencies;Career patterns of local medical professionals;Competing conceptions of health among local medical personnel;Consumer attitudes toward some aspect of local medical practice.5. Television Program-making: Provided the equipent to do the joband assigned a sensitive television production staffer, any three medicalstudents can make a meaningful thirty-minute television program in thetime it would take them to study one textbook. It is an uncanny coincidencethat what is required to make the television program is precisely and exactlywhat: is required to learn about something.Some imagination is needed to place this activity in a context where itcan serve the interests of students other than the participants themselves.FOY example, it is a simple. Matter to have a team of students tape a programpresenting the people and substance another team of students a P6 researching.It is a short step from here to teams of students wor,jng with the chiefof staff at a local hospital preparing an analysis of some problem of concernto his associates for which a date has been set aside where the studentsmake a presentation of their findings for the benefit of the staff as wellan to receive their critical reactions. From here melical students alongwith rwmhers of the medical community can move to wor?.:Ang with citizen's 393 committees in the analysis of local health problems. Study groups can beformed around this kind of enterprise.The acqWsition of a library.of tapes raises the possibility then that slodent!ihave amen,: to a series of studies of local medical problems nod cm) in.r,iit their own orient:It:ion to the community with the aid and support of winimulo tutorial assistance.6. Ca!:tydies: The preparation of a concise, narrative descriptionof the emergence, analysis and resolution of a problem has achieved aposition of importance in political science. The unique contribution ofthe narrative case study is that it typically deals not merely with theroots of a problem and its emergence as a full-fledged difficulty, but withalternative ways of dealing with it and so-called action issues. What is critical. here is that the narrative. case tends to promote the examinationof riot merely others ways of doing things, but of entirely different arrange-ments of goals and resources, means and ends, people and programs.Case studies of the building of a group practice clinic can be comparedwith case studies of maintaining a solo practice, or likewise, case studiesof group health or other prepaid medical care arrangements can be comparedwith the operation of a conventionally based medical care program in a smallcity, and each case could provide dramatic learning potentialities, forexample.7. Gaming and Simulating: The essence of simulation involves the distil-lation of a process into its essentials with the result that time is speededup and we are enabled to see three dimensionally, that is, the relationshipbetween the past, present and future. Simulations are perfect learning vehiclesfor students who find that they can easily and comfortably adapt to rolestipult:tions and vicariously experience a substantial portion of that whichthose 'on the firing line' have gone through. Manual simulations and games 394 of yarrow; ;()Yli are !:0 In()CIQ':1 in OW time demand:: they make that r.:Ludent!; can e;t!illy be provided with a series of gaming-simolAtieu packages thatenable them to experiment with some of the basic constructs of institutionalbehavior (within the context of medicine) in a matter of hours (for example,the dynamics of change [n. institutionalized medicine in a small city, orengaging in policy level decision7making about the form and functioning ofinstitutionalized medicine in such a city) .Because of the economy ofgaming-simulation as a learning device, it bears repeating that all of thiscan he accomplished within the time that might be invested in mastering a single textbook of major proportions.8. SuperyisedProblem7solvinv it is not a long; step from the kinds .eflearning activities inventoried above to the practicum type of experiencewhere the student takes independent responsibility for the analyss andformulation of a line of action intended to ameliorate some real world problem.This internship (as it is labeled in political science) and theclinical experience (medicine's label) is the logical consumation of manyof the learning techniques we have discussed above.When these techniques are used to embellish the suggested curriculapresented in Part IV, learning experiences of a profound and unique qualitywill. follow which could not be accomplished otherwise through the trad-itional format of medical education as we generally know it today.Part IVCURRICULA PROTOTYPESThe essential concerns of political .science in mlation to institution-alized medicine may be characterized as centering around change in its manyforms -- particularly for the interrelationships between change at several ]cvels and the way :; in which those interrelationships can be kept in align-ment with each other.- Several other dimensions-pertinent to '.the organization 395 of the substantive knowledge we have about politics can be rationalizedaround this focus of concern.Three levels In medicine's institutional operation can be stipulated a!:the haeie for course development: 1.The Local Health Care System (as the context for the practice ofmedicine).II..The Community (as the context,of the local health care system andat the same time the domain where contending or even competing'interests' are balanced).LH.The Regional and National Levels of Health Care Organization (asthe setting where major program values are defined and assignedresources).Obviously, these three levels of concern-are nested together in sucha way that each prOvides the context within which those above it take place.Equally important is the converse; that is, each provides the instrumentalitythrough which purposes and needs identified at the next higher level of insti-tutionalization goes into process. What we are talking of here is one bf thebasic precepts from the policy science that broad goals can only be forgedthrough the use of great nationwide political instrumentalities, whileservices must, perforce, be provided to one individual at a time through aprogram mechanism firmly seated in a locality. Embodied in this nestedconception of medicine is the postulate that one of the critical dynamicsin any great program of action is that of balancing expectations -- especiallyof those who are the local constituency for a program with service capa-bility; and achieving this balance within cost limits that are (a) adequateto sustain an effective level of programHoperation and (b) palatable in termsof competing demands for resources.The political scientist's concern asserts that politics involves bal-ancing costs with services on each of the levels of institutional organization.To put the matter in other terms, policy-making is asocial technology 396 developed as a means Cf.maintalning a moving balance between health needsand program capabilities which comprehends the relationship between the totalprogram costs and the benefits to a multiplicity of constituencies.lt is precisely because. any attempt to deal with problems such as thesewithout: a grasp or somo of the basics of politics are almost bound to lendto disaster that political science has become relevant to medicine. Which brings us to two questions anyone contemplating designing courses in thisare must consider: 1.What: Pre the key concepts that the student shall have to grasp tocome to grips with the problem-oriented policy-making at each level ofinstitutionalized medicine?2. What arc the most appropriate ].earning techniqUes through whichto articulate courses dealing with each of these kinds of concerns?Since the last two sections of this report have dealt with each of thesetwo questions in order, what we come to now is the mating of concepts withinstructional. teChniques-within the framework of prototypical courses. Three courses, each matched to one of the three headings listed above, are set down in the remainder of this part: of the report.*I. The Local Health Care System Asthe Context for the Practice of MedicineWhile the training and experience given a physician place a gross kindof limit on what he can and cannot do, the immediate determinates of hispractice, its style, thrust and character is the milieu in which he works.What kind of hospital (if any) does he ].ink himself to, what kinds ofspecialists are active in his area, what kinds of para-medical and other *ln each of the three course areas that are described below, two or moresuggested formats will be offered. The initial format may be thought: ofas comprehending the 'essential.' materials and the second, a 'desirable' wayof eNpanding upon this. In several cases 'specialized' materials goingbeye::d either of these formats .are suggested. 397 health-related personnel are tied into treatment activities here, and whatis the stance of third party payment agencies -- these are the kinds ofquestions immediately determinative of practice styles.It is not to these aspects of medicine per se that political scienceis pertinent, though. Rather it is the matter of thD kinds of changes one might expect that is' of concern. The factor that is critical to the manage-ment of one's own practice is the forces operating toward the stabilizationof the existing structure of a local health care program and the way inwhich they impinge on the forces operating toward program change.This course is framed to encompass the Local Health Care System andwould be in the range of first year students provided they were given suffic-ient tutorial assistance by competent behavioral scientists. Conceptsdiscussed earlier which might be mobilized are: 'Staffing' and staffingpatterns along with 'Mix of. Organizational. Types' to offer an initial handlefor getting a hold on the situation. With some understanding of these manifestdimensions of the local program the student can increase the depth ofhisunderstanding through insights into 'Creating Sets of Policy Makers' andby gaining a grasp on the 'Problems' extant in the program at a given point in time.A number of instructional strategies are relevant to this problemand these concepts.* A course could be divided into three units. .*Throughout this section the term 'class' shall be used- to signify a coursethat is' scheduled to meet one morning or one afternoon a week for threehours over the period of one quarter ten weeks.Class = 30 instructionor contact hours. 39 8 t1:During the first,readings dealing with the concepts coul d bekeyed toI eetues fol 1 owed by discussions , all of which were .designed tolot odnee the ::I aunt to the conceptual, framework needed to gain an under- ::tasti int; of the cseen tfal s of the heal Lb care. delivery system as a soel al. me eh an i em. Uni 1II:Mere, leaders from four areas of the health program in a 1 nhornt.e ry community cool d be brought to the cl ass /700111to di scuss televisionprograms describing (1) the hospital, (2) mental. health facilities, (3)community heal th planning, and () third party payment agencies.Unit ill: During a final. three weeks students could divide themselvesinto teams going to the laboratory community to probe the structure of eachof these- (or other) areas of the health program, preparing a set of papersthat were read by all the me.mbers of the class, then discussed with eachset of local.leaders who visited with the class during the second unit.For moreadvanced students, a somewhat more challenging course might be assembl.cd.A Seeond Format Uni t I. During an initial three weekunit of the coursestudents would: 1. View specially pi,epilred television tapes to introduce them to thecharacter, operation and problems of each of the component areas of thelaboratory community's health program. Tapes could be viewed at the student'sconvenience, but they would be keyed to the three afternoon's of discUssionandthe student would be expected to have worked with the tape until he hadidentified all of the questions lie would have . to ask to gain a reliablegraspofeach of the three central components of the local program.2. Reading materials keyed to the tapes would be provided to givethe student a grasp of how each component of the program was expected tooperate, the social. technologies through which it was organized, and aninsight into the problems that were typical of these activities in averagecommunities.3. ilalth leaders from the community, including those to whom thestudent had been introduced during his viewing of the tape, would visitwith the class for half. of each of three cl &ss periods, proViding themwith explanations going beyond the tapes and the reading materials andanswering their questions. 399 4. The last half of the class period would be devoted to students andtheir instructor in a review of the assigned component of the program,perhaps through the process of drawing diagrams representing the flow ofactivitiel: and the distribution of functions among the agencies and indi-viduals linked into this program area.A Second Format Units Il and III: Students would be expected to go toOw laboratory community during the last seven weeks of the class to under-take case studies of problems in at least two of the three program areas covered during the first unit of the course. The first order of businessduring the second unit would be the selection and definition of case studiesand the forming of the teams of students to undertake them.If, during the first unit of the course, faculty or staff had visitedthe community inviting individuals from across the community's healthprogram to serve as advisors to the teams, it would be possible to have afaculty member back-stopped by a resource group from the community. Theycould bring their detailed knowledge of local problems to bear on the casestudies during review sessions held with students once they were well intotheir analyses.In medical schools where residents in family medicine or some otherrelevant department were available to assist in this kind of learningexercise it would be possible to escalate the level of the learning task in several. ways:1. Instead of merely doing casual case studies, students might beencouraged to undertake the making of a television tape providing a visualpresentation of their analysis with the expectation that this wouldbecome part of a library of video tapes that would be used by succeedingclasses. 2. Instead of undertaking an analysis of some case, the work of studentsfrom year to year might be so coordinated that some students would take acase study of a problem completed during the previous year as a problemto which they would seek solutions. Local advisory groups as well as setsof faculty with relevant competencies would be mobilized to assist teachingfaculty in following and preparing a critique of the course of each study. 400 Recommendations would be presented co the relevant operating officials andtheir responses would become part of the student's feedback for the project.11. The Community As the Context Forthe local Hell th Service Del i very ro,,ramlt is at the 'eve/ of the community where the criss-cross of tensions both within and between programs are_ most easily seen. Charges leviedagainst health providers by organized interests suddenly lose much of theirpejorative quality when they are put in context alongside of (a) the fullspectrum of claims coming to bear upon health leaders and (b) the competitiveclaims of other programs for limited community resources.From the political scientist's point of view, dealing with this unstablecompounding of interests reduces itself Co finding a way of balancing claimswith capabilities by factoring out the complimentary purposes from a wholespectrum of claims and providing well conceived program mechanisms forachieving these. The concepts he relies on for doing this are in the matrixdiscussed earlier; i.e.,.program leadership, consumer participation, programadaptation, and forging policy alternatives.That the physician of the future must he equipped to take an effectivepart.in program leadership is one of the thrusts of the work of this committee;the question, then, becomes one of what the student needs to understand inorder to equip himself for taking initiatives in program development.The policy science's answer to this question is that program leadershippivots round the-analysis of tensions (both those within and those amongcommunity programs). It then identifies what these imply by way of program change.This is pivotal, but not the only function of program leadership,however.Undertaking a change in a program is a costly enterprise. Toconnumate change, leadership must enlist those who can speak for consumerson the one hand and those who have the profL;F:ional abilities to devise 401 the modiftcations in existing program arrangements on the other and'then induce the:;e people to undertake t1n forging of policy alternatives.Obviously, we cannot hope to do more than introduce the student to theintricacies of program leadership during the span of a single course, hoping thathey. will pursue: postgradunte training, in management if he wishes to prepare him!; c11 fully here. What kinds of introductory experiences might be most useful?Several suggest themselves:Unit 1: During an introductory unit of 3 weeks, one instructionalformat could be organized around the development of a case history of twoepisodes of program leadership in a laboratory community, one which is viewedas successful and another that is seen as leaving something to be desired.Lectures and reading materials might be used to sketch in the context of program leadership.. During this period the instructor would identifyindividuals from the laboratory community willing to act: as sponsors for thecase history; during the first unit they could discuss what would be involvedin one versus another possible study.Unit: II: Students then could assemble themselves into teams at thebeginning of the fourth week of the course by opting, for a given pair of case hisUnit TIT: At the end of the second unit of the course (in the sixth or seventh week) , reports on less than successful studies of program leader-ship could be circulated as a background for the pr&bings of effectiveincidents of program leadership.A Second Format: This course might emphasize the multitude of studies.which students of management have produced during the past quarter century.Sets of readings dealing with aspects of each of the four cell headingsin the mtrix could be assembled; the could be discussed during the first 402 half of the weekly seminar period and a resource person either from the faculty ofthe behavioral sciences or from the ranks of health leadershipcould he induced to Mu:AI:Ito. how these concepts g.r, Into process as offeetive leader:;hip r,e li vily. A Third Format.: The mode. for the organization of this course, providinga much more intensive experience, would involve students being 'buirt into'policy dialogues in a laboratory community. Since there are always, moreproblowthan there is time, health leaders are more than willing to workwith medical students who are adequately supervised in making a frontalatt.eck on a local problem that is not viewed as controversial. In this casestudents would_be briefed by community leaders during the first unit of thecourse; they could also be expected to delve into the literature relevant to the problem. During the remainder of the course they would divide upinto teams working on various aspects of the probleml -7 in full consultationwith sets of community-leaders previously mobilized iby the instructor.The last two meetings of the course would be devoted to producing an analysisof the problem and spinning out alternatives in consultation with community leaders. III. Regional and National Levels'of Health Care OrganizationBeyond the reaches of community a subtle but imvidious complexityintrudes itself into the processes of our understanding health problems;regional and national dimensions of health care can never be experiencedby any one person. To put the matter as the policy scientist would phraseit, problem solving at the top levels of institutionalized medicine --must he carried on through'rellance upon models, information processingand the-ratLonal extrapolation of consequences from indices (rather thanfrom experience with what'has happened in the past). 403 If, that is, we are to maintain a workable balance between our capabilityto produce and provide heAlth care and our expectations as to what thisshould consist of, we must learn to u$e an intricate social technology nowemorgLng through the efforts of the policy sciences. How can we best intro-duce the medical student to this elaborate body of knowledge with a jargonas inscrutable as that of medicine itself?As is the case with any body of technical knowledge acquisition ofvocabulary and elemental principles is the first order business and eitherprogrammed learning strategies or the traditional classroom lecture suggestthemselves as the most efficient way to present this to the 'ent.Systems is certainly the key word in all of this for it is casting the par-ticulars of institutionalized medicine within the confines of a system'smodel that marks the point from which the student must begin in developingthe capacity to comprehend the larger dimensions of health as a nationalprogram of action. The central. ;question around which policy-making at this level rotates'is what kinds of resources can be committed to what kinds. of new programsor reorganized programs to_achieve what kinds of revised sets of expectations.The simplest way of attacking this matter is to provide the student witha coherent model of health as a dynamic system and to so form this modelthat indicators of health care effectiveness can be processdd through themodel to provide indices of health care accomplishments. Once. he studenthas had the opportunity to familiarize himself with the model he can moveon to the critical learning task: What kinds of changes have to be made in(1) inputs and (2) program structure to realize (3) specified changes inoutputs? 404 lJniI1,I1anti 10) 1f a course is broken in to three learni ng unit:;of throe, four and three week's duration respectively, the first unit canbe devoted Its familiarization with vocabulary and principles, the second to node's Land i at in (or sUV L111'11)d the dynami. C( ftUllamuch1!\",and the last unit to the processing of differcnt sets of outpuL and input:data to dh; over the changes in program structure that are required if thestipulated shifts in program outcomes are to be realized.A Second Format:: A course that covers a good deal more than theseessentials can he elaborated. First, a learning program keyed to a textbook can be coordinated with a set of television tapes providing the studentwith (a)a discursive introduction to policy science, (b) the primary objec- tives of policy-making, and (c.) the most frequently disruptive problemsin dealing with national health care. A four week introductory unit couldbe developed giving the student a solid grounding in the policy sciences approach.A second three week unit could be devised introducing the studentto a computor simulation. Were Lids unit accompanied by lectures and demon-strations whore the student came to grips with the static and dynamic elementsof the computor program as well as television' tapes explaining the tech-nicalities of the operation of the program, the student could reify hisabstract underStandings from the first unit into concretized conceptionslinked to the computor simulation.- A third unit based upon classroom dis-cussions of how the dynamics of the nation's health system went into process,keyed to a series of assignments where the student programmed alternativekinds of policy-decisions into the computor, would complete. the student'sintroduction to health as a national program of action.A Third. Format: Were the resources for the development of a still moreaelaborate learnin:r; proLrom available, this corvuter-ba,;ed strategy furinstruction could be implemnted with a man-machine simulation where groups 405 of students playing the roles of each of the central actors in health policy- making could make decisions which were then processed by the c7omputor to indicate 'real world' consequepces. 406 Section C ) KnowledgeInto Health Practice Weisenberg, Ph.D. OrRanizational Forms for Medical Behavioral Science 1.)17.(18.1-amsEvan G. Pattishall, Jr., Ph.D., M.D. 407 TRANSFORMATION liEHAVIORAL SCIENCE INTO HEALTH PRACTICE Matisyohu Weisenberg, Ph.D.University of ConnecticUtHealth Center 409 KNOWLEDGE.INTO HEALTH PRACTICE ;Matisyohu Wcisenberg, Ph.D.University of Connecticut Health Center In defining. the content of social and behavioral science teachingin the medical school setting, an important ingredient for considerationis the extent Lo which this information can be converted by the studentor physician into usable or relevant material. ,There has to be thecom4Lant question of \"Why does a medical student have to know this?\"ThIs question, although seemingly simple and some might even say obvious,Is extremely complex and presents many problems. Anyone teaching medicalstudents becomes aware quite soon that he cannot transfer his lecturesstraight from graduate,-academic teaching, without being asked why themedical student must know that material. Faculty are often reminded ofthe difference between behavioral science and the \"real stuff\" thatcounts in becoming a physician. These questions are raised by non- ,behavioral science faculty as well as by students.AL the same time, behavioral scientists may experience resistance'and possibly some feelings of guilt or betrayal to a parent discipline,in presenting what might be considered as a watered down version of material.Yet, presenting detailed data, methodology and theory withall of their implications may not be possible,given time limitations,and may not even be desirable or necessary. The behavioral scientistLeaches students who are to become capable physicians, not behavioralscientists and is therefore limited by the constraints of the medical school setting. * Written for the study of Teaching Behavioral Sciences in Medical Schools. 411 Given the great time demands made on the medical student, itbecomes imperative to define clearly what should be included. Basicscience courses that are well entrenched, such as biochemistry, physiology,etc. are increasingly going to be called on to have a sharper focusof presentation to eliminate what does not seem relevant or necessary.Behavioral science courses that are not so well entrenched cannotafford the luxury of the traditional basic science courses and musttherefore, from the beginning, demonstrate relevance and convertibility.What is meant by behavioral science convertibility is the extentto which these materials can be translated so as to be perceived andaccepted by medical students as relevant, useful and needed by thecompetent physician. There are some behavioral science areas that bytheir very contents are more convertible. Other areas that are notas apparent, may become convertible by the methods used in presentationso that students become convinced of their relevance. Some behavioralscience materials have application to a wide range of activities, whileothers are more limited. Some are convertible to activities directlyrelated to patient care, while other information aimed at the studenthimself, might be indirectly convertible.Convertibility is not a simple dimension and it cannot be definedindependently from the target and purpose of the teaching, the activitiesand needs of the student and physician, and the specific contents of thepresentation.It is also affected by the nature of the availabledata.What may be considered convertible and relevant under one situationwould not be under other circumstances. Thus, the detailed researchprocedures involved in assessing attitudes may be of vital importancein a research seminar whose purpose is to teach future public health 412 phrdc1:m; how tonssess re;:cI ofstudents who are only concernedwith the resultsofthe study and how it would affect pat tentmanagement.The various dimensions of convertibility will be examined intitis paper and examples of possible content will be presented to fitthem.'t'heseexamples should be viewed as suggestionsbased on theexpericnce of several schools and the opinions of the author. In most 4'a -at here arc no systematic research data on which to base firmcone! its ions.Thebas-ftconsideration for elabora Lion of these variousd owns i oilsof convertibill ty is the past history of not en tire] ysuccessful programs and at the same time the burgeoning number ofteaching programs in medical. schools, many of them seeking to benefitiron the experience of others. Although each school must ultimatelyde idcits ownteaching content based on its own unique situation and:Iva I lableresources, itis the hope of the writer that the suggestionspresented ran help inthischoice byPointing to some of the alternatives. I. Target of Convertibility_The goal of social and behavioral science teaching cannot always he viewed as being the specific clinical activity - -as one physiciandescribed it \"laying his hands on the patient: At times it is themanner in which the hands are \"laid on\" or the setting in which this takes place.There are at least three targets for behavioral scienceLeaching: 1) physician attitudes, 2) physician skills and 3) themedical care system. 413 A.Physician AttitudesThis refers to the attempt at developing an approach to healthcare rather than relating to any specific technique or skill. Specificcontent Ls almost unimportant and may change from year to year withoutreally changing the direction of the teaching.There are examples at many schools. Generally, the student hasto have \"remonstrated that he applies high ethical standards in hisprofessional behavior. Demonstrated positive attitudes towards caringfor the sick and maintaining the health of the well.\" The physicianmust learn to deal with the person, not the illness.The student is told that as a professional and the expert inmedical care his responsibility will go beyond the single patient to the community as a whole. It is therefore important for him to acceptthis role and actively be concerned for the medical problems of hiscommunity and his nation. Many of the issues to be discussed laterunder Social Action are also important here.The approach the student takes to many of the medical-social issuessuch as drug abuse, alcoholism, abortion, etc. enters into the attitude domain as well. By and large the attitude desired is non-judgmental;that is, the student should prevent his personal and_moral judgmentsfrom compromising the type of care rendered. This attitude also needs to be applied when treating across class lines. Many students feeluncomfortable dealing with the poor and with members of different cultural groups.Another basic predisposition concerns many of the social diseases as well as other health problems, and is an alternative to the medical model of disease. The latter emphasizes the one-to-one doctor-patient relationship and seeks cures by medication even for day -to -day normal 414 problems of livingattempts to cope with and master the normal anxieties and worries. Content here might involve group processes,the role of patient motivation as a means of understanding and dealingwith problems of deviance and coping. Not every disease is theresult of a microbe that can he cured by its removal. Very few schoolchildren require medication because of brain damage. Most schoolproblem-hildren con be helped by being motivated through the use ofbetter leaching methods.The self-understanding of the medical student, why he chosemedicine as a career, what takes place during his socialization intoLhe field, the awesome pOwers he will acquire and the way in whichhe will view his responsibilities is another content area that aims at revealing underlying attitudes. It is mainly an outgrowth of thesociological study of professions and would be classed as the sociology of medicine.Willi current development of team practice concepts and increasinguse of all kinds of auxiliaries, including non-professional community.aides, ihe'soctology of medicine can be significant for preparingthe student for the future practice of medicine. Depending on how itis presented, it could lead to an understanding of how effectiveutilizaLion of non-physicians could benefit himself. SensitivityLraining could he an experiential method for helping the studentunderstand and feel what he was taught. B. Physician SkillsMany of the skills which the student is to acquire throughbehavioral science teaching will be mentioned later. These includeinterviewing skills with an understanding that the patient's definition 415 of health and disease, the manner in which he presents his symptomsand the kind of treatment he is willing to accept are partiallydetermined by the social and cultural groups to which he belongs.The student is usually made aware of how to interpret the expressionof emotion and feeling as well as the meaning of the manifest verbal content.Another skill related to interviewing is observation of behavior.Many schools offer the student the opportunity to observe behavior underdifferent curcumstances, analyze what was observed and relate it to didactic material. Thus, for example, students may be asked to observeand compare the behavior of a group of nursery school children anda group of teenagers and relate their behaviors to their normaldevelopmental stages as described in the literature. In other casesstudents have been asked to observe and classify the behavior of apatient in terms of his being normal, neurotic or psychotic.From a teaching point of view it should be readily apparent thatskills are acquired best when they are actually used and experiencedby the student. Unfortunately the opportunity to use skills, especiallyduring the clinical years of training, does not frequently involve thebehavioral scientist.It is felt by many physicians that having an M.D. degree hauendowed them with the ability to undertake many activities that thoseof other disciplines have spent years acquiring. This is especiallytrue of research skills. It is not necessary to repeat the laterdiscussion of research activity by physicians. Suffice it to say thatteaching the knowledge of research technique and skills is an areafrequently undertaken by behavioral scientists. It has as one of its 416 gools Instilling In the physician n critical ability with which reuenrch reports :1-1 In journals and judge the efficocy ofnewly thot medical decIsionm are not modeOnly 1M informotion from detail men, authority figures and anecdotes. It' can also help those students who would like to conduct researchas well as provide clinical services. C. Medicol Core SystemAnother target of behavioral science, teaching is the medicalstudent os n potential change agent of the medical. care system in general.The Implicit assumption Is that since the student has notdeveloped vested Ipterests In N given system of care, and since hewill hove the power to deal with the future care problems, it is bestLo prosenL to him what seem to he the problems of the current systemand how it might be changed. Usually included in these discussionsarc materials concerning the utilization of care, distribution ofservices and manpower, problems of access, and methods of dealing with them.The effects of different types of finance systems, organizationalarrangements, use of automation, auxiliaries, and other solutions suchits the various health insurance bills in Congress, also have beenused os content.The expectation is that it is possible to solve problems byhelping those who come out of the pipeline to be more sympatheticLo varied points of view or by encouraging them to enter communitymedicine as a field. Too frequently, this approach fails to providefollow-through during the clinical years except for those who do electcommunity medicine as a field. 417 11.Convertibility by Method of PresentationThe method of presentation is of central concern for achievingmaximum effectiveness. The same information can be more or lesseffective in achieving its desired outcome depending on how it is presented.Relevance has often not been achieved because behavioralscientists have failed to gain acceptance of their materials.It thus becomes partially a matter of plausibility. A.Passive Versus Active ParticipationThe traditional approach has the professor in front of theclassroom lecturing during most of the classtime. Medical studentsare quite used to this system. However, for the most effectivepresentation of social and behavioral science materials a more ac(ivestudent involvement has been found to be important. Several formsof such teaching are possible.An approach that is gaining in popularity is the seminar system.This involves the breaking down of the class into small sections so asto allow for a maximum of personal contact, student discussion andstudent presentations. In some cases the entire course is run onthis basis with all students covering basically the same materialsin each seminar section. In other cases students are given achoice of several different seminars from which they must choose one or two. Another variation has students choose a seminar section that isused as an in-depth means of covering a selected portion of the materialspresented in plenary sessions. It is extremely effective in developing 41E\\ close ties between students and behavioral science faculty while at!he same time al towing for a greater optimization in the use of plenary ::essions.As an example, a group of students presented a debate lorIhoir class based on the materials covered in their seminar. Thissession was much more useful in involving the rest of the class inthe issue as compared to an ordinary lecture.Emphasis on seminars should not be taken as a condemnation of all lectures.But their use has been one of the easiest ways of gainingacceptance through more active student involvement in the learningprocess with. the possibility of developing a close student-faculty relationship.The seminar is not, however, necessarily the mc)st efficient way oldelivering Information to a large group of people. This consideration would be especially important for a 'school with a largestudent body and 'a small number of behavioral science faculty, makingclass division impractical.There are, however, other means of producing a more active involvement in the learning process. These would include class demon-strations using students, e.g.,_ autokinetic phenomena; debates, e.g.national health materials, e.g.. statisticalconcepts:and laboratories, e.g. emotional role playing.Field trips can also produce an active .involvement in the learning process.However,. these trips are viewed as a waste of precious timeif they become merely sight.3eeing trips where students see some buildings.They have to be able to experience what is happening at the place visited.This could be done through some form of participant observationor by starting with some predetermined assignment for collecting specific 419 data.An added caution would be to use trips sparingly since theyoften do consume more than the usual amount of class time.Whichever approach is used they are all geared to greater studentacceptance of behavioral science concepts by capitalizing on the in-fluence process and making learning more interesting and compelling.Active student involvement has been by far more influential than othermethods, at least as measured by students' reports of how they were\"turned on.\"B. Relating Data to Specific PatientsWherever possible, translation of behavioral science conceptscan be made by use of specific patients. as case histories. Relevanceis thus made immediately apparent. In one school, behavioral sciencecourses use patients in the following manner. There i6 a handout ofall the information and concepts to be covered in the lecture. Classtime is used for a discussion and elaboration of these concepts andfor a student-faculty dialogue. This is followed by a live-patientpresentation for the purpose of demonstrating the concepts. The laststep in the process involves a discussion and integration of the patientpresentation with the handout. The contents of the handout areimportant ingredients for the student to take with him so he doesnot feel that the patient presentation was a waste of time as medicalstudents are oriented to substantive content.There are several ways in which patients can be presented.The patient might be brought before the class or the class couldobserve the patient from behind a one-way glass. Since it is not 420 always possible to have a patient available for specific conceptsto be illustrated, it is possible to prepare video tapes ofselected patients and use these in class. There are also available.good films that Illustrate with specific patients the points of apresentation beyond the scope of any particular health center. itisimportant, however, to preview such films and follow their presentationby class disco 'ion. C. CaSe Conferences and Rounds Itis vital to continue behavioral science input into theclinical years. Case conferences and rounds represent an important avenuefor behavioral science education in the clinical years. It may take timefor non-behavioral science faculty to become adjusted to behavioralscience Input in such situations, but they have been made welcome once itIs seen they have something to contribute.The behavioraL scientist on the other hand, can use these opport-unities as, a means of self-education so he can make his own teachingmore relevant. He must also be prepared to discuss a specific patient from Lhe standpoint of the individual clinician. Generalities maynot be sufficient. However, the payoff of seeing earlier teachingapplied in a meaningful way can be extremely gratifying to the facultyand student and makes it more likely to be adapted by. the studentto practice after completing school. III. Physician ActivesOne approach to measuring convertibility of behaviorai scienceknowledge would be based upon the activities to which this knowledge 421 would be applied. As is true of any definition of convertibility,content would have a continuum of relatedness to a set of activitieswith some areas being more directly related than-others. Of course,the degree to whiCh it may be perceived as related depends upon thefocus and method of presentation. There are several activity categoriesthat can be delineated: diagnosis, patient management, research,community health and medical care organizations, social actionand office management. A. Diagnosis This category would include the kind of knowledge and skills neededto elicit diagnostic information. Examples include such content asinterviewing and history taking. These have been taught as inter-disciplinary subjects where the behavioral scientists attempted to sensitizethe student to the different possible modes of communication and tothe methods of evaluating them. Related to the history taking isthe social epidemiology of disease that can be designed to aid indiagnosis, e.g. to differentiate between the likelihood of pheumoniaor T.B. depending on the social background of the patient.One school emphasized as an objective \"identifying behaviorsassociated with specific diseases and disease systems throughoutmedicine.\"A course in Behavioral Medicine was offered in the secondyear that emphasized the psychosomatic, stress and emotional factorsin illness, including such things as the behavioral aspects of G.I.disease, liver disease and behavior, reproduction and behavior,cardiovascular disease and behavior, and the social epidemiology ofdisease.During the third year the social, cultural and behavioral 422 factors that played -a part in the etiology of an illness were emphasizedduring clinical rounds as related to specific patients.It might be pointed out that there are very few schools offering!nich exlensive behavioral science contributions for the actualclinical activities of the sLudent. This Is partially due to the lack 01knowledge of the potential contribution of behavioral science,especially on rounds, the general lack of continuity between basicand clinical sciences, the lack of a sufficient faculty, and often theimprecise nature of social and behavioral science data.Many schools do offer growth and development course materialwhose convertibility to actual. patient diagnosis depends to a greatextent upon the way it is taught. Growth and development has been anarea claimed by many psychiatrists as. belonging to their domain andconsequently it has often been approached from a psychiatric, psyschoannlytically oriented frame of reference. Although this informationcan be helpful, it is of limited usefulness in patient diagnosis outsideof the psychiatric and psychopathological domain. Growth and development,however, could include a greater emphasis on the normal progressionfrom conception to death with emphasis upon the differences betweenvarious stages and how they affect such things as the manner in whichsymptoms are presented, the limitations imposed by the maturation processes, the effects of the normal aging process and so forth. Potentially,such information should he extremely useful. to many kinds of physicians,such as the pediatrician, gynecologist and the internist who isconcerned with the aged, as well as the psychiatrist.The doctorpatient relationship (materials in addition Lointerviewing) is another area covered by many schools. it should be 423 highly convertible both for diagnosis and for patient managementespecially for the establishment of trust and for the continuationOf contact in the medical care system. Unfortunately, most schoolslimit such course content to the basic science years and have verylittle continuation into the clinical years where it should betranslated into the action that matters most.One area neglected by many schools involves the potentiallyuseful diagnostic instruments found in psychological testing.Although physicians may not become competent in their administration,they could be made aware of their existence, the information thatthey yield as well as the meaning of such concepts as standardization,reliability and validity that are so necessary for understandingtest limitations and possible interpretations. This latter point wasbrought out in a recent class discussion of I.Q. testing. The students felt that there were too many instances of test misuse. Faculty membershad the opportunity to explain that standardization and test constructionprocedures allow the examiner to know at least his margin of error. Atest is useful when that margin of error is substantially less than theerror to be expected when not using a test. These points concerningtest interpretation apply equally well to accepted medical diagnostictests, such as T.B. chest x-ray, diabetes tests, etc. but frequentlytheir margin of error and methods for their evaluation are never conveyed to the student. B. Patient ManagementMany of the content areas mentioned earlier have relevance topatient management, e.g., doctor-patient relationship, growth and 424 development, etc. Social and behavioral sciences can bring to bear allof the cultural, social, and psychological and economic factors that r;In attectlice outcome or LrOniMelii. These would include such things aspatient expectations in regard to care, the assumplinn of [he sick role, and the el louts of the sickness on the family. The effects of stress,anxiety, reactions to pain and placebos are topics that can be extremely usefulEn the student especially if these are translated into meaningfulexperiences with actual patients. Much of medicine is directed at this area.A good deal of interest in patient management relates to patientcompliance with physician instruct ions, i.e., patient motivation. Thisreflects the fact that therapy often seems to be unsuccessful becausethe patient disregards the advice of his physician by not taking medication or nottaking it NS indicated, not refraining from poor health habits, suchas smoking, nor establishing sound health behavior, such as exercising.Under such conditions, many treatment failures have resulted. One caninclude in this treatment of obesity, smoking, alcoholism, drug abuseand many other diseases that are combatted through patient observance of N regimen.Some of these are further complicated by social stigmaand legal restrictions, e.g., alcoholism and drug abuse.Successful treatment involves using the information and skillsnecessary to persuade the patient to accept the .regimen and help himeliminate habits that are incompatible with the desired outcome.Where motivation is the central problem, the use of group pressure andempathy have helped achieve beneficial behavior better than reliance ona one-to-one interaction, e.g., Alcoholics Anonymous, Weight Watchers. 425 To use these techniques in patient management the health practitionershould have knowledge of the principles of group dynamics and their uses.Many of these concepts also can be applied to reducing stressand discomfort of treatment. Thus members of a patient's family orother significant individuals can help the physician reduce trauma ina difficult situation, e.g., the presence of the father in natural child-birth, the mother who stays in the hospital with a sick child, the clergy-man who is a member of the medical team.Other people such as these are especially meaningful to the dying patient.He has a tremendous need to tell all the things that arebothering him or specifically what he wants done before his passing sohe can depart in peace.It is interesting to note that first-year medical students havebeen extremely receptive to this information on the dying patients.Perhaps this is the time to impart this knowledge since they are notyet personally involved and need not feel defensive.Powerful psychological tools for inducing desired behavior are thetechniques of behavior modification that have grown out of the experimentallaboratory.Increasingly, they have been applied to patient managementto help reduce chronic pain, to eliminate fear and anxieties throughdesensitization and progressive relaxation, to aid in management ofobesity, alcoholism, and smoking behavior and currently--through the useof biofeedback--in cases of tension headache. Hopefully, in the nearfuture such techniques will be used to help in many other areas suchas hypertension or fractures. Several schools include these areas astopics for seminars or lectures. However, the great usefulness of thesetechniques has yet to be actualized through experimental evaluation 426 In;1)ocilic clinical situations and widespread application.A frequently overlooked area of patient management is theeconomic impart of lreatmont. The best treatment plan may have to be :0ir there arc no lundH available to pay for it. A physicianshould be aware or the sources or funds and the effects of various;alternative plans on the treatment process and on the f:mily or the patient. Iffollowing a regimen means that the patient might loseseveral days pay LI is would reduce the likelihood of successfulcompliance. ALtimes Lhe economic problem becomes expressed in terms ofrelative values where the patient as a consumer might choose betweenmedical treatment or a color T.V. The task of a physician is to under-:timid those relative value differences and deal wiLh them in such a moniwr o:-;to promote the palionl.'s health, The physician cannot. assumethat Hine health is his number one priority the same is Irue of his pal .Teaching in the area of patient management has been handicappedby the same problem as with teaching patient diagnosis--most schoolsconcentrate on these topics during the basic medical science years andnearly negiecl. them in the clinical years. When there is input in the taller,it may he limited to occasional clinical case conferences. C. Re-tearthNotably, many medical students are less than enthusiastic aboutthe details of research methodology. Despite-this there are groups ofstudents who are interested in conducting their own research or atleast in being knowledgeable concerning the methods of gathering data. 427 Some schools offer seminars or courses such as \"Quantification andQualification in Medicine.\" These deal with research methodology as Itapplies to the medical literature and offer an introduction is computersand their use. Such courses are designed to give the student anappreciation of some statistical principles, their interpretation, andto some extent, an understanding of data gathering methods.In some schools, medical students are required to carry out aprojectthat requires at least some knowledge of research requirements.It is important to realize, however, that many of these are not ex-clusively or characteristically associated with behavioral science either, in method or content. A good deal depends on whether behavioralscience faculty are involved, either by virtue of student choice orat Limes because there is no one else to teach this subject matter.From a content point of view, research seminars could be limitedS.... Ito methodology as applied to medicine or could include a specific emphasis- -such as methods for health services research. One school offers medicalstudents a program leading to a master's degree in one of the behavioralsciences in addition to the M.D. degree.Content of research seminars, however, need not be limited tomethodology.They could include any area of behavioral science in whicha student is interested. Courses similar to these in the traditionalbasic science may be attractive to students with research interestsin that domain. They could cover the so-called bio-behavioral area,including such topics as CNS function and behavior, the autonomicnervous system and emotion, biofeedback and autonomic conditioning,behavioral physiology and pharmacology, etc. Students oriented toward community and preventive medicine may be moreinterested in courses dealing with health services organizations,determination of community health needs, evaluation of care, andpidemieloAlal methods.In general excipt for some hlostatisties, most research relatedteaching is done on an elective basis with small groups of students.Leaching usually is extremely gratifying both to students and triobecause of strong motivation ordinarily present when dealing with all. area of personal. interest. However, exposing all medicalstudents to research methodology as a program objective has not netwith very much success: Perhaps this could be accomplished withbetter Leaching techhiques such as programmed instruction and self- learning approaches. Use of clinical material as a starting point isanother possibility. In addition to specific course content, it is .necessary to encourage an overall. intellectual environment on campusthat motivates students to evaluate the evidence, bibliographicalcitation, and possible sources of conflict due to methodological errors. H.Community Health and Medical Care OrganizationMany schools offer courses, seminars, or series of lecturesdealing with the health and medical care system. They- are intended tohelp the student understand conceptually and practically what the presenthealth care system is like and how it might change in the future..Such courses often include content dealing with the economics of healthcare delivery, health manpower, quality of care, the utilization anddistribution of health care and possibly some comparisons of the U. S. 429 care system with those of other countries.Successful use of such course material depends greatly on makingit meaningful to students in terms of their day-to-day activities.Except for the student who is particularly interested in public healthand community medicine as a career, all too often this material isviewed as irrelevant to actual patient care. Most medical schools donot provide students the opportunity to practice medicine using alternativesystems of care described in such courses. Clinical training is basedupon the one-to-one doctor-patient relationship. Rarely does thestudent deliver care as part of a health team giving him experiencewith other health professionals. Most do not know what it mightmean to practice in a neighborhood health center, a private office,group practice, or health department. The student is socialized intohis profession with expectations of keeping to the mode of practicehis preceptors learned 20 years ago. In essence, the student is givena conflicting message. His courses in medical care organization tellhim of the importance of new forms of delivery. Yet, in clinical trainingby the provision of only the traditional model of care, his clinicalpreceptors are apparently telling him that the other models are notthat important for the practice of quality care.Community health course material usually deals with more than thesingle patient unit. It may involve community-wide problems or national issues that do not seem to have an obvious bearing on day-to-day patient care.One school lists as an objective in this area: \"To appreciatethe involvement of the health professional in the national process ofhealth care delivery.\" Such an objective may be considered by the studentto be \"interesting\" but of little relevance to him--\"That isn't real medicine.\"Thus, it behooves behavioral and social scientists to translate this materialin such a manner as to make it meaningful.. SuchI ranslation can be helped through active student involvement in course content ,Ihrongh strategic placement or (hhi material in the curriculum noloundalion I orItIran keen laid, and throngh nctualexperience in providing care under differing systems of health caredelivery.Teaching of health care delivery systems and organizations mayinclude some of the basic concepts of organizational theory. Theseconcepts must also be given relevance and not left at the level ofsociological theory. A valuable approach would he to examine thosesettings in which the student is most directly involved as a starting point, such :is his own hospital and outpatient clinic. Principlesof organizational theory and their implications for direct patient caremight be extracted from the immediate setting. At that poinspeculationabout alternatives becomes meaningful. in one school where the instructorattempted to present such material at the love] of sociological theory,IL was received as \"obvious\", a \"waste of time\" and as \"why do we haveto know this.\"Where possible it is desirable to have some real life experiences.A field trip might help this area come alive. Some successful examples have been:a 48 hour stay in an inner city area, interviews with patientsin their home environments concerning time barriers they faced in obtainingcare, examination of how people in a rural setting obtain care, interview-ing patients concerning the ways they finance care, and interviewingprogram directors and patients with regard to the effects of specificprograms such as family planning. 431 E. Social Action Frequently social and behavioral scientists have been looked to fordevelopment of a sense of social consciousness in medical students.Their critics, especially those who fear change of the status quo, use thisto argue that social and behavioral science really has no substance tocontribute to medical education, only rhetoric. Social and behavioralscientists have been cast in such roles partly as a result of the typeof researchwhich they engaged, e.g., class structure, and partlybecause such concepts as cultural relativity tolerate a variety ofapproaches for doing things and are antithetical to prejudice, discrimin-ation, and a double standard of medical care. Courses have included studyof the welfare system and its problems, consumer involvement, methodsof change in the ghetto and poverty, ethnicity and health. One seminarattempted to involve students beyond a single course by encouraging themto take on an action project which might continue over the whole four-year medical school experience.With social action, terms such as relevance do not refer so muchto actual patient care as to social responsibity by the medical careestablishment to unmet, but perceived needs. Medical students haveserved as advocates to poverty groups helping them find their waythrough the medical care maze. In some cases medical students have begunproviding care in geographical areas where it did not exist, ocasionallyforcing the University to take over responsibility for care in a region.Not all students or behavioral science faculty express equal interest in social action. In cases where such materials are presented to thewhole student body some degree of background preparation seems in order.Otherwise critical examination of the present medical care 432 system may produce resentment and defensiveness with the potential ofproducing the opposite of intended results. As mentioned in a previoussection, teaching methods that are experiential in nature probably willhave a greater impact on the student with a greater potential forapplication in actual clinical practice. V. offiixe Man).B.emenLPartly as a result of inchistriai psychology and its relationshipto management problems, social and behavioral scientists have beenviewed by some as potential sources of information on practice management.Al one school this is offered in a seminar cailed\"Management Conceptsfur Future Physicians.\" Many social and behavioral scientists resentthis and wish to dissociate themselves from such course content.However, potentially this is an area where the future physician could be reached- -his pocketbook. It should be possible to include suchconcepts as the greater use of auxiliaries and teams in the delivery ofcare, methods of choosing practice location, especially in geographicalregions with scarcity of care, sources of financing of. care, and health insurance.Onc extremely promising topic under office management is the medical record. This document can be used for the most readily convertibleapplication of social and behavioral knowledge, especially if It ismaintained with a problem-oriented point of view. Social and behavioralscientists must, however, be prepared to spell out in great detail howsuch information might be used in the delivery of patient care. Thishas nut been done to date in most schools.In at least one place, behavioral science preceptors make it apractice to examine the clinical. records of medical students to seeif social and behavioral science information is included. It is through 433 such efforts that, from the very beginning of training, social andbehavioral science considerations become an integral part of medicalcare and are likely to be applied in day-to-day practice after thestudent graduates.Another area related to office management that is beginning toreceive more attention lately is sensitivity training for medical students.This is designed to instill a greater understanding of inter-group relationships--to enhance awareness of the impression the studentmakes on others and how he relates to others. This might be especiallyhelpful in analyzing how the physician relates to his office staff,nurses and other auxiliaries. Satisfaction in interpersonal relationscan help cut staff turnover with all the savings that this brings. IV. Nature of the DataOne of the most important issues facing the behavioral scientistwho is interested in converting his knowledge to clinical applicationis the nature of his data versus the clinical needs of patients.Psychologists long ago debated this issue in terms of the differencebetween group data useful for general theoretical formulation, whatAllport called nomothetic, as opposed to the type of data needed forclinical prediction, called idiographic theory.*There is thus a difference in the degree of reliability requiredfor a clinical instrument, such as an I.Q. test, when applied to aspecific patient as opposed to the useof the instrument forresearch purposes where comparisons are to be made between groups ofsubjects receiving different treatments. In the former situation, *Allport, G. W. The psychologist's frame of reference. PsychologicalBulletin, 1940, 37: 1-28. 434 reIinhiIilies in the .90 range ar.o desirable while for researchpurposes an investigator can tolerate reliabilities in the .60 rangeand,still find statistical differences between groups.Much of the data referred to in teaching by behavioral scientistshas been gathered :for research purposes and with significance obtainedby comparison between groups as a function of different treatments oras a func(Aon of different groupings such as social class. Middle ClassSocial Clan:-;sLower ClassPreventive Health Behavior No Yes Fl20% 80%60% 40%100% 100%100% 100% FIGURE A - Preventive health behavior as a function of. Social Class (P = .001) In Figure A Is a fictitious example of the type of data a socialscientist might: have available that is statistically significant at .001level of confidence. It might be concluded that there is a sign-ificanlfy greater amount or preventive health behavior among the middle .class as opposed to the lower class.How can this be used by the practitioner who is treating nineyear old Jimmy Smith? Can he merely assume that since Jimmy is from alower class group, he is not interested in preventive health behavior?This would be an unfair assumption based on the data in figure A, for 40% 435 of the lower class sample did follow preventive health practices.Furthermore, it is not clear from these data what specific practicesare Involved, nor if these data were collected for adults as well aschildren or only for adults. It is also not clear which social orcultural groupi- are referred to in the findings. Does lower classmean Whites, Blacks as well as Puerto Ricans or only one of these groups?Do these data refer to practices prior to coming for care or dothey include compliance with physician instructions as well?There are many more questions that can be asked of these data.The physician dealing with a specific patient for a specific diseasewants a definite answer. He will not be content with all the\"ifs\" and \"buts\". Unfortunately, much of the data available is ofthe type described in figure A. The student must be taught how toutilize these data for the appropriate conclusions he could derive from them.For example, they might suggest he should feel an cbligation tofind out about the specific preventive practices of the patient he is treating.If the patient is from the lower class, there may be a needto exert greater than normal effort at motivating him to accept aspecific set of actions. The physician may thus have to use a differentapproach with a lower class patient than with a middle class patient.The extent of generalization and the limitations of behavioralscience findings are not usually conveyed to the student. Neither istheir possible action translation made when applied to specific patients.Many behavioral scientists feel a reluctance to do so based upon thedata limitations above. At the same time many students are reluctant_to accept the data as relevant until they do. 436 Freidson*has described the physician's reaction as, what hecalls, thedevelopment of the clinical mind. Whereas scientists useboth specific phenomena to arrive at general principles of knowledge andgencr:II principles to apply to Hpeelfic situations, physicians lea.mainly geoeral principles applied to specific situations. Physiciansaro interested In dealing with individuals, not groups. Therefore, theyplace a greater reliance on first-hand, clinical experience than on genera Irules.Arguments based upon experience carry greater weight thanscientilic data.The clinical mind is described as containing the following elements: I.There is an emphasis on action; not knowledge. 2.What the physician does makes a difference. It is better'than no action at all 'i.The physician is a pragmatist; relies (fll results not theory. 4.The physician trusts first-hand experience more than abstract principles.There Is an emphasis on uncertainty rather than on lawfulness.The physician thus is taught that what counts is the personalci ink:al experience he or his colleagues have, even if these data are biased.The physician is described by Freidson as not placing a greatvalue on creativity, originality, or intellectual stimulation. He,therefore, is interested in straight, direct answers and does notcare much about theory. Behavioral scientists who wish to gain accept-ance of their findings in the clinical setting must be prepared, there-fore, to specify the possible conclusions that can be reached for suchpurposes.it is not sufficient to leave the data for the physician toconvert for he probably will not bother.*Freidson, E.Profession of Medicine, New York: Dodd, Mead and Co.1970: Chapter 8. 437 V. Convertibility by Content of Materials.The extent to which behavioral science concepts are convertibleto one purpose or another is of course limited by the specific information taught.Some topic areas seem to span a wider range of application than others.Several examples will be briefly discussed:A. Example of Broad Versus Narrow Application:Behavioral Modification Versus Psychoanalytic Theory. The contentsof psychoanalytic theory are well entrenched in medical school teaching.One can hardly fail to hear of the battle of the id, ego and superegoor of the oral, anal and Oepidal stages of development. They arebasic concepts in most psychiatric teaching. Yet, in terms of the day-to-day activities of the health practitioner they may have few meaningfulapplications.Psychoanalytic thinking grew out of the treatment of psychopathology.In the case of Freudian classical theory, specifically, it grew out of the treatment of the hysterical patient of. Vienna. It is naturallypreoccupied with the abnormal and psychopathological. It also lacksstrong experimental validation because of the nature of its concepts.Psychoanalytic concepts are useful for certain purposes, such astheir application to psychopathology, their apparent relevance to thedevelopment of children, or to the regression of the patient withchronic severe pain. However, just as every patient does not requirea histological study, so every patient need not require psychoanalytic examination.The concepts of behavior modification have been developed,mainly but far from exclusively, in the psychological laboratory.They have a broad degree of application to both the normal and the 438 .dniorma IInd I v idua IThey are e;pe in I ly usei uI incv lig act change in a pat lens's behav ior and a re Icss of 1 ens i ve to pat Tents than loptiyclillnlw Iyl ItMc( I etitiC1111)11:04I::011Si'xtCI;IV jut-Mid II [cat ion appl i able to the reduct. Tern adthe tears, stress and discomfort or many medical procedures, e.g.,the concepts of relaxation and desensiti.zation. Patient motivationand compliance with medical regimen are areas of particular concern and rre suit.ecl LoL he app licaL ion of reinforcement by physicians. IIShOUIdbe pointed out that since behavior modification procedures arc aimed atchanging or instilling habits, they do not rely solely on thephysician butc:In incorporate the parent, the pal lent himself andsignificant others who can al lent behavior. This significantly extendsthe capability of lhe.physician.The types of problems to which these procedures are applicableinclude many of the normal problems of living such as difficulty inconcentrating on homework, the elimination of such harmful habits as smoking,Lift! more difficult problems of obesity and alcoholism, andmanagement of chronic pain. With the current work on biofeedback, many urccre problems Wright also be treatable, e.g., migraine and tensionhe:niche, and potentially, even addiction to hard drugs. IIis interesting to note that many medical students reject theapproach of behavior modification. This is partially due to questionsconcerning its validity. However, most important objections seem to beon moral and ethical grounds. It is seen as mechanical, heartless andmanipulative of patients. It definitely does not have the \"sexappeal\" of psychoanalysis. It might be pointed out that many medicalprocedures are just as manipulative and mechanical. A shot of morphine can be just as controlling as the dispensation of reinforcement.A proctoscopic examination can be just as uncomfortable as aversivetherapy applied to the alcoholic. Psychoanalytic control ofbehavior can also exist even though it might be more subtle and hap- hazard.Because it is more effective and powerful, behavior moJLficationis noL necessarily less ethical than other procedures. As with othertechniques, ethical judgment depends on how it is used by thepractitioner. B. Relevance to Basic. Science Versus Clinical Practice: Example of PainObviously some topics more readily appeal to the basic scientistside of medical students while others are more attractive to the clinician.The problem of pain reactions and their control is one thatis unique in that it seems to span the whole basic science-clinicalapplication continuum. It is also an area of convergence for facultyfrom physiology, pharmacology, psychology, sociology, anthropology,anesthesiology and other clinical faculty.From the basic science side contents can be included outliningthe basc mechanisms of pain and its physiology, pain as a sensation, itsdimensions and methods of measurement and the distinctions betweenpain threshold and pain tolerance reactions. Understanding of themrequires the introduction of behavioral science variables. The well entrenched, hard - headed scientists as well as the clinicians must admit this.It therefore comes as an important area of entry for thebehavioral scientist. Additional materials that lend themselves fordiscussion include the concepts of stress and anxiety and their rolein pain reactions, the effects of cognitive sets, personality variables,and socio-culturaI groupings. 440 From the clinical management side enter all the techniques involvedin Lhe reduction of stress and anxiety, including the use of desensitizationproedures, placebo phenomena, Lho effects of realistic fears, thesociocnlinral effects on symptom presentation and reactions to pain, the wac ofhypnosis and relaxation lechnigoes and the psychiatric use id' iulI I.Pain NS NH area ISIS not been dealt with appropriatelyin most schools of medicine. Yet,it should be of vital concern Lo all tluwho aspire to be members of a profession to alleviate humansullering.It certainly is a meeting ground for behavioral. and lion-behavioral scientists that is readily convertible Lo clinical application-as well as bask research. IL can serve as a wedge for demonstrating therelevance of many other behavioral science concepts. evaneeo(NilCa toseparate One from another. Preventive practices in medicine havebecome greatly emphasized in recent years as a proper manner in whichto practice Lhe delivery of care. Preventive medicine requiressome regular contact with the practitioner either for such things asinoculation, check-ups or other forms of preventive maintenance. Onemost therefore begin to deal with the problem'of accessibility of careto the patient which inevitably involves a discussion of Lhe medical care system.Ls this Leaching patient care or medical care organization?Actually, it is one example of how it is possible Lo do both.The knowledge of medical care organization becomes convertible topatient care via the discussion of preventive fiactices. As has 44]. already been mentioned at several points, there are some materials thatcan be used as gate openers. Once opened, many other guests become welcome.Behavioral scientists should demonstrate relevance ofmaterials first. Only then will the rest seem to follow alongsmoothly.There has to be careful search for such pivotal areas. Vl. Concluding RemarksIn teaching behavioral science to medical students, it is importantto realize that they are not interested in becoming behavioral scientists.Careful selection of materials is thus an important requirement. Content.areas to be taught should be convertible to physician utilization at onelevel or another and this convertibility and relevance should bedemonstrated to the extent possible.There are many ways of defining convertibility, depending greatlyon the objectives to be reached and the kind of activity into whichthe knowledge will be converted. What is required under one circumstancemay not be relevant under other conditions. Relevance is alsogreatly affected by the sequence, timing and methods with which thematerials are taught. In addition, certain materials seem to bepivotal areas for opening doors for other behavioral science input.Behavioral scientists might do well.by utilizing these areas whenever possible. 442 ORGANIZATIONAL FORMS FOR MEDICALBEHAVIORAL SCIENCE PROGRAMS Evan G.

These questions fall into three generalcategories:the extent to which the arrangement will implement arAdevelop the basic goals and philosophy of the medical school; the totalecology of the medical school, especially the academic, student, andadministrative ecology; and the developmental needs of the behavioralsciences and the behavioral scientists. Within these questions, thereare also many separate considerations with which one must deal, if aviable behavioral science teaching program is to develop.The question of the best administrative arrangement to implementand develop 'the basic philosophy and goals of the medical s2hool mayseem so obvious that it barely needs mentioning. On the other hand,many schools have formed blue ribbon committees to articulate theirbasic philosophy and objectives but have not taken the necessary stepof assessing each learning experience in terms of its contributionto the stated goals and objectives. If human behavior is consideredto be basic to all fields of medicine, then it will require a differentadministrative structure than if it is regarded as only basic topsychiatry, or family medicine, or community medicine. If the goal isto train a primary physician then the arrangement and integration mightbe quite different than for the training of secondary or tertiary' specialists.If a school is more concerned with integrative learning,or problem solving; or the total patient, the behavioral sciences willhave different administrative requirements than if one is primarilyconcerned with disciplinary specialization or the encyclopaedic approachto knowledge and the patient. 446 A careful consideration of the total ecology of the academic,administrative, and student situation is probably the most importantfactor to predict the survival and success of a behavioral scienceteaching program. It is here that one must deal with the real practicalpolitics of academia. How can a discipline gain academic credibility?What are the major criteria used by a faculty in accepting each otheras true colleagues? If research has more priority and rewards thanteaching, then it is not realistic to establish a behavioral scienceunit excited about it's teaching and the possibilities for innovation,when the \"system\" does not promote and reward that activity above all others.In administrative ecology, the most important questions dealwith the making of decisions about budget, space, salaries, policy,recruiting, committees, curriculum time, etc.. if these are made bydepartment chairmen, then to have the behavioral sciences without abehavioral scientist chairman would be relegating the behavioralsciences to a peripheral mission with a noble charge, but without the,authority or resources to back it up.The question of student role in the ecology of a medical schoolis becomingincreasingly important. With the advent of \"relevance\"and activism, the students are helping the faculty interpret theexisting learning experiences in terms of meaningfulness to theireducational goals. On the other hand, the survival system in mostschools is still a forceful reality. Much has been done to diffuse theparochial power of separate departments, to allow students to havesome patient contact early in their training, and to recognize thestrong motivation for humanitarian concern. However, the medical 447 student must deal with the discrepancies between the fantasies andaspirations of what-the faculty wants to provide and the reality of theday-to-day learning situations encountered by the student. He oftengets a double message from these experiences which may tell him suchthings as:people are important as long as they don't get in your way;becoming a primary physician is important as long as you master myspecialty first; problem solving, not the accumulation of facts, willbe the most important task for you to accomplish, so let's get on withthe job of learning as many facts as you can about my discipline. Thebewildered student is often confronted with the paradox that he wouldlike to learn more about social factors and human behavior, since itis such a large part of doctoring, however, the survival system tellshim it is less important. Besides, he often feels that he is workingas hard as he can, attempting to master the traditional disciplines,without having to accommodate a new discipline as an overload.The point is that all aspects of the student's learning environ-ment are important, including each classroom and patient care experience,promotion criteria, student admissions process, examination policy, andfaculty behavior at all levels. Just as beirid sick is a total organismresponse, so, learning to be a physician is done in the context of theentire educational ecology, whether it is a new school or an olderschool with long Standing traditions.A third question to consider in deciding on the most appropriatebehavioral science administrative structure is what are the develop-mental needs of the medical behavioral sciences as an evolving discipline,or disciplines, and what are the developmental needs of behavioral 448 scientists as teaching faculty? As medicine and medical education isbeginning to respond to its own academic and patient care imbalance,the behavioral sciences are responding by attempting to redefine theirown multidisciplinary roles, content, points of educational and patientcare intervention, colleague relationships, disciplinary identity, andadministrative needs.There are at least three major needs or tasks in the behavioralsciences which must be effectively met through the resources of anadministrative unit. These are: 1.To synthesize a body of knowledge on basic human behavior andto integrate the behavioral disciplines into medicine. Thisis a most difficult task since there is no readily availabletext or body of knowledge, es exists in the other basic sciencedisciplines. 2.To teach the basic principles of human behavior as they arerelated to medical problem solving. While teaching shouldhave the highest priority at a medical school, the assumptionis often made that if one is thoroughly trained in a disci-pline, then he should have no difficulty communicating thisdiscipline.We know that it does not work out that way inthe other basic sciences, and there is less reason to expectthat it would be as easy in the behavioral sciences, sinceit involves the identification, synthesis, and teaching ofcontent in a form that has not existed in the past. Theother basic sciences have already evolved through this phaseof development with existing textbooks and teaching programs. 3.To conduct research in the various behavioral sciences withconsiderable emphasis on bridging between disciplines. Sincesome of the most exciting breakthroughs in science haveoccurred at the interface between disciplines, and thebehavioral sciences actually represent multiple disciplines,it is important for the behavioral sciences to have anopportunity to work together in their behavioral research invery much the same evolutionary pattern as was followed bysuch disciplines as physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacologyin the past? 449 The behavioral sciences have had a rather short, but rapid,development in the history of medical education. In most instances,they began within the context of psychiatry, occasionally within adepartment of medicine or pediatrics, and usually centered aroundthe teaching of doctor-patient relationship or the teaching of interviewing.In an effort to develop as broad a base of scientific support asmedicine, surgery, and pediatrics have enjoyed, psychiatrists beganto look toward their colleagues in the social science departments ofthe university to assist with the new emphasis on basic research inclinical departments. Most often the colleague was a clinicalpsychologist who had been building a coLsiderable fund of knowledgeand skill in the measurement of human attributes, as well as partici-pating in the process of psychotherapy.The social scientist had a good deal to contribute to psychiatrythrough his already established research on human behavior, especiallywith his knowledge of research design, measurement, and statistics.For the social scientist this was a fortuitous development because hedesperately needed the real life and real patient situations withwhich to continue his study of behavior.As clinicians of other medical disciplines also began to collaboratewith the social scientists, they began to see that the social scientisthad specific research skills and a body of basic information abouthuman behavior that added a new dimension to the understanding ofnormal biological function and dysfunction. However, it was psychiatrywhich had the greatest need for a supportive basic science of humanbehavior, that accepted most eagerly the participation and transplan-tation of the social scientist into the medical school. 450 Often, however, the psychiatrist was unable to eslish the kindof colleague relationship that the social scientist had learned toenjoy in the evolution of his discipline on the university campus. Asa result, many social scientists began to feel used rather than appreci-ated as colleagues. This had caused a number of identity and recruitingproblems among social scientists. Although destructive in this mannerat times, the development of the behavioral sciences within departmentsof psychiatry was an important evolutionary step in the formation ofa teaching and research discipline of behavioral science. Without thesupport, encouragement, and nurture that behavioral scientists received,it is unlikely that the discipline of behavioral science would haveprogressed to a level where it could now function as an independentunit or as a separate discipline. While the intent of this paper is to consider the most optimaladministrative structure and professional relationships, this canobviously be done only in the context of an evolving discipline, thetrends in medical education and practice, and the professional andhuman characteristics of the faculty involved. We must be allowed thefreedom to learn from our experiences and not be required to repeatnecessarily the same evolutionary process or perpetuate the sameacademic errors which may have occurred in other disciplines.ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ADMINISTRATIVE UNITSLet us now consider some of the assets and liabilities of eachadministrative unit, in terms of the primary mission of teaching thebehavioral sciences in a medical school. 451 1.A Department of Behavioral Science.If one accepts the assumptions that human behavior is essentialin understanding the total patient and the disease process; that itinvolves more than either biological, psychological, or sociologicalcomponents; and that it is -truly a basic science related to all fieldsof medicine; then, it follows that it should be established as atruly basic science department comparable to such other departments,such as anatomy, biochemistry, microbiology, pharmacology, andphysiology.In most instances, a separate department would possess thecharacteristics necessary to provide a positive answer to the threemajor questions of basic philosophy, academic ecology, and developmentalneeds for the behavioral sciences. As a fully autonomous departmentof the medical school with its own chairman, faculty, budget, space,curriculum time, and with full access to the teaching and researchresources of the university, it should be able to compete, withoptimal efficiency and effectiveness in the politics, responsibilities,and rewards of the academic medical saculture.A number of medical schools have established departments ofbehavioral science or human behavior. The first of these was establishedby Robert Straus at the University of Kentucky fifteen years ago.2This represented a firm recognition of behavioral science as a teachingand research discipline in a medical school. Since that time, Departmentsof Behavioral Science have been established at Pennsylvania StateUniversity, Temple University, the University of Toronto, and theUniversity of Sherbrooke, a Department of Medical Psychology at the 452 University of Oregon, a Department of Human Behavior at the Universityof Southern California, and a Department of Behavioral Biology at theUniversity of California at Davis. Several other medical schoolsare currently studying the feasibility of est;iblishing similardepartments.Also, three of the six developing Canadian schoolsexpect to have separate departments of behavioral science.If the basic philosophy of any medical school is to be implemented,it must enjoy the top priority and commitment of all faculty. Anyteaching unit or program expected to make a major contribution to thephilosophy must be given the highest political, administrative, andacademic support. Furthermore, it must give top priority to institu-tional goals over disciplinary goals. Anything less will result inanunderminingofthe philosophy and the establishment of competing andparochial goals. Such has been the fate of many new medical schools,established with the articulation of creative and innovative basicphilosophies, but without the committed faculty or institutionalcommitments to accomplish the goal.It has been claimed that the time to establish anew departmentis when the school is also new. Although there are certain advantagesin being on a equal basis from the beginning, \"growing up\" with anew school is not as ideal a situation as our fantasies might portray.Problems, such as, academic credibility, colleague relationships,conjoint teaching, recruiting, and teaching program development aremore difficult for a new discipline, regardless of the age of theparticular institution. The philosophical priorities and commitmentof resources are still the major. determinants. 453 In terms of the academic ecology of most medical schools, it isimportant to recognize that the power structure still rests with theindividual departments. This means that the decision making ofcurriculum hours, financial stability, policy matters, space, newprograms and academic status still rests primarily with separate andcollective departments. Without such an organizational base, evencommunication and integrative relationships with other departmentsand programs can become very difficult. Very often, claims are madethat the departmental structure is archaic and that behavioral scienceshould not perpetuate an archaic system. This may be true, howeverone must work within both the realities and the fantasies of theexisting system in order to guarantee maxiluum survival and effectiveness.When the traditional departments reorganize into new and bold adminis-trative formats, then behavioral science should do likewise.Considering the student's perception of the academic ecology,the operating base of a separate department serves to providevisibility and credibility that the faculty is serious in its supportof behavioral science and that the student can expect the behavioralsciences to be an equra partner in the academic survival system.The developmental needs of the behavioral sciences and thebehavioral scientists deserve special emphasis. The tasks of synthe-sizing a body of knowledge on basic human-behavior, integrating thisbody of knowledge into medicine, and teaching in the context of medicalproblems requires the secure base of a separate department. Likewise,a research program can develop from within a Clepartment according tothe needs and the interfaces found within the behavioral sciences, andwill not be forced to conform to the interests and support of a hostdepartment. 454 Recruiting can also be accomplished more easily, since there isan intellectual excitement to be found in a new multidisciplinarydepartment when one has the sense of establishing new academic fron- tiers.Medical schools have to compete with other university departmentsand disciplines for the career commitments of behavioral scientists.Separate departments are far more effective in attracting and holdingthose behavioral scientists. They quickly discover that the sensitive,stimulating, and supporting relationships they are able to developwith the medical students and their own colleagues are very rewarding.With these kinds of securities and rewards, medical behavioral scientistsfind less need to hang desperately to their original discipline identitieson campus and will be free to make the maximum contribution in the medical setting.This does not mean that all behavioral scientists in a medicalschool must be in such a department. Other disciplines in medicinewill undoubtedly have some special needs which require the servicesor skills of a full-time behavioral scientist. This is very desirable,and having a separate department can often help other departmentsrecruit and retain behavioral scientists, for example, through ajoint appointment relationship.Again, assuming that one has opted for a separate department, itis important to allow the neWlepartment to develop a structure andfunction that does not necessarily fit that of the traditional basicscience department. An academic model closer to that of a modernPharmacology department might be more compatible with new teachir,-;and patient care programs which are developing in medical education.To be more specific about the pharmacology departmental model, 455 consider the disci?linary breadth whereby one might expect to find inone department, individuals who are clinical pharmacologists, perhapsas boarded internists, and on the other end of the continuum to findan individual working at the more molecular level who may be basicallya oiochemist.This allows for the development of multidisciplinarybridging and integration on both the clinical and basic science levels.Such a departmental model would contain both Ph.D.'s and M.D.'s andshould have a much greater chance of impact and survival in the newcwricula proposals being implemented throughout the country. 2.Division a Section of a Department.A review of behavioral science teaching units in medical schoolsshows that the most common administrative structure for behavioralscientists is in a division of behavioral science, usually within adepartment of psychiatry.3 Occasionally, such a division will beformed within a department of community medicine, internal medicine,pediatrics, or preventive medicine. For example, the behavioralscience units at the University of Missouri and at Mt. Sinai are foundwithin departments of community medicine; at the University of Connecticutit is found in the Department of Clinical Medicine and Health Care.At the University of Toronto, the Department of Behavioral Science wasformerly a.division in the Department of Pediatrics. At the Universityof Arizona there is an autonomous and separate Division of SocialPerspectives in Medicine.In many instances, the development of a division or section ofbehavioral science in a traditional department was the natural out-growth of mutual interests and needs of the clinical discipline and thebehavioral scientists. In psychiatry, there was a very natural sharing 456 of common interests in human behavior. Since the traditional basicsciences did not do teaching or research directly related to theproblems of clinical psychiatry, it was necessary for psychiatry toteach its own basic science and to do research on its own basic problems.They needed the basic science training and the research skills of thebehavioral scientist.As more and more behavioral scientists were recruited intodepartments of psychiatry, they became actively involved in theteaching and research programs of psychiPtrists, but eventually :_,eganto demonstrate a collective strength in teaching the basic scienceof human behavior from the first year teaching program through thepsychiatric residency program. They also began to secure their ownresearch grants and support for studying human behavior problems,both psychiatric and non-psychiatric.Thomas Webster has made the analogy of the behavioral scientistoften feeling iAmself to be in the position of a foster child withoutsome of the privileges of his medical faculty siblings. The hostdepartment chairman often found himself in the position of the fosterparent and he became understandably bewildered when the person he hadsponsored and supported developed feelings of ungratefulness for thefact that he was not treated like a real son and that he shouldeventually want a house and family of his own. This analogy is notfar from the actual situation in many departments of psychiatry,especially when the teaching and research skills began to findexpression in other traditional clinical and basic science departmentsof the medical school, and when the behavioral scientists began tosee themselves as second class citizens. 457 One must recognize that the development of divisions of behavioralscience in departments of psychiatry was a most important evolutionary step.It is unlikely that the discipline of behavioral science wouldhave progressed as rapidly to the level where it could function as aseparate departmental unit if it were not for this initial support,encouragement, and nurture.On the other hand, the reactions of departments of psychiatryhave proved to be highly variable. Some departments of psychiatry havehelped to nourish and develop the behavioral sciences to the state ofreadiness for independent status as a separate discipline or departmentand have encouraged their contributions to other clinical departmentsand teaching programs. A few departments of psychiatry have respondedby altering their department names to include behavioral science inthe title; sometimes in an effort to give equal billing and status, .at other times, to capture arri consume all contributions of thebehavioral sciences. .A few others have been so threatened by thebehavioral sciences that they have rigidly resisted either the develop-ment, or the escape, of behavioral science.In addition to providing a sympathetic and helpful haven duringthe initial stages in the growth and development of the behavioralsciences, a division can have the added advantage of allowing a criticalmass of faculty to accumulate and .a- teaching program to be tested-outbefore administrative autonomy is acquired. Of course, other departments,Kas community medicine, internal medicine and pediatrics canalso serve this role equally well. If the transition to a separateor autonomous administrative unit is not anticipated, then the colleaguerelationships, the proportion of support, and the plans fOr both the 458 nurture and the integration of the behavioral sciences in the curriculumneeds special monitoring by the medical school administration. As isoften the case in other academic endeavors, the success or failureof a division of behavioral science depends to a great extent on themutual educational commitments and individual personalities of thepeople involved. 3.A Curriculum or Subject committee.About one-fourth of all medical schools have adopted a completeor modified subject committee or systems committee approach, aspioneered by Case Western Reserve University. Usually an interdepart-mental curriculum or subject committee cperates independently of anydepartmental base. The teaching faculty may be drawn from severaldifferent basic science or clinical departments. Decisions of contentand method are usually made by the, different subject committees andan interdisciplinary format is emphasized.Harvard University uses a curriculum committee for the administra-tion of its social and behavioral science program, while VirginiaCommonwealth University, the University of Connecticut, and theUniversity of Alabama, 2re examples of the use of a subject committeeadministration.In terms of the criterion of promoting the basic philosophy andgoals of the school, a curriculum or subject committee administrative unit has certain advantages. The major benefit is that it takes thecurriculumdecision making and control away from the individualdepartments or disciplines and places it i.n an interdisciplinarygroup whose major responsibility is a learning program for the students. This allows the individual departments to continue to pursue their 459 disciplinary goals, but not at the expense of the institutional goalof training the best possible physician.The academic ecology of a curriculum or subject committee ismainly influenced by the shift of power and decision making mentioned above.It serves to structure interdisciplinary teaching arrangementswhich can result in interdisciplinary research efforts as well.Students respond more positively because they feel that the facultyare actually working together, rather than promoting their own discipli-nary or departmental goals.Problems occur when a special curriculum or subject committee isorganized only for the purpose of presenting the behavioral sciences.While this can serve an initial positive function by providing acommittee charged with the responsibility of formulating and emphasizingbehavioral science content, unless the other parts of the curriculumare organized in a similar fashion it seriously reduces the credi-bility and impact of the behaviorel science teaching effort. Themessage often received is that behavioral science is important enoughto have e special committee, but not really important enough to beput on an equal basis with other disciplines or departments.Recruiting of behavioral scientists is also more difficult underthis administrative arrangement, since they are being asked to operatewithout a common academic home base within the medical school. Theproblems of academic identity can be accentuated through such anorganizational form unless careful planning and rewards are instituted.Since behavioral factors are a part of most biological phenomena,a subject committee can help the behavioral sciences develop as a trulyintegrative discipline. However, this initial gain will be lost unless 460 other disciplines in the school also use a similar format and take amajor responsibility for the integration of their awn subject matter. 4.Departments of Anthropology, Psychology, or Sociology.Several medical schools have organized behavioral science teachingunits by utilizing faculty from the disciplinary departments in theparent university, occasionally with joint appointments in a clinicalor basic science department of the medical school. The best exampleof this effort is at Michigan State University where a number of theuniversity basic science departments relate to the new college ofhuman medicine while they remain as the administrative and disciplinaryentities in their parent departments of the university. This iscoordinated by an associate dean in the College of Human Medicine,who is also an associate dean in the College of Social Science. TheCollege of Human Medicine provides a financial reimbursement for the7cooperating teaching faculty from the disciplinary departments. TheState University of New York at Stony Brook uses a similar adminis-trative arrangement through a Division of Social Sciences and Humanities.Other medical schools, such as Stanford University andthe University of Alberta, have also decentralized the behavioralscience offerings to utilize the university departments as well asthe medical school departments.This organizational form can serve to promote the basicphilosophy and goals of the medical school, especially when it is alsothe major administrative structure for the other basic sciences. Itworks less well when it is used as an administrative arrangement forbehavioral science only. Through such an arrangement, the medicalschool is able to request, reimburse, and reinforce those teaching 461 efforts which make the greatest contribution to the fulfillment ofthe basic philosophy and goals of the school.In-terms of the total academic ecology, this administrativearrangement places the power and the decision making responsibilitiesin the school of medicine. Furthermore, it emphasizes the responsi-bility of the clinical faculty to design and shape the curriculumexperiences for the student physicians. Also, it will probably be moreeasily accomplished in a new school, rather than in an older schoolwith established traditional basic science departments. The possi-bilities of developing and extending the integration of the medicalschool and the university can be greatly enhanced by this arrangement.However, this decentralized academic arrangement will notserve the developmental needs of medical behavioral science as adiscipline.Medical behavioral scientists will be united through theirinterdepartmental teaching assignments, but the tendency will be toretain a purer disciplinary orientation, since they will still lacka common base from which to work and affiliate with other medical disciplines.Recruiting of behavioral scientists may be enhanced somewhat, becauseof the generic disciplinary identity, but the translation and bridgingof the pure discipline into the medical sciences will be handicapped.In t.,e past, the transplanting of a pure behavioral scientist into amedical school has not resulted in maximum effectiveness until after aconsiderable period of working and teaching by the behavioral scientistIn a medical setting. This is an important reorientation and (mwhich is often overlooked in the attempt to utilize the behavioral science 462 resources of the university. The traditional academic rewards in adisciplinary department of the university do not generally place ahigh value on individuals who attempt to take their pure disciplineand translate or apply it to a profession such as medicine. There-fore, such an administrative arrangement would require the recruitmentand training of special individuals, with special commitments, specialresponsibilities, and with special rewards built into the system. 5.Renamed traditional department.In this organizational arrangement, a traditional clinical or basicscience department may change its name and mission to include a majorbehavioral science component. It is often similar to a division orsection arrangement, except that the term behavioral science appearsin the name of the department and there is often more autonomy allowed.Examples of the above are: the University of Oklahoma with itsDepartment of Neurology, Psychiatry, and Behavioral Science; theUniversity of California at Irvine with a Department of Psychiatry andHuman Behavior; Loma Linda University with a Department of Legal andCultural Medicine; the Chicago Medical School, Johns Hopkins University,and Louisana State University with Departments of Psychiatry andBehavioral Science.This does not necessarily provide more additional support forthe basic, philosophy and goals of the institution than any otheradministrative arrangement. When Behavioral Science has been addedto a traditional department and the name changed to include behavioralscience in the title, this at least provides visibility and recognitionfor the Behavioral Sciences. If a new department is organized combining 463 two or more disciplines, it can often have more of an impact because ofa new teaching unit being introduced into the traditional system, butwith equality of status and support.One of the major ecological factors includes a more egalitarian relationship with one's colleagues. This appears to work better thanthe section or division administrative structure, in that behavioralscientists may feel more autonomous and less as second class citizensin a medical school.In terms of the developmental needs of the behavioral sciences,combining with a traditional department can provide many of theadvantages of the separate department. The protection of the traditionaldepartment can allow the behavioral scientists to develop their staff,content, methods, research, and consultative relationships withouthaving to assume all of the institutional responsibilities of aseparate department. The professional :identity crisis can also bealleviated by the autonomy and the protection provided.There seems to be an expectation on the part of some medicaleducators that the administrative pattern for the future will be tocombine basic science and clinical departments according to theirdisciplinary overlap and their supporting relationships. Theargument is then made that the behavioral sciences should set thepattern for the future, rather than organizing along traditionaldepartmental lines. This argument makes considerable sense, if theinstitution is already in the process of reorganizing its traditionaldepartments.A new discipline struggling to ertablish its content,identity, and relationships in medical educaticn should not have tosuffer the additional trauma of spearheading a rational, but possibly 464 impractical, innovation.Also, the assumption is usually made that the best multihsciplinarycombination would be with psychiatry. This should be more carefullyexamined, as in many schools the behavioral sciences are establishinga much more complementary and integrative relationship with such groups ascommunity medicine, family medicine, and pediatrics.If the behavioral sciences are truly basic to all areas of medicine,then it is extremely difficult to select one clinical specialty andinsist that it integrate primarily with that specialty. There is nodoubt that this would do a' lot to develop the clinical specialty ofpsychiatry, but it might be at the expense of the desperate behavioralneeds of the other specialties or general areas in medicine. 6.Institute or Center.The development of centers or institutes within, or associatedwith, medical schools has served as a logical administrative home forseveral behavioral science teaching units. The center or institute isusually organized for the purpose of conducting research in closeassociation with a medical school, teaching hospital, or a relateduniversity facility,Examples of such centers are: The Behavioral Science Center atBowman Gray, The Mental Health Research Institute at the University ofMichigan, The Center for Neurobiological Sciences and a HumanDevelopment Center at the University of Florida, The BehavioralSciences Study Center at Yale University, the Brain Research Instituteat U.C.L.A., and The Neurosciences Program at the University of Alabama.In general, most of the behavioral science units establishedwithin centers or institutes have not proved to be as effective teaching/ 465 units as those established within medical school departments or subjectcommittees.One of the major reasons is that, with a few exceptions (possibly Bowman Gray), most of the centers are establishedwith the primary goal of research, rather than teaching, and they aremost often peripheral, financially and academically, to the mainstreamof the medical school and the university. That is not to say thatthey do not serve the institution in a productive manner, but that ifone is attempting to organize a teaching program for student physiciansor health care professionals, the commitment to teaching and medicaleducation must be stronger than the commitment to research.The considerations of academic ecology are'still relevant forcenters and institutes, since most are nut directly involved with thedecision making responsibility for the medical school curriculum. Whena Center is organized for the specific purpose of implementing andintegrating a behavioral science teaching unit, it can experience agreat deal of success. However, most behavioral science units in acenter or institute were placed there because of some disciplinarysimilarity, for example with the neurological sciences; ratherthan to provide an environment for the development of an autonomousdiscipline of behavioral science. Occasionally, behavioral scienceis placed in an institute or center because everyone recognizes thatit is very important, but no one knows exactly where to put it.Because of his research skills and interests, the behavioralscientist can probably make a greater contribution to the mission ofa center than the center can make to the mission of behavioral scienceteaching. 466 The academic ecology discussed above is particularly relevant whenone considers the developmental needs of the behavioral sciences as anevolving discipline concerned with the teaching of medical students.The needs of a behavioral science research program can be greatly aidedby the center or institute as an organizational structure, while thedevelopment of a teaching program, as discussed above, can be considerablyhandicapped unless the behavioral sciences are in he mainstream ofcurriculum planning and medical education.Summary and Conclusions.As has been illustrated, the selection of an optimal organizational. --- form for a medical behavioral science program involves a multitude of factors.Some of the more important. dimensions include the extent towhich a particular organizational form will accomplish the basicphilosophy and goals of the medical school, the practical politics ofacademia in terms of the total ecology in which the behavioral scienceunit must relate to colleagues and other disciplines in a studentoriented learning situation, and the extent to which the particularorganizational form provides for the needs of the behavioral sciencesas a developing discipline and the behavioral scientists as effectiveteachers of medical students.Many other factors have been considered, such as: the multi-disciplinary character of such a unit; the need for both Ph.D. andM.D. behavioral scientists to continually bridge and integrate intorelevant medical problem solving; the need to establish and integratethe behavioral sciences vertically during each of the four years ofmedical school; the need to recognize the personality and professional 467 problems of identity, recruiting, rewards, colleague relationships, andbasic commitments to medical students and medical education.There is at least one important factor which has not been discussed.It has to do with a planned grace period between the formation of sucha behavioral science teaching unit and the intradepartment and inter -departmental evaluation which may be applied to such a unit. Intra-departmental evaluation should be a continuing process from the beginning,but there should be at least a five year grace period before any externalevaluation is attempted. This is to allow the behavioral scientists toexplore, develop, test-out, and evaluate various means of interpreting,integrating, and applying the knowledge of basic human behavior tomedical problem solving and patient care situations. The new behavioral science administrative bnd teaching unitsdeveloping around the United States and Canada are demonstrating arevitalization of medical education and of the relationship ofbehavior to disease and patient care. Rigid departmental and disci-plinary lines are giving way to more integration and a reorientationof medical education toward better training for primary care responsi-bilities. If our understanding of human health and disease is to progress,we must develop administrative and disciplinary structures which canchange and grow along with our knowledge, skills, and priorities. 468 REFERENCES 1.Evan G.
