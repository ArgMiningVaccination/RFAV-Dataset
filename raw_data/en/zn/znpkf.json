According to Dr. Emoto, human consciousness could affect the molecular structure of water. Dr. Emoto believed water was a \"blueprint for our reality\" and that human emotions, thoughts, energies, and vibrations could change the physical structure of water. He tested his theory by exposing water in glasses to words, pictures, and music. Then, he froze the water and examined the resulting ice crystals.
