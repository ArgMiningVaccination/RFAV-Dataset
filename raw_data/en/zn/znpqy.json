The most highly studied forms of meditation are transcendental meditation (TM) and mindfulness meditation. Results to date suggest that meditation could work via at least 2 mechanisms: Producing a relaxed state that counters excessive activation of neurohormonal pathways resulting from repeated stress Developing the capacity for metacognitive awareness (the ability to stand back from and witness the contents of consciousness), thus theoretically helping patients not react to stress automatically (with highly conditioned, learned patterns of behavior) and helping them tolerate and regulate emotional distress better Most meditation practices were developed in a religious or spiritual context; their ultimate goal was some type of spiritual growth, personal transformation, or transcendental experience. However, studies suggest that as a health care intervention, meditation can often be beneficial regardless of a person's cultural, spiritual, or religious background.

It is also used to promote well-being, particularly among health care practitioners and people with chronic disease ( [4](/professional/special-subjects/integrative,-complementary,-and-alternative-medicine/meditation#v59175503) [ References In meditation, a type of mind-body medicine, patients regulate their attention or systematically focus on particular aspects of inner or outer experience.

Evidence supporting efficacy in relieving depression is strong, and evidence supporting sexual dysfunction is at least suggestive; however, evidence supporting most purely physical symptoms is less robust.
