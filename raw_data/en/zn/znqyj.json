Below are just a few... According to the [American Chiropractic Association](https://www.acatoday.org/Patients/Health-Wellness-Information/Back-Pain-Facts-and-Statistics), the number one reason for visiting a chiropractor is due to back pain, neck pain and/or headaches. Whether a result of a car accident, work injury or other reason, pain can have a significant affect on your day-t0-day activities. Many Americans spend about eight hours a day sitting down at work. If you're like most of us, you don't naturally maintain good posture. Good posture is important because it helps us sit, stand, walk and move in ways that don't strain muscles and ligaments. As you get older, your joints start to show signs of wear and tear. Sometimes that wear and tear causes inflammation and pain, which can disrupt your life. Without warning, performing the workouts and other activities you enjoy can become more and more difficult. Much like sitting, poor sleeping posture can disrupt your spinal health. Lack of spine, neck and head support can increase pain and restlessness and keep you from your proper sleep cycle. Dr. Jeff Neal practices a drug-free, hands on approach to health care that includes patient examination, diagnosis and treatment. You can benefit in a number of ways by adding massage therapy to your chiropractic care program. "}
