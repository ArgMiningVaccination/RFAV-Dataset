Email: mschneider@gsu.edu1 Introduction The premises of behavioural policy interventions lead one to question if they are doing more harm than good. Often this premise is explicit, as in the case of nudging or marketing interventions, which aim to direct individuals towards a particular decision that is presumed to be welfare-improving for the individual. Or the premise is implicit, when interventions are motivated by wanting to see \"what works,\" to increase or decrease a particular behaviour such as \"saving more\" or \"consuming less alcohol,\" again under the presumption that this change in behaviour is welfare-improving. Many behavioural interventions are openly motivated by hunches and sensible priors, but there is typically scant theoretical development of what constitutes individual welfare. Such motivation is ne as long as there are some minimal checks that the unconditional interventions that are proposed can be expected to \"do no harm.\" The principle of \"do no harm\" has long been established in the medical eld in relation to proposed new drugs, procedures and devices. In that setting, we expect tests of clinical efcacy1in carefully controlled environments. Only then, if the evidence is clear that the expected net benet is positive, is approval given for use in the eld.2Often interventions are abandoned before application in the eld.3Evidence that the expected net benets are then realised in the eld is referred to as a test of the effectiveness4of the intervention. We propose that behavioural interventions in economics, where possible, be subject to tests of efcacy before being applied in the eld, to provide priors that they can be expected to be effective in the eld and \"do no harm.\"5This concern is exacerbated when 1Clinical efcacy is dened as the extent to which an intervention produces the expected result under ideal and controlled circumstances. 2There are exceptions, such as the Sputnik V vaccination for COVID-19 released to the public in Russia in 2020. One hoped for good outcomes in 2020, but hope is not science. As it happens, subsequent clinical trials did show impressive efcacy. 3Several COVID-19 vaccines were abandoned as the result of unacceptable efcacy: those developed by Commonwealth Serum Laboratories and the University of Queensland in Australia, by Imperial College and Morningside Ventures in the United Kingdom, by Merck and the Pasteur Institute in the United States and France, and by Merck and IAVI in the United States. 4Effectiveness measures the performance of the intevention under \"real world\" conditions. 5Clinical efcacy is known to often provide a biased, optimistic prediction of eld effectiveness. One reason is that infectious diseases can mutate over the time needed to move from clinical testing 1the eld does not come with informed consent or a participation endowment to offset any losses. Our proposal involves two central steps, which we illustrate with an application to behavioural policy interventions that would have benetted greatly from tests of efcacy before being brought to the eld. The rst step is to use, wherever possible, laboratory and artefactual eld experiments as the behavioural test-bed to determine efcacy of interventions. The second is to use economic theory to develop a rigorous measure of individual welfare from interventions that allows for the measurement of welfare losses as well as welfare gains, thus allowing an assessment of the possibility of harm. We demonstrate this approach by focusing on behavioural interventions that are typically used to promote the uptake of index insurance in the eld in low-income countries. The idea of an index insurance contract is that the insured gets coverage for an idiosyncratic personal risk of loss that they face that is positively correlated with an observable and veriable public index, such as an average-yield for some crop or a weather index, and payments are only made on the basis of the index exceeding some trigger. The potential of index insurance6has led to major investments by governments, (re)insurers, and international organisations into behavioural interventions to promote index insurance uptake. Some 20 years later, demand for index insurance remains below the expectations of many policy makers, leaving us to wonder if index insurance indeed provides a welfare-enhancing proposition. We conduct an experiment in which we randomly assign individuals in the lab to a range of behavioural interventions that are typically used to promote index insurance in the eld. These interventions are aimed at increasing understanding of the decision context, providing information about decisions of peers, or are explicitly designed to encourage to eld applications, as evidenced by COVID-19. Another reason is that controlled tests might not reflect eld use. An infamous example is the use of lters on cigarettes to reduce intake of \"tar\" and nicotine smoke. Mechanical testing devices to determine efcacy did not reflect the unconscious manner in which actual smokers, craving nicotine, would use their ngers to behaviourally \"compensate\" and block the lters. This disparity had tragic health consequences for decades. Another example is the clinical efcacy of condoms versus their messy eld effectiveness: see Trussell and Kost (1987) and Fu et al. (1999). The general point is that efcacy provides priors to guide predictions about effectiveness. 6Index insurance has great potential to provide protection against aggregate risks such as weather risk, climate change, or pandemics because claims are based on observable and independently veriable indices which are correlated with idiosyncratic losses, and thereby prevent moral hazard and adverse selection. 2individuals to purchase.7Based on a battery of incentivised choices over risky lotteries, we infer the risk preferences of individuals that are relevant to index insurance decisions, and then randomly assign subjects to our interventions before they make decisions to purchase or not purchase insurance. We then estimate the expected consumer surplus gained or foregone from insurance purchase decisions, and compare these individual welfare gains or losses across the intervention arms. We nd that there is no evidence that our behavioural interventions lead to an average increase in consumer welfare for all interventions. Without our interventions, in a control condition which provides basic information about the product, the average subject only realises 50% of the potential welfare improvement that can be achieved by making insurance purchase decisions that are in line with their elicited risk preferences. Although four informational interventions signicantly increase take-up and understanding of our insurance product, they do not lead to a signicant average enhancement in welfare for any of the four interventions. Moreover, two of the informational interventions signicantly lower welfare on average. The nudging intervention that is designed as a sales pitch has a strong impact on take-up, but does not increase understanding, and exhibits signicant reductions in welfare. There is, however, suggestive evidence for improvements in welfare from two interventions: giving individuals information about the average choices of peers, or allowing them to self-select the intervention they prefer, seems to incentivise welfare-enhancing take-up. Our core results are chilling. There have been decades of attempts by researchers, policy makers, NGOs and governments to implement behavioural interventions to promote index insurance take-up in the eld in low income countries. Despite this massive research and policy investment, we are not able to provide evidence that, even in a lab setting, these 7By focusing on insurance we know that, ceteris paribus , risk preferences determine the potential welfare, both in signandsize, from purchase decisions, and the elicitation of risk preferences is relatively conventional. The point is obviously more general. For example Moftt (1998) reviews the long-term effects of \"welfare to work\" interventions in social experiments in the United States in the mid-1980s. The impact on earnings persisted over ve years, but in two of the four interventions there was no net gain in income . In these cases the interventions simply substituted higher earnings for lower welfare payments. The general point is that there are at least two observable metrics in this example (earnings orincome), and it is not apparent that the metric preferred by researchers or policy-makers (earnings) reflects the welfare impact on recipients of the interventions. 3interventions are able to improve individual welfare. This striking conclusion is despite these interventions meeting their stated goals of increasing take-up and understanding of index insurance. This is especially problematic because our sample of university students is likely to be more nancially literate than the eld sample that these interventions typically target. The policy implication is that one has to aim to \"do no harm.\" Before taking these policy interventions to the eld, wherever possible , they should be modied and tested so that they can be reliably expected to generate average welfare gains. The concept of \"do no harm\" has direct relevance for the conduct of research on behavioural interventions. The Belmont Report8guides much research funding using human subjects, and gave the concept prominence: The Hippocratic maxim \"do no harm\" has long been a fundamental principle of medical ethics. Claude Bernard extended it to the realm of research, saying that one should not injure one person regardless of the benets that might come to others. However, even avoiding harm requires learning what is harmful; and, in the process of obtaining this information, persons may be exposed to risk of harm. Further, the Hippocratic Oath requires physicians to benet their patients \"according to their best judgment.\" Learning what will in fact benet may require exposing persons to risk. The problem posed by these imperatives is to decide when it is justiable to seek certain benets despite the risks involved, and when the benets should be foregone because of the risks. Our study operationalises the key phrase \"avoiding harm requires learning what is harmful.\" We argue that many of the metrics used implicitly to dene harm and benet do not reflect economists' denition of consumer surplus. It is common in the ethical application of randomised controlled trials to invoke the principle of \"equipoise.\" The reference here is to the notion of \"clinical equipoise\" used to justify medical interventions: the prior that we do not know what the effects will be, so it is worthwhile trying a new procedure or drug to \"see what works\" best.9We propose doing 8Presented in full in Appendix D. Important general discussions of ethical issues surrounding the conduct, authorization and evaluation of behavioural interventions include Barrett and Carter (2014), Glennerster (2017) and Teele (2014). 9The notion of \"clinical equipoise\" has an important history in medical ethics, and can be stated in a conditional form to recognise non-diffuse priors when one is deciding what randomisation weight to place on treatments or when to sequentially stop trials. But it fundamentally claims that one must have priors that the interventions will not do harm, in expectation, to the individuals they are presented to. Controversies in medical ethics arise since observational data 4better in terms of the application of equipoise to behavioural interventions in economics. In many instances, the laboratory or an artefactual eld experiment provides an environment to test if interventions work in terms of welfare, in which consenting is mandatory and enforced, and participation fees that are not tied to outcomes can more than cover direct monetary losses and the income-equivalent of any harms. Of course this means that certain aspects of an intervention cannot be tested for efcacy, such as decisions with monetary consequences that do not have a \"safety net\" beneath them. That is, in part, the point of the distinction between efcacy and effectiveness, and why, again, efcacy ndings are only ever viewed as providing a prior to justify eld applications. A key conceptual step is to be able to show the potential for interventions to cause harm. This is not as obvious as it might seem. Much of descriptive economics is built around application of the concept of (direct) revealed preference, that observed choices reveal preferences to the observer. Perhaps the one thing that behavioural welfare economists agree on is that application of that concept has to be relaxed or removed when doing normative economics. The reason is perhaps obvious: if choices only inform us what people prefer to do, then by construction those preferences can only tell us that people are doing themselves no harm (in subjective expectation). Now there are many ways to relax the application of the concept of (direct) revealed preference, but as a general matter we need to agree that we have to do that in order to be able to identify and measure \"harm\" to the individual. We use one such method of doing this, following Harrison et al. (2016, 2018b, 2018c, 2020b), Andreoni et al. (2016), Carpenter et al. (2021), McIntosh et al. (2019) and Aggarwal et al. (2020). These studies elicit preferences in a separate \"reference task,\" such as a survey or an experiment, and apply these to infer welfare from decisions in another task or observational setting. We recognise that interventions lie on a continuum in terms of the feasibility of laboratory or artefactual eld tests of \"do no harm.\" Choices over risky monetary outcomes, the extended case study we provide, are denitely on the easy end of that continuum, as are, arguably, the majority of decisions over nancial products. Hence, we believe, nancial decisions are an appropriate place to start. Choices over morbidity or on the effects of interventions is often cast aside completely when initiating randomised control trials, as if there is literally no information to be gleaned from them. Harrison (2021) discusses these issues in more depth. 5mortality risks, to be sure, are at the other end of that continuum. However, as we stress throughout and in Sections 7.3 and 7.4, the objective is to generate priors about potential harm, and priors should be expected to vary in terms of the weight we place on them. We make a general point about the ethics of behavioural interventions, but we also contribute to the understanding of index insurance as a policy mechanism. In the case of index insurance, despite its potential, demand appears low and many interventions have focused on increasing take-up.10The contractual modications inherent in index insurance imply, however, that take-up does not necessarily lead to an improvement in welfare for everyone. If that is the case, lowdemand may merely be a reflection of the fact that some consumers may be better off not purchasing the product.11We demonstrate that typical interventions that promote index insurance, while increasing purchase, are an important driver of average welfare losses. Many individuals who dotake-up index insurance are actually worse off in terms of welfare than they would have been without the insurance. In Section 2 we discuss the experimental design. In Section 3 we explain how we evaluate welfare from insurance decisions. Section 4 documents the data we collected, and Section 5 presents the results from our experiment. Section 6 asks if we can do better, in the sense of systematically exploiting the \"wind tunnel\" of the lab to nd interventions most likely to \"do not harm\" in the eld. We discuss robustness, extensions and limitations in Section 7, and in Section 8 conclude. 2 Experimental Design Our objective is to undertake normative evaluation of nancial decisions while recognising that people are heterogeneous in their preferences and can make mistakes when making decisions. First, this implies that we need to take the lessons we have so far learned from descriptive behavioural economics and apply them to normatively evaluate behaviour. Second, as noted above, we cannot rely on direct revealed preference to infer preferences from nancial decisions as that would, by denition of revealed preference, never show that 10See Gaurav et al. (2011), Cole et al. (2013), Cole et al. (2014), Norton et al. (2014), Takahashi et al. (2016), Casaburi and Willis (2018), Belissa et al. (2019) and Ceballos and Robles (2020). 11See Doherty and Schlesinger (1990) and Clarke (2016) on theoretical effects of basis risk. 6someone made the wrong decision (in expectation). Hence we need to have some experimental task that is separate from the nancial decision of normative interest with which to estimate preferences. In the simplest world of objective risk, economists know that risk preferences determine if someone will value an insurance contract with specic actuarial parameters, and that people are heterogenous in the risk preferences that matter for insurance decisions. To understand if someone should purchase insurance or not, and what the consumer surplus is from their observed purchase decisions, we thus need to infer their risk preferences. We elicit their risk preferences in an incentivised risky lottery task conducted in the laboratory, and after randomising our subjects to the baseline or treatment conditions we infer welfare from a separate incentivised task where subjects make insurance decisions in the laboratory. The explicit assumption we therefore make is that there is one set of risk preferences of an individual that applies to both tasks. The assumption is that the risk preferences that apply descriptively in one task apply normatively in the other task. There are several concerns that one might have with this approach, related to the temporal stability as well as the domain specicity of preferences. Even though these are relevant concerns, we view them as second order, simply because there are no other assumptions that one can make if the objective is normative evaluation. In Section 7.3 we do, however, discuss the empirical support for these assumptions, implications of applying this method in a eld context, and propose procedures that can be used to relax them. We conduct experiments with 480 student subjects at Georgia State University. Before subjects are randomly assigned to the baseline and intervention conditions, they participate in a risk elicitation task that allows us to characterise their risk preferences as consistent with Expected Utility Theory (EUT) or Rank Dependent Utility (RDU), elicit preferences over simple and compound risk, and measure the extent to which they violate the Reduction of Compound Lotteries (ROCL) axiom. Each subject was asked to make choices for 100 pairs of lotteries. The battery is based on designs from Loomes and Sugden (1998) to test the Independence Axiom, designs from Harrison and Ng (2016) to evaluate EUT and RDU models of risk preferences, designs from Harrison et al. (2015) to test the ROCL axiom, and a series of lotteries that are actuarially-equivalent versions of some of our 7index insurance choices.12Each subject faced a randomised sequence of choices from this battery of 100. The estimation of risk attitudes given these choices follows Harrison and Rutstr\u00f6m (2008), and is undertaken at the level of the individual subject. Our main nancial decision task is an experiment where subjects make 54 choices in which they receive an endowment that is at risk of a loss from a personal risk event. In each of the 54 choices subjects can choose to purchase index insurance or not, and at the end of the experiment one choice is randomly selected for payment. In each choice a random personal event determines losses, and a correlated random index event determines insurance claim payments if the subject chooses to purchase insurance.13We provide an endowment of $60 for each choice. Loss amounts are either $39 or $30. Loss probabilities are either 0.1 or 0.2. Premium loadings on actuarially-fair premia are -50%, 0% or +8%. Finally, the correlation of the index event and the idiosyncratic loss event is 100%, 80%, 60%, 40%, 20% or 0%. Appendix C.1 displays the choice parameters for all 54 choices presented to each subject. To better understand the manner in which subjects' understanding of the decision task effects consumer welfare, subjects engage in a task that assesses subjective beliefs about their answers to a set of ten insurance decisions randomly selected from the 54 insurance choices. An example of a question in this task is: \"What is your outcome if you decided not to purchase insurance, experienced a bad personal event, and the index outcome differs?\" We elicit these beliefs following the method of Di Girolamo et al. (2015) and Harrison et al. (2017, 2021), who use an incentivised Quadratic Scoring Rule for payment: for each question the responses of a subject are elicited over a continuous range of possible answers presented in terms of ten intervals, where one interval represents the correct answer. A computer interface is used to present the belief elicitation tasks to subjects and record their choices, allowing them to allocate tokens in accordance with their subjective beliefs. Out of the 10 questions one is selected for payment. From the belief elicitation task we produce a literacy score that takes into account both the bias and condence of beliefs. Before the subjects make their 54 insurance choices they are randomly assigned to 12Appendix B explains the rst two design components in detail. The typical interface used is shown in the rst gure in Appendix B.2, for instances of two simple lotteries. For compound lotteries we used a \"Double or Nothing\" option, illustrated in the second gure in Appendix B.2. 13Appendix B.1 provides the instruction sets for this task, including all treatments. 8one of our control or treatment interventions. In our control intervention ( Baseline ) subjects receive basic instructions about the insurance.14On the computer screens the probability of the index experiencing a loss, and the probability of the personal outcome matching the outcome of the index, are presented separately to the subjects. The monetary outcomes are also presented, based on the outcomes of the index event and personal event matching as separate events.15 In our rst treatment ( Full) subjects receive exactly the same instructions as in the control intervention, but a section is added where we work through some examples of choices, realisations of losses, and payments.16The displays are identical to the displays in theBaseline treatment. Assuming that subjects are sophisticated, the proposition we are testing is that providing subjects with more details about the product increases their understanding and thereby allows them to make choices that are closer to their preferences. This intervention was designed after eld insurance interventions in Cole et al. (2013, 2014) and Takahashi et al. (2016). In our second treatment ( AE) the display on each computer screen for each of the 54 decisions is literally identical to the display for the Baseline treatment, with the addition of \"pie displays\" showing the actuarially equivalent lotteries implied.17The instructions are the same as for the Baseline treatment but there is extra information introducing and explaining the display. The logic of the contract and underlying risk is still explained in the same manner in the instructions for the Baseline andAEtreatments. The proposition in the AE treatment is that by correctly applying the reduction of compound lotteries for the subject, violations of the ROCL axiom in the insurance decision will be avoided, leading the subject to make a more accurate comparison of the choice to purchase or not purchase insurance (Harrison et al., 2020). In our third treatment ( Practice ), before subjects start with the 54 insurance choices they receive the same instructions and displays as in the Baseline treatment, but get to experience two hypothetical practice rounds where they make decisions to purchase 14See Appendix B.1.1 for the instructions for this task. 15Appendix B.1.1 displays a typical screenshot from this treatment, using an example from the instructions. 16See Appendix B.1.2. 17See the second gure in Appendix B.1.3. 9insurance or not, and the personal loss event and index event are realised. It is then announced to subjects what their earnings would have been if these rounds had not been hypothetical. This treatment was designed after the eld interventions by Norton et al. (2014) and Cole et al. (2014) to test if hypothetical experience of decisions and realisations increases understanding, and thereby allows subjects to make choices that are closer to their preferences. In our fourth treatment ( Understand ), subjects participate in an incentivised experiment that tests their bias and condence in their own answers to a set of ten insurance choices randomly selected from the insurance experiment, following Harrison et al. (2021). This treatment tests the proposition that incentivizing subjects to better understand the insurance decision context encourages their understanding and allows them to make decisions that are closer to their risk preferences. In our fth treatment ( Sales Pitch ), subjects receive exactly the same displays and instructions as in the Baseline treatment, except that there is a preface and epilogue that explains why insurance is an important way to protect oneself against monetary losses, reduce stress, and have peace of mind.18On the displays for each of the 54 decisions one sentence is added: \"Recall that insurance is important to protect you against losses and reduce your worries.\" This treatment was designed after eld interventions by Gaurav et al. (2011) and Cole et al. (2013), to test if endorsement by an agent, through stressing the negative consequences of risk, \"nudges\" people to buy insurance. In our sixth treatment ( Peers ), subjects receive the same instructions and displays as in the Baseline treatment, except that for each of the 54 choices they receive information about the average choices that their peers made. This information is presented to them in one sentence that is added on their display which states: \"We already played several of these rounds of experiments with your peers in the last few weeks, and on average [X%] of your peers chose to purchase insurance when presented with this question.\" The proposition is that the decisions of peers functions as an endorsement, as distinct from a peer informational channel, in the adoption decision. This treatment is suggested by eld interventions by Banerjee et al. (2013) and Bursztyn et al. (2014). 18See Appendix B.1.5. 103 Evaluating the Welfare from Insurance Decisions To measure the welfare consequences of our behavioural interventions we compare the welfare gains and losses resulting from insurance decisions that our subjects make in our baseline condition and our interventions. To measure these welfare losses and gains we estimate the risk preferences of each subject based on the risk preferences task. For each of the insurance choices we can then establish, based on the estimated risk preferences, what the optimal choice of the subject is and the resulting welfare gain or loss from the observed choice. Since subjects make multiple insurance decisions we summarize the total welfare gains and losses, to derive a welfare measure for the individual. The objective of insurance is, ex ante any actual loss, to reduce the expected variability of income, by paying an insurance premium now, in exchange for a claim payment later, in case the future state is realised where the insured experiences a loss. The most obvious approach to evaluate the value of insurance is to assess the expected variability of income in the light of the risk preferences and beliefs of an individual. Therefore we focus on an assessment of the expected welfare of buying insurance to an individual, compared to the expected welfare of not buying insurance to the same individual, and term this measure the Expected Consumer Surplus (ECS) of insurance decisions. We use this measure because insurance is an ex ante risk management product, and should be evaluated in terms of the value of its ex ante protection at the time of the purchase decision, rather than in terms of its Realised Consumer Surplus conditional on the realisation of states, and thus potential losses. The calculation of the ECS from the choice to purchase insurance is, by itself, not controversial. What is perhaps controversial, to some, is how one takes the logic of that calculation to do more than just describe when someone would be expected to purchase insurance and say normatively whether they should purchase insurance. To explain these two steps, which are central to our evaluation of welfare and the very possibility of \"doing harm,\" we use one of the specic examples given to our subjects. Assume that there is an endowment of $60, and a loss probability to the individual of 20%. If there is a loss, it has value $39, leaving the individual with $21 = $60 - $39. This is a lottery {$21, 0.2; $60, 0.8} in the usual notation, for an individual that does not purchase insurance. This lottery has an Expected Value (EV) of $52.20 = $21 \u00d70.2 + $60\u00d70.8. 11Assume for now that the individual behaves consistently with EUT, and has a Power utility function u(x) =xrwith parameter r = 0.507, the estimated average of our sample. Then the Expected Utility (EU) of this lottery in which the individual does not purchase insurance is u($21)\u00d70.2 +u($60)\u00d70.8 = 7.31. With a Power utility function we know that the Certainty Equivalent (CE) of the lottery is the CE value that solves u(CE) =EU. Hence the CE = EU(1/r)= 7.31(1/0.507)= $50.62 We now repeat the logic of this calculation to obtain the CE when purchasing the insurance. The premium for the insurance is $12.50, which happens to be the actuarially-fair premium. This insurance contract provides full indemnication of all losses, and there is no risk of non-performance. The probability that the index matches the outcome of the individual is 0.8. This matching probability implies a correlation between the individual's loss and the index outcome of 0.6 = 1(2\u00d7(10.8)). In this case there are 4 possible outcomes, which we spell out in full: 1. The individual pays the $12.50 premium, the individual experiences a loss of $39, and the index matches the outcome of the individual. Hence the insurance pays out $39 and the individual ends up with $47.50 = $60$12.50$39 + $39 . The compound risk of the individual having a loss and the index matching is 0.2\u00d70.8 = 0.16. 2. The individual pays the $12.50 premium, the individual experiences a loss of $39, and the index differs from the outcome of the individual. Hence the insurance does not pay out and the individual ends up with $8.50 = $60$12.50$39. The compound risk of the individual having a loss and the index differing is 0.2\u00d7(10.8) = 0.2\u00d70.2 = 0.04. 3. The individual pays the $12.50 premium, the individual experiences no loss , and the index matches the outcome of the individual. Hence the insurance does not pay out and the individual ends up with $47.50 = $60$12.50. The compound risk of the individual having a loss and the index matching is (10.2)\u00d70.8 = 0.8\u00d70.8 = 0.64. 124. The individual pays the $12.50 premium, the individual experiences no loss , and the index differs from the outcome of the individual. Hence the insurance pays out $39 and the individual ends up with $86.50 = $60$12.50 + $39 . The compound risk of the individual having a loss and the index differing is (10.2)\u00d7(10.8) = 0.8\u00d70.2 = 0.16. The upshot of these calculations is that the lottery involved in the purchase decision is {$47.50, 0.16; simple lottery that our AEtreatment displays directly to the subject. This lottery has an EV of $52.18, slightly lower than the EV of the lottery in which no insurance is purchased, $52.20. With the same degree of risk aversion for the individual making the decision to purchase insurance or not, r=0.507, the EU of the lottery to purchase the insurance is 7.3183, which has a CE of $50.69. Comparing the two lotteries, we can now see that with this degree of risk aversion the individual gains an ECS of $0.07 = $50.69$50.62from purchasing the insurance. Again, this is the Expected CS, since it refers to all payouts from all possible events when they are weighted by their probabilities of occurring. It has nothing whatsoever to do with whether the individual actually had a loss or the index insurance actually matched that individual outcome. The same calculation can be repeated for different levels of risk aversion. We already know from the EV calculations that the ECS for a risk-neutral individual would be slightly negative, and equal to $0.02 = $52.18$52.20. If the individual was more risk averse than the average, and r= 0.3say, then the ECS would increase to $0.12; and if the individual was less risk averse than the average, and r= 0.7say, then the ECS would decrease to $0.02. Hence if we know the risk aversion of each subject, we can calculate the ECS from making either the purchase decision or the non-purchase decision. As we vary the actuarial parameters facing the individual, the ECS from making the correct decision varies. Ceteris paribus , a lower premium means a higher ECS if purchasing the product was the correct thing to do. For this reason, that some product offerings are better than others, we also consider the percentage of the total ECS that the individual realises over all decision compared to the total ECS that the same individual would have 13realised over all decisions if all decisions were correct. We term this Efciency, and it effectively normalises across subjects for the different product offerings, since each individual faces the same set of 54 product offerings by design. Everything to this point is standard Insurance 101 arithmetic: if we know the risk aversion of an individual we can determine the ECS from purchasing insurance product, and it can be positive, zero, or negative. Two complications arise when we recognise that a substantial fraction of subjects behave consistently with RDU rather than EUT, and that many subjects violate the ROCL axiom. Both are signicant for the proper structural evaluation of the ECS of observed decisions with respect to index insurance, but do not change the general logic of our approach: see Harrison et al. (2020) for details. Violations of ROCL obviously matter for understanding the basis risk of index insurance, since basis risk is just compound risk. And RDU will always matter for insurance dened over probabilistic outcomes. Now assume that we observe that our average risk averse EUT individual, who has r= 0.507, decides to notpurchase the insurance. The arithmetic tells us that this individual has foregone $0.07 in expectation that could have been gained by purchasing the insurance. Nothing controversial with that statement. But now switch from describing what we observe with our model to making normative evaluations of what we observe. What if we know that the risk aversion of the individual is 0.507, and observe the wrong choice for that risk preference? One response might be to say that we must have the wrong risk aversion for the individual, and that it must be 0.86 or higher, since that is the risk aversion parameter that can explain not purchasing insurance as the correct decision (the ECS gain then is $0.01or higher). If, however, we recognise that individuals make mistakes, misunderstand the decision-context, or are not sophisticated about their preferences, we cannot rely on direct revealed preference to infer preferences from the nancial decisions we are seeking to make normative evaluations about. To repeat, this would, by denition of revealed preference, never show that someone made the wrong decision (in expectation). This is a key step in our normative evaluation of index insurance. Solely for normative reasons, we must assume that the risk aversion of the agent can be measured independently of the observed insurance choice. We can certainly debate the best way to 14measure risk aversion, but this basic methodological point is required if we are to say that someone made an error and to be able to quantify it.19We appreciate that this argument might seem odd to some economists, steeped in descriptive economics and the desire to test every assumption. We completely share that desire when it comes to descriptive economics, but not when it comes to normative economics. In that case the best we can do is measure the preferences of each individual independently and in a separate task, in the best way we know how, and evaluate their insurance decisions in terms of these \"best estimates\" of their preferences. Further details on this normative approach to insurance purchase behaviour are provided by Harrison and Ng (2016), and Harrison (2019). To see the signicance of this normative position, consider the same individual and another choice in our battery. This choice provided the same actuarial parameters, but added a loading of just 8% to the premium, which then becomes $13.50. In this instance the correct decision for this individual is to notpurchase the insurance, generating an ECS of $0.98. And in this instance, what would we make normatively of a policy intervention that was motivated solely to increase take-up, with no regard for the risk aversion of the individual in the intervention? We would have to conclude that such an intervention simply had the wrong welfare proxy. If it had managed to increase take-up, with these changes in the actuarial parameters and risk preferences, it would have actually done harm in terms of individual welfare measured by ECS. This standard logic has two important implications. First, even if we assume an individual is an EUT decision-maker, we need to know how risk averse she is to say if her decision to \"take-up\" the product is the right one or not. The same point applies generally to the case in which she is an RDU decision maker, and even in the case in which she violates ROCL. Second, we see ECS numbers in dollars, reflecting the equivalent variation in income from old-fashioned welfare economics. We can therefore distinguish \"small\" welfare effects from \"large\" welfare effects. 19There are several concerns that one might have with this approach. First, if risk preferences are not stable over time, is there a risk of normative evaluation being based on \"stale\" preferences measured some time prior to the decisions being normatively evaluated? We agree. Second, if risk preferences are elicited in one domain, how do we know that they are appropriate for another domain? In the (agreed) absence of perfect markets, making the two domains fungible, we also agree that this is an open question. We discuss these methodological issues in Section 7.3. 154 Descriptives and Risk Preferences Table 1 shows the means of key covariates of the subjects in our sample by treatment status. The statistic in brackets is the t-statistic for an OLS regression of the specic treatment compared to the baseline on each covariate. This table shows that our randomisation to treatment was successful in terms of these observable characteristics. Figure 1 presents a histogram of the fraction of subjects, following Harrison and Ng (2016), as one of four risk types. One type is EUT, and then we have three RDU risk types depending on whether their probability weighting function is best characterised statistically by the Power, Inverse-S, or (two parameter) Prelec specication.20Approximately 50% of our subjects are classied as EUT and 40% as RDU Prelec, while only 5% and 1% behave consistently with RDU Inverse-S and RDU Power, respectively. We classify a subject as being best characterised as having EUT or RDU risk preferences, in order to make it clear that it is not just the level of risk aversion that matters, but the typeof risk preference that matters as well. This characterisation is operationalised by a subject needing to have RDU estimates that indicate statistically signicant evidence of probability weighting. Specically, we undertake a Wald test of the hypothesis that the probability weighting parameters ( for the Power and Inverse-S specications, and and for the Prelec specication) take on values that imply no probability weighting ( = 1and == 1). If we reject this null hypothesis of EUT risk preferences at the 5% signicance level, we characterize an individual as having RDU risk preferences. Unless we say otherwise, however, we always use the estimated utility function from the preferred RDU estimates for every subject when evaluating the CS for each subject. Why do this, if we have characterised an individual as EUT? 20All four models use the CRRA utility function u(x) =x(1r) (1r). The three RDU models differ in terms of the probability weighting function (p)used. The power function is (p) =p. The inverse-S function is (p) is (p) =exp((lnp)), with> 0and> and assuming (0) = 0 and(1) = 1 . The Prelec function is the most flexible. 16Table 1: Covariate Means in house 2.60 2.84 3.30 2.62 2.78 2.66 (0.59) (2.25**) (0.08) 1.53 1.39 0.62 0.54 0.52 Observations 159 31 63 69 34 38 45 36 Note: Signicance levels p < 0.10,p < 0.05,p < 0.01. The rst column presents the means in the baseline sample, while the second through to the eighth column present the means in the intervention samples. Column (2) through Column (8) also present, below the mean and in brackets, the t-statistic for OLS regressions of the specic treatment compared to the baseline on each covariate. Each covariate is binary unless otherwise indicated. \"ROCL violations\" represents the percentage of choices where subjects violated ROCL. The F-statistic tests the joint signicance of all covariates from a regression where the specic treatment (versus the baseline) is regressed on all covariates jointly. 17The statistical reason, stressed by Monroe (2021), is that those subjects that are characterised as EUT by the test for \"no probability weighting\" still have standard errors around the probability weighting parameters, and potentially large ones.21And, perhaps surprisingly, these standard errors can make a substantive difference in precisely the normative evaluations undertaken here.22Hence there is no formal need to differentiate EUT and RDU decision makers for these calculations, because EUT is nested within RDU, even if there is an important normative insight in knowing that there are these different types of risk preferences in the sample. Figure 1: Classication of Subjects by Type of Risk Preference Note: Hypothesis test that (p) =p. Signicance level of 5% or less to reject EUT. As an example of how the ECS of subjects is estimated we present the risk parameters for subject #2 in Figure 2. These risk parameters were estimated based on her choices over lotteries in the risk task and are displayed in Panel A. If subject #2 was classied as EUT, she would be risk averse with a modestly concave utility function (r = 0.58), using the utility function u(x) =x1r 1r. 21Indeed, larger standard errors make it easier to fail to reject the null hypothesis of EUT risk preferences. 22Monroe (2021) shows that they can make a difference to the analyses of full indemnity insurance 18Figure 2: Estimated Risk Parameters and Consumer Surplus for Subject #2 A. Subject#2 is classied RDU with EUT p-value = 0.038 (<0.05) B. Consumer Surplus of Choices of Subject #2 under EUT C. Consumer Surplus of Choices of Subject #2 under RDU (Prelec) 19However, the preferred model is selected based on the hypothesis test that (p) =p, and for subject #2 the preferred model is RDU with the Prelec probability weighting function. Classifying subject #2 as RDU Prelec implies, given the EUT estimates, that the utility function is less concave (r = 0.44) than under EUT. Panels B and C of Figure 2 show the importance of this classication for the welfare calculations of subject #2. Each chart shows the ECS calculated for each insurance choice made. Light blue bars indicate that the subject had chosen to purchase insurance and red bars indicate that the subject had chosen not to purchase insurance. Panel B shows the ECS distribution if we had assumed subject #2 had EUT risk preferences, and Panel C shows the ECS distribution assuming subject #2 had RDU risk preferences with the Prelec probability weighting function. Different models of risk preference type can lead to different insurance decisions being normatively recommended. For choices 28 and 29 under EUT, for example, the subject chose to purchase insurance, but that resulted in a negative ECS. Under RDU, however, the same choices resulted in a positive welfare gain. There are several such examples. Using a different model of risk preference type can also impact the sizeof the expected welfare gain from an insurance choice, and not just the sign. Choices 3 and 4 becomes less harmful when subject #2 is correctly classied as RDU compared to EUT. 5 Are We Doing Harm? Figure 3 presents the distribution of Efciency for each of 157 subjects that participated in the Baseline condition. The range of Efciency is between 0% and 100%, reflecting the percentage of ECS the subject extracted from their observed choices divided by the maximum ECS they could have extracted if they had made decisions to purchase or not purchase insurancee consistent with their risk preferences. The fact that we do not have a signicant spike at, or close to, 100% tells us that there is room for welfare improvement in the Baseline decisions that subjects make. The average is 50%, and the median is 47%, so roughly half the subjects could double their welfare gain from making decisions about index insurance that are more in line with their risk preferences. contracts considered by Harrison and Ng (2016), and our general approach follows theirs. 20Figure 3: Baseline Distribution of Efciency of Choice Note: Efciency is between 0% and 100%. One observation per individual (N=159). Efciency reflects the percentage of Expected Consumer Surplus the subject extracted from their observed 54 insurance choices divided by the maximum Expected Consumer Surplus from their 54 insurance choices that they could have extracted if they had made these insurance decisions consistent with their risk preferences. 21This distribution sets the stage for examining the effect of the treatment arms. Figure 4 shows the change in the distribution of Efciency compared to the distribution in the Baseline condition shown above. Hence these changes range between -100% and +100%, with 0% being no change compared to Baseline . There are three insights from these distributions. First, none of them exhibit the negative skew that would point to a treatment that signicantly moves Efciency to 100%. Second, all of them include signicant fractions of subjects that do worse with the treatment compared to the Baseline , as shown by the fraction of each distribution to the left of 50%. Third, four out of six treatments exhibit a tendency to lower welfare on average in comparison to Baseline (Full,Sales Pitch , Understand , and Practice ), and only one appears to exhibit a tendency to raise welfare on average in comparison to Baseline (Peers ). Even though the Peers treatment appears to reduce Efciency for those who achieve slightly more than 50% of potential welfare in the Baseline , the treatment leads to a substantial reduction in the left tail of the distribution and an increase in the right tail. It is noteworthy that the Understand treatment had the bulk of its impact, to reduce welfare, in the top tail of the Efciency distribution. In other words, those that were more relatively efcient to begin with suffered the most from this intervention. The statistical model of Efciency, at the level of the individual, is a beta regression. The statistical model of the purchase decision is a panel probit regression, recognising that each subject contributed 54 purchase decisions. The unobserved heterogeneity of each subject is accommodated in the panel regression with a random effects specication, allowing us to examine the effects of characteristics that are associated with the individual (e.g., literacy measures, demographics). We cluster standard errors at the session level, to correct for potential session-level heteroskedasticity. Figure 5 and 6 present the Average Treatment Effects and 90% condence intervals of regressions of the treatments on Efciency and take-up respectively. Figure 5 replicates the results in Figure 4, namely that none of the treatments except for the Peers treatment leads toanyimprovements in welfare. Figure 6 shows, however, that all treatments signicantly increase the probability of take-up by approximately 5 to 10 percentage points. Some initial intuition into the general determinants of good quality and bad quality 22Figure 4: Distribution of Percent Efciency in Treatments Compared to Baseline Note: Solid black lines show the kernel density of Percent Efciency for the Baseline , and the dashed red line shows percent Efciency for the indicated treatment. The Baseline distributions are the same, as shown in Figure 3. These distributions are based on one Efciency measure per subject. All treatments are between-subjects. 23Figure 5: Treatment Effects on Individual-Level Efciency Note: Average Treatment Effect and 90% condence intervals for beta regressions of the treatments (compared to the Baseline ) on Efciency. For the Full treatment N=180, for the AEtreatment N=218, for the Understand treatment N=183, for the Practice treatment N=195, for the Sales Pitch treatment N=212, for the Peers treatment N=189, for the Self-Select treatment N=190, and for all treatments combined N=461. Standard errors are clustered at the session level. 24Figure 6: Treatment Effects on Decision-Level Probability of Take-up Note: Average Treatment Effect and 90% condence intervals for panel probit regressions of the treatments (compared to the Baseline ) on take-up, with random individual effects. Each of the subjects makes 54 decisions to purchase insurance or not. For the Full treatment N=10,260, for the AEtreatment N=12,312, for the Understand treatment N=10,422, for the Practice treatment N=11,016, for the Sales Pitch treatment N=11,988, for the Peers treatment N=10,638, and for all treatments combined N=23,706. Standard errors are clustered at the session level. 25purchase decision can be obtained by just focusing on the purchases made in the Baseline .23 The median ECS is virtually zero, so roughly 50% of the purchase decisions reduced welfare and 50% of the purchase decisions improved welfare. Dene \"great decisions\" as those generating a ECS (gain) in excess of the 75th centile, and dene \"terrible decisions\" as those generating a ECS (loss) below the 25th centile. For all 119 subjects the purchase decision was made 57% of the time. But for those making terrible decisions, it was a purchase decision 83% of the time, and for those making great decisions it was a purchase decision only 26% of the time. So the stylized fact is that the terrible decisions tended to reflect excessive take-up, and the great decisions tended to reflect some caution when deciding to purchase the product. Intuitively, the contracts with a negative loading of 50% below the actuarially fair premium would be the ones that should have been taken up by most subjects, and the contracts with a positive loading of 8% above the actuarially fair premium would be the ones to scrutinize more carefully.24 With this background, Figure 6 provides the rst clue as to why all but one of the interventions led to welfare losses compared to the baseline: increased take-up. In all cases the increase in purchase rate for the positive loading of 8% was statistically signicant, with the largest increase predictably in the Sales Pitch treatment. The positive loading products are the instances where one would want to see some caution in purchasing, depending carefully on one's risk preferences, and we observe exactly the opposite on average. The largest welfare loss is from the Understand treatment, where subjects were checked on their domain-specic literacy about the index insurance product prior to making the decisions. This treatment arguably alerted many subjects to the fact that they really did not understand the index insurance product. This conclusion is a deeper one than it might seem: does it indicate a failure of the experimental design to explain the task, or an inability of subjects to comprehend the way in which an index insurance contract works, and how can one tell the two apart? The fact that the subject was \"scored,\" and with nancial 23A detailed analysis of the determinants of the Baseline purchase decisions is provided by Harrison et al. (2021). In general they nd that incentivised measures of literacy are more reliable indicators of purchase behaviour, and that for the higher quality decisions a key role is played by domain-specic literacy about the index insurance product. 24A reminder that for index insurance products the familiar Insurance Economics 101 theorem, that any risk averse EUT agent should purchase any full indemnity product for actuarially fair premiums, or lower, does not apply: again, see Clarke (2016). 26incentives for being correct and condent in the answer, arguably drove home the realization that the normal passive learning that goes on when insurance products are marketed did not translate into a deep understanding. Every professor is familiar with the puzzled student that does poorly on an exam but is certain that they understood the material when it was presented in class. Figure 7 pursues this question by examining the effect of each treatment on domain-specic literacy about the index insurance contract. The \"effect\" here is again compared to Baseline , and excludes the Understanding treatment for the obvious reason.25 We observe some improvements in domain-specic literacy, particularly for the AEand Practice treatments. The AEtreatment provides an additional visual display to help \"triangulate\" the logic by which the index insurance contract leads to four distinct outcomes that take on three distinct payoff levels. And the Practice treatment, of course, provides a worked example with hypothetical payoffs, akin to the familiar \"learning by doing\" that one encounters so much with (good) modern software. 6 Can We Do Better? The primary message of our analysis is to sharply caution against the risk of undertaking interventions that might do harm, at least based on the non-diffuse priors from our experiments. Our results do, however, allow us to illustrate two ways in which we might be able to do better. One possibility is to allow individuals themselves to \"self-select\" from a menu of interventions, rather than having them \"forced-fed\" to them. The other possibility is to use the type of data we have collected to design behaviourally \"targeted\" interventions that do not rely on presumed or inferred tendencies of the average individual. In other words, to exploit the behavioural heterogeneity we observe to identify who might be expected to make better decisions from which interventions. 25Figure 7 also excludes the Full treatment because we did not have the index insurance literacy experiment in those sessions. 27Figure 7: Treatment Effects on Individual-Level Insurance Literacy Score Note: Average Treatment Effect and 90% condence intervals for beta regressions of the treatments (compared to the Baseline ) on index insurance literacy. For the AEtreatment N=226, for the Understand treatment N=191, for the Practice treatment N=194, for the Sales Pitch treatment N=218, and for the Peers treatment N=195. No data was collected on index insurance literacy in theFull treatment. Standard errors are clustered at the session level. 286.1 Self-Selecting Behavioural Interventions The motivation for evaluating the welfare effects of behavioural interventions is driven by a recognition that individuals are heterogeneous in the preferences, beliefs, and constraints that determine their optimal choices in nancial decisions. Our sophisticated revealed preference approach, in which we descriptively elicit risk preferences in one task in order to make normative statements about welfare from insurance decisions in another task, starts from the premise that we need to be able to classify choices as mistakes. It therefore fundamentally builds on the assumption that individuals would like to be consistent about applying their preferences, beliefs, and constraints. If we extend this idea to an individuals' choices over behavioural interventions themselves, the \"force-fed\" nature of how the interventions are presented to subjects does not automatically follow as being consistent. By recognising that our subjects have an individual-specic knowledge production function, of which they might be best informed, and therefore that a specic behavioural intervention may have the highest likelihood to be welfare-enhancing for them, it is logical to consider allowing subjects to self-select the behavioural intervention. To investigate this idea we conducted an additional treatment where subjects received brief information about the content of all our interventions, and were then asked if they wanted to select one of the behavioural interventions or if they preferred to receive only the basic instructions. They then received the intervention of their choice in exactly the same manner as in the \"force-fed\" interventions. Only 2% of the subjects chose to receive only the basic instructions. More than 50% chose to receive behavioural interventions that provided additional information ( Full: 20%; Practice : 37%). Interestingly, given the sharply contrasting welfare effects displayed in Figures 4 and 5, 32% chose the Sales Pitch treatment and 10% chose the Peers treatment. Figure 8 presents the distributions of individual-level efciency for the Baseline and theSelf-Select treatment, irrespective of the intervention selected.26Although the average treatment effect on individual-level Efciency is not signicant (1 percentage point, p-value 0.27), it is striking that a large fraction of these subjects, when self-selecting into behavioural interventions, are able to achieve an improvement in welfare. Furthermore, Self-Select is the only intervention that did not lead to a signicant increase in purchase (3 percentage 26Our sample size does not allow for a breakdown of the impact of self-selection by intervention. 29Figure 8: Impact of Self-Selected Intervention on Individual-Level Efciency Note: Solid black lines show the kernel density of Percent Efciency for the Baseline (N=159), and the dashed red line shows Percent Efciency for the Self-Select (N=36) treatment. These distributions are based on one Efciency measure per subject. 30points, p-value 0.20), suggesting that self-selecting the behavioural interventions does not increase the likelihood that subjects make welfare-reducing purchase decisions as much as the \"force-fed\" interventions. 6.2 Heterogeneity The evaluation of the effect of behavioural interventions on welfare sets the stage for investigation of the distributions of welfare gains or losses to try to identify observable characteristics that may be used to design conditional interventions that can be expected to improve welfare for specic sub-groups. Barrett and Carter (2014) directly raise the issue of the risk of \"mis-targeting\" when using randomised allocations of interventions if one has information, or even prior beliefs, that one sub-sample would benet from the intervention and another sub-sample would not. Glennerster (2017) picks up on this important insight, and discusses the extent to which \"targeting\" might be feasible or efcacious. An interesting but purely illustrative heterogeneity result, which serves as a prime candidate for conditional interventions because it is easily observable, is the heterogenous treatment effect by gender. Although women realize about a 10 percentage points ( p-value 0.02) higher level of Efciency in the baseline, Figure 9 shows that the average treatment effects on Efciency for women are all negative, and signicantly different from zero in four out of six treatments. In stark contrast, the average treatment effects on Efciency for men are positive in ve out of six treatments, albeit only signicant in one treatment. The differences between men and women are also signicant, at the 5 percent level, in ve out of six treatments. One policy implication of this heterogeneity is that, if gender is the only demographic one can condition on, women should not receive anyof the interventions. On the other hand, men should receive the Peers intervention. Of course, life is more subtle than this, with other observable characteristics in play, but the general message is clear: a bit of distributional information from our interventions can go a long way towards policy design that Does No Harm. By focusing on the average treatment effect one misses information in the tails of the distributions of effects. Our proposal is to \"connect the tails\" of the distributions for each intervention to design conditional interventions. 31Figure 9: Treatment Impact on Individual-Level Efciency by Gender Note: The top and bottom panel present the Average Treatment Effect and 90% condence intervals of a re-estimation of our beta-regressions of our treatments (compared to the Baseline ) on Efciency for a sub-sample of women (N=298) and men respectively (N=167). Standard errors are clustered at the session level. For the sub-sample of women, for the Full treatment N=113, for the AEtreatment N=138, for the Understand treatment N=119, for the Practice treatment N=119, for the Sales Pitch treatment N=126, and for the Peers treatment N=122. For the sub-sample of men, for the Full treatment N=68, for the AEtreatment N=81, for the Understand treatment N=64, for the Practice treatment N=69, for the Sales Pitch treatment N=85, and for the Peers treatment N=68. 32We would \"connect the tails\" normatively by identifying sub-groups of individuals that are statistically likely to respond to specic interventions. We naturally dene sub-groups in terms of observable characteristics, but also potentially in terms of inferred characteristics such as preferences and beliefs.27We can then use statistical methods, such as quantile regression, or even machine-learning algorithms to generate \"random forests,\" to link sub-group X with treatment Y: see Carter et al. (2019) for an extended example. We would then test these predictions to see if they do lead to improved distributions of welfare out of sample. The recognition that heterogeneity of welfare impact might be the basis for normatively designing better, conditional interventions is one that has tremendous promise in general. Rather than just providing one-size-ts-all, unconditional interventions, these behavioural interventions are tailored to provide specic advice or information designed for the behavioural characteristics of those making insurance decisions. These are \"behaviourally smart\" conditional interventions, not unconditional \"nudges\" in the spirit of Thaler and Sunstein (2003). 7 Robustness, Extensions and Limitations 7.1 Isn't EUT More Normatively Attractive than RDU? We have used the best descriptive model of an individual's risk preferences to make normative evaluations of the insurance purchase choices of the same individual. In effect this assumes periculum habitus non est disputandum (risk preferences are not to be disputed), as proposed by Harrison and Ng (2016). This approach allows that there might be some normative rationale for individuals to hold RDU preferences. However, many would claim that EUT is somehow \"more normatively attractive\" than RDU. Although we do not automatically agree with this position, it is certainly worthy of examination because some economists view it as self-evident. 27DellaVigna et al. (2013) remind us of the general point that it is marginal effects of characteristics, conditional on other characteristics of the subject or task, rather than total effects, that matter. 33The main effect of using the EUT-consistent risk preferences for every individual's evaluation of the quality of their decisions is that we nd that allof the interventions do harm to the average subject. In general we also see more heterogeneity in the welfare effects, consistent with the fact that some relatively extreme utility function estimates are required to capture the risky lottery choice patterns that are better characterised by a mix of utility functions and probability weighting functions. These results can be seen in Figure 10, which is to be directly compared to Figure 5. The greater heterogeneity in risk preferences is reflected in wider condence intervals. Figure 10: Treatment Impact on Individual-Level Efciency Assuming EUT for All Subjects Note: Average Treatment Effect and 90% condence intervals for beta regressions of the treatments (compared to the Baseline ) on Efciency. For the Full treatment N=188, for the AEtreatment N=226, for the Understand treatment N=191, for the Practice treatment N=194, for the Sales Pitch treatment N=218, and for the Peers treatment N=195. Standard errors are clustered at the session level. 34The most striking result is that the welfare gains from the Peers treatment are now wiped out, and we nd a statistically signicant welfare loss on average. This is an interesting result because the Peers treatment is the only treatment that uses information about the average of the distribution of purchases amongst peers, which represents about 60% RDU decision-makers and 40% EUT decision-makers. Subjects who are RDU and probability weight may have positive welfare effects from purchase, whereas the same subject might have welfare losses from purchase when characterised by EUT. If we then assume that everyone is EUT, those decisions by those RDU subjects are suddenly bad for them, leading to welfare losses. This result again demonstrates why it is critical to think carefully about which normative models of risk preferences are being applied to evaluate interventions. The welfare gains for the Full treatment are roughly the same, although the added heterogeneity just leads to the upper bound of the welfare effect including zero. The welfare losses for the AEtreatment, on the other hand, are now statistically signicant. There is a noticeable reduction in the welfare loss from the Understand treatment, although it remains statistically signicant. The welfare losses from the Practice treatment are the same, apart from the effect of heterogeneity. The Sales Pitch treatment now has a larger average loss, and little change in the precision. In summary, our qualitative results really only change for the Peers treatment when one insists on using EUT as the normative metric for welfare evaluation. And that change for the Peers treatment only makes our \"do no harm\" alarm even more serious, since it then applies to every intervention. 7.2 Risk Preferences that Relax ROCL One conceptual limitation of the methodology we have applied for calculating the expected welfare benets from insurance purchase decisions is that we assume the subject evaluates ECS by using ROCL. This is true whether the subject is classied as having EUT or RDU preferences, since both assume ROCL. We therefore follow Harrison and Ng (2018) and consider variants of the EUT and RDU models that do not assume ROCL. For the variant of EUT we consider a \"Source-Dependent\" model in which the 35individual has one risk attitude for simple lotteries and potentially another risk attitude for compound lotteries. In historical context, Smith (1969) proposed this specication as one that was consistent with the evidence from several of the thought experiments underlying the (two-color) Ellsberg paradox. If we view these types of lotteries as dening different sources of risk, this specication deviates from ROCL to the extent that these risk attitudes differ. For the variant of RDU we apply the methodology from (Segal, 1990, 1992) to relax the ROCL assumption, leading to what is often referred to as the Recursive RDU model. The basic idea is to assume that the second-stage lotteries of any compound lottery are replaced by their CE, \"throwing away\" information about the second-stage probabilities before one examines the rst-stage probabilities at all. Hence one cannot then dene the actuarially-equivalent simple lottery, by construction, since the informational bridge to that calculation has been burnt. If this CE is generated by RDU, then one can apply RDU to evaluate the rst-stage lottery using those CE as nal outcomes. The Recursive RDU model assumes one set of RDU preference parameters, just applied recursively in this manner.28 The overall distribution of risk preferences of subjects is similar whether or not we assume ROCL.29In this case the classication employs non-nested hypothesis tests, since the Source-Dependent EUT model and Recursive RDU model are not nested.The classication of type of risk preference are similar in the sense that the \"EUT counterpart characterizes around 50% of the subjects in each case,\" but of course the models are in principle quite different. In fact they are not all that different in practice. The EUT model is nested in the Source-Dependent EUT model, and at the 5% signicance level 90% of the subjects classied as having risk preferences consistent with Source-Dependent EUT are actually EUT subjects. The same nding is not true of the Recursive RDU models, which in turn nests RDU. But the upshot is that just over 40% of our subjects behave consistently with EUT, whether or not one imposes ROCL, and hence would have no change in their welfare evaluations compared to when we assumed ROCL. The welfare results of using models of risk preferences that do not assume ROCL are 28It would be a simple matter to also consider a Source-Dependent Recursive RDU, or just a Source-Dependent RDU model. There is only one way for ROCL to be valid, but an innite number of ways for it to be invalid. 29See Figure A.8 in the appendix. 36roughly the same as our default results. These results can be seen clearly in Figure 11, which is to be directly compared to Figure 5. The welfare gains for the Full treatment are roughly the same, suggesting a larger welfare loss and even more clearly statistical signicance. The welfare losses for the AEand Understand treatments are virtually the same. The welfare losses from the Practice treatment are reduced slightly, and the upper bound of the 95% condence interval now (just) spans zero. The Sales Pitch treatment now has a slightly larger average loss. And the Peers treatment has roughly the same welfare gain on average, and with a smaller condence interval. In summary, our qualitative results do not change when one considers relaxing the assumption of ROCL for the models of risk preferences that underlie the normative metric for welfare evaluation. 7.3 Normative Evaluation and Reference Tasks To conduct normative evaluation of nancial decisions we need to make the explicit and necessary assumption that there is a set of risk preferences of an individual that we can identify in a risky lottery task, and that we can apply as priors in an insurance task, to infer welfare from insurance decisions. There are several concerns that one might have with this approach. If risk preferences are not stable over time, is there a risk of normative evaluation being based on \"stale\" preferences? If risk preferences are elicited in one domain, how do we know that they are appropriate for another domain?30 Even though these are relevant concerns, we argue that they are second order, simply because there are no other assumptions that one can make if the objective is normative evaluation. Now that we have demonstrated our method based on that assumption, however, it is appropriate to engage in debate over the strength or weakness of our prior and potential alternative priors for risk preferences that might be used. This is where the 30Some studies suggest that preferences are not stable over time (Hanaoka et al., 2018; Sakha, 2019), and others suggest they are not stable across domains (Barseghyan et al., 2011; Einav et al., 2012). Another set of studies nd positive correlations between risk preferences estimated in a laboratory or artefactual eld experiment and behaviour and events in the eld (Anderson and Mellor, 2008; Voors et Individual-Level Efciency ROCL Axiom Note: Average Treatment Effect and 90% condence intervals for beta regressions of the treatments (compared to the Baseline ) on Efciency. For the Full treatment N=188, for the AEtreatment N=226, for the Understand treatment N=191, for the Practice treatment N=194, for the Sales Pitch treatment N=218, and for the Peers treatment N=195. Standard errors are clustered at the session level. 38ongoing discussion of these, and related, descriptive characterisations of risk preferences have a legitimate role: helping us navigate among the various priors we might use. In our rst attempt of applying this method in the laboratory the risky lottery choice task and the insurance decisions are made contemporaneously, implying that there is no serious issue of temporal stability that arises in this instance. And the nancial-outcome frame of the risky lottery choice task is close to the nancial-outcome frame of the insurance purchase task, so we also don't anticipate a serious issue of domain-specicity in this instance. But the objective of our work is obviously to demonstrate this application so that it can be generalized, particularly to the eld, so discussion of these issues is important. Temporal stability of preferences can mean three things, and can be dened at the aggregate level for pooled samples or for individuals.31Our concern is with individuals, and this is arguably a more demanding requirement.32One interpretation of temporal preference stability is that risk preferences are unconditionally stable over time. This means that the risk preference parameter estimates we obtain for a given individual should predict the risk preference parameters she would use in the future when she makes the decision that we are normatively evaluating, no matter what else happens in her life. This is the strongest version of a \"temporal stability of preferences\" assumption, and will presumably be rejected for longer and longer gaps between elicitation of the risk preferences and normative evaluation of the decision.33 A second interpretation of temporal preference stability is that risk preferences are conditionally stable. This interpretation assumes that risk preferences might be state-dependent and stable over time, but there could be changes in the relevant states over time. This interpretation implies that the risk preference parameter estimates for a subject might depend on her age, for example, and that particular \"state\" changes in thankfully 31And the relevant characteristic of stability can vary with the inferences being made. For some inferences we only care about the ranking of individuals in terms of risk premia, and for some inferences we care about the level of the risk premia for individuals. We assume the latter for our purposes. 32There is very little data collected on any forms of stability at the individual level. Most of the evidence concerns averages or distributions over individuals. 33Chuang and Schechter (2015) review the literature and suggest low correlations of risk preferences over time. Harrison et al. (2005) nd evidence of unconditional stability over 5 or 6 months for average levels of risk aversion. Andersen et al. (2008, \u00a75.1) similarly nd evidence of unconditional stability over 17 months for distributions of risk attitudes. 39predictable ways. Of course, this predictability presumes that we have a decent statistical estimate of the effect of age on risk preferences, but it is plausible that this could be obtained. If the states are readily observable, such as age, conditional stability is perhaps a reasonable prior to have for normative evaluation.34 A third interpretation is that risk preferences might be state-dependent and the states are not observable, or that the risk preferences are themselves stochastic. In this instance there are stochastic specications, which in turn embody hyper-priors, that let us say something about stability (e.g., that the unobserved states are xed for the individual, or that the stochastic variation in preference realisations follows some xed, parametric distribution).35 Domain specicity of risk preferences involves systematically examining the role of alternative priors over the risk preferences on posterior-based inference about the nancial decisions we aim to normatively evaluate. This implies we should use Bayesian formalisms. Imagine one was designing a eld experiment, say in rural Ethiopia, in which various interventions for a health insurance product were to be used to improve the welfare of rural Ethiopian households. Assume that this health insurance product focused on acute conditions, with signicant mortality risk. The only priors on risk preferences you have come from university students who participated in laboratory experiments in the United States. Should you go ahead and design interventions that, conditional on the risk preferences of the university students, lead to expected welfare losses for the same students, of the kind we have demonstrated? We suggest that, ethically speaking, you should not. Now imagine you have been able to conduct comparable incentivised artefactual eld experiments with risky lottery choices in Ethiopia with the target population of rural Ethiopian households that allow you to infer risk preferences over nancial outcomes. These are obviously better priors for the risk preferences needed to undertake the eventual normative inference about the health insurance decisions, and should be used. In this case 34Andersen et al. (2008, \u00a75.2) nd evidence that the state of personal nances of individuals systematically affects risk preferences over a 17 month period. 35Allowing for unobserved heterogeneity, Harrison et al. (2020) nd evidence for temporal stability of distributions of risk preferences over 6 to 12 months, but only when correcting formally for sample selection and attrition. And they infer temporal instability when those corrections are not made. No prior study has corrected for selection or attrition when drawing inferences about temporal stability. 40we would completely discard the priors from students in the United States. Next, imagine that you have been able to conduct artefactual eld experiments over certain risky health outcomes in Ethiopia that allow you to infer risk preferences. Assume that these health outcomes refer to morbidity risks, not mortality risks, but to real outcomes nonetheless.36 Clearly the domain of risk preferences here is closer than the risk preferences dened over money because they were elicited in the context of health choices. However, because we know that eliciting risk preferences over health risks is not as reliable, would you now attach zeroweight to the risk preferences over money by similar Ethiopians? Probably not. What this discussion shows is that it is simplistic to attempt to make a general statement about the validity of preferences for a reference risk preference elicitation task and a different task that is the target of normative evaluation, since it depends entirely on the timing, context, and domain of the two tasks. However, the statistical methods that we have at our disposal (Bayesian analysis) merely demand that we are able to dene a diffuse or an informed prior in one task or domain, to do normative evaluation of decisions in another domain, without having to require that the elicited risk preferences are perfectly valid for the decision task that we want to make normative statements about. 7.4 How General is This? We are making a general point, that economists should do a better job generating priors as to the efcacy of behavioural interventions before applying them to the eld. We have repeatedly stressed the idea that these are priors, and priors can be stronger or weaker depending on the context. Priors are beliefs about the data-generating process (DGP) in question, in our case decisions to purchase insurance and the individual welfare implications of these decisions. In Bayesian terms, we refer to diffuse priors as conveying no information about the DGP, an informative prior as conveying \"precise\" information about a DGP, and weakly-informative priors as conveying partial information about the DGP. A precise, informative prior does not mean the same thing as a \"low variance\" belief: one can be condent that the variance is high, by some metric. It just means that it informs all of the parameters or sufcient statistics dening the DGP. A weakly-informative prior might be 36As any experimental economist knows, it is not easy to come up with morbidity outcomes that can be credibly and ethically delivered within the budgets we normally nd ourselves facing. 41one that constrains a parameter to be non-negative or bounded, but is otherwise diffuse.37 So stated, we have no difculty identifying situations in which our priors might be stronger or weaker. Our discussion of temporal stability and domain-specicity speak to this point, flagging the trade-offs we see in terms of the risk preferences that form priors for a wide class of risky decisions. And our discussion of \"equipoise\" as an implicit prior used for many interventions is really all about the extent to which observational data is to be completely ignored prior to the design of some randomised control trial (Harrison, 2021). Of course, identifying weaker or stronger priors for a given application is one thing: it is another thing to get agreement on that ranking, or on \"how weak\" or \"how strong\" the prior is. That concern is easily, and formally, evaluated with sensitivity analysis over different priors when making posterior-based inferences about welfare effects (Leamer and Leonard, 1983). Indeed, the use of EUT-only risk preferences in \u00a77.1 illustrates that perfectly. More to the immediate ethical \"do no harm\" point before going into the eld, one might undertake a formal \"pre-posterior analyses\" or Bayesian experimental design (Berger, 1985). The same ethical point applies to deciding when to terminate sequential interventions, or to weight or sequentially re-weight treatment arms for randomised selection (Berry et al., 2011). So what? Thinking of laboratory or artefactual eld experiments as a source of priors for ethically validating eld experiments does not lend itself to ever completely rejecting those experiments as a source of priors. Consider the case in which we pro-actively concede that risk preferences over monetary stakes provide weak priors for decisions: where the decision is over index insurance dened over morbidity or mortality outcomes. If the proposed interventions to encourage welfare-improving decisions come from the laundry list we have 37A Bayesian is always careful to avoid setting the density of a probability mass function or probability density function of a prior to zero for some values of parameters, since that dooms the posterior to never be able to take on those values, no matter what the data suggests. So Bayesians always like to have some chance that the posterior can take on any value. In practical terms this leads to the use of mixture distributions as priors, often referred to as /epsilon1-contaminated priors: there is some informative prior given 1/epsilon1weight, and some appropriately diffuse prior given/epsilon1weight (see Berger (1984) and Berger and Berliner (1986)). A related issue, of some signicance for the estimation of multi-parameter models such as RDU, is that one can specify a series of univariate prior distributions over each parameter and still have a non-zero posterior covariance matrix for all parameters if that is what the data suggests. See Gao et al. (2020) for application of Bayesian methods to the type of welfare evaluation employed here. 42considered, why would one completely ignore these priors if no other priors were available? 8 Conclusion One theme lies at the heart of a rigorous evaluation of policy using the insights of behavioural welfare economics: how to judge if some policy is encouraging good decisions or bad decisions. One approach, which drives the \"nudge\" movement and some \"randomised evaluations,\" is to assume that judgment away, and simply assert that some change in an observable must be good for all preferences and beliefs. Isn't it obvious that people should save more, eat less fatty foods, drink less wine, and take-up insurance? Of course not: economics teaches us that the demand for these behaviours depends on preferences and beliefs, and hence the expected consumer surplus from these behaviours is also conditional on preferences and beliefs. Further, no sensibly realistic economics that recognises heterogeneity of preferences and beliefs, and identies a welfare-enhancing treatment conditional on those preferences and beliefs, tells us that this would be a welfare-enhancing treatment on average if applied unconditionally . Our approach takes a position on how one judges good and bad decisions, and there are other approaches that policy makers should be aware of and consider. Assuming the normative validity of our approach for now, we come to a major conclusion when applied to the canonical tool of risk management, insurance: that blindly encouraging take-up may lead to welfare losses . Blind watchmakers typically end up making a lotof terrible watches before they come across onegood watch. Hence studies that evaluate the impact on take-up of policy interventions that promote index insurance38should be extended to include an analysis of the welfare of index insurance purchase decisions so that future policies do no harm in expectation. Our primary message is to sharply caution against the risk of undertaking interventions that might do harm. The implication, for us, is to do more theory, more laboratory experiments, more artefactual eld experiments, and to become more humble and patient before undertaking eld experiments. 38Such as Gin\u00e9 et al.

In each choice you will start out with an initial amount of money and, in the event of a loss, the loss amount will be taken from this initial stake. In each choice you will have the option to buy insurance to protect you against the possible loss, although you are not required to buy the insurance. You will make 54 choices in this task. You will actually get the chance to play one of the choices you make, and you will be paid in cash according to the outcome of that choice. So you should think carefully about how much each insurance choice is worth to you. Each choice has two random events: a Personal Event and an Index Event . Each event has two possible outcomes: Good orBad. If the Personal Event outcome is Bad, then you will suffer a loss. Before you know the outcome of the Personal Event, you must decide whether to purchase insurance against this possible loss. However, the insurance only pays a claim if the Index Event outcome is Bad. If you do not purchase insurance , then only the outcome of the Personal Event will decide your earnings: Personal Event Your Earnings Bad Initial stake - Loss Good Initial stake If you do purchase insurance , it is important for you to understand that an insurance claim is not paid according to whether you actually suffer a loss. Instead, an insurance claim is paid only according to the Index Event. Both events will decide your earnings: B-1Personal Event Index Event Your Earnings Bad Bad Initial stake - Insurance cost - Loss + Insurance Coverage Bad Good Initial stake - Insurance cost - Loss Good Good Initial stake - Insurance cost - Loss Good Bad Initial stake - Insurance cost + Insurance Coverage So there are four possible outcomes if you purchase insurance. You might suffer a loss and receive an insurance claim payment. Or you might suffer a loss but not receive an insurance claim payment. You might not suffer a loss and also receive no insurance claim payment. Finally, you might receive an insurance claim payment even when you do not suffer a loss. Each event is determined by randomly drawing a colored chip from a bag. In general, each draw will involve two colors, and each decision you make will involve different amounts and mixtures of two colors. When making each decision, you will know the exact amounts and mixtures of colored chips associated with the decision. After you have decided whether or not to purchase insurance, the two events will be determined as follows. First, the Personal Event will be determined with blue and red chips. \u000fIf you draw a blue chip, then the Personal Event outcome is Good and you do not suffer a loss. \u000fIf you draw a redchip, then the Personal Event outcome is Badand you suffer a loss. Next, if you purchased insurance, the Index Event will be determined with green and black chips. \u000fIf you draw a green chip, then the Index Event outcome Matches the Personal Event outcome \u000fIf you draw a black chip, then the Index event outcome Differs from the Personal Event outcome B-2Here is an example of what your decision would look like on the computer screen. The display on your screen will be bigger and easier to read. In this example you start out with an initial stake of $75. If the outcome of the Personal Event is Badyou will lose $45, and if the outcome of the Personal Event is Good you will not lose any money. If you faced the choice in this example and chose to purchase insurance, you would pay $5.75 from your initial stake. You would pay this $5.75 before you drew any chips, so you would pay it regardless of the outcomes of your draws. You will be drawing colored chips from bags to determine the outcomes of both events. First, you will draw a chip to determine the Personal Event outcome. The image on the left shows that there is a 10% chance that the Personal Event outcome is Bad, and a 90% chance that the Personal Event outcome is Good . This means there will be 9 blue chips and 1 red chip in a bag, and the color of the chip you randomly draw from the bag represents the outcome of the Personal Event. If a blue chip is drawn, the Personal Event outcome is Good , and if a red chip is drawn the Personal Event outcome is Bad. Next, you will draw a chip to determine the Index Event outcome. There is an 80% chance that the Index Event outcome Matches the Personal Event outcome and a 20% chance B-3that the Index Event outcome Differs from the Personal Event outcome. This means there will be 8 green chips and 2 black chips in a bag. If a green chip is drawn the Index Event outcome Matches the Personal Event outcome, and if a black chip is drawn the Index Event outcome Differs from the Personal Event outcome. You will indicate your choice to purchase, or not purchase, the insurance by clicking on your preferred option on the computer screen. There are 54 decisions like this one to be made, each shown on a separate screen on the computer. Each decision might have different chances for the Personal Event outcome, the Index Event outcome, the initial stake, or the cost of insurance, so pay attention to each screen. After you have worked through all of the insurance decisions, please wait in your seat and an experimenter will come to you. You will then roll two 10-sided dice to determine which insurance decision will be played out. Since there are only 54 decisions, you will keep rolling the dice until a number between 1 and 54 comes up. There is an equal chance that any of your 54 choices will be selected, so you should approach each decision as if it is the one that you will actually play out to determine your payoff. Once the decision to play out is selected, you will draw chips from the Index bag and the Personal bag to determine the outcome. In summary: \u000fYou will decide whether or not to purchase insurance in each of the 54 scenarios. \u000fOne of your decisions will be randomly selected to be played for cash. \u000fYou will suffer the specied monetary loss only if the Personal Event outcome is Bad. \u000fIf you purchase insurance, it will pay a claim payment only if the Index Event outcome is Bad. This can happen in two ways: 1. Your Index draw Matches a bad Personal Event outcome; 2. Your Index draw Differs from a good Personal Event outcome. Whether or not you prefer to buy the insurance is a matter of personal taste. You may choose to buy insurance on some or all of your 54 choices, or none of the choices. The B-4people next to you may be presented with different choices, insurance prices, and may have different preferences, so their responses should not matter to you. Please work silently, and make your choices by thinking carefully about each prospect. Your payoff from this task is in cash and is in addition to the show-up payment that you receive just for being here, as well as any other earnings in other tasks. If you have a question, raise your hand and someone will come over and answer it. B-5B.1.2 Full treatment Choices Over Insurance Prospects In this task you will make choices about whether to insure against possible monetary loss. In each choice you will start out with an initial amount of money and, in the event of a loss, the loss amount will be taken from this initial stake. In each choice you will have the option to buy insurance to protect you against the possible loss, although you are not required to buy the insurance. You will make 54 choices in this task. You will actually get the chance to play one of the choices you make, and you will be paid in cash according to the outcome of that choice. So you should think carefully about how much each insurance choice is worth to you. Each choice has two random events: a Personal Event and an Index Event . Each event has two possible outcomes: Good orBad. If the Personal Event outcome is Bad, then you will suffer a loss. Before you know the outcome of the Personal Event, you must decide whether to purchase insurance against this possible loss. However, the insurance only pays a claim if the Index Event outcome is Bad. If you do not purchase insurance , then only the outcome of the Personal Event will decide your earnings: Personal Event Your Earnings Bad Initial stake - Loss Good Initial stake If you do purchase insurance , it is important for you to understand that an insurance claim is not paid according to whether you actually suffer a loss. Instead, an insurance claim is paid only according to the Index Event. Both events will decide your earnings: B-6Personal Event Index Event Your Earnings Bad Bad Initial stake - Insurance cost - Loss + Insurance Coverage Bad Good Initial stake - Insurance cost - Loss Good Good Initial stake - Insurance cost - Loss Good Bad Initial stake - Insurance cost + Insurance Coverage So there are four possible outcomes if you purchase insurance. You might suffer a loss and receive an insurance claim payment. Or you might suffer a loss but not receive an insurance claim payment. You might not suffer a loss and also receive no insurance claim payment. Finally, you might receive an insurance claim payment even when you do not suffer a loss. Each event is determined by randomly drawing a colored chip from a bag. In general, each draw will involve two colors, and each decision you make will involve different amounts and mixtures of two colors. When making each decision, you will know the exact amounts and mixtures of colored chips associated with the decision. After you have decided whether or not to purchase insurance, the two events will be determined as follows. First, the Personal Event will be determined with blue and red chips. \u000fIf you draw a blue chip, then the Personal Event outcome is Good and you do not suffer a loss. \u000fIf you draw a redchip, then the Personal Event outcome is Badand you suffer a loss. Next, if you purchased insurance, the Index Event will be determined with green and black chips. \u000fIf you draw a green chip, then the Index Event outcome Matches the Personal Event outcome \u000fIf you draw a black chip, then the Index event outcome Differs from the Personal Event outcome B-7Here is an example of what your decision would look like on the computer screen. The display on your screen will be bigger and easier to read. In this example you start out with an initial stake of $75. If the outcome of the Personal Event is Badyou will lose $45, and if the outcome of the Personal Event is Good you will not lose any money. If you faced the choice in this example and chose to purchase insurance, you would pay $5.75 from your initial stake. You would pay this $5.75 before you drew any chips, so you would pay it regardless of the outcomes of your draws. You will be drawing colored chips from bags to determine the outcomes of both events. First, you will draw a chip to determine the Personal Event outcome. The image on the left shows that there is a 10% chance that the Personal Event outcome is Bad, and a 90% chance that the Personal Event outcome is Good . This means there will be 9 blue chips and 1 red chip in a bag, and the color of the chip you randomly draw from the bag represents the outcome of the Personal Event. If a blue chip is drawn, the Personal Event outcome is Good , and if a red chip is drawn the Personal Event outcome is Bad. Next, you will draw a chip to determine the Index Event outcome. There is an 80% chance that the Index Event outcome Matches the Personal Event outcome and a 20% chance B-8that the Index Event outcome Differs from the Personal Event outcome. This means there will be 8 green chips and 2 black chips in a bag. If a green chip is drawn the Index Event outcome Matches the Personal Event outcome, and if a black chip is drawn the Index Event outcome Differs from the Personal Event outcome. The possible outcomes if you choose not to purchase insurance are therefore as follows: Personal Event outcome Your Earnings Red ( Bad) $75 - $45 = $30 Blue ( Good ) $75 - $0 = $75 \u000fIf a red chip is drawn from the Personal bag your Personal Event outcome is Bad. You will lose $45 and be left with $30. \u000fIf a blue chip is drawn from the Personal bag your Personal Event outcome is Good . You will lose nothing and be left with $75. You can choose to purchase insurance, which will cost you $5.75, and if you chose to purchase insurance you would pay this $5.75 regardless of the outcomes of your draws. The possible outcomes if you choose to purchase insurance are therefore as follows: Personal Draw Index Draw Your Earnings Red ( Bad) Green ( MatchesBad) $75 - $5.75 - + $45 = $114.25 \u000fIf a red chip is drawn from the Personal bag and a green chip from the Index bag, you will lose $45 but the insurance claim payment will cover the loss. You will keep $69.25. \u000fIf a red chip is drawn from the Personal bag and a black chip from the Index bag, you will lose $45 but you will notreceive an insurance claim payment from insurance. You will keep $24.25. B-9\u000fIf a blue chip is drawn from the Personal bag and a green chip from the Index bag, you will not lose any money. You will keep $69.25. \u000fIf a blue chip is drawn from the Personal bag and a black chip from the Index bag, you will not lose any money, but you receive a claim payment from insurance. You will keep $114.25. You will indicate your choice to purchase, or not purchase, the insurance by clicking on your preferred option on the computer screen.

This means there will be 8 green chips and 2 black chips in a bag. If a green chip is drawn the Index Event outcome Matches the Personal Event outcome, and if a black chip is drawn the Index Event outcome Differs from the Personal Event outcome. You will indicate your choice to purchase, or not purchase, the insurance by clicking on your preferred option on the computer screen. There are 54 decisions like this one to be made, each shown on a separate screen on the computer. Each decision might have different chances for the Personal Event outcome, the Index Event outcome, the initial stake, or the cost of insurance, so pay attention to each screen. The screen that you will actually see has one additional piece of information, shown in this display. In this case you should note that the initial stakes are now $60, that the loss is now $35, and that the cost of the insurance is now $14.50. This shows how these values might change from screen to screen, as mentioned earlier. The additional information is contained in the two \"pie displays\" on the right hand side. These additional displays are just another way to view the same information, and may or may not help you make your choice to purchase insurance or not to purchase insurance. B-15In this example you start out with an initial stake of $60. If the outcome of the Personal Event is Badyou will lose $35, and if the outcome of the Personal Event is Good you will not lose any money. If you faced the choice in this example and chose to purchase insurance, you would pay $14.50 from your initial stake. You would pay this $14.50 before you drew any chips, so you would pay it regardless of the outcomes of your draws. In this example there is a 20% chance that the outcome of the Personal Event is Bad, and an 80% chance that the Personal Event outcome is Good . There is an 80% chance that the Index Event outcome Matches the Personal Event outcome and a 20% chance that the Index Event outcome Differs from the Personal Event outcome. Based on these probabilities, the pie charts show the overall probabilities of the possible earnings and their respective amounts. The top pie chart shows the possible earnings if you choose not to purchase insurance . Without insurance, the payouts depend only on the outcome of the Personal Event. Given that there is a 20% chance that the Personal Event outcome is Badand an 80% chance that the Personal Event outcome is Good , the pie chart shows that there is a 20% chance you earn $25 (= $60 - $35) and an 80% chance that you earn $60. The bottom pie chart shows the possible earnings if you choose to purchase insurance . Since the insurance claim is only paid out according to the outcome of the Index Event, outcomes from both the Index Event andthe Personal Event will decide your earnings. There is an 80% chance that the Index Event outcome Matches the Personal Event outcome. Hence there is an 80% chance you will either receive a claim payment when you suffer a loss ornot receive a claim payment when you do not suffer a loss. If either of these happen your payout will be $45.50: your initial stake of $60 less the $14.50 cost of insurance. In the case in which you receive a claim payment when you suffer a loss the payout of $35 completely offsets the loss of $35. According to the bottom pie chart the chance that the Personal Event outcome is Bad, but the Index Event outcome Differs , is 4% (= 20%\u00d720%). This means that there is a 4% chance that the Personal Event outcome is Badwithout receiving an insurance claim payment . In this case you will receive $10.50: your initial stake of $60 less the $14.50 cost of insurance less the $35 loss. The chance that the Personal Event outcome is Good , and the Index Event outcome Differs , is 16% (= 80%\u00d720%). This means that there is a 16% chance B-16that the Personal Event outcome is Good and you still receive an insurance claim payment. In this case you will receive $80.50: your initial stake of $60 less the $14.50 cost of insurance plus the $35 claim payment from the insurance. There are 54 decisions like this one to be made, each shown on a separate screen on the computer. Each decision might have different chances for the Personal Event outcome, the Index Event outcome, the initial stake, or the cost of insurance, so pay attention to each screen. After you have worked through all of the insurance decisions, please wait in your seat and an experimenter will come to you. You will then roll two 10-sided dice to determine which insurance decision will be played out. Since there are only 54 decisions, you will keep rolling the dice until a number between 1 and 54 comes up. There is an equal chance that any of your 54 choices will be selected, so you should approach each decision as if it is the one that you will actually play out to determine your payoff. Once the decision to play out is selected, you will draw chips from the Index bag and the Personal bag to determine the outcome. In summary: \u000fYou will decide whether or not to purchase insurance in each of the 54 scenarios. \u000fOne of your decisions will be randomly selected to be played for cash. \u000fYou will suffer the specied monetary loss only if the Personal Event outcome is Bad. \u000fIf you purchase insurance, it will pay a claim payment only if the Index Event outcome is Bad. This can happen in two ways: 1. Your Index draw Matches a bad Personal Event outcome; 2. Your Index draw Differs from a good Personal Event outcome. Whether or not you prefer to buy the insurance is a matter of personal taste. You may choose to buy insurance on some or all of your 54 choices, or none of the choices. The people next to you may be presented with different choices, insurance prices, and may have different preferences, so their responses should not matter to you. Please work silently, and make your choices by thinking carefully about each prospect. B-17Your payoff from this task is in cash and is in addition to the show-up payment that you receive just for being here, as well as any other earnings in other tasks. If you have a question, raise your hand and someone will come over and answer it. B-18B.1.4 Understand treatment Participants in the Understand treatment received the same instruction set as the Baseline treatment, provided in Appendix B.1.1. Immediately after the Baseline insurance instructions, participants were given the instructions for the index insurance beliefs, provided in Appendix B.3. Subjects then completed the index insurance beliefs task rst and then nished with the baseline insurance task. In all other treatments, the insurance task was conducted rst and then followed by the insurance belief task. B-19B.1.5 Sales Pitch treatment Choices Over Insurance Prospects In this task you will make choices about whether to insure against possible monetary loss. Insurance is an important way to protect yourself against monetary losses. In each choice you will start out with an initial amount of money and, in the event of a loss, the loss amount will be taken from this initial stake. In each choice you will have the option to buy insurance to protect you against the possible loss, although you are not required to buy the insurance. Some people believe that they can save enough money to replace their assets should anything happen to them. The problem is that, in most cases, the expenses incurred after an accident, the death of a loved one, or a disability, are beyond any savings or wealth that a person has accumulated. For this reason, insurance has become an important component of the nancial planning for most people. You will make 54 choices in this task. You will actually get the chance to play one of the choices you make, and you will be paid in cash according to the outcome of that choice. So you should think carefully about how much each insurance choice is worth to you. Each choice has two random events: a Personal Event and an Index Event . Each event has two possible outcomes: Good orBad. If the Personal Event outcome is Bad, then you will suffer a loss. Before you know the outcome of the Personal Event, you must decide whether to purchase insurance against this possible loss. However, the insurance only pays a claim if the Index Event outcome is Bad. If you do not purchase insurance , then only the outcome of the Personal Event will decide your earnings: Personal Event Your Earnings Bad Initial stake - Loss Good Initial stake If you do purchase insurance , it is important for you to understand that an insurance claim is not paid according to whether you actually suffer a loss. Instead, an B-20insurance claim is paid only according to the Index Event. Both events will decide your earnings: Personal Event Index Event Your Earnings Bad Bad Initial stake - Insurance cost - Loss + Insurance Coverage Bad Good Initial stake - Insurance cost - Loss Good Good Initial stake - Insurance cost - Loss Good Bad Initial stake - Insurance cost + Insurance Coverage So there are four possible outcomes if you purchase insurance. You might suffer a loss and receive an insurance claim payment. Or you might suffer a loss but not receive an insurance claim payment. You might not suffer a loss and also receive no insurance claim payment. Finally, you might receive an insurance claim payment even when you do not suffer a loss. Each event is determined by randomly drawing a colored chip from a bag. In general, each draw will involve two colors, and each decision you make will involve different amounts and mixtures of two colors. When making each decision, you will know the exact amounts and mixtures of colored chips associated with the decision. After you have decided whether or not to purchase insurance, the two events will be determined as follows. First, the Personal Event will be determined with blue and red chips. \u000fIf you draw a blue chip, then the Personal Event outcome is Good and you do not suffer a loss. \u000fIf you draw a redchip, then the Personal Event outcome is Badand you suffer a loss. Next, if you purchased insurance, the Index Event will be determined with green and black chips. \u000fIf you draw a green chip, then the Index Event outcome Matches the Personal Event outcome B-21\u000fIf you draw a black chip, then the Index event outcome Differs from the Personal Event outcome Here is an example of what your decision would look like on the computer screen. The display on your screen will be bigger and easier to read. In this example you start out with an initial stake of $75. If the outcome of the Personal Event is Badyou will lose $45, and if the outcome of the Personal Event is Good you will not lose any money. If you faced the choice in this example and chose to purchase insurance, you would pay $5.75 from your initial stake. You would pay this $5.75 before you drew any chips, so you would pay it regardless of the outcomes of your draws. You will be drawing colored chips from bags to determine the outcomes of both events. First, you will draw a chip to determine the Personal Event outcome. The image on the left shows that there is a 10% chance that the Personal Event outcome is Bad, and a 90% chance that the Personal Event outcome is Good . This means there will be 9 blue chips and 1 red chip in a bag, and the color of the chip you randomly draw from the bag represents the outcome of the Personal Event. If a blue chip is drawn, the Personal Event outcome is Good , and if a red chip is drawn the Personal Event outcome is Bad. B-22Next, you will draw a chip to determine the Index Event outcome. There is an 80% chance that the Index Event outcome Matches the Personal Event outcome and a 20% chance that the Index Event outcome Differs from the Personal Event outcome. This means there will be 8 green chips and 2 black chips in a bag. If a green chip is drawn the Index Event outcome Matches the Personal Event outcome, and if a black chip is drawn the Index Event outcome Differs from the Personal Event outcome. You will indicate your choice to purchase, or not purchase, the insurance by clicking on your preferred option on the computer screen. There are 54 decisions like this one to be made, each shown on a separate screen on the computer. Each decision might have different chances for the Personal Event outcome, the Index Event outcome, the initial stake, or the cost of insurance, so pay attention to each screen. After you have worked through all of the insurance decisions, please wait in your seat and an experimenter will come to you. You will then roll two 10-sided dice to determine which insurance decision will be played out. Since there are only 54 decisions, you will keep rolling the dice until a number between 1 and 54 comes up. There is an equal chance that any of your 54 choices will be selected, so you should approach each decision as if it is the one that you will actually play out to determine your payoff. Once the decision to play out is selected, you will draw chips from the Index bag and the Personal bag to determine the outcome. In summary: \u000fYou will decide whether or not to purchase insurance in each of the 54 scenarios. \u000fOne of your decisions will be randomly selected to be played for cash. \u000fYou will suffer the specied monetary loss only if the Personal Event outcome is Bad. \u000fIf you purchase insurance, it will pay a claim payment only if the Index Event outcome is Bad. This can happen in two ways: 1. Your Index draw Matches a bad Personal Event outcome; 2. Your Index draw Differs from a good Personal Event outcome. B-23Insurance is important because: 1.It protects individuals and their families Your family depends on nancial support to enjoy a decent standard of living, which is why insurance is particularly important once you start a family. It means that the people who matter most in your life will be protected from nancial hardship if the unexpected happens. 2.It reduces stress during difcult times None of us know what lies around the corner. Unforeseen tragedies, such as illness, injury, or permanent disability, even death, can leave you and your family facing tremendous emotional stress, and even grief. For most people, with insurance in place, their nancial stress will be reduced so that they can focus on recovery and rebuilding their lives. 3.To enjoy nancial security No matter what your nancial position is today, an unexpected event can see it all unravel very quickly. Buying insurance offers the certainty of a claim payment so that if there is an unforeseen event you can hopefully continue to move forward. 4.Peace of mind No amount of money can replace your health and wellbeing - or the role you play in your family. Because of insurance, most people can have peace of mind knowing that if anything happened to them, at least their family's nancial security is assisted by insurance. For each of the 54 choices you decide if you want to purchase insurance or not, knowing that insurance is important to protect yourself against the risk of monetary loss. The people next to you may be presented with different choices, insurance prices, and may have different preferences, so their responses should not matter to you. Please work silently, and make your choices by thinking carefully about each prospect. Your payoff from this task is in cash and is in addition to the show-up payment that you receive just for being here, as well as any other earnings in other tasks. If you have a question, raise your hand and someone will come over and answer it. B-24B.1.6 Peers treatment Participants in the peers treatment received the same instruction set as the Baseline treatment, provided in Appendix B.1.1. In addition, on each of the decision screens, subjects were provided with information on how other students have responded to the same decision. On each decision screen participants saw the added text: \" Over the last few weeks other students like yourself participated in this experiment. On average, X% chose 'Do Not Buy Insurance' and Y% chose 'Buy Insurance' for this question. \" Here X and Y updated with the actual percentages for each decision. These percentages were calculated from actual purchase decisions from 86 subjects that participated in the rst several sessions of the Baseline treatment. Figure B.1 displays where the additional text was inserted on the subject's screen. Figure B.1: Subject's Screen for Peer Treatment of the Insurance Purchase Task Note: B-25B.1.7 Self-Select treatment Selecting Additional Information One of the tasks today will involve making multiple decisions on whether or not you want to purchase insurance against possible monetary losses. Everyone will be provided with standard written instructions about the task that are also explained in a video. Before you begin that task, you may choose one of the options below. You should select the option that you prefer and sign your initials next to that option. The options are: 1. Receive additional instructions with detailed examples that are explained You will receive additional written and video task instructions explaining the insurance decisions in more detail. 2. Go through two practice decision rounds You will go through two practice decision rounds before beginning the actual task. You will not earn money with these two practice decisions. During the practice rounds the enumerator will explain the outcomes and what you would have earned given your choice. 3. Receive additional instructions written by an insurance advisor You will receive additional written and video instructions about the task in the same way that an insurance advisor would provide advice about insurance decisions. 4. Receive information about the choices of your peers For each of the decision screens, you will be provided with information on how other students have responded to the same decision. On each decision screen you will have the added text: \" Over the last few weeks other students like yourself participated in this experiment. On average, X% chose 'Do Not Buy Insurance' and Y% chose 'Buy Insurance' for this question. \" Here X and Y will update with the actual percentages for each decision. 5. Receive only the standard instructions B-26After everyone has selected which option they prefer, the session enumerator will advise next steps. Please wait quietly until then. B-27B.2 Instructions for the risk preference elicitation task Choices Over Risky Prospects This is a task where you will choose between prospects with varying prizes and chances of winning each prize. You will be presented with a series of pairs of prospects where you will choose one of them. For each pair of prospects, you should choose the prospect you prefer. You will actually get the chance to play one of these prospects for earnings, and you will be paid according to the outcome of that prospect, so you should think carefully about which prospect you prefer on each decision screen. Here is an example of what the computer display of such a pair of prospects will look like. B-28The outcome of the prospects will be determined by the draw of a random number between 1 and 100. Each number between, and including, 1 and 100 is equally likely to occur. In fact, you will be able to draw the number yourself using two 10-sided dice. You might be told your cash endowment for each decision at the top of the screen. In this example it is $35, so any earnings would be added to or subtracted from this endowment. The endowment may change from choice to choice, so be sure to pay attention to it. The endowment you are shown only applies for that choice. In this example the left prospect pays twenty-ve dollars ($25) if the number drawn is between 1 and 5, pays negative ve dollars ($-5) if the number is between 6 and 55, and pays negative thirty-ve dollars ($-35) if the number is between 56 and 100. The blue color in the pie chart corresponds to 5% of the area and illustrates the chances that the number drawn will be between 1 and 5 and your prize will be $25. The orange area in the pie chart corresponds to 50% of the area and illustrates the chances that the number drawn will be between 6 and 55 and your prize will be $-5. The green area in the pie chart corresponds to 45% of the area and illustrates the chances that the number drawn will be between 56 and 100. When you select the decision screen to be played out the computer will conrm the die rolls that correspond to the different prizes. Now look at the pie on the right. It pays twenty-ve dollars ($25) if the number drawn is between 1 and 15, negative ve dollars ($-5) if the number is between 16 and 25, and negative thirty-ve dollars ($-35) if the number is between 26 and 100. As with the prospect on the left, the pie slices represent the fraction of the possible numbers which yield each payoff. For example, the size of the $25 pie slice is 15% of the total pie. Even though the screen says that you might win a negative amount, this is actually a loss to be deducted from your endowment. So if you win $-5, your earnings would be $30 = $35$5. Each pair of prospects is shown on a separate screen on the computer. On each screen, you should indicate which prospect you prefer to play by clicking on one of the buttons beneath the prospects. Some decision screens could also have a pair of prospects in which one of the prospects will give you the chance for \"Double or Nothing\". For instance, the right B-29prospect in this screen image pays \"Double or Nothing\" if the Green area is selected, which happens if the number drawn is between 51 and 100. The right pie chart indicates that if the number is between 1 and 50 you get $10. However, if the number is between 51 and 100 we will flip a coin with you to determine if you get either double the amount or $0. In this example, if it comes up Heads you get $40, otherwise you get nothing. The prizes listed underneath each pie refer to the amounts before any \"Double or Nothing\" coin toss. After you have worked through all of the pairs of prospects, please wait quietly until further instructions. When it is time to play this task out for earnings, you will then roll two 10-sided dice until a number comes up to determine which pair of prospects will be played out. If there are 40 pairs we will roll the dice until a number between 1 and 40 comes B-30up, if there are 80 pairs we will roll until a number between 1 and 80 comes up, and so on. Since there is a chance that any of your choices could be played out for real, you should approach each pair of prospects as if it is the one that you will play out. Finally, you will roll the two ten-sided dice to determine the outcome of the prospect you chose, and if necessary we will then toss a coin to determine if you get \"Double or Nothing\". Here is an example: suppose your rst roll was 81. We would then pull up the 81st decision that you made and look at which prospect you chose - either the left one or the right one. Let's say that the 81st lottery was the same as the last example, and you chose the left prospect. If the random number from your second roll was 37, you would win $0; if it was 93, you would get $20. If you picked the prospect on the right and drew the number 37, you would get $10; if it was 93, we would have to toss a coin to determine if you get \"Double or Nothing\". If the coin comes up Heads then you would get $40. However, if it comes up Tails you would get nothing from your chosen prospect. It is also possible that you will be given a prospect in which there is a \"Double or Nothing\" option no matter what the outcome of the random number. This screen image illustrates this possibility. B-31In summary, your payoff is determined by ve things: \u000fby your endowment, if there is one, shown at the top of the screen; \u000fby which prospect you selected, the left or the right, for each of these pairs; \u000fby which prospect pair is chosen to be played out in the series of pairs using the two 10-sided dice; \u000fby the outcome of that prospect when you roll the two 10-sided dice; and \u000fby the outcome of a coin toss if the chosen prospect outcome is of the \"Double or Nothing\" type. B-32Which prospects you prefer is a matter of personal choice. The people next to you may be presented with different prospects, and may have different preferences, so their responses should not matter to you or influence your decisions. Please work silently, and make your choices by thinking carefully about each prospect. All payoffs are in cash, and are in addition to the $5 show-up fee that you receive just for being here, as well as any other earnings in other tasks from the session today. B-33B.3 Instructions to the index insurance beliefs Beliefs over Potential Outcomes, Monetary Endowments, and Insurance Purchases In this task you will be presented with possible outcomes of monetary endowments that are exposed to random events that can be protected through insurance or not. In this task you will be paid according to how accurate your beliefs are about the outcomes of these endowments, shocks, and insurance purchases. In this task you will not be asked to make any insurance purchases yourself. You will be presented with some questions and asked to place some bets on your beliefs about the answers to each question. You will be rewarded for your answer to one of these questions, so you should think carefully about your answer to each question. The question that is chosen for payment will be determined after you have made all decisions, and that process is explained below. Here is an example of the outcomes that will be presented to you on paper. The paper display will be bigger and easier to read. From the top left corner, note that this display refers to Figure X . We will ask you 10 questions about potential outcomes of initial stakes, the personal B-34event and the index event, and the effect of purchasing insurance or not. Examples of the questions we might ask you are: \u000fConsider Figure X. What is your outcome if you decided not to purchase insurance, experienced a good personal event, and the index outcome matches? There will be 10 categories What is your outcome if you decided to purchase insurance, experienced a bad personal event, and the index outcome differs? There will be 10 categories then ask you to place some bets on your beliefs about the answers to each question. B-35Here is an example from the rst question shown above. You will probably recall this task from a previous session. You have 10 sliders to adjust, shown at the bottom of the screen, and you have 100 tokens to allocate across the sliders. Each slider allows you to allocate tokens to reflect your belief about the answer to this question. You must allocate all 100 tokens, and in this example we start with 0 tokens allocated to each slider. As you allocate tokens, by adjusting sliders, the payoffs displayed on the screen will change. Your earnings are based on the payoffs that are displayed after you have allocated all 100 tokens. You can earn up to $10 in this task. Where you position each slider depends on your beliefs about the correct answer to the question. Note that the bars above each slider correspond to that particular slider. Each bar shows the amount of money you could earn if the true outcome is in the interval shown under the bar. To illustrate how you use these sliders, you might make these choices: B-36Your earnings depend on your reported beliefs and, of course, the true answer. For instance, suppose you allocated your tokens as just shown. If the true answer had been $13, you would have earned $2.78. If the true answer had been $33, you would have earned $8.78, and so on. If the true answer contains cents, we will round it to the nearest whole dollar. So if the true answer had been $13.26, we would have rounded it to $13. Suppose you had put all of your eggs in one basket, and allocated all 100 tokens to the interval corresponding to an outcome between $80 and $89. Then you would have faced the earnings outcomes shown here: Note the \"good news\" and \"bad news\" here. If the true answer had been $85, you would have earned $10. But if the true answer had been $15, or even $79, you would have earned nothing in this task. It is up to you to balance the strength of your personal beliefs with the possibility of them being wrong. There are three important points for you to keep in mind when making B-37your decisions: \u000fFirst, your belief about the correct answer to each question is a personal judgment that depends on the information you have about the topic of the question. \u000fSecond, depending on your choices and the correct answer you can earn up to $10. \u000fThird, your choices might also depend on your willingness to take risks or to gamble. The decisions you make are a matter of personal choice. Please work silently, and make your choices by thinking carefully about the questions you are presented with. When you are satised with your decisions, you should click on the Submit button and conrm your choices. When you are nished we will roll dice to determine which question will be played out. The experimenter will record your earnings according to the correct answer and the choices you made. All payoffs are in cash, and are in addition to the show-up fee that you receive just for being here, as well as any other earnings in the session today.

It has since been widely referenced by government regulations on the funding and conduct of behavioural research, as stressed by Glennerster (2017, \u00a73). The full text is available here: https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/read-th e-belmont-report/index.html . One of the three key principles of the report introduced the \"Do No Harm\" principle into broader behavioural research. It stated, in full: 2. Benecence. - Persons are treated in an ethical manner not only by respecting their decisions and protecting them from harm, but also by making efforts to secure their well-being. Such treatment falls under the principle of benecence. The term \"benecence\" is often understood to cover acts of kindness or charity that go beyond strict obligation. In this document, benecence is understood in a stronger sense, as an obligation. Two general rules have been formulated as complementary expressions of benecent actions in this sense: (1) do not harm and (2) maximize possible benets and minimize possible harms. The Hippocratic maxim \"do no harm\" has long been a fundamental principle of medical ethics. Claude Bernard extended it to the realm of research, saying that one should not injure one person regardless of the benets that might come to others. However, even avoiding harm requires learning what is harmful; and, in the process of obtaining this information, persons may be exposed to risk of harm. Further, the Hippocratic Oath requires physicians to benet their patients \"according to their best judgment.\" Learning what will in fact benet may require exposing persons to risk. The problem posed by these imperatives is to decide when it is justiable to seek certain benets despite the risks involved, and when the benets should be foregone because of the risks. The obligations of benecence affect both individual investigators and society at large, because they extend both to particular research projects and to the entire enterprise of research. In the case of particular projects, investigators and members of their institutions are obliged to give forethought to the maximization of benets and the reduction of risk that might occur from the research investigation. In the case of scientic research in general, members of the larger society are obliged to recognise the longer term benets and risks that may result from the improvement of knowledge and from the development of novel medical, psychotherapeutic, and social procedures. D-1The principle of benecence often occupies a well-dened justifying role in many areas of research involving human subjects. An example is found in research involving children. Effective ways of treating childhood diseases and fostering healthy development are benets that serve to justify research involving children - even when individual research subjects are not direct beneciaries. Research also makes it possible to avoid the harm that may result from the application of previously accepted routine practices that on closer investigation turn out to be dangerous. But the role of the principle of benecence is not always so unambiguous. A difcult ethical problem remains, for example, about research that presents more than minimal risk without immediate prospect of direct benet to the children involved. Some have argued that such research is inadmissible, while others have pointed out that this limit would rule out much research promising great benet to children in the future. Here again, as with all hard cases, the different claims covered by the principle of benecence may come into conflict and "}
