Of course, we must rule out other causes of a cough which need specific treatments and sometimes more workup, including [croup](https://pedemmorsels.com/croup/), [pertussis](https://pedemmorsels.com/pertussis-still-a-problem/), [aspirated foreign body](https://pedemmorsels.com/aspirated-foreign-body/), [pneumomediastinum](https://pedemmorsels.com/pneumomediastinum/), and [hemoptysis](https://pedemmorsels.com/hemoptysis-in-children/). But what should a parent do about that snotty, phlegm-laden, persistent, wet, chesty cough that kids hang on to for weeks? Many parents are concerned about what is contained in medicines and if over-the-counter medications are safe for their children. So, they turn to more \"natural\" remedies. But are these homeopathic cough preparations safer, or are they sinister? Can parents give them to kids with peace of mind, or a grain of salt (it's ok, salt is natural)? Does a spoonful of sugar help the medicine go down, or is the medicine just a spoonful of sugar? Let's explore homeopathic remedies for coughs and other pediatric complaints.

Homeopathic Remedies - Complications - Homeopathic products are not reviewed by the FDA for safety or effectiveness [Langevin 2021] - Some products do contain additional active ingredients that may have adverse side effects and cause drug interactions [Langevin 2021] - A 2012 systematic review mentions use of mercury or iron in homeopathic products - Liquid products may contain alcohol - A 2017 study found that homeopathic teething tablets had excessive belladonna, which may be toxic to babies [Abbasi 2017] - Systematic review of 38 reports of adverse events (pediatric and adult) from 5 electronic databases related to homeopathic remedies [Posadzki 2012] - 1159 adverse events - 4 fatalities - Rhus toxidendron was most frequent offender - A 44-month retrospective case-control study found 11 infants had [ALTE event](https://pedemmorsels.com/brue/)(9% of 115 total admitted for ALTE) after taking infantile colic preparation \"Gali-col\" [Aviner 2010] - Case report of an infant with weight loss and life-threatening metabolic hyperchloremic acidosis after xylitol [Wille 2010] - Case report of a 20-day old with status epilepticus after correctly dosed homeopathic colic medication containing belladonna [Glatstein - Can cause anticholinergic syndrome Homeopathic Remedies - Efficacy? - Australian National Health and Medical Research Council study in 2015 concluded no reliable evidence that homeopathy is effective to treat any health condition [Langevin 2021] - Inclusion criteria were rigorous - 57 systematic reviews that included 176 studies - Currently there is an updated review going on - NIH National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health states, \"Little evidence to support homeopathy as an effective treatment for any specific health condition\" [Langevin 2021] - A Cochrane review evaluated oscillococcinum to prevent and treat influenza like illness [Vickers 2000] - It called results \"promising\" that it probably reduces the duration of illness - But data still not strong enough to recommend it as a first line treatment - Data does not support the preventive effect - An RCT to compare homeopathic cough syrup to placebo in children found improved severity of composite cold symptoms according to parents, but no difference for any individual cold symptoms [Jacobs 2016] - A systematic review and metanalysis evaluated homeopathic preparations for preventing and treating URIs. [King 2021] - Did not find overall significant effectiveness. - All studies with low risk of bias showed no benefit. - No serious events were reports in these studies. - \"Happiest Baby\" author and blogger Dr. Karp endorses no evidence of efficacy of homeopathic colic remedies. [Karp 2022] Moral of the Morsel - First Do No Harm! While you may want to mitigate the snot, be aware that unregulated \"remedies\" offer more potential harm than benefit. - Know what they are taking. Asking to see what therapies a family is giving a child can be helpful in finding potential problems. - \"Over-the-counter\" does not equate to \"safe and effective.\" There are case reports and case-control studies of adverse events associated with administration of homeopathic preparations. - Call [1-800-222-1222](https://www.poison.org/contact-us)if you are uncertain. I cannot pronounce most of the ingredients listed above and have no idea what any of them actually are... but our Toxicology friends do! Ask them! - As always, remain vigilant!
