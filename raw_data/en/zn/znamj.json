The IPCAVD program is designed to enable a multi-disciplinary team of investigators to complete all steps necessary from down-selection of a vaccine candidate through CGMP manufacture/testing/product release and into clinical trials. A preclinical research application alone is not sufficient for this announcement. Awards will provide the critical resources to allow the advancement of vaccine concepts to clinical trials within the project period of the award. However, this funding opportunity will not provide funds for conducting the clinical studies; applicants are encouraged to collaborate with NIAID-supported clinical trial networks or to develop other relationships to support the clinical studies. Investigators are expected to begin clinical studies by the end of the award.

Application Review Information](#_Section_V._Application) [Section VII. Agency Contacts](#_Section_VII._Agency) [Section VIII. Other Information](#_Section_VIII._Other) The development of a safe and effective prophylactic vaccine against HIV/AIDS is one of the highest priorities of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). To date numerous experimental prophylactic HIV vaccines have been tested in phase I clinical trials, some of which were supported through NIAID's Integrated Preclinical/Clinical AIDS Vaccine Development Program (IPCAVD). Only three large-scale HIV vaccine efficacy trials have been completed to date. Two of these trials provided no evidence of efficacy, despite the fact that the vaccines induced an immune response in many trial participants. Recently, vaccines tested in a third trial, in Thailand (RV144), demonstrated modest efficacy at preventing HIV infection. These results, together with promising Non-Human Primate (NHP) vaccine efficacy studies, provide some evidence that a HIV vaccine may be within reach. Therefore, one of the goals of the NIAID is to support studies to confirm and extend the results of RV144. Another major goal of the NIAID is to continue the advancement of promising and innovative HIV vaccine platforms, unrelated to those used in RV144, for evaluation in early clinical trials. This IPCAVD FOA is designed to support both of these NIAID goals through the translation of innovative HIV vaccines of various types to the point of testing in human clinical trials. The objective of the IPCAVD program is to facilitate the translation of advanced, innovative, and promising vaccine platforms for the development of prophylactic HIV vaccines towards clinical research studies by providing the support necessary for achieving this goal. This Program will provide the critical resources necessary for achieving the goal of advancing vaccine concepts into clinical studies within the project period of the award. Specifically the IPCAVD award will provide support for: (1) all stages of vaccine platform research and development through facilitation of Non-Human Primate (NHP) proof-of concept studies and down-selection of the final lead candidate; (2) all product development stages including processes development, CGMP manufacturing and formulation; and (3) support for all IND-enabling studies and regulatory submissions. The IPCAVD will not support clinical trials. However, investigators are expected to begin clinical studies under other funding mechanisms no later than year five of this award. Applications consisting of preclinical research alone without a direct pathway to clinical testing will not be supported. The Research Programs funded under this FOA will be comprised of multiple components. These are: Administrative Core: An administrative core is a resource to the program, providing overall management, coordination, and supervision of the Program. This core administers the plan provided in the application to address the short- and long-term management of the program. Projects: Research and Product Manufacture Projects. Each application must propose a minimum of two projects and one of the projects must perform product manufacture as described below. The Program will support the funding of a multidisciplinary consortium of experts in animal models, molecular biology, immunology, and manufacturing. Specific activities in the application may include basic HIV vaccine research, preclinical testing and vaccine optimization, product development and CGMP manufacturing; and parallel NHP efficacy studies. Scientific Core(s): One or more optional Scientific Cores may be proposed as a resource to the multi-project grant and each of the proposed Cores must support at least two research projects. External Advisory Committee (EAC): An External Advisory Committee (EAC), consisting of independent experts in the areas of research that the project addresses, will be identified soon after award. The EAC, together with the PD/PI, will be responsible for determining progress of the PD/PI and other investigators during the annual site visit. Cooperative Agreement: A support mechanism used when there will be substantial Federal scientific or programmatic involvement. Substantial involvement means that, after award, NIH scientific or program staff will assist, guide, coordinate, or participate in project activities. New Renewal Resubmission Revision The [OER Glossary](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11116) and the SF424 (R&R) Application Guide provide details on these application types. Not Allowed: Only accepting applications that do not propose clinical trials. [ Need help determining whether you are doing a clinical trial?](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=82370) NIH intends to fund an estimate of 1-2 awards, corresponding to a total of $2.8 million, for fiscal year 2017. Application budgets are not limited but need to reflect the actual needs of the proposed project.

Only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. As part of the [NIH mission](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11149), all applications submitted to the NIH in support of biomedical and behavioral research are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system. Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the program to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the program proposed). Reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and provide an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items. Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following five scored review criteria, and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed). Reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. For example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field. Significance Does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? If the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? How will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field? Investigator(s) Are the Project Lead(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? If Early Stage Investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? If established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? If the project is collaborative or multi-Project Lead, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project? Innovation Does the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? Are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? Is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed? Approach Are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? Are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? If the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? If the project involves human subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of children, justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed? Environment Will the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? Are the institutional support, equipment and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? Will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements? Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the Core to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the core proposed). Reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below, as appropriate for the proposed Core, in the determination of scientific merit and provide an overall impact score for each Core, but will not give separate scores for these items. Administrative Core Scientific Cores (if applicable): As applicable for the program proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items. Milestones Are the proposed Milestones well-defined with quantifiable measures that are appropriate for assessing the success of the individual projects and overall Program application? Do the Milestones have specific criteria that will enable clear decisions about their attainment? Do the milestones support the goal of advancing vaccine concepts into clinical studies within the first five years of the award? Does the application describe a collaboration to support a clinical trial and is there a plan to conduct a clinical trial as described in the overall Research Plan? Is there a plan for clinical development that describes approaches and identifies a clinical trial partner to allow a clinical trial to begin no later than year five of the award? For research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials. For research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials. For additional information on review of the Human Subjects section, please refer to the [Guidelines for the Review of Human Subjects](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11175). When the proposed program involves human subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research, the committee will evaluate the proposed plans for the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion (or exclusion) of children to determine if it is justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed. For additional information on review of the Inclusion section, please refer to the [Guidelines for the Review of Inclusion in Clinical Research](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11174). The committee will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the following five points: 1) proposed use of the animals, and species, strains, ages, sex, and numbers to be used; 2) justifications for the use of animals and for the appropriateness of the species and numbers proposed; 3) adequacy of veterinary care; 4) procedures for limiting discomfort, distress, pain and injury to that which is unavoidable in the conduct of scientifically sound research including the use of analgesic, anesthetic, and tranquilizing drugs and/or comfortable restraining devices; and 5) methods of euthanasia and reason for selection if not consistent with the AVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia. For additional information on review of the Vertebrate Animals section, please refer to the [Worksheet for Review of the Vertebrate Animal Section](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11150). Reviewers will assess whether materials or procedures proposed are potentially hazardous to research personnel and/or the environment, and if needed, determine whether adequate protection is proposed. For Resubmissions, the committee will evaluate the application as now presented, taking into consideration the responses to comments from the previous scientific review group and changes made to the project. For Renewals, the committee will consider the progress made in the last funding period. For Revisions, the committee will consider the appropriateness of the proposed expansion of the scope of the project. If the Revision application relates to a specific line of investigation presented in the original application that was not recommended for approval by the committee, then the committee will consider whether the responses to comments from the previous scientific review group are adequate and whether substantial changes are clearly evident. As applicable for the program proposed, reviewers will consider each of the following items, but will not give scores for these items, and should not consider them in providing an overall impact score. Reviewers will assess whether the project presents special opportunities for furthering research programs through the use of unusual talent, resources, populations, or environmental conditions that exist in other countries and either are not readily available in the United States or augment existing U.S. resources. Reviewers will assess the information provided in this section of the application, including 1) the Select Agent(s) to be used in the proposed research, 2) the registration status of all entities where Select Agent(s) will be used, 3) the procedures that will be used to monitor possession use and transfer of Select Agent(s), and 4) plans for appropriate biosafety, biocontainment, and security of the Select Agent(s). Reviewers will comment on whether the following Resource Sharing Plans, or the rationale for not sharing the following types of resources, are reasonable: 1) [Data Sharing Plan](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11151); 2) [Sharing Model Organisms](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11152); and 3) Genomic Data Sharing Plan. Reviewers will consider whether the budget and the requested period of support are fully justified and reasonable in relation to the proposed research. Applications will be evaluated for scientific and technical merit by (an) appropriate Scientific Review Group(s), convened by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in accordance with [NIH peer review policy and procedures](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11154), using the stated [review criteria](#_1._Criteria). Assignment to a Scientific Review Group will be shown in the eRA Commons. As part of the scientific peer review, all applications: Applications will be assigned on the basis of established PHS referral guidelines to the appropriate NIH Institute or Center. Applications will compete for available funds with all other recommended applications. Following initial peer review, recommended applications will receive a second level of review by the appropriate national Advisory Council or Board. The following will be considered in making funding decisions: After the peer review of the application is completed, the PD/PI will be able to access his or her Summary Statement (written critique) via the [eRA Commons](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11123). Information regarding the disposition of applications is available in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11156). If the application is under consideration for funding, NIH will request \"just-in-time\" information from the applicant as described in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11157). A formal notification in the form of a Notice of Award (NoA) will be provided to the applicant organization for successful applications. The NoA signed by the grants management officer is the authorizing document and will be sent via email to the grantee's business official. Awardees must comply with any funding restrictions described in [Section IV.5. Funding Restrictions](#_5._Funding_Restrictions). Selection of an application for award is not an authorization to begin performance. Any costs incurred before receipt of the NoA are at the recipient's risk. These costs may be reimbursed only to the extent considered allowable pre-award costs. Any application awarded in response to this FOA will be subject to terms and conditions found on the [Award Conditions and Information for NIH Grants](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11158) website. This includes any recent legislation and policy applicable to awards that is highlighted on this website. All NIH grant and cooperative agreement awards include the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11120) as part of the NoA. For these terms of award, see the [NIH Grants Policy Statement Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart A: General](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11157) and [Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart B: Terms and Conditions for Specific Types of Grants, Grantees, and Activities](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11159). More information is provided at [Award Conditions and Information for NIH Grants](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11158). Cooperative Agreement Terms and Conditions of Award The following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) administrative guidelines, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) grant administration regulations at 45 CFR Parts 74 and 92 (Part 92 is applicable when State and local Governments are eligible to apply), and other HHS, PHS, and NIH grant administration policies. The administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an \"assistance\" mechanism, (rather than an \"acquisition\" mechanism), in which substantial NIH programmatic involvement with the awardees is anticipated during the performance of the activities. Under the cooperative agreement, the NIH purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the award recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. Consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the awardees for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the awardees and the NIH as defined below. The PD(s)/PI(s) will have the primary responsibility for: The Program Director(s)/Principal Investigator(s) will have the primary responsibility for: defining the research objectives, approaches, and details of the projects within the guidelines of the FOA and for performing the scientific activities. Annual Site Visit Review: Each awardee is required to coordinate an annual site visit. The site visit will provide a progress report and allow discussion of the future year plans. The site visit will be attended by the PD/PI, all co-Investigators, the External Advisory Committee (see below under Collaborative Responsibilities) members, the NIAID/DAIDS Project Scientist (see below) and NIAID Program Official (see below). An update and summary of the results generated on each project shall be presented by the PD/PI, Co- Investigators, and/or pertinent staff. These presentations should include summaries of all goals or milestones (refer to Other Submission Requirements section of the FOA) and a description of all problems encountered that may have an impact on the achievement of future goals and milestones. No later than the third year of the award the Program Officials with assistance from the NIAID Project Scientist will assess the accomplishment of the milestones as a measure of progress, the immunologic parameters of the vaccine candidate as an efficacious prophylactic HIV/AIDS vaccine, and whether the feasibility of manufacture as reported will allow, with high probability, initiation of a clinical study within the duration of the grant. The assessment will be based on the first two annual reports and any additional information that the PD/PI elects to submit. The PD(s)/PI(s) will be responsible for the timely submission to the NIAID of all abstracts, manuscripts and reviews (co)authored by members of the grant and supported in whole or in part under this Cooperative Agreement. The PD(s)/PI(s) are requested to provide manuscripts to the NIAID Program staff at the time of acceptance by a Journal so that an up-to-date summary of program accomplishments can be maintained. Publications and oral presentations of work conducted under this Cooperative Agreement are the responsibility of the PD(s)/PI(s) and appropriate Research Project and Core Leaders and will require appropriate acknowledgement of NIAID support. Awardees are expected to make new information and materials known to the research community in a timely manner through publications, web announcements, and report to the NIAID or other mechanisms consistent with laws, regulations, and NIH policies. Awardees will retain custody of and have primary rights to the data and software developed under these awards, subject to Government rights of access consistent with current DHHS, PHS, and NIH policies. NIH staff will have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below: The NIAID Project Scientist will provide technical assistance, advice, and coordination, and interact with the PD/PI on a regular basis to monitor study progress, regulatory compliance, adherence to clinical protocol, and quality assurance in order to ensure the production of high-quality, unbiased results. Monitoring may include: (1) regular communication with the PD/PI and staff, (2) periodic site visits for discussions with awardees' research teams, and (3) observation of field data collection and management techniques, quality control, fiscal review, and other relevant matters, as well as, (4) attendance at and participation in annual site visit meetings and/or External Advisory Committee meetings. The NIAID retains as an option, periodic review of progress. NIAID retains the right to independently monitor any clinical trial to ensure adherence to regulatory requirements. Such review and monitoring may be conducted through organizations contracted by and acting on behalf of NIAID. The NIAID Project Scientist will serve as a resource with respect to concurrent NIAID research and research support activities that may be relevant to the IPCAVD project, to facilitate compatibility, avoid unnecessary duplication, and potentially forge collaborations that may enhance the quality and breadth of the study. The NIAID Project Scientist will provide substantial assistance in design and coordination of preclinical research activities and clinical testing for awardees, including: (1) advice on the planning, management, and technical performance of the investigators, (2) access to and use of reagents and assays, and other resources available through NIAID contractors and grantees, including the independent non-clinical evaluation of the candidate vaccine, (3) technical advice and assistance for meeting Food and Drug Administration requirements for investigational drugs, (4) serving as the point of contact between the PD/PI and NIAID for initiating the NIAID review process of all clinical protocols (per the [ NIAID Clinical Terms and Conditions of Award)](http://www.niaid.nih.gov/ncn/pdf/clintermguidance.pdf), (5) providing guidance (e.g., submission of the required documentation etc.) for the NIAID clinical protocol review process, and (6) providing guidance and oversight throughout the clinical trial to ensure that the awardee is in full compliance with all human subjects research as delineated in the NIAID Clinical Terms and Conditions of Award. At the mid-point of the cooperative agreement (No later than the third year), the NIAID Project Scientist, will assess the accomplishment of the milestones as a measure of progress, the immunologic parameters of the vaccine candidate as an efficacious prophylactic HIV/AIDS vaccine, and whether the feasibility of manufacture as reported will allow, with high probability, initiation of a clinical study within the duration of the grant. The assessment will be based on the first two annual reports and any additional information that the PD/PI elects to submit. Based on comments from the peer reviewers, the NIAID Project Scientist may wish to revise the milestones included in the application through negotiation with the awardee. The revised milestones will be included in the Terms of Award. The decision to release funds for initiation of the manufacturing will be contingent upon the successful completion of a DAIDS-contracted GMP audit of the manufacturing facility and proof of concept. Additionally, an agency program official or IC program director will be responsible for the normal scientific and programmatic stewardship of the award and will be named in the award notice. Areas of Joint Responsibilities include: In addition to the interactions defined above, awardees and the NIAID Project Scientist shall share responsibility for the organization of an External Advisory Committee (EAC). The composition and membership of the EAC shall be determined by consensus between the PD/PI and the NIAID Project Scientist. The EAC will consist of a minimum of 3 members not directly affiliated with the research being conducted by the awardee. The EAC, together with the PD/PI, will be responsible for determining progress of the PD/PI/co-investigators during the annual site visit. Each EAC member will have one vote. Awardees will be required to accept and implement policies approved by the External Advisory Committee. The NIAID Project Scientists and Program Officials will participate as non-voting members of the EAC. Intellectual Property: The successful development of tools for the evaluation of a prophylactic HIV/AIDS vaccine will require substantial investment and support of private sector industries and may also involve collaborations with multiple organizations, including academic and/or non-profit research institutions. It is the intent of this initiative to support the formation of the appropriate public-private partnerships that are essential to meet this critical public health need. NIAID recognizes that intellectual property rights are likely to play an important role in achieving the goals of this program. To this end, all awardees understand and acknowledge the following: The awardee is solely responsible for the timely acquisition of all appropriate proprietary rights, including intellectual property rights, and all materials needed for applicant to perform the project; Before, during, and subsequent to the award, the U.S. Government is not required to obtain for awardee any proprietary rights, including intellectual property rights, or any materials needed by awardee to perform the project; Awardee is required to report to the U.S. Government all inventions made in the performance of the project, as specified at 35 U.S.C. Sect. 202 (Bayh-Dole Act). In addition, awardees are expected to exercise their Bayh-Dole rights in a manner that does not conflict with the goal of this award or the intent of the Bayh-Dole Act to promote the utilization, commercialization and availability of U.S. Government-funded inventions for public benefit. Dispute Resolution: Any disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between award recipients and the NIH may be brought to Dispute Resolution. A Dispute Resolution Panel composed of three members will be convened. It will have three members: a designee of the EAC, one NIH designee, and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area that is chosen by the other two; in the case of individual disagreement, the first member may be chosen by the individual awardee. This dispute resolution procedure does not alter the awardee's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with PHS regulation 42 CFR Part 50, Subpart D and DHHS regulation 45 CFR Part 16. When multiple years are involved, awardees will be required to submit the [Research Performance Progress Report (RPPR)](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/rppr/index.htm) annually and financial statements as required in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement.](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11161) [A final progress report, invention statement, and the expenditure data portion of the Federal Financial Report are required for closeout of an award, as described in the ] [NIH Grants Policy Statement](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11161). The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (Transparency Act), includes a requirement for awardees of Federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under Federal assistance awards issued in FY2011 or later. All awardees of applicable NIH grants and cooperative agreements are required to report to the Federal Subaward Reporting System (FSRS) available at [www.fsrs.gov](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11170) on all subawards over $25,000.
