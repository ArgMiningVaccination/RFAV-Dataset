In children, our [HealthNuts study](/research/projects/healthnuts) has shown up to 10 per cent of 12-month-olds in Australia have a clinically confirmed food allergy. Hospital data also show a rapid increase in food allergy and anaphylaxis, with admissions in Australia increasing by 350 per cent over the past two decades. To help address this public health crisis, our research is working to address the rising allergy epidemic in Australia and provide relief and hope to children who are living with food allergy and their families. This work informs clinical guidelines and public health policy for the clinical care and management of childhood food allergy. Our vision is to help prevent the current 10 per cent of infants developing food allergy by generating, translating and evaluating new knowledge about novel strategies to prevent - and early targeted interventions to treat - young children with food allergy. Specifically, our research looks at three levels of prevention: - Primary: prevention of the development of food allergy - Secondary: prevention of adverse events in food allergic children - Tertiary: aiding the development of tolerance The Population Allergy Group is one of the leading food allergy research centres in Australia. Our group secured a highly prestigious Centre for Research Excellence grant from the National Health and Medical Research Council in 2012, 2017 and 2022. This grant funds the Centre for Food & Allergy Research. In August 2022, the [National Allergy Centre of Excellence](https://www.nace.org.au/) (NACE), hosted at the Murdoch Children's, launched following a four-year Federal Government investment of $10.2 million. As the country's peak allergy research body, the NACE will develop infrastructure to enable cutting-edge research into allergy prevention, intervention and management. NACE Director and Murdoch Children's Population Allergy Group Leader, A/Prof Kirsten Perrett, and the Executive Committee will lead four broad pillars to underpin a national plan of action addressing drug, food, insect and respiratory allergic disease: - An Allergy Research Hub will oversee a Clinical Trials Network and an Allergy Studies Directory to improve access to treatments. - A Repository and Discovery Hub will harness the power of big data analysis to drive individualised healthcare. - An Evidence and Translation Hub will establish living systematic reviews to seamlessly connect evidence and practice. - A Training and Innovation Hub will support and mentor the next generation of allergy experts.

This infant allergy development prevention research study is running across multiple research sites in Australia, including the Murdoch Children's, and across the United States. The study is recruiting pregnant mothers or mothers who have just given birth within the last seven days. The biological mother, biological father or biological sibling of the baby must have a history of asthma, eczema, a food allergy, or allergic rhinitis. Aravax AVX-201 Aravax AVX-201 is a Phase 2 study in adolescents and children with peanut allergy. The trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PVX108 - a novel immunotherapy designed to precisely retrain the immune system to tolerate peanut allergens and reduce the risk of severe allergic reactions. PVX108 has been studied in AVX-001 - a First in Human Phase 1 randomised double-blind clinical trial in adults. AVX-001-EXT was a follow-up study that demonstrated PVX108 was safe and well tolerated in participants with peanut allergy, including those with asthma. In 2023, Murdoch Children's Research Institute - along with sites in South Australia, New South Wales and Western Australia - began recruiting four- to 17-year-olds for the AVX-201 study. EarlyNuts Australia has among the highest reported rates of childhood food allergy, a potentially life-threatening condition. New evidence shows that earlier introduction of allergenic foods such as peanut can reduce the risk of food allergy. This is reflected in new infant feeding guidelines. This study will measure current infant feeding practices and whether earlier allergen consumption has reduced the rate of food allergy among the population. Results will inform strategies to improve the uptake and efficacy of timely allergen introduction for food allergy prevention. EPITOPE and EPOPEX trials The EPITOPE study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a novel desensitisation method, called EPicutaneous ImmunoTherapy (EPIT) with the Viaskin\u00ae Peanut patch in young children aged between one to three years, diagnosed with peanut allergy. In this double-blind placebo-controlled trial, participants were randomised to receive treatment or a placebo, to determine if one year of daily patch wear could facilitate desensitisation of peanut allergy. All children who complete one year of EPITOPE participation enrol in the open-label follow-on study, EPOPEX, where they continue to wear the Viaskin\u00ae Peanut patch daily for up to three years. HealthNuts Study This is the world's first comprehensive population-based study of food allergy with objective measurement of true food allergy. It will enable us to better understand the natural history of allergic disorders, including food allergy, asthma, eczema, and hay fever, and the risk factors for developing these conditions in childhood. HealthNuts recruited 5300 children at 12 months of age, who were followed up at ages four, six, and 10. The 15-year-old follow-up began in 2022 and aims to understand why some children outgrow their food allergies while, for others, it persists into adolescence. We are also investigating the impact of food allergy on children's future health. LMNOP Pilot Study (Low-dose Multi-nut Oral Immunotherapy trial in Pre-schoolers) The LMNOP pilot study is testing a new treatment approach for food allergy. The study is looking at whether over 18 months, children undergoing low-dose, multi-nut oral immunotherapy (OIT) treatment can safely achieve sustained unresponsiveness (the participant can pass an oral food challenge after having paused treatment for several weeks) at a higher rate than children under standard care (avoidance of allergic nuts) develop natural tolerance. OIT involves parents giving their children small amounts of two nuts they are allergic to daily at home over 18 months. MIST Each year over 40,000 people have their tonsils out - it is the most common elective childhood operation in Australia\u2014but this number could be reduced thanks to a simple nasal spray. This study is working to determine if a nasal spray called mometasone can moderate snoring, improve sleep and decrease the need for surgery. This medicine is already commonly used in children with hay fever and is available over the counter. Children aged three to 12 were invited to take part as snoring affects up to 10 percent of children. MIST+ MIST+ builds on the recently completed MIST trial and is looking at whether a nasal spray can effectively treat snoring and sleep disturbance in children aged 3-12 years. Snoring and breathing problems during sleep are very common and affect a large number of children. Currently, the most common treatment is surgery. However, surgery is invasive, costly, and has an increasingly long wait time. MIST+ aims to use medical therapy to reduce the need for surgery and improve the quality of life of many children. The children taking part in MIST+ will use a saline nasal spray for six weeks and those who continue to experience snoring and sleep problems will then be treated with either a saline spray or with a common steroid spray called mometasone for a further 6 weeks. Novartis Peanut The Novartis Study (CQGE031) is a multi-centre study investigating the effectiveness of the medication Ligelizumab in children and adolescents with severe peanut allergy. Children aged between six- and 17 years can take part in the 52-week study, which will determine whether Ligelizumab can decrease sensitivity to peanuts. The medication will be given as an injection to participants each month with regular appointments held at MCRI to measure its effectiveness. OPTIMUM Study This is a multi-centre study investigating whether one dose of 'whole cell' pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine given at two months of age instead of the current 'acellular' pertussis vaccine can help protect young children against allergic outcomes. Vaccines work by training the immune system to recognise what certain germs look like. Researchers believe some vaccines might also help to prevent allergy by making the immune system less likely to react to things that are not harmful, like food. Babies aged between six- and 12 weeks are invited to take part. The research involves three study visits over 18 months. The PrEggNut Study Current evidence suggests the ideal time to prevent food allergy may be during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but little is known about the effect of what mothers eat during pregnancy and breastfeeding on the risk of food allergies in their babies. This research is testing whether the amount of eggs and peanuts a mother eats during pregnancy and breastfeeding has an influence on her baby's food allergy development. Study results will develop national recommendations about how much egg and peanut to eat during pregnancy and breastfeeding to reduce egg and peanut allergies in babies. SchoolNuts The SchoolNuts study aimed to identify the lifestyle factors which are common to children suffering from food allergy; assess the impact of food allergy on the risk of asthma and severity, and identify factors that are likely to modify food allergy and asthma. The study was completed in 2016 and found adolescents with food allergy are frequently exposed to food allergens. Those with asthma and more than two food allergies were at the greatest risk for adverse food reactions. Those with nut allergies were most at risk of severe reactions. SchoolNuts recruited around 10,000 students and their parents from Melbourne schools to answer a questionnaire on lifestyle factors like diet and allergy history. TreEat Allergies to tree nuts, such as almond, cashew, hazelnut, and walnut can be severe, often lifelong, and seem to increase. Children with peanut allergy are at higher risk for developing tree nut allergies. We know that eating nut and egg in the first year of life can be protective for the development of peanut and egg allergies, however, it is not known if this applies to other allergens, including tree nuts. This study aims to determine the safest and most effective way to introduce tree nuts into the diet of infants with peanut allergy to prevent the development of further nut allergies. VITALITY Trial The cause of Australia's rise in food allergy in recent years is unknown. The number of people experiencing allergic reactions has also significantly increased. The aim of this study is to see the relationship between food allergy, vitamin D, and immune function in infants. Infants aged between six-to12-weeks who are predominantly breastfed and not taking Vitamin D are taking part. Each infant is given a vitamin drop each day and attends a free allergy test at 12 months of age. Over 2,700 infants have been enrolled in the study. We have now also begun our 6-year follow-up. We are inviting VITALITY participants back into the clinic when they turn six (6) years old for another free allergy test, as well as lung function, dental, hearing, and cardiometabolic assessments.
