If something comes up when you have an appointment, please give us a call or shoot us a text to inform us of your inability to make your appointment. It is our desire to be fair and effective for all of our clients as well as to be considerate to our therapist/teacher's time we have adopted the following policies: 24-hour cancellation In most cases we require a 24-hour cancellation for any appointments, classes and workshops. This allows for the appointment or seat in a class/workshop to be offered to other clients. In the event that you cancel less than 24 hours you will be charged $25 for any services (massage/energy work/craniosacral therapy) or the price of the class/workshop you signed up for upon your next visit. No show appointments/classes/workshops Anyone who either forgets or consciously chooses to not show for their appointment for whatever reason will be considered a \"no-show\". They will be charged for their \"missed\" appointment ($25 or class/workshop fee), and future service will be denied until payment is made. After three (3) less than 24-hour cancellations or no-show appointments you will no longer be able to book appointments, with any of Sacred Transcendence's team. In the event that you have a package with us, we will mail you a check for the remainder of the amount on your account with an itemized receipt of services rendered as well as the deduction ($25) from your missed appointments. Minors (Birth - 18 years old) We love having children join us for services, classes and workshops! We are requiring a parent or legal guardian to attend the child's first service with us. Legal guardian must fill out and sign any and all paperwork for their child. We also have a release form for all legal guardians to sign in addition to intake forms giving Sacred Transcendence's Team the okay to work with their child even if the minor is of driving age and come in on their own.
