(Langan) prepared th is Interim Remedial Meas ures Work Plan (IRMWP) on behalf of Gowanus President Owner LLC (the Volunteer) for the property at 514 Union Street, Brooklyn, New York (the site) . The Volunteer was accepted into the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) Brownfield Cleanup Program (BCP) to investigate and remediate the site pursuant to the NYSDEC Brownfield Cleanup Agreement (BCA) executed on 21 October 2021 . The site was assigned BCP Site No. C224318 . This IRMWP proposes contain ment and stabiliz ation of a chlorinated volatile organic compound (CVOC) groundwater plume by prevent ing the migration of the plume and reduc ing CVOC concentrations, to the extent feasible . Plume containmen t and stabilization , and dissolved CVOC concentration reduction will be achieved by in -situ application of remediation products designed to capture and enhance biodegradation of CVOCs. The IRMWP was prepared in accordance with the process and requirements of the BCP and the May 2010 Division of Environmental Remediation (DER) Technical Guidance for Site Investi gation and Remediation (DER -10). 1.1 Site Description The approximately 17,000 -square -foot site, identified as Brooklyn Borough Tax Block 440, Lot 12, is located in an urban area in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, and consists of an one-story brick building occupied by the Royal Palms Shuffleboard Club. A site location map is included as Figure 1 . The site is located on the block bound by Union Street to the north, 3rd Street to the east, President Street to the south, and Nevins Street to the west. The south -adjoining parcel, 473 President Street, is in the NYSDEC BCP (BCP Site No. C224220). The east - and west -adjoining parcels, identified as President Street Portfolio, are also in the NYSDEC BCP (BCP Site No. C224309). The Gowanus Canal (a National Priorities List [NPL] site) is located about 350 feet west of the site. Prior to occupancy by the Shuffleboard Club, the site opera ted as a manufa cturing and storage warehouse. In 2013 , the warehouse was retrofitted with an elevated wooden platform to support a new finished floor over the majority of the footprint . The building improvements include shuffleboard courts, an office, ba rs, restrooms, storage areas, and a one -car pa rking garage. An about 2 - to 23 -inch-thick void space exists between the finished floor platform and the concrete building foundation slab. A site plan is included as Figure 2 . The July 2022 NYSDEC -approved IRMWP was implemented in September 2022 to install a soil vapor intrusion (SVI) mitigation system. The system has been operating since 22 September Interim Remedial Measures Work Plan No. 2 514 Union Street Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361307 2 February 2023 Page 2 of 23 2022. Implementation of the July 2022 IRMWP will be documented in a forthcoming Construction Completion Report (CCR). A remedial investigation (RI) was conducted between 31 August and 12 September in accordance with the NYSDEC -approved 28 July 2022 Remedial Investigation Work Plan (RIWP). RI results will be documented in a forthcoming Remedial Investigation Report (RIR). 1.2 Proposed Development As of the date o f this IRMWP, t here are no proposed development plans. The site will continue to operate as a shuffle board club for the foreseeable future. 1.3 Physical Conditions 1.3.1 Site and Regional Topography According to the 23 July 2021 Architectural Survey by New York City Land Surveyors, PC , the Union Street sidewalk elevations (el) fronting the site range from about el 141 to el 11, sloping down from east to west . The topography of the surrounding area is generally flat, but gradually slopes down from east t o west towards the Gowanus Canal . 1.3.2 Site and Regional Geology According to the RI conducted by Langan from 31 August to 12 September 2022 , the site is underlain by fill generally characterized as dark gray to brown fine sand with varying amounts of gravel, silt, cobbles , concrete , coal fragments , coal ash, slag, glass and organic fibers . Fill was observed below the concrete slab to depths ranging between 2 and 14 feet below grade surface (bgs). Fine-grain ed sand with varying amounts of silt and gra vel was observed below the fill layer to the boring termination depths (10 to 27 feet bgs). United States Geological Survey (USGS) \"Bedrock and Engineering Geologic Maps of New York County and Parts of Kings and Queens Counties, New York, and Parts of Be rgen and Hudson Counties, New Jersey\" indicate that bedrock underlying the site is part of the Hartland Formation. The Hartland Formation is comprised of mica schist and quartz -feldspar granulite, with localized intrusions of granite and pegmatite. A geo technical investigation report, dated October 2021 and prepared by Pillori Associates, P.A. (Pillori) for the 473 President and President Street Portfolio sites , documents 18 exploratory geotechnical borings completed between December 2019 and September 20 21. According to the geotechnical boring logs, the stratigraphy generally consists of fill underlain by brown sand with trace amounts of silt and gravel. Cobbles and boulders were encountered between 40 and 90 feet bgs. The borings were advanced to a ma ximum depth of about 102 feet bgs. Bedrock was not encountered in any exploratory borings. 1 Elevations herein are in feet and referenced to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88). Interim Remedial Measures Work Plan No. 2 514 Union Street Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361307 2 February 2023 Page 3 of 23 1.3.3 Site and Regional Hydrogeolog y Groundwater flow is typically topographically influenced, as shallow groundwater tends to originate in areas of topographic highs and flows toward areas of topographic lows, such as rivers, stream valleys, ponds, and wetlands. A broader, interconnected hydrogeological network often governs groundwater flow at depth or in the bedrock aquifer. Groundwater depth and flow directi on are also subject to hydrogeological and anthropogenic variables such as precipitation, evaporation, extent of vegetation cover, and coverage by impervious surfaces. Other factors influencing groundwater include depth to bedrock, the presence of histori c fill material, and variability in local geology and groundwater sources or sinks. Site groundwater ranged from approximately el 2.29 to el 2.74 (corresponding to approximately 9.5 and 10.5 feet bgs) during the September 2022 RI . Groundwater elevations r anged from about el 2.1 to el 3.1 during remedial investigations performed at 473 President Street (BCP Site No. 224220) and President Street Portfolio (BCP Site No. C224309) between March 2017 and November 2019. Groundwater flow direction is west toward the Gowanus Canal. Groundwater elevation contour s are shown on Figure 3. 1.4 Site History Prior to the current occupant, the site was used by various manufacturing and industrial facilities since as early as 1886. Current and historic al site uses include the following: The Royal Palms Shuffleboard Club (2013 - present) Manufacturing and Storage (1993 - 2007) Dolin Metal Manufacturing Co. (1969 - 1992) Coca -Cola Bottling Co. of NY (1938 - 1950) Albro J. Newton Co. Trim and Planing Mill (1904 - 1915) Kenyon and Newton Sash and Door Factory (1886) 1.5 Previous Environmental Reports 24 July 2014 Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, prepared by Carlin, Simpson & Associates Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA), dated July 24, 2014, prepared by Carlin, Simpson & Associates (CSA) The Phase I ESA was prepared for a larger area, including the site. Findings of the Phase I ESA as they relate to the site are as follows: Interim Remedial Measures Work Plan No. 2 514 Union Street Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361307 2 February 2023 Page 4 of 23 The property has a history of industrial uses including Dolin Metal Manufacturing Co., Coca -Cola Bottling Co. of NY, and Albro J. Newton Co. Trim and Planing Mill, with limited information regarding waste management and housekeeping practices, which may ha ve contributed to contamination at the site. Contaminated groundwater from nearby off -site sources, including the Gowanus Canal (a National Priorities List [NPL] site) and 318 Nevins Street (petroleum -contaminated groundwater attributed to on -site petrole um bulk storage), may have impacted groundwater at the site. 473 President Street, an adjacent property to the south currently enrolled in the NYSDEC BCP (BCP Site No. C224220), is associated with open NYSDEC Spill No. 9412605 for a petroleum release duri ng a tank test failure that may have impacted groundwater at the site. 30 April 2021 Limited Subsurface Investigation Report, prepared by Langan The limited subsurface investigation was implemented between 19 and 21 March 2021 to assess the potential for soil vapor intrusion into the existing site building and investigation environmental subsurface conditions at the site . The investigation included collection of soil, groundwater, sub-slab vapor, indoor air and ambient air samples. Laboratory analytical results indicative of CVOC impacts to soil and groundwater include: CVOC Impacts to Soil: One CVOC, trichloroethene (TCE), was detected in two soil samples from a soil boring in the southeastern part of the site. TCE was detected in the sample collected from 1 to 3 feet bg s at 12 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) ( above the Unrestricted Cleanup Objective [SCO2] of 0.47 mg/kg) , and in a sample collected from 7 to 9 feet bgs at 140 mg/kg ( above the Restricted Use Restricted Residential [RURR ] SCO of 21 mg/kg) . CVOC Impacts to Groundwater: At least one CVOC was detected at concentrations above the corresponding NYSDEC Standards and Guidance Value s (SGV3) in all five groundwater samples collected during the March 2021 limited subsurface investigation . The highest CVOC concentrations were detected in the sample collected from monitoring well MW02 in the southwestern part of the site. TCE was detected at concentrations above the NYSDEC SGVs in 3 of 4 monitoring wells, ranging from 14 micrograms per liter ( \u00b5g/L) at 2 SCOs promulgated in the NYSDEC Title 6 of the Official Compilation of New York Codes, Rules, and Regulations (NYCRR) Part 375. 3 NYSDEC SGVs promulgated in the NYSDEC 6 NYCRR Part 703.5 and the NYSDEC Technical and Operational Guidance Series (TOGS) 1.1.1 Ambient Water Quality Standards and Guidance Values for Class GA Water . Interim Remedial Measures Work Plan No. 2 514 Union Street Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361307 2 February 2023 Page 5 of 23 monitoring well MW03, located southern part of the site , to 140 \u00b5g/L at monitoring well MW02 , located in the southwestern part of the site . Preliminary Remedial Investigation Data , prepared by Langan The remedial investig ation was implemented between 31 August and 12 September 2022 to investigate and characterize the nature and extent of the contamination at and/or emanating from the site; and inform the in -situ remedial alternative. The investigation includ ed collection of soil and groundwater samples. Findings and conclusions as they relate to CVOC contamination in soil and groundwater are as follows : 1. Stratigraphy : A fill layer was encountered from below the building slab to depths ranging from about 2 feet bgs in the so utheastern portion of the site to about 8 to 13 feet bgs throughout the rest of the site. The fill generally consists of dark gray to brown fine sand with varying amounts of gravel, silt, red cobbles, concrete, coal fragments, coal ash, slag, glass and organic fibers . The fill layer is underlain mainly by brown to tan , fine sand with varying amounts of silt and gravel. In some borings , the fill was underlain by a 2.5 - to 5-foot-thick brown to tan silt layer. Bedrock was not encountered in any of the soil borings. 2. Hydrogeology : Groundwater was encountered from about el 2.29 to el 2.74 in shallow monitoring wells (screened from 5 to 17 feet bgs) , corresponding to approximately 9.5 and 10.5 feet, respectively, below grade . The inferred gr oundwater flow direction is to the west toward the Gowanus Canal. 3. CVOC -Impacts : TCE was detected in four shallow soil samples (0 to 2 feet bgs) above the UU SCOs. The following s ix CVOCs were detected in at concentrations above NYSDEC SGVs in of cis -1,2-DCE in groundwater samples collected from monitoring wells MW09D and MW11D were detected at 3,000 \u00b5g/L and 2,800 \u00b5g/L; and concentrations of TCE were detected at 8,300 \u00b5g/L and 6,900 \u00b5g/L, respectively - about three orders of magn itude above the NYSDEC SGVs. The presence of CVOCs in soil and groundwater is Interim Remedial Measures Work Plan No. 2 514 Union Street Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361307 2 February 2023 Page 6 of 23 attributed to historical releases associated with the former uses of the site and 473 President Street for metals manufacturing, a planing mill, and/or bottling. 1.6 Soil Cont aminant Conditions Three VOCs - acetone, total xylenes, and TCE - were detected in soil samples at concentrations above UU SCOs collected during the September 2022 RI. Soil sample analytical results from the September 2022 RI and May 2021 Limited Subsurfa ce Investigation are shown on Figure 4 . Concentrations of one CVOC (TCE) was detected above the UU SCO in shallow soil samples (0-2 feet bgs) TCE was detected concentrations above the UU SCO ranging from 3.7 mg/kg in SB16_0 -2, located in the south -central part of the site, to 120 mg/kg in SB15_0 -2, located in the southeastern part of the site. TCE in soil was delineated vertically and horizontally by deeper samples and surrounding borings. TCE was not detected at concentrations above the UU SCO below 2 feet bgs in soil samples collected during the September 2022 RI . TCE was detected at concentrations above the UU SCO in unsaturated soil sample s collected during the March 2021 limited subsurf ace investigation from 1 to 3 feet bgs and from 7 to 9 feet bgs from the southeast ern part of the site. Non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) was not identified during previous investigations. The unsaturated TCE soil impacts are not a continuous source of grou ndwater impacts given the lack of NAPL and the presence of an impervious site cover which prevents water infiltration through the unsaturated soil. The unsaturated TCE soil impacts are a source of soil vapor contamination and soil vapor intrusion (SVI) is being mitigated by the operation of a SVI mitigation system. 1.7 Groundwater Contaminant Conditions CVOCs and petroleum -related VOCs were detected in groundwater samples above the NYSDEC SGVs collected during the September 2022 RI. Groundwater sample analytical results from the September 2022 RI are shown on Figure 5 . Groundwater TCE concentrations for all groundwater samples collected to date at the site and the two adjoining BCP sites (473 President Street/BCP Site No. C224220 and President Street P ortfolio/BCP Site No. C224309) are shown on Figure detected at concentrations above NYSDEC SGVs in nine groundwater samples . CVOC concentrations in groundwater were high er in wells scre ened at \"intermediate\" intervals (between 15 and 27 feet bgs), and were highest in monitoring wells MW09D and MW11D, located along the southern and western perimeters of the site , respectively . Concentrations of cis -1,2-DCE in the groundwa ter samples collected from monitoring wells MW09D and MW11D were 3 ,000 \u00b5g/L and 2,8 00 \u00b5g/L, respectively ; and concentrations of TCE were 8,300 \u00b5g/L and 6, 900 \u00b5g/L, respectively - more than three orders of magnitude above the NYSDEC SGVs. CVOC concentrations were detected Interim Remedial Measures Work Plan No. 2 514 Union Street Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361307 2 February 2023 Page 7 of 23 above the NYSDEC SGVs at monitoring wells screened as deep as 27 feet bgs; however, CVOCs were not detected above the NYSDEC SGVs in monitoring wells screened below 27 feet bgs . Interim Remedial Measures Work Plan No. 2 514 Union Street Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361307 2 February 2023 Page 8 of 23 2.0 SUMMARY OF INTERIM R EMEDIAL MEASURES This IRM WP includes the following tasks to support in-situ groundwater remediation : 1. Development and implementation of a site-specific Construction Health and Safety Plan (CHASP) for the protection of on -site workers , tenants, and the communit y during remedia tion; 2. Collection of baseline groundwater samples from existing monitoring wells MW07 D, MW08 D, MW11D ,MW13D and HRP -MW-1 (off -site well installed by others) , and new monitoring wells MW14S and MW15D ; 3. Application of PlumeStop \u00ae Liquid Activated Carbon (PlumeStop \u00ae), Microemulsion (3DME \u00ae)4 via injections at varying targeted doses designed to capture and enhance biode gradation of CVOCs . The remedial products will be mixed together and diluted with water on -site and applied in batches with varying dosages. The in -situ groundwater remedy will contain and stabilize the CVOC groundwater plume by prevent ing the migration of the plume and reduc ing CVOC concentrations, to the extent feasible ; 4. To demonstrate effectiveness, c ollecti on of post-remediation groundwater samples from existing MW11D ,MW13D and HRP -MW-1 (off -site by others) and new wells MW14S and MW15D ; and 5. Preparation of a Construction Completion Report (CCR) to document implementation of this IRMWP . These tasks are further des cribed in the ensuing sections. 2.1 Objectives and Rationale Based on the results of previous subsurface investigations and the RI, the following Remedial Action Objectives (RAO) have been Regenesis \u00ae of San Clemente, California. Interim Remedial Measures Work Plan No. 2 514 Union Street Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361307 2 February 2023 Page 9 of 23 RAOs RAOs for Public Health Protection RAOs for Environmental Protection Groundwater Preve nt ingestion of groundwater with contaminant levels exceeding drinking water standards. Prevent contact with, or inhalation of volatiles, from contaminated groundwater Restore ground water aquifer to pre-disposal/pre -release conditions, to the extent practicable. Plume containment/stabilization to prevent, to the extent feasible, the down -gradient migration of the groundwater plume Developed in accordance with DER -10 4.1(d)2.ii and 4.1(d)2.iii , t his IRMWP proposes containment and stabilization of a CVOC groundwater plume and reduction of CVOC concentrations , to the extent feasible. The objective s of this IRMWP include the following: 1. Containment and stabil ization of a CVOC groundwater plume by prevent ing the migration of the plume through a permeable reactive barrier ; and 2. Reduction of dissolved CVOC concentrations in groundwater through sorption to liquid activated carbon followed by anaerobic biodegra dation via in -situ chemical reduction . CVOCs -related VOCs were detected in groundwater above NYSDEC SGVs in multiple samples . A permeable reactive barrier, four \u00ae), will be implemented along the perimeter of the site via injection points. The in-situ groundwater treatment plan is detailed in Section 2.4. Following IRM implementation , the planned construction and remediation at the adjoining development site will preclude access to the proposed in -situ groundwater treatment area. The planned remediation for the development site involves the installation of an air sparge/soil vapor extraction (AS/SVE) system , set forth in the 7 July 2022 Remedial and Miti gation System Design Technical Memorandum prepared by Langan . Following the temporary one-time injection points, residual CVOC -impacted groundwater will continue treatment through the AS/SVE system, once installed. The AS/SVE system will continue operati on until remediation objectives for the development site are achieved. Remedial components for the site (injection points and SVI mitigation system) and the adjoining BCP sites (AS/SVE system and vapor collection system) are shown on Figure 7. The timing of the proposed IRM as it relates to the development site remediation is further discussed in Section 3.0. All activities that will result in soil disturbance will be completed in accordance with requirements of the site-specific Construction Health and Safety Plan (CHASP) and the Community Air Monitoring Plan (CAMP) contained therein in a manner to prevent exposure of potential impacts to site workers and the surrounding community. Interim Remedial Measures Work Plan No. 2 514 Union Street Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361307 2 February 2023 Page 10 of 23 2.2 Remedial Design Investigation Methodology Analytical data was collected to evaluate in -situ remediation alternatives during the September 2022 RI . The investigation and sampling method ologies and analytical results as they pertain to remedial design criteria are described in the following sections . Remedial Design Investigation Methodology Seven soil borings , SB05 SB08, and SB14 through SB16, were completed by AARCO Environmental Services Corp. (AARCO) between September 6 and 12, 2022 . Borings were advanced using a limited access Geoprobe \u00ae 420M direct -push drill ing rig and a hand -held hammer drill with a 2.5 -inch coring drill bit was used to pre -clear the concrete slab at each boring location. Localized removal of the finished wooden floor platform was completed to expose the unde rlying concrete slab and provide access to each boring location. The two borings sampled for remedial design criteria depths are summarized as follows: Boring SB08 was advanced to 27 feet bgs Boring SB07 was advanced to 21 feet bgs due to refusal Continuo us soil samples were collected from the surface to the final depth of each boring. Samples were collected from the Geoprobe \u00ae 420M into 4-foot-long acetate liners . The soil was screened for visual, olfactory, and instrumental evidence of environmental imp acts, and was visually classified for soil type, grain size, texture, and moisture content. Instrument screening for the presence of VOCs was performed with a photoionization detector ( PID) equipped with a 10.6-electron volt (eV) lamp . Following sample collection, the borings were converted to groundwater monitoring wells. Excess soil was containerized in United Nations/Department of Transportation (UN/DOT )-approved 55 -gallon steel drums with sealed lids in preparation for off -site disposal. Four soil borings (SB05, SB06, SB07, and SB08) monitoring wells (MW05D, MW06D, MW07D, and MW08D, respectively). The two monitoring wells selected to evaluate remedial design parameters, MW07D and MW08D, were constructed b y advancing 5 or 10 feet of 1 -inch diameter 0.01 -inch slotted schedule 40 PVC well screen with attached riser into the boreholes. MW07D was screened from 15 to 20 feet bgs using 5 feet of 1 -inch diameter 0.01 -inch slotted schedule 40 polyvinyl chloride ( PVC) well screen due to refusal at 21 feet bgs, and about one foot of borehole cave -in. MW08D was screened from 17 to 27 feet bgs using 10 feet of 1 -inch diameter 0.01 -inch slotted schedule 40 PVC well screen and attached riser to the surface. Following installation, each well was developed using a submersible whale pump. Development water was placed into labeled drums and stored on -site pending off -site disposal. Interim Remedial Measures Work Plan No. 2 514 Union Street Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361307 2 February 2023 Page 11 of 23 Remedial Design Sampling Samples submitted for VOC analysis were collected directly from the acetate liner via laboratory -supplied Terra Core \u00ae soil samplers. For all other analyses, t he sample volume was homogenized and placed in appropriate laboratory -supplied sample containers . The sample containers were labeled, placed in a laboratory -supplied cooler and packed on ice (to maintain a temperature of 4\u00b12\u00b0C). Samples were relinquished to a courier for delivery to Alpha Analytical Laboratories (Alpha), a New York State Department of Health ( NYSDOH ) Environmental Laboratory Approval Program (EL AP)-certified laboratory in Westborough, Massachusetts , under standard chain -of-custody protocol. Two grab soil samples in total were collected from soil boring SB07 and SB08 for remedial design analysis . Both soil samples were analyzed for grain size, total solids (TS), iron, manganese, nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, phosphate, sulfate, alkalinity, biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC) . Monitoring wells were sampled in genera l accordance with the EPA's low -flow groundwater sampling procedure to allow for collection of a representative sample (\"Low Stress [low flow] Purging and Sampling Procedure for the Collection of Groundwater Samples from Monitoring Wells\", EQASOP -GW 001, J anuary 19, 2010). Prior to sample collection, groundwater was purged from each well until either groundwater parameters (pH, conductivity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen [DO], temperature, and oxidation -reduction potential [ORP]) had stabilized and turbidity measurements were below 50 Neph elometric Turbidity Units (NTU) or one hour had lapsed. Two groundwater samples, collected from monitoring wells MW07D and MW08D were analyzed for TCL VOCs by EPA to support the evaluation of an in -situ remedial alternative. In addition to collecting groundwater samples to inform remedial design, a Langan field engineer installed a FluxTracer \u00ae Flux Mapping Tool in monito ring well MW11D, wh ere had chemical -like impacts (i.e., visual, olfactory, and/or PID readings above background) were most apparent. The device was installed on 12 September 2022 and removed on 26 September 2022 and was sent to Regenesis \u00ae of San Clemente, California for analysis. The FluxTracer \u00ae consists of five separate two -foot-long stainless steel canisters, each filled with granular activated carbon pre -loaded with biodegradable tracers. The FluxTracer \u00ae determined groundwater speed and contaminant ma ss upon analysis. The FluxTracer \u00ae data was used in the select ion and design of the groundwater remedy, and is incl uded as Appendix A . 2.3 Remedial Design Investigation Results Following the two -week deployment period, the FluxTracer \u00ae was analyzed for Darcy velocity, representing the volume of water that flows through the porous canisters per one -foot interval Interim Remedial Measures Work Plan No. 2 514 Union Street Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361307 2 February 2023 Page 12 of 23 measured in centimeters per day (cm/day), and contaminant flux, representing the mass of contaminants that adsorb to the FluxTracer \u00ae canisters per one -foot interval measured in milligrams per cubic meter per day (mg/ m3/day) . To determine Darcy velocity , the FluxTracer \u00ae device reveals the amount of alcohol tracers that have desorbed from the granular activated carbon from groundwater passing through the steel canisters over the two -week deployment period. As the plume travels with groundwater flow, contaminants adsorb to the activated carbon within the steel canisters. The contaminants are extracted during analysis to determine contaminant mass flu x and concentration. The Darcy velocity and contaminant flux are used to determine contaminant mass at one -foot intervals. The contaminant fluxes for TCE, PCE, and cis -1,2-DCE are divided by the Darcy velocity at each one -foot interval to show flux -derived concentrations for each of the three contaminants. The FluxTracer \u00ae data at monitoring well MW11D shows that the highest concentrations of TCE and cis -1, 2-DCE are at about 18 feet bgs at about 1,180 \u00b5g/L and 150 \u00b5g/L, respectively. The flux-derived c oncentration for PCE at all intervals were non -applicable because the Darcy velocity and/or PCE detection was less than the reporting limit. PCE was detected at concentrations about one order of magnitude less than the cis -1,2-DCE concentration, and about two orders of magnitude less than TCE concentration. Concentrations of TCE and cis -1,2-DCE steadily decrease with depth after the peak at about 18 feet bgs. The FluxTracer \u00ae analytical results provide Darcy velocity, contaminant flux, and contaminant con centrations from about 13 feet bgs to about 22 feet bgs. In combination with groundwater sample analytical results, the FluxTracer \u00ae data was used to define the target treatment zone (TTZ) and remedial product dosages. Additional analyses were performed on soil and groundwater samples collected from the southeastern and southwestern parts of the site to model subsurface conditions in detail and determine remedial product dosages. Two grab soil samples were collected from soil borings SB07 and SB08 and analyzed for grain size, TS, iron, manganese, nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, phosphate, sulfate, alkalinity, BOD, COD, and TOC. Two groundwater samples were collected from monitoring wells MW07D and MW08D and analyzed for TCL VOCs by EPA 8260C MW07D_090922 to 1.55E+01 cells/mL in MW08D_090922. The groundwater design criteria sample results for DHC at the site did not i ndicate dechlorinating bacteria activity above the target threshold of 104 cells/mL ; however, the presence of PCE/TCE breakdown products cis -1,2-DCE and vinyl chloride suggests that some br eakdown has occurred. Interim Remedial Measures Work Plan No. 2 514 Union Street Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361307 2 February 2023 Page 13 of 23 Tables 1 and 2 pr esent the results of the remedia l design parameter analyses . 2.4 In-Situ Groundwater Treatment 2.4.1 Technical Description of In -Situ Groundwater Treatment The CVOC plume will be contained and stabilized via temporary one-time injections of PlumeStop \u00ae, a matrix of activated carbon suspended in water ; S-MicroZVI \u00ae, a fast-release containing DHC bacteria, and other microbes and enzymes to p erform anaerobic biodegradation; and 3DME \u00ae, a multi -staged -release donor product to enhance an aerobic biodegradation. The remedial products will be mixed together and diluted with water on -site and applied in batches with varying dosages . As a result of sorption and biodegrada tion, dissolved CVOC concentrations in groundwater will also be reduced. After the PlumeStop \u00ae application, fine particles of activated carbon will coat soil surfaces , where dissolved phase CVOCs will then sorb into the PlumeStop \u00ae. Following CVOC sorption, colonizing bacteria and microbes in the form of BDI PLUS \u00ae breakdown the CVOCs to non -toxic end products via reductive dechlorination. The process is stimulated by the fast -release electron donor S-MicroZVI \u00ae, which creates a reducing environment. The fast - and slow -release electron donor 3DME \u00ae will be applied , along with BDI PLUS \u00ae and S-MicroZVI \u00ae, to accessible up -gradient areas. The multi -stage release of electron donors in 3DME \u00ae allows the product to flow through the subsurface matrix with gro undwater to otherwise inaccessible areas to complete the permeable reactive barrier . Due to the adjacent building to the west , northwestern perimeter injection points are not feasible. The application of the 3DME \u00ae dose inside the one -car parking garage, located in the northwestern part of the site, is intended to stimulate anaerobic biodegradation once the products adjoin the down -gradient permeable reactive barrier along the western part of the site. Limited access inside the occupied site bu ilding precludes on -site injection points at the suspected source area in the southeastern part of the site. The application of the 3DME \u00ae -dose along the eastern perimeter of the site is intended to allow the products to reach the suspected on -site CVOC sour ce area through groundwater flow , located in the south to southeastern parts of the site before stimulating anaerobic biodegradation. About 19,600 pounds of PlumeStop \u00ae, 1,200 3DME \u00ae, 3,200 pounds of S -MicroZVI \u00ae, and 54 liters of BDI PLUS \u00ae will be applied , totaling 40,008 gallons of remedial products , to construct the permeable reactive barrier. Collectively, these combinations of remedial products create a permeable reactive barrier to reduce CVOC concentrations, and contain and stabilize the CVO C plume beneath the site in order to prevent, to the extent practicable, the migration of Regenesis \u00ae, of San Clemente, California; technical specification s and safety data sheets (SDS) for these Interim Remedial Measures Work Plan No. 2 514 Union Street Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361307 2 February 2023 Page 14 of 23 products are included in Appendix B. Proposed locations are s hown on Figure 8. 2.4.2 Application Methodology The remedial injection products are grouped into three application and water will be combined in mix vessels and applied in batches at 12 injection points along the southern and western perimeters. Each injection point will contain about 924 gallons of PLUS \u00ae will be combined in mix vessels and applied in batches at 28 injection points along the southeastern and south to southwestern perimeters. Each injection point will contain about 895 gallons of PlumeStop \u00ae, S-MicroZVI \u00ae, and BDI BDI PLUS \u00ae, will be combined in mix vessels and applied in batches at 12 injection points along the eastern and northwestern perimeters of the site. Each injection point will contain about 320 gallons of 3DME \u00ae, S-MicroZVI \u00ae, and BDI PLUS \u00ae mixture . reactive barrier will be applied directly to CVOC -impacted and up -gradient areas via about 52 temporary injection points across the southern, eastern, and western perimeters of the site. A summary of the three appl ication strategies are tabulated as Number of Injection Points 12 28 12 Remedial Product Mixture Volumes Per Injection Point PlumeStop\u00ae : 85 gallons S-MicroZVI\u00ae : 5.5 gallons BDI PLUS\u00ae : 1.5 liters Water: 83 3 gallons PlumeStop\u00ae : 41 gallons S-MicroZVI\u00ae : 5 gallons BDI PLUS\u00ae : 0.5 liters Water: 849 gallons 3DME\u00ae : 12 gallons S-MicroZVI\u00ae : 5.5 gallons BDI PLUS\u00ae : 1.5 liters Water: 288 gallons Total Mixture Volume per Injection Point 924 gallons 895 gallons 306 gallons Target Treatment Zone (feet bgs) 10 to 30 10 to 30 10 to 30 Application of the permeable reactive barrier will be conducted via a direct -push drill rig. The remedial application will target the 10 to 30 feet bgs interval . Direct push injection point locations (IP01 through I P52) are shown on Figure 8. Interim Remedial Measures Work Plan No. 2 514 Union Street Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361307 2 February 2023 Page 15 of 23 The anticipated radius of influence for the permeable reactive barrier injections via direct -push is 4 feet. The proposed injection points are about 6 feet apart in their respective application strategy areas. Injections will be made using a \"bottom -up\" approach, beginning at the deepest injection zone and raised in 2 -foot or 3-foot intervals to the top of the gro undwater table. The TTZ is defined from the top of the groundwater table (about 10 feet bgs) to 30 feet bgs. Injection points will be completed through a retractable steel rod equipped with either a 2 -foot- or 3-foot-long slotted section. At each injection point, the steel rod will be advanced to 30 feet bgs . The total volume and concentration within the TTZ at each injection point will be determined by the injection point's high -dose, low- dose , or 3DME \u00ae dose classification. Dosage concentrations are further discussed in the design document prepared by Regenesis \u00ae included in Appendix B. Figure 8 shows the proposed groundwater treatment area. The Regenesis \u00ae groundwater treatment design is detailed in Appendix B. 2.5 Groundwater Monitoring Baseline Sampling One baseline groundwater sample will be collected from existing groundwater monitoring wells and new monitoring wells MW14S and MW15D . These groundwater samples are intended to establish baseline results for future performance monitoring. Monitoring wells selected for baseline sampling are subject to change a ccording to field conditions. Prior to sampling , the monitoring wells will be purged. Purging will consist of pumping, at a minimum, the stabilized drawdown volume plus the pump's tubing volume, and waiting until the physical and chemical parameters (e.g., temperature, dissolved oxygen, oxygen reduction potential, tu rbidity) stabilize within the ranges specified in the USEPA's Low Stress Purging and Sampling Procedure for the Collection of Groundwater Samples From Monitoring Wells, dated July 30, 1996, and 4 th revision September 19, 2017. Samples will be collected wi th a submersible pump and dedicated polyethylene tubing. The pump will be decontaminated with Alconox \u00ae and water between each sample location. Development and purge water will be containerized for off -site disposal. The groundwater samples will be coll ected in laboratory -supplied containers and will be sealed, labeled, and placed in an ice -chilled cooler (to maintain a temperature of about 4\u00baC) for delivery Interim Remedial Measures Work Plan No. 2 514 Union Street Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361307 2 February 2023 Page 16 of 23 to the laboratory. Groundwater samples will be analyzed for CVOC5 compounds detected above the NYSDEC SGVs during the September 2022 RI using the latest USEPA methods for VOCs . QA/QC procedures to be followed are des cribed in the QAPP in Appendix C. Post-Remediation Sampling Post-injection groundwater sample s will be collected existing groundwater monitoring wells MW07D, MW08D MW11D, MW13D, and HRP -MW-1 (off -site and new wells MW14S and MW15D . Well MW11D is located on the adjoining development site and may get destroyed during implementation of the remedy for the adjoining development site. MW11D will be replaced by the installation of development site wells RD-MW02S and RD -MW02D . Once instal led wells RD -MW02S and RD -MW02D will be sampled in lieu of MW11D. The first sampling event will take place about 30 days after the injection s are completed . Post-injection groundwater samples will be collected on a quarterly basis for the first year following the injection program . After one year, the sampling frequency will be reassessed based on analytical results. The samples will be submitted to an NYSDOH ELAP -certified laboratory for analysis of CVOCs. The Construction Completion Report will i nclude results of at least the first two quarterly sampling events . Although well HRP -MW-1 will be monitored following the injections , CVOC concretions in HRP-MW-1 are expected to be directly impacted by the proposed injection program give the distance fro m the site. The numbers of wells to be monitored may be reduced based on a review of the results and with the NYSDEC's written concurrence. The decision to discontinue groundwater sampling will be made in consultation with NYSDEC and will consider wh ether remaining contaminant concentrations have: Decreased to levels below applicable NYSDEC standards, as practicable; or Become asymptotic over an extended period of time as mandated by the NYSDEC and the NYSDOH. The groundwater monitoring locations may be subject to change based on construction/remediation at the adjoining development site. Any additional groundwater monitoring requirements will be address ed in the forthcoming RAWP . 5 Groundwater samples will be analyzed for TCE, PCE, ci s-1,2-dichloroethene, vinyl chloride, 1,1-dichloroethene, and trans -1,2-dichloroethene. Interim Remedial Measures Work Plan No. 2 514 Union Street Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361307 2 February 2023 Page 17 of 23 Purged Groundwater and Decontamination Fluids Management Excess remediation phase -derived waste including purged groundwater, and decontamination fluids, will be containerized in properly -labeled and sealed UN/DOT -approved 55 -gallon drums and staged for future waste characterization and off -site disposal at a facility permitted to accept the waste. T he drums will be staged in an area on -site, pending receipt of laboratory data and off -site disposal to an appropriate facility. T he site will be secured during and after investigation to prevent public access to the site. 2.6 Remediation Oversight The Remedial Engineer ( RE), Jason Hayes, P.E., of Langan, will oversee implementation of th is IRMWP. The RE is responsible for documenting that the contractor performs the work as specified in this IRM WP and for providing required documentation to the NYSDEC as part of the CCR described below in Section 4. 2. A Langan representative , under the supe rvision of the RE, will provide oversight d uring implementation of th is IRMWP . Work conducted in accordance with this IRM WP will be documented in daily field reports, monthly BCP progress reports, and in the CCR. 2.7 Odor, Vapor, and Nuisance Control Plan Community air monitoring will be conducted during ground -intrusive work (i.e., advancement of injection points) in compliance with the NYSDOH Generic CAMP outlined be low and included in Appendix D. CAMP will consist of continuous monitoring for VOCs and dust emissions during ground -intrusive activities. Ground intrusive activities includ e, but are not limited to the installation of injection points. Special Require ments, as included in Appendix D, will be adhered to for indoor work or occupied structures within 20 feet . Upwind concentrations will be measured at the start of each workday to establish background concentrations. VOCs and dust emissions will be monitore d at the downwind perimeter of the work zone, which will be established at a point on the site where the general public or site employees may be present. Periodic monitoring for VOCs is required during non -intrusive activities such as the collection of groundwater samples from existing monitoring wells. \"Periodic\" monitoring during sample collection might reasonably consist of collecting a reading upon arrival at a sample location, monitoring while opening a well cap or overturning soil, monitoring durin g well bailing/purging, and collecting a reading before leaving a sample location. CAMP monitoring for VOC levels will be conducted with a PID , and monitoring for dust/particulates will be conducted with a particu late sensor equipped with a filter to detec t particulates less than 10 microns in diameter (PM10). Monitoring for particulates and odors will be conducted during all ground intrusive activities by the RE's field inspector. The work zone is Interim Remedial Measures Work Plan No. 2 514 Union Street Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361307 2 February 2023 Page 18 of 23 defined as the general area in which machinery is operati ng in support of remediation activities. A portable PID will be used to monitor the work zone and for periodic monitoring of VOCs during activities such as groundwater sampling. The site perimeter will be visually monitored for fugitive dust emissions. The following actions will be taken based on VOC levels measured: If total VOC levels exceed 5 ppm above background for the 15 -minute average at the perimeter, work activities will be temporarily halted and monitoring continued. If levels readily decrease (per instantaneous readings) below 5 ppm above background, work activities will resume with continued monitoring. If total VOC levels at the downwind perimeter of the work zone persist at levels in excess of 5 ppm above background but less than 25 ppm, wo rk activities will be halted, the source of vapors identified, corrective actions taken to abate emissions and monitoring continued. After these steps work activities will resume provided that the total organic vapor level 200 feet downwind of the work zo ne or half the distance to the nearest potential receptor or residential/commercial structure, whichever is less - but in no case less than 20 feet, is below 5 ppm above background for the 15 -minute average. If the total VOC level is above 25 ppm at the p erimeter of the work zone, activities will be shut down. The following actions will be taken based on visual dust observations: If the downwind particulate level is 100 \u00b5g/m\u00b3 greater than background (upwind conditions measured at the start of each workday ) for the 15 -minute period or if airborne dust is observed leaving the work zone, then dust suppression must be employed. Work may continue with dust suppression techniques provided that downwind PM10 levels do not exceed 150 \u00b5g/m\u00b3 above the background lev el and provided that no visible dust is migrating from the work zone. If, after implementation of dust suppression techniques, downwind PM10 levels are greater than 150 \u00b5g/m\u00b3 above the background level conditions measured at the start of each workday , work must be stopped and a re -evaluation of activities initiated. Work can resume provided that dust suppression measures and other controls are successful in reducing the downwind PM10 concentration to within 150 \u00b5g/m\u00b3 of the upwind level and in preventing v isible dust migration. Due to VOC impacts present at the site, s pecial requirements for work within 20 feet of potentially exposed i ndividuals or structures have been established. If work areas are within 20 feet of potentially exposed populations or occu pied structures, the continuous monitoring locations for VOCs and particulates must reflect the nearest potentially exposed individuals and Interim Remedial Measures Work Plan No. 2 514 Union Street Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361307 2 February 2023 Page 19 of 23 the location of ventilation system intakes for nearby structures. The on -site building is not expected to be occupi ed during injection point installation. The use of engineering controls will be considered to prevent exposures related to the work activities and to control dust and odors. If total VOC concentrations opposite the walls of occupied structures or next to intake vents exceed 1 ppm, monitoring should occur within the occupied structure(s). Background readings in the occupied spaces must be taken prior to commencement of the planned work. Any unusual background readings should be discussed with NYSDOH prior to commencement of the work. If total particulate concentrations opposite the walls of occupied structures or next to intake vents exceed 150 \u00b5g/m3, work activities should be suspended until controls are implemented and are successful in reducing the tot al particulate concentration to 150 \u00b5g/m3 or less at the monitoring point. Concentrations above actions levels observed in the CAMP will be reported to the NYSDEC and NYSDOH Project Managers and included in the daily report. In addition, a map showing t he location of the downwind and upwind CAMP stations will be included in the daily report. 2.8 Construction Health and Safety Plan The RE oversaw preparation of a CHASP for the site, and the adjoining parcels , which is provided as Appendix E. The CHASP provides a mechanism for establishing on -site safe working conditions, safety organization, procedures, and personal protective equipment requirements. The CHASP meets the requirements of 29 CFR 1910 and 29 CFR 1926 (which includes 29 CFR 1910.120 an d 29 CFR 1926.65, respectively).

REGENESIS received 1 set of 10' passive flux meter device from Langan Engineering and performed FluxTracer analysis to determine Darcy flux, mass flux, and flux derived contaminant concentration. The quantitative FluxTracer test measur es the amount of alcohol tracers that desorbed from the activated carbon due to ground water passively flowing through the cylinder cannister s. Concurrently , contaminants present in the plume will adsorb to the activated carbon during the deployed period after which will be extracted from the activated carbon to quantify mass flux and flux derived contaminant MW -11D Darcy velocity and mass flux data Depth below top of well casing (ft) Darcy velocity 1 14.8 9.9 <1 11 12 15.8 4.6 <1 6 6 16.8 6.3 <1 13 6 17.8 3.4 <1 40 5 18.8 6.3 <1 29 8 19.8 6.7 <1 5 1 20.8 <2.0 <1 6 3 21.8 6.9 <1 2 1 Table 2.

Contaminant flux and Darcy velocity are then used to derive contaminant mass at 1-foot interval s. Under these test conditions, the Darcy velocity and contaminant flux for the groundwater plume can be interpreted as Indicator Yellow Low <2 - 5 <96 - 240 <10 - 300 Yellow to Orange Medium 5 - 15 240 - 719 300 - 800 Orange to Red High 15- >30 719 - 1437 800 - >2000 *Seepage rate assumes a 0.25 porosity Flux derived concentration is derived using the following equation: (/)= (/2/) (/)10 A non -applicable (N/A) is applied to the intervals where either the Darcy velocity, contaminant of concern, or both is less than the reporting limit. A value of ND <X indicates that the analyte of concern is NOT detected above the method detection limit (MDL) or the method reporting limit (MRL) . A J-value indicates that the analyte of concern was detected and that the analyte concentration is an estimated value which is between the method detection limit (MDL) and the method reporting limit (MRL). Description of Experimental Methods A batch reactor is filled with 10 grams of sample from each 1 -foot interval and is extracted for alcohol tracers followed by extraction of chlorinated volatile organic solvents (CVOCs) using of isobutanol and acetone -hexane , respectively. Batch reactors are then placed on a sh aker for 24 hours. A 1 ml extract from each batch reactor is transferred to a liquid gas chromatography vial and each sample is analyzed by a GC -FID for alcohol tracers and GC-MS for CVOCs. Quantitatio n procedures of Darcy and mass flux can be found in , https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/es050074g . APPENDIX B GROUNDWATER TREATMENT DESIGN DOCUMENTS PROJECT NAME 514 Union Street PREP ARED FOR Langan |1Reduce mass migr ating from below the building to aid in full scale remediation paired with downgr adient AS/SVE to be installed later .Three dosage/product mix es will be used based on the concentr ation of the migr ating materials.Proposed Solution Example: W e are proposing a permeable reactiv e barrier around the west, south and part the east building walls to address migr ating CV OC impacts along the building walls migr ating from below the slab. This remediation e vent is intended to help the downgr adient treatment to be implemented at a later time. The reagents will be applied via direct push injection.Project Summary REGENESIS appreciates the opportunity to pro vide Langan Engineering & En vironmental this remedial design and cost estimate for this project. Included within is a brief summary of our proposed solution, our understanding of y our project goals, the technologies proposed, and a table summarizing the design. PlumeStop High Dose to access pr oduct specification sheetsProject Goals Technologies Proposed Technical Resources PlumeStop\u00ae Technical Bulletin 2.1: Sorption of Contaminants from 14, 2022Figure 1-Injection L ocation Mapregenesis.com |3Technical Approach We are proposing the application of PlumeStop\u00ae Liquid Activated Carbon (PlumeStop) and Sulfidated-Micro Zero Valent Iron (S-MicroZVI\u00ae) to treat residual chlorinated solvents. Together, these technologies will foster rapid concentration reductions and provide long-term treatment of the target compounds through sorption plus abiotic destructive pathways, while minimizing the potential for daughter product formation. PlumeStop is a colloidal form of activated carbon with a surface treatment which reduces its interactions with the soil matrix. This allows it to move through soil pores leaving a coating on the soil matrix as it distributes from the injection point. This provides a very large sorption surface which will result in immediate reduction of these contaminants while concentrating contaminants to allow for more efficient and controlled remediation through destructive technologies. S-MicroZVI is a concentrated suspension of sulfidated, colloidal zero-valent iron, designed for enhanced, long-lasting reactivity and ease of application relative to other forms of ZVI. When applied to the subsurface it imparts an in-situ chemical reduction (ISCR) mechanism that allows for the direct destruction of chlorinated ethenes (i.e. TCE) via abiotic degradation pathways, which minimizes the formation of daughter products such as vinyl chloride. Sulfidation of the ZVI surface significantly decreases the reaction that occurs between water and the ZVI particles, allowing the reagent tobemore effective forthechemical reduction ofchlorinated ethenes. This approach combines enhanced reductiv e ) and abiotic in-situ ents. The its longe vity (se veral y ears) allow for sufficient co verage with minimal pore volume displacement thereb y minimizing application costs. Our colloidal zero-valent iron (ZVI) product, Sulfidated- MicroZVI (S-MicroZVI\u00ae), will pro vide a source of iron, creating conditions for abiotic reduction via the formation of iron sulfides, o xides, and h ydro xides, while also maintaining strongly reducing conditions in the treatment area for an extended timefr ame. This will foster r apid abiotic reduction of chlorinated solv ents while reducing the potential for daughter product formation compared to a standard in-situ bioremediation approach. Bio-Dechlor INOCULUM\u00aePlus (BDI Plus) is added to pro vide a liv e microbial culture that is known to fully degr ade these compounds.

Table 2: Remedial Design P arameters Summary PlumeStop High Dose 3DMEregenesis.com |5Design V erification T esting (D VT) Design V erification T esting (D VT) is a term used to describe a suite of field sampling/testing activities carried out before implementing a subsurface substr ate injection progr am. The purpose is to v erify that the subsurface conditions at the selected application location match those conditions used in the design. P erforming the D VT step pro vides critical data input to the design team allowing to adjust the necessary elements in the design. These design adjustments significantly impro ve substr ate placement and result in an o verall impro vement in remedial performance and reduction in o verall project cost. DVT will be conducted during the remediation mobilization and will consist of pre-injection soil cores. Additionally , REGENESIS is recommending installing a FluxT racer in a well near the planned barrier . FluxT racer is a de vice that is deplo yed into the satur ated screened interval of a monitoring well, that can accur ately determine groundwater speed and chlorinated solv ent mass flux, both are instrumental in the successful design of PlumeStop barriers. A FluxT racer unit consists of a series of 2-foot pre-strung canisters, that can be installed into 2-inch monitoring well for appro ximately two weeks. Each canister contains activated carbon and biodegr adable tr acers. As groundwater natur ally moves through the FluxT racer , contaminants are sorbed to the activated carbon, and the tr acers are depleted from activated carbon. The amount of sorbed contaminants is used to determine mass flux, while the depletion of the tr acers can estimate groundwater speed. Initial construction and lab analysis is completed b y REGENESIS, lea ving only the installation and retrie val to the client. Placement Validation (PV) Placement V alidation (PV) seeks to e valuate that the designed injection point spacing and v olumes are adequate to achie ve proper distribution within the target treatment zone. Evaluation will be based on the reagent fluid monitoring at nearb y monitoring locations during the injection process and modifications ma y be made to the design if initial field tests are not satisfactory . PV is also used to document visual product sorption onto aquifer materials after its initial colloidal fluid state. As such, RRS will conduct various field tests to e valuate the distribution and influence of the remedial reagents in the subsurface throughout the injection application. These site--specific PV field tests will typically be conducted in strategically-located quality control segments within the injection area footprint. These segments are commonly referred to as as \"clusters\" . The field tests ma y include pre-injection soil cores to view the lithology and confirm v ertical treatment as designed; installation of tempor ary piezometers to monitor water le vel, groundwater par ameters, and groundwater color; and lastly , collection of post-injection soil cores to observ e reagents adhered to the aquifer matrix where desired. In gener al,RRS ma y utilize se veral field test procedures in combination or individually to e valuate the distribution and influence of the remedial reagents being applied. Materials for PV will need to be coordinated with the subcontr acted drilling firm.regenesis.com |6Performance Objectiv es Purpose/Goals Example: W e are proposing a permeable reactiv e barrier around the west, south and part the east building walls to address migr ating CV OC impacts along the building walls migr ating from below the slab. This remediation e vent is intended to help the downgr adient treatment to be implemented at a later time. The reagents will be applied via direct push injection. Monitoring To evaluate and measure performance at this site, in the shallow zone monitoring wells MW -37, MW -11S, MW -02, MW -18, MW -12, MW -11 will be utilized. in the intermediate -07DD , MW -21DD , represent \"in barrier\" wells. Downgr adient wells are to be installed and monitoring points will be assigned at that time. Within this proposal it is suggested that groundwater monitoring par ameters will be collected monthly for the 1 st3 months, and quarterly thereafter . To help support performance e valuations, REGENESIS requests the data collected be pro vided to us in a timely manner . Qualifiers (Design Consider ations) Seepage v elocity /mass flux is a primary driv er of dose for PlumeStop projects. This is the basis for our recommendation of P assiv e Flux Meters at y our site. Any anthropogenic changes to the groundwater flow v elocity or direction can effect the performance of the barrier .Changes to the groundwater system due to activating the AS/SVE system should be closely monitored.regenesis.com |7REGENESIS Remediation Services (RRS) pro vides turn-k ey remediation planning, design, and application services.

Over 100 Projects Completed Annually Across the US Statement of Qualificationsregenesis.com |8RRS will work under the direction of Langan Engineering & Environmental to implement the field work associated with the application of the selected remediation technologies. Responsibilities for the implementation of this scope of work will be shared between RRS and Langan Engineering & Environmental . Responsibilities for each are outlined in this section and further under the Assumptions/Qualification section. At the beginning of each da y a safety tailgate meeting will be conducted and an o verview of the procedures, responsibilities and goals for the da y will be discussed. RRS will be equipped with multiple injection tool options to use with 1.5-inch diameter DPT rods. The injection tool string will be advanced to the top or bottom of the TTZ and injections will be performed in a bottom-up or top-down method depending on site and lithology conditions. The remediation technologies will be mix ed in an injection tr ailer (Figure 2) with water in batches at the designated solution percentage and k ept in constant suspension throughout the injection application. Pressures, flow r ates and total v olume will be monitored and digitally documented for each injection interval. Multiple injection points ma y be injected into simultaneously to increase efficiencies on-site. The injection points and surrounding areas will be monitored for an y signs of surfacing and a spill response kit will be on standb y.RRS Scope of Services During the application, real-time information will be collected and analyzed to help v erify design assumptions and subsurface reagent distribution. Depending on the primary product applied, data collected and analyzed ma y consist of groundwater quality par ameters (i.e., pH, conductivity , DO , ORP , etc.), depth to water measurements, visual indicators through groundwater or soil samples, and in-field injection concentr ation test kits. This information is typically collected during the application when within 10 feet of an appropriately screened monitoring well. Based on the information collected, the project team ma y choose to modify the remediation design to further optimize the injection application. This includes modification to injection concentr ations, v olume per v ertical foot, injection intervals, etc. Once the injection e vent is completed, RRS will demobilize all equipment and personnel off-site. A detailed injection summary report which includes injection point data (interval depths, injection pressure/flow r ates, reagent v olume, time elapsed and if surfacing occurred), field observations and an y other noteworth y information will be gener ated and made available to Langan Engineering & En vironmental .

The attached design summary tables specify the assumptions used in prepar ation for this technical design. W e request that these modeling input assumptions be v erified b y your firm prior to application of the product. Other assumptions and qualifications related to this proposal are as follows: The product and services cost outlined will be valid for 60 da ys from date of proposal. If be yond 60 da ys, RRS reserv es the right to update cost. The freight charges included for product deliv ery abo ve are estimated at the time of proposal gener ation. Actual freight charges are neither set nor guar anteed b y RRS and are calculated when the product order is placed. This price ma y vary from what is estimated abo ve. Actual freight charges for product deliv ery will be in voiced. Freight deliv ery time fr ames cannot be guar anteed and RRS will not be responsible for an y dela ys or an y resulting increase in cost associated with those dela ys. If applicable, sales tax charges for product, freight, and services are considered estimated at the time of proposal submittal. The appropriate sales tax category (i.e., product, freight, and services) and actual sales tax r ate is finalized at the time of in voice and ma y change from date of proposal submittal. RRS will ha ve access to the site for equipment oper ation and secure stor age of materials and equipment throughout the dur ation of the project.

PlumeStop is composed of very ne particles of activated carbon (1-2\u00b5m) suspended in water through the use of unique organic polymer dispersion chemistry. Once in the subsurface, the material behaves as a colloidal biomatrix, binding to the aquifer matrix, rapidly removing contaminants from groundwater, and expediting permanent contaminant biodegradation. This unique remediation technology accomplishes treatment with the use of highly dispersible, fast-acting, sorption-based technology, capturing and concentrating dissolved-phase contaminants within its matrix-like structure. Once contaminants are sorbed onto the regenerative matrix, biodegradation processes achieve complete remediation at an accelerated rate.

It is the user'sresponsibility to ensure safe conditions for handling, storage and disposal of the product, and toassume liability for loss, injury, damage or expense due to improper use. The information in thesheet was written based on the best knowledge and experience currently available.Disclaimer S-MicroZVI or S-MZVI SDS US (3DME\u00ae ) is comprised of a patented molecular structure containing oleic acids (i.e., oil component) and lactates/polylactates, which are molecularly bound to one another (gure 1). The 3DME molecule contains both a soluble (hydrophilic) and insoluble (lipophilic) region. These two regions of themolecule are designed to be balanced in size and relative strength. The balancedhydrophilic/lipophilic regions of 3DME result in an electron donor with physical properties allowing it to initially adsorb to the aquifer material in the area of application, then slowly redistribute via very small 3DME \"bundles\" calledmicelles. These 3DME micelles spontaneously form within sections of theaquifer where concentrations of 3DME reach several hundred parts per million. The micelles' small size and mobility allow it to move with groundwater flow through the aquifer matrix, passing easily through the pore throats in betweensoil grains resulting in the further redistribution of 3DME within the aquifer. This allows for advective distribution of the oleic acids which are otherwise insoluble and unable to distribute in this manner, allowing for increased persistence of thelactate/polylactates component due to their initial attachment to the oleic acids. Due to its patented molecular structure, 3DME oers far greater transport when compared to blended emulsied vegetable oil (EVO) products, which fail to distribute beyond the limits of pumping. 3DME also provides greater persistence when compared to soluble substrates such as lactates or simplesugars. The 3DME molecular structures capitalize on the best features of the two electron-donor types while at the same time, minimize their limitations. 3DME is delivered to the site as a ready-to-apply emulsion that is simply dilutedwith water to generate a large volume of a 3DME colloidal suspension. Suspension of 3DME generated by this mixing range from micelles on the order of .02 microns to .05 microns in diameter, to \"swollen\" micelles, (termed \"microemulsions\") which are on the order of .05 to 5 microns in diameter. Once injected into the subsurface in high volumes, the colloidal suspension mixes and dilutes in existing pore waters. The micelles/microemulsions on the injection front will then begin to sorb onto the surfaces of soils as a result of zeta potential attraction and organic matter within the soils themselves. As the sorption continues, the 3DME will \"coat\" pore surfaces developing a layer of molecules and in some cases a bilayer. This sorption process continues as the micelles/microemulsion moves outward and disassociates into their hydrophilic/hydrophobic components. The specialized chemistry of 3DME results in a staged release of electron donors: free lactate (immediate); polylactate esters (mid-range) and free fatty acids & fatty acid esters (long-term). Material longevity of three years or greater has been seen at most sites as determined from biogeochemical analyses.

(Langan) prepared this Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) on behalf of 473 President LLC (the Volunteer) for the property at 514 Union Street, Brooklyn, New York (the site). The Volunteer was accepted into the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) Brownfield Cleanup Program (BCP) to investigate and remediate the site pursuant to the NYSDEC Brownfield Cleanup Agreement (BCA) executed on 21 October 2021. The site was assigned BCP Site No. C224318. The approximately 17,000-square-foot site, identified as Brooklyn Borough Tax Block 440, Lot 12, is located in an urban area in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, and consists of an one-story brick building occupied by the Royal Palms Shuffleboard Club. This Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) specifies analytical methods and evaluation procedures to be used to ensure that data from the proposed interim remedial measure (IRM) at the site are precise, accurate, representative, comparable, and complete. 1.2 Project Objectives IRMWP No. 2 proposes containment and stabilization of a chlorinated volatile organic compound (CVOC) groundwater plume to prevent the migration of the plume and reduce CVOC concentrations, to the extent feasible. Plume containment and stabilization will be achieved by in-situ application of remediation products designed to capture and enhance biodegradation of CVOCs. The IRMWP includes the following tasks to support groundwater treatment: Development and implementation of a site-specific Construction Health and Safety Plan (CHASP) for the protection of on-site workers, tenants, and the community during remediation; Collection of baseline groundwater samples from existing monitoring wells MW07D, MW08D, and MW13D; Application of PlumeStop\u00ae Liquid Activated Carbon and 3-D Microemulsion (3DME\u00ae)1 via injections at varying targeted doses designed to capture and enhance biodegradation of CVOCs. The i of San Clemente, California.Quality Assurance Project Plan 514 Union Street, Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361305 NYSDEC BCP Site No. C224318November 2022 Page 2 of 27 n-situ groundwater remedy will contain and stabilize the CVOC groundwater plume to prevent the migration of the plume and reduce CVOC concentrations, to the extent feasible; Collection of post-remediation groundwater samples from existing wells MW07D, MW08D, and MW13D to demonstrate effectiveness; and Preparation of a Construction Completion Report (CCR) to document implementation of the IRMWP. 1.3 Scope of Work The scope of work is described in detail in the IRMWP No. 2. Groundwater samples will be collected for laboratory analysis. An odor and organic vapor control and monitoring plan will be implemented during implementation of the IRMWP No. 2. Quality Assurance Project Plan 514 Union Street, Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361305 NYSDEC BCP Site No. C224318November 2022 Page 3 of 27 2.0 DATA QUALITY OBJECTIVES AND PROCESSES Data Quality Objectives (DQOs) are qualitative and quantitative statements to help ensure that data of known and appropriate quality are obtained during the project. DQOs for sampling activities are determined by evaluating five factors: Data needs and uses: The types of data required and how the data will be used after it is obtained. Parameters of Interest: The types of chemical or physical parameters required for the intended use. Level of Concern: Levels of constituents, which may require remedial actions or further investigations. Required Analytical Level: The level of data quality, data precision, and QA/QC documentation required for chemical analysis. Required Detection Limits: The detection limits necessary based on the above information. The quality assurance and quality control objectives for all measurement data include: Precision - an expression of the reproducibility of measurements of the same parameter under a given set of conditions. Field sampling precision will be determined by analyzing coded duplicate samples and analytical precision will be determined by analyzing internal QC duplicates and matrix spike duplicates. Accuracy - a measure of the degree of agreement of a measured value with the true or expected value of the quantity of concern. Sampling accuracy will be determined through the assessment of the analytical results of equipment blanks and trip blanks (organic analysis of aqueous matrices only) for each sample set. Analytical accuracy will be assessed by examining the percent recoveries of surrogate compounds that are added to each sample (organic analyses only), internal standards, laboratory method blanks, instrument calibration, and the percent recoveries of matrix spike compounds added to selected samples and laboratory blanks. Representativeness - expresses the degree to which sample data accurately and precisely represent a characteristic of a population, parameter variations at a sampling point, or an environmental condition. Representativeness is dependent upon the adequate design of the sampling program and will be satisfied by ensuring that the scope of work is followed and that specified sampling and analysis techniques are used. Representativeness in the laboratory is ensured by compliance to nationally-recognized analytical methods, meeting sample holding times, and maintaining sample integrity while the samples are in the laboratory's possession. This is accomplished by following all Quality Assurance Project Plan 514 Union Street, Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361305 NYSDEC BCP Site No. C224318November 2022 Page 4 of 27 applicable methods, laboratory-issued standard operating procedures (SOPs), the laboratory's Quality Assurance Manual, and this QAPP. The laboratory is required to be properly certified and accredited. Completeness - the percentage of measurements made which are judged to be valid. Completeness will be assessed through data validation. The QC objective for completeness is generation of valid data for at least 90 percent of the analyses requested. Comparability - expresses the degree of confidence with which one data set can be compared to another. The comparability of all data collected for this project will be ensured using several procedures, including standard methods for sampling and analysis, instrument calibrations, using standard reporting units and reporting formats, and data validation. Sensitivity - the ability of the instrument or method to detect target analytes at the levels of interest. The project manager will select, with input from the laboratory and QA personnel, sampling and analytical procedures that achieve the required levels of detection. The above objectives are discussed in detail in Section 4.0.

These objectives are defined in following subsections. Variances from the quality assurance objectives at any stage of the investigation will result in the implementation of appropriate corrective measures and an assessment of the impact of corrective measures on the usability of the data. 4.1 Precision Precision is a measure of the degree to which two or more measurements are in agreement. Field precision is assessed through the collection and measurement of field duplicates. Laboratory precision and sample heterogeneity also contribute to the uncertainty of field duplicate measurements. This uncertainty is taken into account during the data assessment process. For field duplicates, results less than 5x the reporting limit (RL) meet the precision criteria if the absolute difference is less than \u00b12x the RL for soil or \u00b11x for groundwater. For results greater than 5x the RL, the acceptance criteria is a relative percent difference (RPD) of 50% (soil) or 30% (groundwater). RLs and method detection limits (MDL) are provided in Attachment B. 4.2 Accuracy Accuracy is the measurement of the reproducibility of the sampling and analytical methodology. It should be noted that precise data may not be accurate data. For the purpose of this QAPP, bias is defined as the constant or systematic distortion of a measurement process, which manifests itself as a persistent positive or negative deviation from the known or true value. This may be due to (but not limited to) improper sample collection, sample matrix, poorly calibrated analytical or sampling equipment, or limitations or errors in analytical methods and techniques. Accuracy in the field is assessed through the use of field blanks and through compliance with all sample handling, preservation, and holding time requirements. All field blanks should be non- detect when analyzed by the laboratory. Any contaminant detected in an associated field blank will be evaluated against laboratory blanks (preparation or method) and evaluated against field samples collected on the same day to determine potential for bias. Trip blanks are not required for non-aqueous matrices, but will be considered for non-aqueous matrices where high concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are anticipated based on field screening. Laboratory accuracy is assessed by evaluating the percent recoveries of matrix spike/matrix spike duplicate (MS/MSD) samples, laboratory control samples (LCS), surrogate compound recoveries, and the results of method preparation blanks. MS/MSD, LCS, and surrogate percent recoveries will be compared to either method-specific control limits or laboratory-derived control limits. Quality Assurance Project Plan 514 Union Street, Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361305 NYSDEC BCP Site No. C224318November 2022 Page 7 of 27 Sample volume permitting, samples displaying outliers should be reanalyzed. All associated method blanks should be non-detect when analyzed by the laboratory. 4.3 Representativeness Representativeness expresses the degree to which data accurately and precisely represents a characteristic of a population, parameter variations at a sampling point, a process condition, or an environmental condition within a defined spatial and/or temporal boundary. Representativeness is dependent upon the adequate design of the sampling program and will be satisfied by ensuring that the scope of work is followed and that specified sampling and analysis techniques are used. This is performed by following applicable SOPs and this QAPP. All field technicians will be given copies of appropriate documents prior to sampling events and are required to read, understand, and follow each document as it pertains to the tasks at hand. Representativeness in the laboratory is ensured by compliance to nationally-recognized analytical methods, meeting sample holding times, and maintaining sample integrity while the samples are in the laboratory's possession. This is performed by following all applicable analytical methods, laboratory-issued SOPs, the laboratory's Quality Assurance Manual, and this QAPP. The laboratory is required to be properly certified and accredited. 4.4 Completeness Laboratory completeness is the ratio of total number of samples analyzed and verified as acceptable compared to the number of samples submitted to the fixed-base laboratory for analysis, expressed as a percent. Three measures of completeness are defined: Sampling completeness, defined as the number of valid samples collected relative to the number of samples planned for collection; Analytical completeness, defined as the number of valid sample measurements relative to the number of valid samples collected; and Overall completeness, defined as the number of valid sample measurements relative to the number of samples planned for collection. Soil, groundwater, and soil vapor data will meet a 90% completeness criterion. If the criterion is not met, sample results will be evaluated for trends in rejected and unusable data. The effect of unusable data required for a determination of compliance will also be evaluated. 4.5 Comparability Comparability expresses the degree of confidence with which one data set can be compared to another. The comparability of all data collected for this project will be ensured by:Quality Assurance Project Plan 514 Union Street, Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361305 NYSDEC BCP Site No. C224318November 2022 Page 8 of 27 Using identified standard methods for both sampling and analysis phases of this project; Requiring traceability of all analytical standards and/or source materials to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) or National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST); Requiring that all calibrations be verified with an independently prepared standard from a source other than that used for calibration (if applicable); Using standard reporting units and reporting formats including the reporting of QC data; Performing a complete data validation on documentation sampling analytical results, including the use of data qualifiers in all cases where appropriate; and Requiring that all validation qualifiers be used any time an analytical result is used for any purpose. These steps will ensure all future users of either the data or the conclusions drawn from them will be able to judge the comparability of these data and conclusions. 4.6 Sensitivity Sensitivity is the ability of the instrument or method to detect target analytes at the levels of interest. The project director will select, with input from the laboratory and QA personnel, sampling and analytical procedures that achieve the required levels of detection and QC acceptance limits that meet established performance criteria. Concurrently, the project director will select the level of data assessment to ensure that only data meeting the project DQOs are used in decision-making. Field equipment will be used that can achieve the required levels of detection for analytical measurements in the field. In addition, the field sampling staff will collect and submit full volumes of samples as required by the laboratory for analysis, whenever possible. Full volume aliquots will help ensure achievement of the required limits of detection and allow for reanalysis if necessary. The concentration of the lowest level check standard in a multi-point calibration curve will represent the reporting limit. Analytical methods and quality assurance parameters associated with the sampling program are presented in Attachment C. The frequency of associated field blanks and duplicate samples will be based on the recommendations listed in the May 2010 Division of Environmental Remediation (DER) Technical Guidance for Site Investigation and Remediation (DER-10) and as described in Section 5.3.Quality Assurance Project Plan 514 Union Street, Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361305 NYSDEC BCP Site No. C224318November 2022 Page 9 of 27 5.0 SAMPLING PROGRAM Groundwater sampling will be conducted in accordance with the established NYSDEC protocols contained in DER-10/Technical Guidance for Site Investigation and Remediation (May 2010) and title 6 of the New York Codes Rules and Regulations Part 375. The following sections describe procedures to be followed for specific tasks. 5.1 Field Documentation Procedures 5.1.1 Field Data and Notes Field notebooks contain the documentary evidence regarding procedures conducted by field personnel. Hard cover, bound field notebooks will be used because of their compact size, durability, and secure page binding. The pages of the notebook will not be removed. Entries will be made in waterproof, permanent blue or black ink. No erasures will be allowed. If an incorrect entry is made, the information will be crossed out with a single strike mark and the change initialed and dated by the team member making the change. Each entry will be dated. Entries will be legible and contain accurate and complete documentation of the individual or sampling team's activities or observations made. The level of detail will be sufficient to explain and reconstruct the activity conducted. Each entry will be signed by the person(s) making the entry. The following types of information will be provided for each sampling task, as appropriate: Project name and number Reasons for being on-site or taking the sample(s) Date and time of activity Sample identification number(s) Geographical location of sampling points with references to the Site, other facilities or a map coordinate system; sketches will be made in the field logbook when appropriate Physical location of sampling locations such as depth below ground surface Description of the method of sampling including procedures followed, equipment used and any departure from the specified procedures Description of the sample including physical characteristics, odor, etc. Readings obtained from health and safety equipmentQuality Assurance Project Plan 514 Union Street, Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361305 NYSDEC BCP Site No. C224318November 2022 Page 10 of 27 Weather conditions at the time of sampling and previous meteorological events that may affect the representative nature of a sample Photographic information including a brief description of what was photographed, the date and time, the compass direction of the picture and the number of the picture on the camera Other pertinent observations such as the presence of other persons on the Site, actions by others that may affect performance of site tasks, etc. Names of sampling personnel and signature of persons making entries Field records will also be collected on field data sheets including boring logs, which will be used for geologic and drilling data during soil boring activities. Field data sheets will include the project- specific number and stored in the field project files when not in use. At the completion of the field activities, the field data sheets will be maintained in the central project file. 5.1.2 Sample Labeling Each sample collected will be assigned a unique identification number and abbreviation in accordance with the sample nomenclature guidance provided in the following table and the Standard Operating Procedure provided in Attachment D. Sample Nomenclature Summary AA Ambient Air DUP Field Duplicate EA Effluent Air FB Field Blank IA Indoor Air MW Monitoring Well SB Soil Boring SSV Sub-slab Vapor TB Trip Blank (#-#) Depth Interval MMDDYY Date of Sampling Each sample container will have a sample label affixed to the outside with the date and time of sample collection and project name. In addition, the label will contain the sample identification number, analysis required and chemical preservatives added, if any. All documentation will be completed in waterproof ink.Quality Assurance Project Plan 514 Union Street, Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361305 NYSDEC BCP Site No. C224318November 2022 Page 11 of 27 5.2 Equipment Calibration and Preventative Maintenance A photoionization detector (PID) will be used during the sampling activities to evaluate work zone action levels. Field calibration and/or field checking of the PID will be the responsibility of the field team leader and the Site Health & Safety Officer, and will be accomplished by following the procedures outlined in the operating manual for the instrument. At a minimum, field calibration and/or field equipment checking will be performed once daily, prior to use. Field calibration will be documented in the field notebook. Entries made into the logbook regarding the status of field equipment will include the following information: Date and time of calibration Type of equipment serviced and identification number (such as serial number) Reference standard used for calibration Calibration and/or maintenance procedure used Other pertinent information Equipment that fails calibration or becomes inoperable during use will be removed from service and segregated to prevent inadvertent utilization. The equipment will be properly tagged to indicate that it is out of calibration. Such equipment will be repaired and recalibrated to the manufacturer's specifications by qualified personnel. Equipment that cannot be repaired will be replaced. Off-site calibration and maintenance of field instruments will be conducted as appropriate throughout the duration of project activities. All field instrumentation, sampling equipment and accessories will be maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations and specifications and established field equipment practice. Off-site calibration and maintenance will be performed by qualified personnel. A logbook will be kept to document that established calibration and maintenance procedures have been followed. Documentation will include both scheduled and unscheduled maintenance. 5.3 Sample Collection 5.3.1 Groundwater Samples Groundwater sampling will be conducted using low-flow sampling procedures following USEPA guidance (\"Low Stress [low flow] Purging and Sampling Procedure for the Collection of Groundwater Samples from Monitoring Wells\", EQASOP-GW 004, January 19, 2017). During purging, field parameters should be measured, including: water level drawdown, purge rate, pH, specific conductance, temperature, dissolved oxygen, turbidity and oxidation-reduction-Quality Assurance Project Plan 514 Union Street, Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361305 NYSDEC BCP Site No. C224318November 2022 Page 12 of 27 potential (ORP), every five minutes using a water quality meter (Horiba U-52 or similar) and a depth-to-water interface probe that should be decontaminated between wells. Samples should generally not be collected until the field parameters have stabilized. Field parameters will be considered stable once three sets of measurements are within \u00b10.1 standard units for pH, \u00b13% for conductivity and temperature, \u00b110 millivolts for ORP, and \u00b110% for turbidity and dissolved oxygen. Purge rates should be adjusted to keep the drawdown in the well to less than 0.3 feet, as practical. Additionally, an attempt should be made to achieve a stable turbidity reading of less than 10 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) prior to sampling. If the turbidity reading does not stabilize at reading of less than 10 NTU for a given well, then both filtered and unfiltered samples should be collected from that well. If necessary, field filtration should be performed using a 0.45 micron disposable in-line filter. Groundwater samples should be collected after parameters have stabilized as noted above or the readings are within the precision of the meter. Deviations from the stabilization and drawdown criteria, if any, should be noted on the sampling logs. Samples should be collected directly into laboratory-supplied jars. After collection, all sample jars will be capped and securely tightened, and placed in iced coolers and maintained at 4\u00b0C \u00b12\u00b0C until they are transferred to the laboratory for analysis, in accordance with the procedures outlined in Section 5.4. Analysis and/or extraction and digestion of collected groundwater samples will meet the holding times required for each analyte as specified in Attachment C. In addition, analysis of collected groundwater sample will meet all quality assurance criteria set forth by this QAPP and DER-10. 5.3.2 Sample Field Blanks and Duplicates Field blanks will be collected for quality assurance purposes at a rate of one per 20 soil and groundwater investigation samples per analysis. For per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and 1,4-dioxane, field blanks will be collected at a frequency of one per day per matrix. Field blanks will be obtained by pouring laboratory-demonstrated analyte-free water on or through a decontaminated sampling device following use and implementation of decontamination protocols. The water will be collected off of the sampling device into a laboratory-provided sample container for analysis. Field blank samples will be analyzed for the complete list of analytes on the day of sampling. Field duplicate soil samples will be collected and analyzed for quality assurance purposes. Field duplicate samples will be collected at a frequency of 1 per 20 investigative soil samples per analysis and will be submitted to the laboratory as \"blind\" samples. If less than 20 samples are collected during a particular sampling event, one field duplicate sample will be collected. Quality Assurance Project Plan 514 Union Street, Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361305 NYSDEC BCP Site No. C224318November 2022 Page 13 of 27 5.4 Sample Containers and Handling Certified, commercially clean sample containers will be obtained from the analytical laboratory. Sample bottle containers will be placed into plastic coolers by the laboratory. These coolers will be received by the field sampling team within 24 hours of their preparation in the laboratory. Possession of samples collected in the field will be traceable from the time of collection until they are analyzed by the analytical laboratory or are properly disposed. Chain-of-custody procedures, described in Section 5.9, will be followed to maintain and document sample possession. Samples will be packaged and shipped as described in Section 5.6. 5.5 Sample Preservation Sample preservation measures will be used in an attempt to prevent sample decomposition by contamination, degradation, biological transformation, chemical interactions and other factors during the time between sample collection and analysis. Preservation will commence at the time of sample collection and will continue until analyses are performed. Should chemical preservation be required, the analytical laboratory will add the preservatives to the appropriate sample containers before shipment to the office or field. Samples will be preserved according to the requirements of the specific analytical method selected, as shown in Attachment C. 5.6 Sample Shipment 5.6.1 Packaging Groundwater sample containers will be placed in plastic coolers. Ice in Ziploc\u00ae bags (or equivalent) will be placed around sample containers. Cushioning material will be added around the sample containers if necessary. Chains-of-custody and other paperwork will be placed in a Ziploc \u00ae bag (or equivalent) and placed inside the cooler. The cooler will be taped closed and custody seals will be affixed to one side of the cooler at a minimum. If the samples are being shipped by an express delivery company (e.g. FedEx) then laboratory address labels will be placed on top of the cooler. 5.6.2 Shipping Standard procedures to be followed for shipping environmental samples to the analytical laboratory are outlined below. All environmental samples will be transported to the laboratory by a laboratory-provided courier under the chain-of-custody protocols described in Section 5.10. Prior notice will be provided to the laboratory regarding when to expect shipped samples. If the number, type or date of shipment changes due to site constraints or program changes, the laboratory will be informed.Quality Assurance Project Plan 514 Union Street, Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361305 NYSDEC BCP Site No. C224318November 2022 Page 14 of 27 5.7 Decontamination Procedures Decontamination procedures will be used for non-dedicated sampling equipment. Decontamination of field personnel is discussed in the CHASP included in Appendix E of IRMWP No.2. Field sampling equipment that is to be reused will be decontaminated in the field in accordance with the following procedures: 1.Laboratory-grade glassware detergent and tap water scrub to remove visual contamination 2.Generous tap water rinse 3.Distilled/de-ionized water rinse 5.8 Residuals Management Debris (e.g., paper, plastic and disposable personal protective equipment) will be collected in plastic garbage bags and disposed of as non-hazardous industrial waste. Decontamination and fluids will be placed in UN/Department of Transportation (DOT) approved fluid drums with closed tops. All drums will be properly labeled, sealed, and characterized as necessary. Waste characterization samples will be collected from groundwater proposed for disposal during implementation of the RAWP. Samples will be analyzed per disposal facility requirements. This activity will be coordinated and overseen by a representative of the RE. Samples will be representative of the material requiring disposal and will occur at a frequency consistent with disposal facility requirements. Waste characterization samples will be submitted to a NYSDOH ELAP-approved laboratory for analysis in accordance with the QAPP provided in Appendix G. Waste characterization samples will be analyzed for parameters that are typically required by disposal facilities. The following list is provided for planning purposes and may not reflect the analyses performed for waste characterization: Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) characteristics, including ignitability, corrosivity, and reactivity (sulfide and cyanide); Samples will be collected in accordance with the selected disposal facility's requirements and will be collected to be representative of the material requiring disposal at a frequency consistent with disposal facility requirements. It is anticipated that all drummed material will be transported off- site and disposed of at a permitted facility. Quality Assurance Project Plan 514 Union Street, Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361305 NYSDEC BCP Site No. C224318November 2022 Page 15 of 27 5.9 Chain of Custody Procedures A chain-of-custody protocol has been established for collected samples that will be followed during sample handling activities in both field and laboratory operations. The primary purpose of the chain-of-custody procedures is to document the possession of the samples from collection through shipping, storage and analysis to data reporting and disposal. Chain-of-custody refers to actual possession of the samples. Samples are considered to be in custody if they are within sight of the individual responsible for their security or locked in a secure location. Each person who takes possession of the samples, except the shipping courier, is responsible for sample integrity and safe keeping. Chain-of-custody procedures are provided below: Chain-of-custody will be initiated by the laboratory supplying the pre-cleaned and prepared sample containers. Chain-of-custody forms will accompany the sample containers. Following sample collection, the chain-of-custody form will be completed for the sample collected. The sample identification number, date and time of sample collection, analysis requested and other pertinent information (e.g., preservatives) will be recorded on the form. All entries will be made in waterproof, permanent blue or black ink. Langan field personnel will be responsible for the care and custody of the samples collected until the samples are transferred to another party, dispatched to the laboratory, or disposed. The sampling team leader will be responsible for enforcing chain-of-custody procedures during field work. When the form is full or when all samples have been collected that will fit in a single cooler, the sampling team leader will check the form for possible errors and sign the chain-of- custody form. Any necessary corrections will be made to the record with a single strike mark, dated, and initialed. When samples are collected, sample coolers will be accompanied by the chain-of-custody form, sealed in a Ziploc\u00ae bag (or equivalent) and placed on top of the samples or taped to the inside of the cooler lid. If applicable, a shipping bill will be completed for each cooler and the shipping bill number recorded on the chain-of-custody form. Samples will be packaged for shipment to the laboratory with the appropriate chain-of-custody form. A copy of the form will be retained by the sampling team for the project file and the original will be sent to the laboratory with the samples. Bills of lading will also be retained as part of the documentation for the chain-of-custody records, if applicable. When transferring custody of the samples, the individuals relinquishing and receiving custody of the samples will verify sample numbers and condition and will document the sample acquisition and transfer by signing and dating the chain-of-custody form. This process documents sample custody transfer from the Quality Assurance Project Plan 514 Union Street, Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361305 NYSDEC BCP Site No. C224318November 2022 Page 16 of 27 sampler to the analytical laboratory. A flow chart showing a sample custody process is included as Figure 5.1, and an example chain-of-custody form is included as Figure 5.2.Quality Assurance Project Plan 514 Union Street, Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361305 NYSDEC BCP Site No. C224318November 2022 Page 17 of 27 Figure 5.1 Sample Custody ** REQUIRES SIGN-OFF ON CHAIN-OF-CUSTODY FORMPREPARATION OF SAMPLE CONTAINERS SAMPLES COLLECTED BY SAMPLING TEAM SAMPLES LABELED SEALED IN INSULATED COOLER WITH ICE SHIPMENT TO LABORATORY** SAMPLE RECEIPT AT LAB ** CHECK SAMPLE INTEGRITY ** STORAGE IN SECURE AREACORRECTIVE ACTION IF REQUIRED CHECK OUT FOR ANALYSIS **RETURN TO STORAGE OR DISPOSALQuality Assurance Project Plan 514 Union Street, Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361305 NYSDEC BCP Site No. C224318November 2022 Page 18 of 27 Figure 5.2 Sample Chain-of-Custody Form Laboratory chain-of-custody will be maintained throughout the analytical processes as described in the laboratory's Quality Assurance Manual. The analytical laboratory will provide a copy of the chain-of-custody in the analytical data deliverable package. The chain-of-custody becomes the permanent record of sample handling and shipment. 5.10 Laboratory Sample Storage Procedures The subcontracted laboratory will use a laboratory information management system (LIMS) to track and schedule samples upon receipt by the analytical laboratories. Any sample anomalies identified during sample log-in must be evaluated on individual merit for the impact upon the results and the data quality objectives of the project. When irregularities do exist, the environmental consultant must be notified to discuss recommended courses of action and documentation of the issue must be included in the project file. For samples requiring thermal preservation, the temperature of each cooler will be immediately recorded. Each sample and container will be will be assigned a unique laboratory identification number and secured within the custody room walk-in coolers designated for new samples. Samples will be, as soon as practical, disbursed in a manner that is functional for the operational Quality Assurance Project Plan 514 Union Street, Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361305 NYSDEC BCP Site No. C224318November 2022 Page 19 of 27 team. The temperature of all coolers and freezers will be monitored and recorded using a certified temperature sensor. Any temperature excursions outside of acceptance criteria (i.e., below 2\u00b0C or above 6\u00b0C) will initiate an investigation to determine whether any samples may have been affected. Samples for VOCs will be maintained in satellite storage areas within the VOC laboratory. Following analysis, the laboratory's specific procedures for retention and disposal will be followed as specified in the laboratory's SOPs and/or QA manual.Quality Assurance Project Plan 514 Union Street, Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361305 NYSDEC BCP Site No. C224318November 2022 Page 20 of 27 6.0 DATA REDUCTION, VALIDATION, AND REPORTING 6.1 Introduction Data collected during the field investigation will be reduced and reviewed by the laboratory QA personnel, and a report on the findings will be tabulated in a standard format. The criteria used to identify and quantify the analytes will be those specified for the applicable methods in the USEPA SW-846 and subsequent updates. The data package provided by the laboratory will contain all items specified in the analytical methodology (Attachment C) appropriate for the analyses to be performed, and be reported in standard format. The completed copies of the Chain-of-custody records (both external and internal) accompanying each sample from time of initial bottle preparation to completion of analysis shall be attached to the analytical reports. 6.2 Data Reduction The ASP Category B data packages and an electronic data deliverable (EDD) will be provided by the laboratory after receipt of a complete sample delivery group. The Project Manager will immediately arrange for archiving the results and preparation of result tables. These tables will form the database for assessment of the site contamination condition. Each EDD deliverable must be formatted using a Microsoft Windows operating system and the NYSDEC data deliverable format for EQuISTM. To avoid transcription errors, data will be loaded directly into the ASCII format from the LIMS. If this cannot be accomplished, the consultant should be notified via letter of transmittal indicating that manual entry of data is required for a particular method of analysis. All EDDs must also undergo a QC check by the laboratory before delivery. The original data, tabulations, and electronic media are stored in a secure and retrievable fashion. The Project Manager or Task Manager will maintain close contact with the QA reviewer to ensure all non-conformance issues are acted upon prior to data manipulation and assessment routines. Once the QA review has been completed, the Project Manager may direct the Team Leaders or others to initiate and finalize the analytical data assessment. 6.3 Data Validation Data validation will be performed in accordance with the USEPA Region 2 SOPs for data validation and USEPA's National Functional Guidelines for Organic and Inorganic Data Review. Samples collected to characterize material proposed for export and import will not be validated. Tier 1 data validation (the equivalent of USEPA's Stage 2A validation) will be performed to evaluate data quality. Tier 1 data validation is based on completeness and compliance checks of sample-related QC results, including:Quality Assurance Project Plan 514 Union Street, Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361305 NYSDEC BCP Site No. C224318November 2022 Page 21 of 27 Holding times; Sample preservation; Blank results (method, trip, and field blanks); Surrogate recovery compounds and extracted internal standards (as applicable); LCS and LCSD recoveries and RPDs; Laboratory duplicate RPDs; and A DUSR will be prepared by the data validator and reviewed by the Quality Assurance Officer (QAO) before issuance. The DUSR will present the results of data validation, including a summary assessment of laboratory data packages, sample preservation and chain-of-custody procedures, and a summary assessment of precision, accuracy, representativeness, comparability, and completeness for each analytical method. Based on the results of data validation, the validated analytical results reported by the laboratory will be assigned one of the following usability flags: \"U\" - Not detected. The associated number indicates the approximate sample concentration necessary to be detected significantly greater than the level of the highest associated blank; \"UJ\" - Not detected. Quantitation limit may be inaccurate or imprecise; \"J\" - Analyte is present. Reported value may be associated with a higher level of uncertainty than is normally expected with the analytical method \"R\" - Unreliable result; data is rejected or unusable. Analyte may or may not be present in the sample; and No Flag - Result accepted without qualification. 6.4 Reporting Upon receipt of validated analytical results, NYSDEC format EDDs, compatible with EQuISTM, will be prepared and submitted to the NYSDEC.Quality Assurance Project Plan 514 Union Street, Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361305 NYSDEC BCP Site No. C224318November 2022 Page 22 of 27 7.0 QUALITY ASSURANCE, PERFORMANCE, AND SYSTEM AUDITS 7.1 Introduction Quality assurance audits may be performed by the project quality assurance group under the direction and approval of the QAO. These audits will be implemented to evaluate the capability and performance of project and subcontractor personnel, items, activities, and documentation of the measurement system(s). Functioning as an independent body and reporting directly to corporate quality assurance management, the QAO may plan, schedule, and approve system and performance audits based upon procedures customized to the project requirements. At times, the QAO may request additional personnel with specific expertise from company and/or project groups to assist in conducting performance audits. However, these personnel will not have responsibility for the project work associated with the performance audit. 7.2 System Audits System audits may be performed by the QAO or designated auditors, and encompass a qualitative evaluation of measurement system components to ascertain their appropriate selection and application. In addition, field and laboratory quality control procedures and associated documentation may be system audited. These audits may be performed once during the performance of the project. However, if conditions adverse to quality are detected or if the Project Manager requests, additional audits may occur. 7.3 Performance Audits The laboratory may be required to conduct an analysis of Performance Evaluation samples or provide proof that Performance Evaluation samples submitted by USEPA or a state agency have been analyzed within the past twelve months. 7.4 Formal Audits Formal audits refer to any system or performance audit that is documented and implemented by the QA group. These audits encompass documented activities performed by qualified lead auditors to a written procedure or checklists to objectively verify that quality assurance requirements have been developed, documented, and instituted in accordance with contractual and project criteria. Formal audits may be performed on project and subcontractor work at various locations. Audit reports will be written by auditors who have performed the site audit after gathering and evaluating all data. Items, activities, and documents determined by lead auditors to be in noncompliance shall be identified at exit interviews conducted with the involved management. Non-compliances will be logged, and documented through audit findings, which are attached to Quality Assurance Project Plan 514 Union Street, Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361305 NYSDEC BCP Site No. C224318November 2022 Page 23 of 27 and are a part of the integral audit report. These audit-finding forms are directed to management to satisfactorily resolve the noncompliance in a specified and timely manner. The Project Manager has overall responsibility to ensure that all corrective actions necessary to resolve audit findings are acted upon promptly and satisfactorily. Audit reports must be submitted to the Project Manager within fifteen days of completion of the audit. Serious deficiencies will be reported to the Project Manager within 24 hours. All audit checklists, audit reports, audit findings, and acceptable resolutions are approved by the QAO prior to issue. Verification of acceptable resolutions may be determined by re-audit or documented surveillance of the item or activity. Upon verification acceptance, the QAO will close out the audit report and findings.Quality Assurance Project Plan 514 Union Street, Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361305 NYSDEC BCP Site No. C224318November 2022 Page 24 of 27 8.0 CORRECTIVE ACTION 8.1 Introduction The following procedures have been established to ensure that conditions adverse to quality, such as malfunctions, deficiencies, deviations, and errors, are promptly investigated, documented, evaluated, and corrected. 8.2 Procedure Description When a significant condition adverse to quality is noted at site, laboratory, or subcontractor location, the cause of the condition will be determined and corrective action will be taken to preclude repetition. Condition identification, cause, reference documents, and corrective action planned to be taken will be documented and reported to the QAO, Project Manager, Field Team Leader and involved contractor management, at a minimum. Implementation of corrective action is verified by documented follow-up action. All project personnel have the responsibility, as part of the normal work duties, to promptly identify, solicit approved correction, and report conditions adverse to quality. Corrective actions will be initiated as follows: When predetermined acceptance standards are not attained; When procedure or data compiled are determined to be deficient; When equipment or instrumentation is found to be faulty; When samples and analytical test results are not clearly traceable; When quality assurance requirements have been violated; When designated approvals have been circumvented; As a result of system and performance audits; As a result of a management assessment; As a result of laboratory/field comparison studies; and As required by USEPA SW-846, and subsequent updates, or by the NYSDEC ASP. Project management and staff, such as field investigation teams, remedial response planning personnel, and laboratory groups, monitor on-going work performance in the normal course of daily responsibilities. Work may be audited at the sites, laboratories, or contractor locations. Quality Assurance Project Plan 514 Union Street, Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361305 NYSDEC BCP Site No. C224318November 2022 Page 25 of 27 Activities, or documents ascertained to be noncompliant with quality assurance requirements will be documented. Corrective actions will be mandated through audit finding sheets attached to the audit report. Audit findings are logged, maintained, and controlled by the Task Manager. Personnel assigned to quality assurance functions will have the responsibility to issue and control Corrective Action Request (CAR) Forms (Figure 9.1 or similar). The CAR identifies the out-of- compliance condition, reference document(s), and recommended corrective action(s) to be administered. The CAR is issued to the personnel responsible for the affected item or activity. A copy is also submitted to the Project Manager. The individual to whom the CAR is addressed returns the requested response promptly to the QA personnel, affixing his/her signature and date to the corrective action block, after stating the cause of the conditions and corrective action to be taken. The QA personnel maintain the log for status of CARs, confirms the adequacy of the intended corrective action, and verifies its implementation. CARs will be retained in the project file for the records. Any project personnel may identify noncompliance issues; however, the designated QA personnel are responsible for documenting, numbering, logging, and verifying the close out action. The Project Manager will be responsible for ensuring that all recommended corrective actions are implemented, documented, and approved.Quality Assurance Project Plan 514 Union Street, Brooklyn, New York Langan Project No. 170361305 NYSDEC BCP Site No. C224318November 2022 Page 26 of 27 Figure 8.1 - Corrective Action Request CORRECTIVE ACTION REQUEST Number: __________________________ Date: ____________ TO: _________________________________________ You are hereby requested to take corrective actions indicated below and as otherwise determined by you to (a) resolve the noted condition and (b) to prevent it from recurring.

APPENDIX D COMMUNITY AIR MONITORING PLAN New York State Department of Health Generic Community Air Monitoring Plan A Community Air Monitoring Plan (CAMP) requires real -time monitoring for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and particulates (i.e., dust) at the downwind perimeter of each designated work area and when certain activities are in progress at contaminated site s. The CAMP is not intended for use in establishing action levels for worker respiratory protection. Rather, its intent is to provide a measure of protection for the downwind community (i.e., off -site receptors including residences and businesses and on-site workers not directly involved with the subject work activities) from potential airborne contaminant releases as a direct result of investigative and remedial work activities. The action levels specified herein require increased monitoring, corrective actions to abate emissions, and/or work shutdown. Additionally, the CAMP helps to confirm that work activities did not spread contamination off -site through the air. The generic CAMP presented below will be sufficient to cover many, if not most, sites. Specific requirements should be reviewed for each situation in consultation with NYSDOH to ensure proper applicability. In some cases, a separate site -specific CAMP or supplement may be required. Depending upon the nature of contamination, chemical spe cific monitoring with appropriately -sensitive methods may be required. Depending upon the proximity of potentially exposed individuals, more stringent monitoring or response levels than those presented below may be required. Special requirements will be necessary for work within 20 feet of potentially exposed individuals or structures and for indoor work with co -located residences or facilities. These requirements should be determined in consultation with NYSDOH. Reliance on the CAMP should not preclud e simple, common -sense measures to keep VOCs, dust, and odors at a minimum around the work areas. Community Air Monitoring Plan Depending upon the nature of known or potential contaminants at each site, real -time air monitoring for volatile organic com pounds (VOCs) and/or particulate levels at the perimeter of the exclusion zone or work area will be necessary. Most sites will involve VOC and particulate monitoring; sites known to be contaminated with heavy metals alone may only require particulate moni toring. If radiological contamination is a concern, additional monitoring requirements may be necessary per consultation with appropriate NYSDEC/NYSDOH staff. Continuous monitoring will be required for all ground intrusive activities and during the demolition of contaminated or potentially contaminated structures. Ground intrusive activities include, but are not limited to, soil/waste excavation and handling, test pitting or trenching, and the installation of soil borings or monitoring wells. Period ic monitoring for VOCs will be required during non -intrusive activities such as the collection of soil and sediment samples or the collection of groundwater samples from existing monitoring wells. \"Periodic\" monitoring during sample collection might reaso nably consist of taking a reading upon arrival at a sample location, monitoring while opening a well cap or overturning soil, monitoring during well baling/purging, and taking a reading prior to leaving a sample location. In some instances, depending upon the proximity of potentially exposed individuals, continuous monitoring may be required during sampling activities. Examples of such situations include groundwater sampling at wells on the curb of a busy urban street, in the midst of a public park, or ad jacent to a school or residence. VOC Monitoring, Response Levels, and Actions Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) must be monitored at the downwind perimeter of the immediate work area (i.e., the exclusion zone) on a continuous bases or as otherwise speci fied. Upwind concentrations should be measured at the start of each workday and periodically thereafter to establish background conditions. The monitoring work should be performed using equipment appropriate to measure the types of contaminants known or suspected to be present. The equipment should be calibrated at least daily for the contaminant(s) of concern or for an appropriate surrogate. The equipment should be capable of calculating 15 -minute running average concentrations, which will be compared to the levels specified below. If the ambient air concentration of total organic vapors at the downwind perimeter of the work area or exclusion zone exceeds 5 parts per million (ppm) above background for the 15 -minute average, work activities must be temp orarily halted and monitoring continued. If the total organic vapor level readily decreases (per instantaneous readings) below 5 ppm over background, work activities can resume with continued monitoring. If total organic vapor levels at the downwind perimeter of the work area or exclusion zone persist at levels in excess of 5 ppm over background but less than 25 ppm, work activities must be halted, the source of vapors identified, corrective actions taken to abate emissions, and monitoring continued. After these steps, work activities can resume provided that the total organic vapor level 200 feet downwind of the exclusion zone or half the distance to the nearest potential receptor or residential/commercia l structure, whichever is less - but in no case less than 20 feet, is below 5 ppm over background for the 15 -minute average. If the organic vapor level is above 25 ppm at the perimeter of the work area , activities must be shutdown. All 15 -minute readi ngs must be recorded and available for State (DEC and DOH) personnel to review. Instantaneous readings, if any, used for decision purposes should also be recorded. Particulate Monitoring, Response Levels, and Actions Particulate concentrations should be monitored continuously at the upwind and downwind perimeters of the exclusion zone at temporary particulate monitoring stations. The particulate monitoring should be performed using real -time monitoring equipment capab le of measuring particulate matter less than 10 micrometers in size (PM -10) and capable of integrating over a period of 15 minutes (or less) for comparison to the airborne particulate action level. The equipment must be equipped with an audible alarm to i ndicate exceedance of the action level. In addition, fugitive dust migration should be visually assessed during all work activities. If the downwind PM -10 particulate level is 100 micrograms per cubic meter (mcg/m3) greater than background (upwind perim eter) for the 15 -minute period or if airborne dust is observed leaving the work area, then dust suppression techniques must be employed. Work may continue with dust suppression techniques provided that downwind PM -10 particulate levels do not exceed 150 m cg/m3 above the upwind level and provided that no visible dust is migrating from the work area. If, after implementation of dust suppression techniques, downwind PM -10 particulate levels are greater than 150 mcg/m3 above the upwind level, work must be st opped and a re -evaluation of activities initiated. Work can resume provided that dust suppression measures and other controls are successful in reducing the downwind PM -10 particulate concentration to within 150 mcg/m3 of the upwind level and in preventin g visible dust migration. All readings must be recorded and be available for State (DEC and DOH) personnel to review. Special Requirements for Work Within 20 Feet of Potentially Exposed Individuals or Structures When work areas are within 20 feet of potentially exposed populations or occupied structures, the continuous monitoring locations for VOCs and particulates must reflect the nearest potentially exposed individuals and the location of ventilation system intakes for nearby structures. The use o f engineering controls such as vapor/dust barriers, temporary negative -pressure enclosures, or special ventilation devices should be considered to prevent exposures related to the work activities and to control dust and odors. Consideration should be give n to implementing the planned activities when potentially exposed populations are at a minimum, such as during weekends or evening hours in non -residential settings. If total VOC concentrations opposite the walls of occupied structures or next to intake v ents exceed 1 ppm, monitoring should occur within the occupied structure(s). Background readings in the occupied spaces must be taken prior to commencement of the planned work. Any unusual background readings should be discussed with NYSDOH prior to comm encement of the work. If total particulate concentrations opposite the walls of occupied structures or next to intake vents exceed 150 mcg/m3, work activities should be suspended until controls are implemented and are successful in reducing the total part iculate concentration to 150 mcg/m3 or less at the monitoring point. Depending upon the nature of contamination and remedial activities, other parameters (e.g., explosivity, oxygen, hydrogen sulfide, carbon monoxide) may also need to be monitored. Respo nse levels and actions should be pre -determined, as necessary, for each site. Special Requirements for Indoor Work with Co -Located Residences or Facilities Unless a self -contained, negative -pressure enclosure with proper emission controls will encompass the work area, all individuals not directly involved with the planned work must be absent from the room in which the work will occur. Monitoring requirements shall be as stated above under \"Special Requirements for Work Within 20 Feet of Potentially Expo sed Individuals or Structures\" except that in this instance \"nearby/occupied structures\" would be adjacent occupied rooms. Additionally, the location of all exhaust vents in the room and their discharge points, as well as potential vapor pathways (opening s conduits, etc.) relative to adjoining rooms, should be understood and the monitoring locations established accordingly. In these situations, it is strongly recommended that exhaust fans or other engineering controls be used to create negative air pressu re within the work area during remedial activities. Additionally, it is strongly recommended that the planned work be implemented during hours (e.g. weekends or evenings) when building occupancy is at a minimum.

These tasks are to be completed by the contractor. 3.2 Radiation Hazards No radiation hazards are known or expected at the site. 3.3 Physical Hazards Physical hazards, which may be encountered during site operations for this project, are detailed in Table 1 . 3.3.1 Explosion No explosion hazards are expected for the scope of work at this site. 3.3.2 Heat Stress The use of Level C protective equipment, or g reater, may create heat stress. Monitoring of personnel wearing personal protective clothing should commence when the ambient temperature is 72 oF or above. Table 6 presents the suggested frequency for such monitoring. Monitoring frequency should increas e as ambient temperature increases or as slow recovery rates are observed. Refer to the Table 7 to assist in assessing when the risk for heat related illness is likely. To use this table, the ambient temperature and relative humidity must be obtained (a regional weather report should suffice). Heat stress monitoring should be performed by the HSO or the FTL, who must be able to recognize symptoms related to heat stress. To monitor the workers, be familiar with the following heat -related disorders and the ir symptoms: Heat Cramps : Painful spasm of arm, leg or abdominal muscles, during or after work Heat Exhaustion : Headache, nausea, dizziness ; cool, clammy, moist skin ; heavy sweating ; weak, fast pulse ; shallow respiration, normal temperature Heat Stroke : Headache, nausea, weakness, hot dry skin, fever, rapid strong pulse, rapid deep respirations, loss of consciousness, convulsions, coma. This is a life threatening condition . Do not permit a worker to wear a semi -permeable or impermeable garment when th ey are showing signs or symptoms of heat -related illness. Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 20 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 To monitor the worker, measure: Heart rate : Count the radial pulse during a 30 -second period as early as possible in the rest period. If the heart rate exceeds 100 beats per minute at the beginnin g of the rest period, shorten the next work cycle by one -third and keep the rest period the same. If the heart rate still exceeds 100 beats per minute at the next rest period, shorten the following work cycle by one -third. A worker cannot return to work after a rest period until their heart rate is below 100 beats per minute. Oral temperature : Use a clinical thermometer (3 minutes under the tongue) or similar device to measure the oral temperature at the end of the work period (before drinking). If oral temperature exceeds 99.6 oF (37.6 oC), shorten the next work cycle by one -third without changing the rest period. A worker cannot return to work after a rest period until their oral temperature is below 99.6 oF. If oral temperature still exceeds 99.6 oF (37 .6oC) at the beginning of the next rest period, shorten the following cycle by one -third. Do not permit a worker to wear a semi -permeable or impermeable garment when oral temperature exceeds 100.6 oF (38.1 oC). Prevention of Heat Stress - Proper training an d preventative measures will aid in averting loss of worker productivity and serious illness. Heat stress prevention is particularly important because once a person suffers from heat stroke or heat exhaustion, that person may be predisposed to additional heat related illness. To avoid heat stress the following steps should be taken: Adjust work schedules. Mandate work slowdowns as needed. Perform work during cooler hours of the day if possible or at night if adequate lighting can be provided. Provide shel ter (air -conditioned, if possible) or shaded areas to protect personnel during rest periods. Maintain worker's body fluids at normal levels. This is necessary to ensure that the cardiovascular system functions adequately. Daily fluid intake must approxim ately equal the amount of water lost in sweat, id., eight fluid ounces (0.23 liters) of water must be ingested for approximately every eight ounces (0.23 kilograms [ kg]) of weight lost. The normal thirst mechanism is not sensitive enough to ensure that en ough water will be drunk to replace lost sweat. When heavy sweating occurs, encourage the worker to drink more. The following strategies may be useful: o Maintain water temperature 50 o to 60 oF (10 o to 16.6 oC). o Provide small disposal cups that hold about fo ur ounces (0.1 liter). Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 21 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 o Have workers drink 16 ounces (0.5 liters) of fluid (preferably water or dilute drinks) before beginning work. o Urge workers to drink a cup or two every 15 to 20 minutes, or at each monitoring break. A total of 1 to 1.6 gallons (4 to 6 liters) of fluid per day are recommended, but more may be necessary to maintain body weight. o Train workers to recognize the symptoms of heat related illness. 3.3.3 Cold -Related Illness If work on this project begins in the winter months, thermal injury d ue to cold exposure can become a problem for field personnel. Systemic cold exposure is referred to as hypothermia. Local cold exposure is generally called frostbite. Hypothermia - Hypothermia is defined as a decrease in the patient core temperature below 96 oF. The body temperature is normally maintained by a combination of central (brain and spinal cord) and peripheral (skin and muscle) activity. Interference with any of these mechanisms can result in hypothermia, even in the absence of what normally i s considered a \"cold\" ambient temperature. Symptoms of hypothermia include: shivering, apathy, listlessness, sleepiness, and unconsciousness. Frostbite - Frostbite is both a general and medical term given to areas of local cold injury. Unlike systemic h ypothermia, frostbite rarely occurs unless the ambient temperatures are less than freezing and usually less than 20 oF. Symptoms of frostbite are: a sudden blanching or whitening of the skin; the skin has a waxy or white appearance and is firm to the touc h; tissues are cold, pale, and solid. Prevention of Cold-Related Illness - To prevent cold-related illness: Educate workers to recognize the symptoms of frostbite and hypothermia Identify and limit known risk factors: Assure the availability of enclosed, h eated environment on or adjacent to the site. Assure the availability of dry changes of clothing. Assure the availability of warm drinks. Start (oral) temperature recording at the job site: At the FSO or Field Team Leader's discretion when suspicion is bas ed on changes in a worker's performance or mental status. At a worker's request. As a screening measure, two times per shift, under unusually hazardous conditions (e.g., wind -chill less than 20 oF, or wind -chill less than 30 oF with precipitation). As a scre ening measure whenever anyone worker on the site develops hypothermia. Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 22 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 Any person developing moderate hypothermia (a core temperature of 92 oF) cannot return to work for 48 hours. 3.3.4 Noise Work activities during the proposed activities may be conducted a t locations with high noise levels from the operation of equipment. Hearing protection will be used as necessary. 3.3.5 Hand and Power Tools The use of hand and power tools can present a variety of hazards, including physical harm from being struck by fly ing objects, being cut or struck by the tool, fire, and electrocution. All hand and power tools should be inspected for health and safety hazards prior to use. If deemed unserviceable/un -operable, notify supervisor and tag equipment out of service. Grou nd Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCIs) are required for all power tools requiring direct electrical service. 3.3.6 Slips, Trips and Fall Hazards Care should be exercised when walking at the site, especially when carrying equipment. The presence of surface debris, uneven surfaces, pits, facility equipment, and soil piles contribute to tripping hazards and fall hazards. To the extent possible, all hazards should be identified and marked on the site, with hazards communicated to all workers in the area. 3.3.7 Utilities (Electrocution and Fire Hazards) 3.3.7.1 Utility Clearance The possibility of encountering underground utilities poses fire, explosion, and electrocution hazards. All excavation work will be preceded by review of available utility drawings and by notification of the subsurface work to the N.Y. One -Call--Center. 3.3.7.2 Lockout -Tagout The potential adverse effects of electrical hazards include burns, arc flashes and electrocution, which could result in serious injury to include death. Therefo re, there is a procedure that establishes the requirements for the lockout/tagout (LOTO) of energy isolating devices in accordance with the OSHA electrical lockout and tagging requirements as specified in 29CFR1910.147 and 29 CFR 1926.417. This procedure will be used to ensure that all machines and equipment are isolated from potentially hazardous energy. If possible, equipment that could cause injury due to unexpected energizing, start -up, or release of stored energy will be locked/tagged, before field p ersonnel perform work activities. Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 23 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 The facility owner/operator/representative is to be the authorized person that will initiate and perform the LOTO in accordance with applicable rules and practices. Inerting of electrical power sources is to be completed by an authorized and licensed electrician. Langan personnel will follow LOTO protocols and practices including adding a separate lock/signature to the LOTO chain in accordance with said protocols and practices. SPECIAL NOTE: Project personnel will assum e that all electrical equipment at surface, subsurface and overhead locations is energized, until equipment has been designated and confirmed as de -energized by a utility company representative. Langan will notify the designated utility representative pri or to working adjacent to this equipment and will verify that the equipment is energized or de -energized in the vicinity of the work location. No project work shall be performed by Langan personnel or subcontractors near energized electrical lines or equipment. The FTL shall accompany the designated facility owner/operator/representative or authorized/licensed electrician in conducting a survey to locate and identify all energy isolating devices. Langan will note which switches, valves or other isolating devices are used for inerting the equipment and how they are set assuring LOTO. The lockout/tagout procedure involves, but is not limited to, electricity, motors, steam, natural gas, compressed air, hydraulic systems, digesters, sewers, etc. 3.3.8 Physi cal Hazard Considerations for Material Handling There are moderate to severe risks associated with moving heavy objects at the Site. The following physical hazards should be considered when handling materials at the Site: Heavy objects will be lifted and moved by mechanical devices rather than manual effort whenever possible. The mechanical devices will be appropriate for the lifting of moving task and will be operated only by trained and authorized personnel. Objects that require special handling or riggi ng will only be moved under the guidance of a person who has been specifically trained to move such objects. Lifting devices will be inspected, certified, and labeled to confirm their weight capacities. Defective equipment will be taken out of service imm ediately and repaired or destroyed. The wheels of any trucks being loaded or unloaded will be chocked to prevent movement. Outriggers will be fully extended on a flat, firm surface during operation. Personnel will not pass under a raised load, nor will a suspended load be left unattended. Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 24 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 Personnel will not be carried on lifting equipment, unless it is specifically designed to carry passengers. All reciprocating, rotating, or other moving parts will be guarded at all times. Accessible fire extinguishers, currently (monthly) inspected, will be available in all mechanical lifting devices. Verify all loads/materials are secure before transportation. Material handling tasks that are unusual or require specific guidance will need a written addendum to this CHAS P. The addendum must identify the lifting protocols before the tasks are performed. Upon approval, the plan must be reviewed with all affected employees and documented. Any deviation from a written plan will require approval by the Langan HSM. 3.3.9 Hearing Conservation Under the construction industry standard, the maximum permissible occupational noise exposure is 90 A-weighted decibles ( dbA) (8-hour TWA), and noise levels in excess of 90 dbA must be reduced through feasible administrative and engineeri ng controls. (20 CFR 1926.52). Hearing protection is required when working within 15 feet of vacuum extraction equipment and drill rigs. 3.3.10 Open Water Employees working over or near water, where the danger of drowning exists, must be provided with U .S. Coast Guard -approved life jackets or buoyant work vests. Prior to and after each use, the buoyant work vests or life preservers must be inspected for defects which would alter their strength or buoyancy. Defective units must not be used. And should a worker fall into the water, OSHA requires (29 CFR 1926.106(c)) that ring buoys with at least 90 feet of line must be provided and readily available for emergency rescue operations. The distance between ring buoys must not exceed 200 feet. Another remedi al action required by OSHA (29 CFR 1926.106(d)) is the use of lifesaving skiffs. OSHA requires that at least one lifesaving skiff must be immediately available at locations where employees are working over or adjacent to water and must include the followi ng provisions. The skiff must be in the water or capable of being quickly launched by one person. At least one person must be present and specifically designated to respond to water emergencies and operate the skiff at all times when there are employees above water. When the operator is on break another operator must be designated to provide requisite coverage when there are employees above water. The designated operator must either have the skiff staffed at all times or have someone remain in the immed iate area such that the operator can quickly reach the skiff and Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 25 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 perform rescue services. The skiff operator maybe assigned other tasks provided the tasks do not interfere with the operator's ability to quickly reach the skiff. A communication system, su ch as a walkie -talkie, must be used to inform the skiff operator of an emergency and to inform the skiff operator where the skiff is needed. The skiff must be equipped with both a motor and oars. With regard to the number of skiffs required and the appro priate maximum response time, the following factors must be evaluated: The number of work locations where there is a danger of falling into water; The distance to each of those locations; Water temperature and currents; Other hazards such as, but not l imited to, rapids, dams, and water intakes; Other regulations that present H&S practices and PPE for work on or near water include: 29 CFR 1910, Subpart T (401 - 440) 3.4 Biological Hazards 3.4.1 Animals There is a possibility of encountering wildlife in cluding reptiles, rodents and other small and medium size mammals. The Langan personnel is to avoid interacting with any wildlife. 3.4.2 Insects Ticks and other biting or stinging insects may to be encountered during site operations. Langan personnel sho uld take necessary precautions including donning long sleeve shirts and insecticide to prevent bites and stings. After field work, Langan personnel should perform a complete visual inspection of their clothing to insure they are not inadvertently harborin g ticks. If they do observe a tick bite, they are to contact the HSM or HSO and report the event. 3.4.3 Plants Poisonous plants may to be encountered during site operations. Langan personnel should take necessary precautions including donning long sleeve shirts and applying preventative poison Ivy/Sumac lotion to prevent or limit effects of exposure. If after field work, Langan employees do observe a reaction to poisonous plant exposure, they are to contact the HSM or HSO and report the event. Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 26 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 3.5 Additi onal Safety Analysis 3.5.1 Presence of Non -Aqueous Phase Liquids (NAPL) Special care and PPE should be considered when NAPL is observed as NAPL is a typically flammable fluid and releases VOCs known to be toxic and/or carcinogenic . If NAPL is present in a monitoring well, vapors from the well casing may contaminate the work area breathing zone with concentrations of VOCs potentially exceed ing health and safety action levels. In addition, all equipment used to monitor or sample NAPL (or ground water from w ells containing NAPL) must be intrinsically safe. Equipment that directly contacts NAPL must also be resistant to organic solvents. At a minimum, a PID should be used to monitor for VOCs when NAPL is observed. If NAPL is expected to be observed in an e xcavation or enclosed area, air monitoring must be started using calibrated air monitoring equipment designed to sound an audio alarm when atmospheric concentrations of VOC are within 10% of the LEL. In normal atmospheric oxygen concentrations, the LEL mo nitoring may be done with a Wheatstone bridge/catalytic bead type sensor (i.e. MultiRAE). However in oxygen depleted atmospheres (confined space), only an LEL designed to work in low oxygen environments may be used. Best practices require that the LEL mo nitoring unit be equipped with a long sniffer tube to allow the LEL unit to remain outside the UST excavation. When NAPL is present, Langan personnel are required to use disposable nitrile gloves at all times to prevent skin contact with contaminated mat erials. They should also consider having available a respirator and protective clothing (Tyvek\u00ae overalls), especially if NAPL is in abundance and there are high concentrations of VOCs. All contaminated disposables including PPE and sampling equipment must be properly disposed of in labeled 55 -gallon drums 3.6 Job Safety Analysis A Job Safety A nalysis (JSA) is a process to identify existing and potential hazards associated with each job or task so these hazards can be elimin ated, controlled or minimized. A JSA will be performed at the beginning of each work day, and additionally whenever an employee begins a new task or moves to a new location. All JSA s must be developed and reviewed by all parties involved. A blank JSA form and documentation of completed JSAs are in Attachment G. Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 27 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 4.0 PERSONNEL TRAINING 4.1 Basic Training Completion of an initial 40 -hour HAZWOPER training program as detailed in OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.120(e) is required for all employees working on a site engaged in hazardous substance removal or o ther activities which expose or potentially expose workers to hazardous substances, health hazards , or safety hazards as defined by 29 CFR 1910.120(a). Annual 8-hour refresher training is also required to maintain competencies to ensure a safe work enviro nment. In addition to these training requirements, all employees must complete the OSHA 10 hour Construction Safety and Health training and supervisory personnel must also receive eight additional hours of specialized management training. Training record s are maintained by the HSM . 4.2 Initial Site-Specific Training Training will be provided to specifically address the activities, procedures, m onitoring, and equipment for site operations at the beginning of each field mobilization and the beginning of each discrete phase of work . The training will include the site and facility layout, hazards, and emergency services at the site, and will detail all the provisions contained within this CHASP . For a HAZWOPER operation, training on the site must be for a mi nimum of 3 days. Specific issues that will be addressed include the hazards described in Section 3.0. 4.3 Tailgate Safety Briefings Before starting work each da y or as needed , the Langan HS O will conduct a brief t ailgate safety meeting to assist site pers onnel in conducting their activities safely. Tailgate meetings will be documented in Attachment H. Briefings will include the following: Work plan for the day ; Review of safety information relevant to planned tasks and environmental conditions ; New activ ities/task being conducted; Results of Jobsite Safety Inspection Checklist; Changes in work practices ; Safe work practices; and Discussion and remedies for noted or observed deficiencies. 5.0 MEDICAL SURVEILLANCE All personnel who will be performing field wor k involving potential exposure to toxic and hazardous substances (defined by 29 CFR 1910.120 (a)) will be required to have passed an initial Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 28 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 baseline medical examination, with follow -up medical exams thereafter, consistent with 29 CFR 1910.120(f). Medical evaluations will be performed by, or under the direction of, a physician board -certified in occupational medicine. Additionally, personnel who may be required to perform work while wearing a respirator must receive medical clearance as required under CFR 1 910.134(e), Respiratory Protection . Medical evaluations will be performed by, or under the direction of, a physician board -certified in occupational medicine. Results of medical evaluations are maintained by the HSM . 5.1 Mercury Monitoring Langan include s medical monitoring for mercury during the initial baseline and annual physical. 5.2 Coronavirus General Preventative Measures Field personnel must follow general proper hygiene measures while in the field including: Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Cover cough or sneeze with tissue, and throw in trash. Wash hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds after going to bathroom, before eating, after blowing nose, coughing or sneezing. Use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water ar e not available. Avoid physical contact with other people (e.g., no handshakes). Maintain a safe distance of at least 6 feet from other people (social distancing). Wear face coverings when around other worker to minimize spread of COVID -19. (May be require d in certain states or locations.) Construction Trailers Employees should avoid use of shared construction trailers or where employees cannot maintain a safe distance (minimum 6 feet) from other workers. If trailer use is needed, areas such as desks, ph ones, chairs and other common areas, should be cleaned and disinfected before and after use. Protocols should be developed to minimize trailer use to essential personal, restrict use from any workers who are ill or showing symptoms of being ill, use if fa ce coverings and ensure a safe distance of 6 feet can b e established between workers. Communication Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 29 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 Include Coronavirus topics and prevention topics in daily tailgate meetings to ensure Coronavirus awareness is communicated daily. Discussions can focus on general topics including: social distancing, prevention measures for field personnel, signs and symptoms and recent news on the Coronavirus. Site-specific topics should include minimizing face -to-face contact, disinfecting/sterilizing field equipment, us e of PPE to reduce exposure, site security , use of face coverings and other potential exposure issues/concerns. Sick/Ill Workers No Langan employee is permitted to be onsite when ill and/or showing potential symptoms of the Coronavirus. Symptoms of the Cor onavirus may appear 2 -14 days after exposure and can range from mild to severe. The most common symptoms include: fever, fatigue, dry cough, shortness of breath chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, or new loss of taste or smell. If an employee or subcontractor is observed being ill or exhibiting symptoms of Coronavirus, employees must immediately utilize their Stop Work Authority and contact their project man ager to address the situation. If an employee observes anothe r worker onsite exhibiting symptoms of Coronavirus, immediately utilize Stop Work Authority and notify their project manager and site construction manager or safety officer. Work should resume when the safety and health of Langan and subcontractors is ade quately addressed. 6.0 PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT 6.1 Levels of Protection Langan will provide PPE to Langan employees to protect them from the specific hazards they are likely to encounter on -site. Direct hired contractors will provide their employees wi th equivalent PPE to protect them from the specific hazards likely to be encountered on -site. Selection of the appropriate PPE must take into consideration: (1) identification of the hazards or suspected hazards; (2) potential exposure routes; and, (3) th e performance of the PPE construction (materials and seams) in providing a barrier to these hazards. Human exposure with contaminants found in the subsurface can occur through three primary routes: Inhalation of gases, vapors, dusts, or mists is a common r oute of exposure. Chemicals can enter and irritate the airways and the lungs. They can become deposited in the airways or can be absorbed through the lungs into the bloodstream. Direct contact of contaminants with the skin or eyes is a common route of exp osure. Some substances are absorbed through the skin and can enter the bloodstream. Broken, cut or cracked skin will allow substances to enter the body more easily. Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 30 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 Ingestion or swallowing of food, drink, or other substances is the third route of exposure . Chemicals that get in or on food, utensils, or hands can be ingested. Substances can be absorbed into the blood. Based on anticipated site conditions and the proposed work activities t o be performed at the site , Level D protection will be used . The u pgrading/downgrading of the level of protection will be based on continuous air monitoring results as described in Section 6 .0 (when applicable) . The decision to modify standard PPE will be made by the site HSO or FTL after conferring with the PM. The le vels of protection are described below. Level D Protection (as needed) Safety glasses w ith side shields or chemical splash goggles Safety boots/shoes Coveralls (Tyvek\u00ae or equivalent) Hard hat Long sleeve work shirt and work pants Nitrile gloves Hearing pro tection Reflective safety vest Level D Protection (Modified, as needed) Safety glasses with sideshields or chemical splash goggles Safety boots/shoes (toe -protected) Disposable chemical -resistant boot covers Coveralls (polycoated Tyvek or equivalent to be worn when contact with wet contaminated soil, groundwater, or non -aqueous phase liquids is anticipated) Hard hat Long sleeve work shirt and work pants Nitrile gloves Hearing protection (as needed) Personal floatation device (for work within 5 ft of the wat er) Reflective traffic vest Level C Protection (as needed) Full or Half face, air -purifying respirator , with NIOSH approved High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA ) filter Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 31 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 Inner (latex) and outer (nitrile) chemical -resistant glove s Safety glasses with side shields or chemical splash goggles Chemical -resistant safety boots/shoes Hard hat Long sleeve work shirt and work pants Coveralls (Tyvek\u00ae or equivalent) Hearing protection (as needed) Reflective safety vest The action levels used in determining the necessa ry levels of respiratory prote ction and upgrading to Level C are summarized in Table 4. The written Respiratory Protection Program is maintained by the HSM and is available if needed. The monitoring procedures and equ ipment are outlined in Section 6 .0 (when applicable) . 6.2 Respirator Fit -Test All Langan employees who may be exposed to hazardous substances at the work site are in possession of a full or half face-piece, air -purifying respirator and have been successfully fit-tested with in the past year. Fit-test records are maintained by the HSM . 6.3 Respirator Cartridge Change -Out Schedule Respiratory protection is required to be worn when certain action levels ( Table 2) are reached. A respirator cartridge change -out schedule has been developed in order to comply with 29 CFR 1910.134. The respirator cartridge change -out schedule for this project is as follows: Cartridges must be removed and disposed of at the end of each shift, when cartridges become wet or wearer experiences breakthrough, whichever occ urs first. If the humidity exceeds 85%, then cartridges must be removed and disposed of after 4 hours of use. Respirators must not be stored at the end of the shift with contaminated cartridges left on. Cartridges must not be worn on the second day, no ma tter how short the time period was the previous day they were used. 7.0 AIR QUALITY MONITORING AND ACTIONS LEVELS 7.1 Monitoring During Site Operations Atmospheric air monitoring results may be collected and used to provide data to determine when exclusion zon es need to be established and when certain levels of personal protective equipment Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 32 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 are required. For all instruments there are Site -specific action level criteria which are used in making field health and safety determinations. Other data, such as the vi sible presence of contamination or the steady state nature of air contaminant concentration, are also used in making field health and safety decisions. Therefore, the HSO may establish an exclusion zone or require a person to wear a respirator even though atmospheric air contaminant concentrations are below established CHASP action levels. During site work involving disturbance of petroleum -impacted or fill material, real time air monitoring may be conducted for methane and VOCs. A MultiRae LEL/Oxygen (O2) meter and FID will be used to monitor the LEL of methane, and a PID and/or FID will be used to monitor concentrations of VOCs at personnel breathing -zone height. Air monitoring will be the responsibility of the HSO or designee. Air monitoring may be co nducted during intrusive activities associated with the completion of excavation, debris removal, and soil grading. All manufacturers' instructions for instrumentation and calibration will be available onsite. Subcontractors' air monitoring plans must be equal or more stringent as the Langan plan. An air monitoring calibration log is provided in Attachment D of this CHASP . 7.1.1 Volatile Organic Compounds Monitoring with a PID, such as a MiniRAE 2000 (10.6v) or equivalent may occur during intrusive work in the Areas of Concern ( AOCs ). Colorimetric Indicator Tubes for benzene may be used as backup for the PID, if measurements remain above background monitor every 2 hours. The HSO will monitor the employee breathing zone at least every 30 minutes, or w henever there is any indication that concentrations may have changed (odors, visible gases, etc.) since the last measurement. If VOC levels are observed above 5 ppm for longer than 5 minutes or if the site PPE is upgraded to Level C, the HSO will begin mo nitoring the site perimeter at a location downwind of the AOC every 30 minutes in addition to the employee breathing zone. Instrument action levels for monitored gases are provided in Table 4. 7.1.2 Metals Based upon the site historical fill, there is a p otential for the soils to contain Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) and metals. During invasive procedures which have the potential for creating airborne dust, such as excavation of dry soils, a real time airborne dust monitor such as a Mini -Ram may be used to monitor for air particulates. The HSO will monitor the employee breathing zone at least every 30 minutes, or whenever there is any indication that concentrations may have changed (appearance of visible dust) since the last measurement. If dus t levels are observed to be greater than 0.100 milligrams per cubic meter ( mg/m3) or visible dust is observed for longer than 15 minutes or if the site PPE is upgraded to Level C, the HSO will begin monitoring Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 33 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 the site perimeter at a location downwind of t he AOC every 30 minutes in addition to the employee breathing zone. Instrument action levels for dust monitoring are provided in Table 4. 7.1.3 Methane During soil excavation or other intrusive activities, direct reading air monitoring will be performed in the excavation area to determine exposure to workers. Monitoring with a LEL/O2 meter and FID may occur during intrusive work in the AOCs. The HSO will monitor the employee breathing zone at least hourly during intrusive activities. If LEL levels are obse rved above 2 0% the professional engineer (PE) or their designee will stop work and evacuate the area; warn others; and determine source of readings and take corrective actions. The Contractor will be responsible for mitigating explosive gas levels. 7.2 Mon itoring Equipment Calibration and Maintenance Instrument calibration must be documented and included in a dedicated safety and health logbook or on separate calibration pages of the field book. All instruments must be calibrated before and after each shif t. Calibration checks may be used during the day to confirm instrument accuracy. Duplicate readings may be taken to confirm individual instrument response. All instruments must be operated in accordance with the manufacturers' specifications. Manufacture rs' literature, including an operations manual for each piece of monitoring equipment will be maintained on site by the HSO for reference. 7.3 Determination of Background Levels Backg round (BKD) levels for VOCs, dust, and methane will be established prior to intrusive activities within the AOC at an upwind location. A notation of BKD levels will be referenced in the daily monitoring log. BKD levels are a function of prevailing conditions. BKD levels will be taken in an appropriate upwind location as dete rmined by the HSO. Table 4 lists the instrument action levels. 8.0 COMMUNITY AIR MONITORING PROGRAM Community air monitoring may be cond ucted in compliance with local standards . If conducted, Langan will implemented the generic CAMP outlined below amended to be in co mpliance with local conditions or standards: Monitoring for dust and odors will be conducted during all ground intrusive activities by the FTL. Continuous monitoring on the perimeter of the work zones for odor, VOCs, and dust may be required for all ground intrusive activities such as soil excavation and handling activities. The Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 34 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 work zone is defined as the general area in which machinery is operating in support of remediation activities. A portable PID will be used to monitor the work zone and f or periodic monitoring for VOCs during activities such as soil and groundwater sampling and .soil excavation . The site perimeter will be monitored for fugitive dust emissions by visual observations as well as instrumentation measurements (if required) . When required, p articulate or dust will be monitored continuously with real -time field instrumentation that will meet, at a minimum, the local standards or, default to the performance standards below: If VOC monitoring is required, t he following actions wil l be taken based on VOC levels measured: If total VOC levels exceed 5 ppm above background for the 15 -minute average at the perimeter, work activities will be temporarily halted and monitoring continued. If levels readily decrease (per instantaneous rea dings) below 5 ppm above background, work activities will resume with continued monitoring. If total VOC levels at the downwind perimeter of the hot zone persist at levels in excess of 5 ppm above background but less than 25 ppm, work activities will be halted, the source of vapors identified, corrective actions taken to abate emissions, and monitoring continued. After these steps work activities will resume provided that the total organic vapor level 200 feet downwind of the hot zone or half the distanc e to the nearest potential receptor or residential/commercial structure, whichever is less - but in no case less than 20 feet, is below 5 ppm above background for the 15 -minute average. If the total VOC level is above 25 ppm at the perimeter of the hot zo ne, activities will be shut down. If dust monitoring with field instrumentation is required, t he following actions will be taken based on instrumentation measurements : If the downwind particulate level is 100 micrograms per cubic meter (\u00b5g/m\u00b3) greater th an background (upwind perimeter) for the 15 -minute period or if airborne dust is observed leaving the work area, then dust suppression must be employed. Work may continue with dust suppression techniques provided that downwind particulate matter less than 10 microns ( PM10 ) levels do not exceed 150 \u00b5g/m\u00b3 above the background level and provided that no visible dust is migrating from the work area. If, after implementation of dust suppression techniques, downwind PM10 levels are greater than 150 \u00b5g/m\u00b3 above t he background level, work must be stopped and a re - evaluation of activities initiated. Work can resume provided that dust suppression measures and other controls are successful in reducing the downwind PM10 concentration to within 150 \u00b5g/m\u00b3 of the upwind level and in preventing visible dust migration. Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 35 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 8.1 Dust Suppression Techniques Preventative measures for dust generation may include wetting site fill and soil, construction of an engineered construction entrance with gravel pad, a truck wash area, coveri ng soils with tarps, and limiting vehicle speeds to five miles per hour. Work practices to minimize odors and vapors include limiting the time that the excavations remain open, minimizing stockpiling of contaminated -source soil, and minimizing the handli ng of contaminated material. Offending odor and organic vapor controls may include the application of foam suppressants or tarps over the odor or VOC source areas. Foam suppressants may include biodegradable foams applied over the source material for sho rt-term control of the odor and VOCs. If odors develop and cannot be otherwise controlled, additional means to eliminate odor nuisances will include: direct load -out of soils to trucks for off -site disposal; use of chemical odorants in spray or misting sy stems; and, use of staff to monitor odors in surrounding neighborhoods. Where odor nuisances have developed during remedial work and cannot be corrected, or where the release of nuisance odors cannot otherwise be avoided due to on -site conditions or close proximity to sensitive receptors, odor control will be achieved by sheltering excavation and handling areas under tented containment structures equipped with appropriate air venting/filtering systems. 9.0 WORK ZONES AND DECONTAMINATION 9.1 Site Control Work zo nes are intended to control the potential spread of contamination throughout the site and to assure that only authorized individuals are permitted into potentially hazardous areas. Any person working in an area where the potential for exposure to site con taminants exists will only be allowed access after providing the HSO with proper training and medical documentation. Exclusion Zone (EZ) - All activities which may involve exposure to site contaminants, hazardous materials and/or conditions should be cons idered an EZ. Decontamination of field equipment will also be conducted in the Contaminant Reduction Zone (CRZ) which will be located on the perimeter of the EZ. The EZ and the CRZ will be clearly delineated by cones, tapes or other means. The HSO may est ablish more than one EZ where different levels of protection may be Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 36 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 employed or different hazards exist. The size of the EZ must be determined by the HSO allowing adequate space for the activity to be completed, field members and emergency equipment. 9.2 Contamination Zone 9.2.1 Personnel Decontamination Station Personal hygiene, coupled with diligent decontamination, will significantly reduce the potential for exposure. 9.2.2 Minimization of Contact with Contaminants During completion of all site activitie s, personnel should attempt to minimize the chance of contact with contaminated materials. This involves a conscientious effort to keep \"clean\" during site activities. All personnel should minimize kneeling, splash generation, and other physical contact with contamination as PPE is intended to minimize accidental contact. This may ultimately minimize the degree of decontamination required and the generation of waste materials from site operations. Field procedures will be developed to control over spray and runoff and to ensure that unprotected personnel working nearby are not affected. 9.2.3 Personnel Decontamination Sequence Decontamination may be performed by removing all PPE used in EZ and placing it in drums/trash cans at the CRZ. Baby wipes should be available for wiping hands and face. Drums/trash cans - will be labeled by the field crews in accordance with all local, state, and federal requirements. Management plans for contaminated PPE, and tools are provided below. 9.2.4 Emergency Decontamina tion If circumstances dictate that contaminated clothing cannot be readily removed, then remove gross contamination and wrap injured personnel with clean garments/blankets to avoid contaminating other personnel or transporting equipment. If the injured pe rson can be moved, he/she will be decontaminated by site personnel as described above before emergency responders handle the victim. If the person cannot be moved because of the extent of the injury (a back or neck injury), provisions must be made to ensu re that emergency response personnel will be able to respond to the victim without being exposed to potentially hazardous atmospheric conditions. If the potential for inhalation hazards exist, such as with open excavation, this area will be covered with p olyethylene sheeting to eliminate any potential inhalation hazards. All Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 37 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 emergency personnel are to be immediately informed of the injured person's condition, potential contaminants, and provided with all pertinent data. 9.2.5 Hand -Held Equipment Decontami nation Hand -held equipment includes all monitoring instruments as stated earlier, samples, hand tools, and notebooks. The hand -held equipment is dropped at the first decontamination station to be decontaminated by one of the decontamination team members. These items must be decontaminated or discarded as waste prior to removal from the CRZ. To aid in decontamination, monitoring instruments can be sealed in plastic bags or wrapped in polyethylene. This will also protect the instruments against contaminant s. The instruments will be wiped clean using wipes or paper towels if contamination is visually evident. Sampling equipment, hand tools, etc. will be cleaned with non -phosphorous soap to remove any potentially contaminated soil, and rinsed with deionized water. All decontamination fluids will be containerized and stored on -site pending waste characterization sampling and appropriate off -site disposal. 9.2.6 Heavy Equipment Decontamination All heavy equipment and vehicles arriving at the work site will be free from contamination from offsite sources. Any vehicles arriving to work that are suspected of being impacted will not be permitted on the work site. Potentially contaminated heavy equipment will not be permitted to leave the EZ unless it has been th oroughly decontaminated and visually inspected by the HSO or his designee. 9.3 Support Zone The support zone or cold zone will include the remaining areas of the job site. Break areas and support facilities (include equipment storage and maintenance area s) will be located in this zone. No equipment or personnel will be permitted to enter the cold zone from the hot zone without passing through the decontamination station in the warm zone (if necessitated). Eating, smoking, and drinking will be allowed on ly in this area. 9.4 Communications The following communications equipment will be utilized as appropriate. Telephones - A cellular telephone will be located with the HSO for communication with the HSM and emergency support services/facilities. Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 38 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 Hand Signal s - Hand signals must be used by field teams, along with the buddy system. The entire field team must know them before operations commence and their use covered during site -specific training. Typical hand signals are the following: Hand Signal Meaning Hand gripping throat Out of air; cannot breathe Grip partners wrists or place both hands around waist Leave immediately without debate Hands on top of head Need assistance Thumbs up OK; I'm alright; I understand Thumbs down No; negative Simulated \"stick\" break with fists Take a break; stop work 9.5 The Buddy System When working in teams of two or more, workers will use the \"buddy system\" for all work activities to ensure that rapid assistance can be provided in the event of an emergency. This requires w ork groups to be organized such that workers can remain close together and maintain visual contact with one another. Workers using the \"buddy system\" have the following responsibilities: Provide his/her partner with assistance . Observe his/her partner for signs of chemical or heat exposure . Periodically check the integrity of his/her partner's PPE . Notify the HSO or other site personnel if emergency service is needed . 10.0 NEAREST MEDICAL ASSISTANCE The address and telephone number of the nearest hospital: New York-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital 506 6th Street Brooklyn , New York 718-780-3000 Map with directions to the hospital are shown in Figure 2. This information will either be posted prominently at the site or will be available to all personnel all of the time. Further, all field personnel, including the HSO & FTL , will know the directions to the hospital. 11.0 STANDING ORDERS/SAFE WORK PRACTICES The standing orders, which consist of a description of safe work practices that must always be followed while on -site by Langan employees and contractor s, are shown in Attachment A.

Emergencies happen unexpectedly and quickly, and require an immediate response; therefore, contingency planning and advanced training of staff is essential. Specific elements of emergency support procedures that are addressed in the following subsections include communications, local emergency support units, and preparation for medical emergencies, first aid for injuries incurred on site, record keeping, and emergency site evacuation procedures. In case of emergency, in addition to 911 , call Incident Intervention\u00ae at 1-888-479-7787 to report their injuries. For all other communications, contact the Langan Incident Hotline at (800) 9 -LANGAN (800-952-6426) extension 4699 as soon as possible. Should outside assistance be needed for accidents, fire, or release of hazardous substances, the emergency numbers will be available and posted at the site (Table 5) where a readily accessible telephone is made available for emergency use. Also, in the event of an incident where a team member becomes exposed or suffers from an acute symptom from contact with site mater ials and has to be taken to a hospital, a short medical data sheet (Attachment C) for that individual will be made available to the attending physician. The medical data sheet will include the following: Name, address, home phone Age, height, weight Name of person to be notified in case of an accident Allergies Particular sensitivities Does he/she wear contact lenses Short checklist of previous illness Name of personal physician and phone Name of company physician and phone Prescription and non -prescriptio n medications currently used. A incident reporting form is included in Attachment C. Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 41 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 16.2 Responsibilities 16.2.1 Health and Safety Officer (HSO) The HSO is responsible for ensuring that all personnel are evacuated safely and that machinery and processes are shut down or stabilized in the event of a stop work order or evacuation. The HSO is responsible for ensuring the HSM are notified of all incidents, all injuries, near misses, fires, spills, releases or equipment damage. The HSO is required to immedi ately notify the HSM of any fatalities or catastrophes (three or more workers injured and hospitalized) so that the HSM can notify OSHA within the required time frame. 16.2.2 Emergency Coordinator The HSO or their designated alternate will serve as the Eme rgency Coordinator. The Emergency Coordinator is responsible for ensuring that all personnel are evacuated safely and that machinery and processes are shut down or stabilized in the event of a stop work order or evacuation. They are also responsible for ensuring the HSM are notified of all incidents, all injuries, near misses, fires, spills, releases or equipment damage. The Emergency Coordinator is required to immediately notify the HSM of any fatalities or catastrophes (three or more workers injured an d hospitalized. The Emergency Coordinator must locate emergency phone numbers and identify hospital routes prior to beginning work on the sites. The Emergency Coordinator must make necessary arrangements to be prepared for any emergencies that could occur . The Emergency Coordinator is responsible for implementing the Emergency Response Plan. 16.2.3 Site Personnel Project site personnel are responsible for knowing the Emergency Response Plan and the procedures contained herein. Personnel are expected to no tify the Emergency Coordinator of situations that could constitute a site emergency. Project site personnel, including all subcontractors will be trained in the Emergency Response Plan. 16.3 Communications Once an emergency situation has been stabilized, or as soon as practically, the injured Langan personnel should contact Incident Intervention\u00ae at 1-888-479-7787 to report their injuries. For all other communications, contact the Langan Incident Hotline at (800) 9 -LANGAN (800-952- 6426) extension 4699 as soon as possible. Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 42 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 16.4 Local Emergency Support Units In order to be able to deal with any emergency that might occur during investigative activities at the site, the Emergency Notification Numbers (Table 5) will be posted and provided to all personnel cond ucting work within the EZ. Figure 2 shows the hospital route map. Outside emergency number 911 and local ambulance should be relied on for response to medical emergencies and transport to emergency rooms. Always contact first responders when there are se rious or life threatening emergencies on the site. Project personnel are instructed not to drive injured personnel to the Hospital. In the event of an injury, provide first aid and keep the injured party calm and protected from the elements and treat for shock when necessary. 16.5 Pre-Emergency Planning Langan will communicate directly with administrative personnel from the emergency room at the hospital in order to determine whether the hospital has the facilities and personnel needed to treat cases of t rauma resulting from any of the contaminants expected to be found on the site. Instructions for finding the hospital will be posted conspicuously in the site office and in each site vehicle. 16.6 Emergency Medical Treatment The procedures and rules in th is CHASP are designed to prevent employee injury. However, should an injury occur, no matter how slight, it will be reported to the HSO immediately. First - aid equipment will be available on site at the following locations: First Aid Kit: Contractor Vehic les Emergency Eye Wash: Contractor Vehicles During the site safety briefing, project personnel will be informed of the location of the first aid station(s) that has been set up. Some injuries, such as severe cuts and lacerations or burns, may require imme diate treatment. Any first aid instructions that can be obtained from doctors or paramedics, before an emergency -response squad arrives at the site or before the injured person can be transported to the hospital, will be followed closely. 16.7 Personnel w ith current first aid and CPR certification will be identified. Only in non -emergency situations may an injured person be transported to an urgent care facility. Due to hazards that may be present at the site and the conditions under which operations are conducted, it is possible that an emergency situation may develop. Emergency situations can be Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 43 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 characterized as injury or acute chemical exposure to personnel, fire or explosion, environmental release, or hazardous weather conditions. 16.8 Emergency Site Evacuation Routes and Procedures All project personnel will be instructed on proper emergency response procedures and locations of emergency telephone numbers during the initial site safety meeting. If an emergency occurs as a result of the site investiga tion activities, including but not limited to fire, explosion or significant release of toxic gas into the atmosphere, the Langan Project Manager will be verbally notified immediately. All heavy equipment will be shut down and all personnel will evacuate the work areas and assemble at the nearest intersection to be accounted for and to receive further instructions. In the event that an emergency situation arises, the FTL will implement an immediate evacuation of all project personnel due to immediate or im pending danger. The FTL will also immediately communicate with the contractor to coordinate any needed evacuation of the property . The FTL or Site Supervisor will give necessary instructions until the Designated Incident Commander (IC) assumes control. After the emergency has been resolved, the FTL or Site Supervisor will coordinate with the IC and indicate when staff should resume their normal duties. If dangers are present for those at the designated assembly point, another designated location of asse mbly will be established. It will be the responsibility of the FTL or Site Supervisor to report a fire or emergency, assess the seriousness of the situation, and initiate emergency measures until the arrival of the local fire fighters or other first respon ders, should they be necessary. The FTL, working with emergency responders , may also order the closure of the Site for an indefinite period as long as it is deemed necessary. Under no circumstances will incoming visitors be allowed to proceed to the area of concern, once an emergency evacuation has been implemented. Visitors or other persons present in the area of the emergency must be instructed to evacuate the area. The FTL will ensure that access roads are not obstructed and will remain on -site to prov ide stand -by assistance upon arrival of emergency personnel. If it is necessary to temporarily control traffic in the event of an emergency, those persons controlling traffic will wear proper reflection warning vests until the arrival of police or fire personnel. Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 44 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 16.8.1 Designated Assembly Locations All personnel will evacuate the site and assemble at a designated assembly location. The assembly location will be designated by Langan personnel and discussed during each shift's pre - job safety briefing . 16.8.2 Accounting for Personnel All contractor and subcontractor supervisors are responsible for the accounting of all personnel assembled at the designed assembly area. The Designated Incident Commander must be notified if personnel are not found. 16.9 Fire Pr evention and Protection In the event of a fire or explosion, procedures will include immediately evacuating the site and notification of the Langan Project Manager of the investigation activities. Portable fire extinguishers will be provided at the work z one. The extinguishers located in the various locations should also be identified prior to the start of work. No personnel will fight a fire beyond the stage where it can be put out with a portable extinguisher (incipient stage). 16.9.1 Fire Prevention Fires will be prevented by adhering to the following precautions: Good housekeeping and storage of materials. Storage of flammable liquids and gases away from oxidizers. Shutting off engines to refuel. Grounding and bonding metal containers during transfer of flammable liquids. Use of UL approved flammable storage cans. Fire extinguishers rated at least 10 pounds ABC located on all heavy equipment, in all trailers and near all hot work activities. The person responsible for the control of fuel source hazard s and the maintenance of fire prevention and/or control equipment is the HSO. 16.10 Significant Vapor Release Based on the proposed tasks, the potential for a significant vapor release is low. However, if a release occurs, the following steps will be take n: Move all personnel to an upwind location. All non -essential personnel must evacuate. Upgrade to Level C Respiratory Protection. Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 45 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 Downwind perimeter locations must be monitored for volatile organics. If the release poses a potential threat to human health or the environment in the community, the Emergency Coordinator must notify the Langan Project Manager. Local emergency response coordinators will be notified. 16.11 Overt Chemical Exposure The following are standard procedures to treat chemical exposures. Other, specific procedures detailed on the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) will be followed, when necessary. SKIN AND EYE : Use copious amounts of soap and water from eye -wash kits and portable hand wash stations. CONTACT : Wash/rinse affected areas tho roughly, then provide appropriate medical attention. Skin must also be rinsed for 15 minutes if contact with caustics, acids or hydrogen peroxide occurs. Affected items of clothing must also be removed from contact with skin. Providing wash water and soap will be the responsibility of each individual contractor or subcontractor on -site. 16.12 Decontamination during Medical Emergencies If emergency life -saving first aid and/or medical treatment is required, normal decontamination procedures may need to b e abbreviated or omitted. The HSO or designee will accompany contaminated victims to the medical facility to advice on matters involving decontamination when necessary. The outer garments can be removed if they do not cause delays, interfere with treatme nt or aggravate the problem. Respiratory equipment must always be removed. Protective clothing can be cut away. If the outer contaminated garments cannot be safely removed on site, a plastic barrier placed between the injured individual and clean surface s should be used to help prevent contamination of the inside of ambulances and/or medical personnel. Outer garments may then be removed at the medical facility. No attempt will be made to wash or rinse the victim if his/her injuries are life threatening, unless it is known that the individual has been contaminated with an extremely toxic or corrosive material which could also cause severe injury or loss of life to emergency response personnel. For minor medical problems or injuries, the normal decontamin ation procedures will be followed. 16.13 Adverse Weather Conditions In the event of adverse weather conditions, the HSO will determine if work will continue without potentially risking the safety of all field workers. Some of the items to be considered pr ior to determining if work should continue are: Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 46 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 Potential for heat stress and heat -related injuries. Potential for cold stress and cold -related injuries. Treacherous weather -related working conditions (hail, rain, snow, ice, high winds). Limited visibility (fog). Potential for electrical storms. Earthquakes. Other major incidents. Site activities will be limited to daylight hours, or when suitable artificial light is provided, and acceptable weather conditions prevail. The HSO will determine the need to ce ase field operations or observe daily weather reports and evacuate, if necessary, in case of severe inclement weather conditions. 16.14 Spill Control and Response All small spills/environmental releases must be contained as close to the source as possible. Whenever possible, the MSDS will be consulted to assist in determining proper waste characterization and the best means of containment and cleanup. For small spills, sorbent materials such as sand, sawdust or commercial sorbents should be placed directl y on the substance to contain the spill and aid recovery. Any acid spills should be diluted or neutralized carefully prior to attempting recovery. Berms of earthen or sorbent materials can be used to contain the leading edge of the spills. All spill con tainment materials will be properly disposed. An exclusion zone of 50 to 100 feet around the spill area should be established depending on the size of the spill. All contractor vehicles must have spill kits on them with enough material to contain and abso rb the worst -case spill from that vehicle. All vehicles and equipment must be inspected prior to be admitted on site. Any vehicle or piece of equipment that develops a leak will be taken out of service and removed from the job site. The following seven s teps must be taken by the Emergency Coordinator: 1. Determine the nature, identity and amounts of major spills. 2. Make sure all unnecessary persons are removed from the spill area. 3. Notify the HSO immediately. 4. Use proper PPE in consultation with the HSO. 5. If a fl ammable liquid, gas or vapor is involved, remove all ignition sources and use non-sparking and/or explosion -proof equipment to contain or clean up the spill (diesel -only vehicles, air -operated pumps, etc.) 6. If possible, try to stop the leak with appropriate material. Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 47 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 7. Remove all surrounding materials that can react or compound with the spill. In addition to the spill control and response procedures described in this CHASP, Langan personnel will coordinate with the designated project manager relative to spill response and control actions. Notification to the Project Manager must be immediate and, to the extent possible, include the following information: Time and location of the spill. Type and nature of the material spilled. Amount spilled. Whether the spill has affected or has a potential to affect a waterway or sewer. A brief description of affected areas/equipment. Whether the spill has been contained. Expected time of cleanup completion. If spill cleanup cannot be handled by Langan's on-site personnel alon e, such fact must be conveyed to the Project Manager immediately. Langan will not make any notification of spills to outside agencies. The client will notify regulatory agencies as per their reporting procedures. 16.15 Emergency Equipment The following mi nimum emergency equipment must be kept and maintained on site: Industrial first aid kit. Fire extinguishers (one per site). 16.16 Restoration and Salvage After an emergency, prompt restoration of utilities, fire protection equipment, medical supplies and o ther equipment will reduce the possibility of further losses. Some of the items that may need to be addressed are: Refilling fire extinguishers. Refilling medical supplies. Recharging eyewashes and/or showers. Replenishing spill control supplies. 16.17 Documentation Immediately following an incident or near miss, unless emergency medical treatment is required, either the employee or a coworker must contact the Langan Incident/Injury Hotline at 1 -(800) -9-Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 48 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 LANGAN (ext ension 4699) and the client representative to report the incident or near miss. For emergencies involving personnel injury and/or exposure, the HSO and affected employee will complete and submit an Employee Exposure/Injury Incident Report (Attachment C) to the Langan Corporate Health and Safety M anager as soon as possible following the incident. 17.0 SPECIAL CONDITION S This guideline contains information and requirements for special conditions that may not be routinely encountered. 17.1 Scope The guideline applies to the specific projects identi fied within this document. Additional provisions will be addressed in each Site -Specific Construction Health and Safety Plan ( CHASP ), as needed. 17.2 Responsibilities Site Personnel - All site personnel must be alert to safety hazards on work sites and ta ke action to minimize such hazards. Personnel must utilize the buddy system, watch for inappropriate behavior, and be alert to changes in site conditions. Health and Safety Officer (HSO) - The HSO is responsible for considering these procedures in the dev elopment of site specific CHASPs. The HSO must schedule frequent \"tail gate\" safety briefings to enhance safety awareness and discuss potential problems. 17.3 Procedures The procedures outlined below must be followed when such conditions are encountered. 17.3.1 Ladders Langan safety procedures must be used to ensure employee safety when using ladders in the office or work sites. All ladders must be coated or repaired to prevent injury to the employee from punctures or lacerations and to prevent snagging or clothing. Any wood ladders used must have an opaque covering except for identification or warning labels, which may be placed on one face only of a side rail. 17.3.1.1 Ladder Use Employees must only use ladders for the purposes, which they were designed and must not be used as scaffolding. Ladders will be maintained and inspected prior to use for slip hazards Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 49 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 including oil and grease. Employees must use ladders only on stable and level surfaces unless the ladder is secured to prevent possible displaceme nt. Ladders should not be used on slippery surfaces unless secured or provided with slip resistant feet to prevent accidental displacement. Ladders should not be used in locations where they could be displaced by workplace activities or traffic. Ladder rungs, cleats and steps must be parallel, level and uniformly spaced when the ladder is in the use position. Employees should not be carrying anything including equipment that could cause injury if there was a fall while utilizing the ladder. The top and bottom of the ladder area must remain clear while in use. When ascending and descending the ladder, employees must face the ladder. Ladders must not be loaded beyond the maximum intended load for which they were built or the manufacturer's rated capacity. 17.3.1.2 Portable Ladders Rungs, cleats and steps for portable ladders and fixed ladders must be spaced not less than 10 inches apart, nor more than 14 inches apart, as measured between center lines of the rungs, cleats and steps. When used to access an upper landing surface, the ladder side rails must extend at least three feet above the upper landing surface to which the ladder is used to gain access. If this is not possible, due to the ladders length, then the top of the ladder must be secured at its top to a rigid support. 17.3.1.3 Step Stools Rungs, cleats and steps of step stools must not be less than 8 inches apart, nor more than 12 inches apart, as measured between center lines of the rungs, cleats and steps. 17.3.1.4 Extension Ladders Rungs, clea ts steps of the base section of extension trestle ladders must be spaced not less than 8 inches apart, nor more than 18 inches apart, as measured between center lines of the rungs, cleats and steps. The rung spacing on the extension section of the ext ension trestle ladder must not be less than 6 inches nor more than 12 inches, as measured between center lines of the rungs, cleats and steps. Ladders must be used at an angle such that the horizontal distance from the top support to the foot of the ladde r is approximately one -quarter of the working length of the ladder (the distance along the ladder between the foot and the top support). Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 50 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 17.3.1.5 Inspection Ladders will be inspected for visible detects periodically, prior to utilization or after any occur rence that could have negatively affected the ladder. Portable ladders with defects including broken or missing rungs, cleats, or steps, broken or split rails, corroded components or other faulty or defective components must not be used. The ladder will be immediately marked as defective, tagged as \"Do Not Use\" or blocked from being used and removed from service until repaired. 17.3.2 First Aid/Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) Langan field and office personnel will be encouraged to be trained in First Aid and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). Training will be provided free of charge by Langan to all employees. Employees will receive a training certificate that will be kept on file with the Health & Safety Coordinator (HSC). Training and certificat ion will be provided by a credited provider such as American Red Cross or equivalent. 17.3.2.1 Emergency Procedures Prior to work at sites the Langan employees certified in first aid and CPR will be identified in the site specific CHASP . Langan will endea r to have at least one employee at a job site trained and able to render first aid and CPR. The site specific CHASP will contain first aid information on both potential chemical and physical hazards. Emergency procedures to be followed are in case of injury or illnesses are provided in the CHASP . The CHASP will include emergency contact information including local police and fire departments, hospital emergency rooms, ambulance services, on -site medical personnel and physicians. The CHASP will also incl ude directions and contact information to the nearest emergency facility in case immediate medical attention is required. The emergency contact information will be conspicuously posted at the worksite. Employees that are injured and require immediate medi cal attention must call either 911 or the local posted emergency contacts. Employees should use ambulatory services to transport injured workers to the nearest facility for emergency medical care. In areas where 911 is not available, the telephone numbers of the physicians, hospitals, or ambulances must be conspicuously posted. 17.3.2.2 First Aid Supplies First aid supplies are readily available to all Langan employees when required. First aid kits are located in each Langan office. Portable first aid ki ts are available for employees to use at work sites. First aid kits should consist of items needed to treat employees for potential chemical and physical injuries. At a minimum, first aid kits should contain items to allow basic first aid to be rendered. Where the eyes or body of an employee may be exposed to corrosive materials, Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 51 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 suitable facilities for quick drenching or flushing of the eyes and body must be provided within the work area for immediate emergency use including eye wash. First aid kits wil l be weatherproof with individual sealed packages of each item. All portable first aid kits must be inspected by Langan employees before and after use to ensure all used items are replaced. When out in the field, employees must check first aid kits weekl y to ensure used items are replaced. 17.3.3 Hydrogen Sulfide Langan employees with the potential to be exposed to hydrogen sulfide while at work sites must have training in hydrogen sulfide awareness. The training will include identification of areas wher e employees could be exposed to hydrogen sulfide, health effects, permissible exposure limits, first aid procedures and personnel protective equipment. Langan employees could be exposed to hydrogen sulfide while at job sites including petroleum refineries , hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal facilities, uncontrolled hazardous waste sites and remediation projects. 17.3.3.1 Characteristics Hydrogen sulfide is a colorless gas with a strong odor of rotten eggs that is soluble in water. Hydrogen su lfide is used to test and make other chemicals. It is also found as a by -product of chemical reactions, such as in sewer treatment. It is a highly flammable gas and a dangerous fire hazard. Poisonous gases are produced in fires including sulfur oxides. Hydrogen sulfide is not listed as a carcinogen. 17.3.3.2 Health Effects Hydrogen Sulfide can affect employees if inhaled or through contact with skin or eyes. Acute (or short term) health effects of hydrogen sulfide exposure include irritation of the nos e and throat, dizziness, confusion, headache and trouble sleeping. Inhalation of hydrogen sulfide can irritate the lungs causing coughing and/or shortness of breath. Higher levels of exposure can cause build -up of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema), a medical emergency, with severe shortness of breath. Chronic (or long term) health effects of low levels of exposure to hydrogen sulfide can cause pain and redness of the eyes with blurred vision. Repeated exposure may cause bronchitis with cough, phlegm an d shortness of breath. Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 52 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 17.3.3.3 Protective Clothing and Equipment Respirators are required for those operations in which employees will be exposed to hydrogen sulfide above OSHA permissible exposure level. The maximum OSHA permissible exposure limit (PEL) for hydrogen sulfide is 20 parts of hydrogen sulfide vapor per million parts of air (20 ppm) for an 8 -hour workday and the maximum short -term exposure limit (STEL) is 10 ppm for any 10 - minute period. Where employees are exposed to levels up to 100 parts o f hydrogen sulfide vapor per million parts of air (100 ppm), the following types of respiratory protection are allowed: Any powered, air purifying respirator with cartridge(s); Any air purifying, full -facepiece respirator (gas mask) with a chin style, fron t- or back - mounted canister; Any supplied air system with escape self -contained breathing apparatus, if applicable; and, Any self -contained breathing apparatus with a full facepiece. Respirators used by employees must have joint Mine Safety and Health Admi nistration and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) seal of approval. Cartridges or canisters must be replaced before the end of their service life, or the end of the shift, whichever occurs first. Langan employees that have the potential to be exposed to hydrogen sulfide will be trained in the proper use of respirators. Respirator training is discussed under - Langan's Respiratory Protection Program. Employees with potential exposure to hydrogen sulfide, or when required by t he client, will wear a portable hydrogen sulfide gas detector. The detector should have an audible, visual and vibrating alarm. The detector may also provide detection for carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and oxygen deficient atmospheres. The hydrogen su lfide monitor will, at a minimum, be calibrated to detect hydrogen sulfide at a level of 20 parts of hydrogen sulfide vapor per million parts of air (20 ppm). Many portable gas detectors will have factory defaults with a low level alarm at 10 ppm and a hi gh level alarm at 15 ppm. Langan employees must consult clients to determine if any site specific threshold levels exist. If the hydrogen sulfide gas detector sounds and employees are not wearing appropriate respiratory protection, employees must immediat ely vacate the area and meet at the assigned emergency location. Langan employees may not re - enter the site without proper respiratory protection and approval from the client or property owner, if needed. Employees must wear PPE to prevent eye and skin c ontact with hydrogen sulfide. Employees must wear appropriate protective clothing including boots, gloves, sleeves and aprons, over any Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 53 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 parts of their body that could be exposed to hydrogen sulfide. Non-vented, impact resistant goggles should be worn whe n working with or exposed to hydrogen sulfide. 17.3.3.4 Emergency and First Aid Procedures Eye and Face Exposure If hydrogen sulfide comes in contact with eyes, it should be washed out immediately with large amounts of water for 30 minutes, occasionally li fting the lower and upper eye lids. Seek medical attention immediately. Skin Exposure If hydrogen sulfide contaminates clothing or skin, remove the contaminated clothing immediately and wash the exposed skin with large amounts of water and soap. Seek me dical attention immediately. Contaminated clothing should either be disposed of or washed before wearing again. Breathing If a Langan employee or other personnel breathe in hydrogen sulfide, immediately get the exposed person to fresh air. If breathing h as stopped, artificial respiration should be started. Call for medical assistance or a doctor as soon as possible. Safety Precautions Hydrogen sulfide is a highly flammable gas and a dangerous fire hazard. Containers of hydrogen sulfide may explode in a fire situation. Poisonous gases are produced during fires. Langan employees should contact property owners and operators prior to conducting work onsite to be aware of any site specific contingency plans, identify where hydrogen sulfide is used at the facility and be informed about additional safety rules or procedures. 17.3.4 Fire Protection/Extinguishers Langan field personnel that have been provided with portable fire extinguishers for use at worksites will be trained to familiarize employees with gener al principles of fire extinguisher use and hazards associated with the incipient stage of firefighting. Training will be provided prior to initial assignment for field work and annually thereafter. Portable fire extinguishers must be visually inspected mo nthly and subjected to an annual maintenance check. Langan will retain records of the annual maintenance date. Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 54 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 17.3.5 Overhead lines When field work is performed near overhead lines, the lines must be deenergized and grounded, or other protective measures must be provided before the work commence s. If overhead lines are to be deenergized, arrangements must be made with the client, property owner or organization that operates or controls the electric circuits involved to deenergize and ground them. If pro tective measures, such as guarding, isolating, or insulating, are provided, these precautions must prevent employees from contacting such lines directly with any part of their body or indirectly through conductive materials, tools, or equipment. When unqua lified Langan personnel are working in an elevated position near overhead lines, the location must be such that the person and the longest conductive object they may contact cannot come closer to any unguarded, energized overhead line than the following di stances: 1. For voltages to ground 50 kilovolts ( kV) or below - 10 feet; and 2. For voltages to ground over 50kV - 10 feet, plus 4 inches for every 10kV over 50kV. As previously indicated, Langan does not retain qualified employees to perform work on energ ized equipment. 17.3.5.1 Vehicle and Equipment Clearance Any vehicle or mechanical equipment capable of having parts of its structure elevated near energized overhead lines must be operated so that a clearance of 10 feet is maintained. If the voltage of t he overhead lines is higher than 50kV, the clearance must be increased 4 inches for every 10kV over that voltage. If any of the following discussed conditions occur, the clearance may be reduced. If the vehicle is in transit with its structure lowered, the clearance may be reduced to 4 ft. If the voltage is higher than 50kV, the clearance must be increased 4 in. for every 10 kV over that voltage. If insulating barriers are installed to prevent contact with the lines, and if the barriers are rated for the vo ltage of the line being guarded and are not a part of or an attachment to the vehicle or its raised structure, the clearance may be reduced to a distance within the designed working dimensions of the insulating barrier. Employees standing on the ground may not contact the vehicle or mechanical equipment or any of its attachments, unless the employee is using protective equipment rated for the voltage; or the equipment is located so that no uninsulated part of its structure (that portion of the structure Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 55 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 that provides a conductive path to employees on the ground) can come closer to the overhead line than permitted. If any vehicle or mechanical equipment capable of having parts of its structure elevated near energized overhead lines is intentionally grounded, employees working on the ground near the point of grounding may not stand at the grounding location whenever there is a possibility of overhead line contact. Additional precautions, such as the use of barricades or insulation, must be taken to protect emp loyees from hazardous ground potentials, depending on earth resistivity and fault currents, which can develop within the first few feet or more outward from the grounding point. 17.3.6 Trade Secret Langan employees could potentially be provided trade secre t information by the client or property owner when site specific information is provided about highly hazardous chemicals. Trade secret means any confidential formula, pattern, process, device, information or compilation of information that is used in an employer's business, and that gives the employer an opportunity to obtain an advantage over competitors who do not know or use it. Langan employees understand that this information should be kept confident and if required, may enter into a confidentially a greement with the client. 17.3.7 Bloodborne Pathogens Langan employees that can reasonably anticipate exposure to blood or other potentially infectious material while at work sites must have training in bloodborne pathogens. Applicable employees would inc lude those trained in first aid and serving a designated role as an emergency medical care provider. Bloodborne pathogens are pathogenic microorganisms that are present in human blood and can cause disease in humans. These pathogens include, but are not limited to, hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency virus. 17.3.7 .1 Training Langan employees with potential occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectious material must participate in a training program. Training must be conducted pr ior to initial assignment where there would be potential for exposure and annually thereafter within one year of previous training. The training program will be provided to Langan employees at no cost to them and during working hours. Langan will ensure t he training program must consist of the following: An accessible copy of the regulatory text of 29 CFR 1910.1030 and an explanation of its Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 56 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 contents; A general explanation of the epidemiology and symptoms of bloodborne diseases; An explanation of the modes of transmission of bloodborne pathogens; An explanation of Langan's exposure control plan and the means by which the employee can obtain a copy of the written plan; An explanation of the appropriate methods for recognizing tasks and other activities that may involve exposure to blood and other potentially infectious materials; An explanation of the use and limitations of personal protective o equipment (PPE) to prevent and reduce exposure; o Information on the types, proper use, location, removal, handling and disposal of PPE; o An explanation of the basis for selection of PPE; o Information on the hepatitis B vaccine, including information on its efficacy, safety, method of administration, the benefits of being vaccinated, and that the vaccine and vaccination will be offered free of charge; o Information on the appropriate actions to take and persons to contact in an emergency involving blood or other potentially infectious materials; o An explanation of the procedure to follow if an exposure incident occurs, including the method of reporting the incident and the medical follow -up that will be made available; o Information on the post -exposure evaluation and follow -up that the o employer is required to provide for the employee following an exposure incident; o An explanation o f the signs and labels and/or color coding required by paragraph 29 CFR 1910.1030(g)(1); and o An opportunity for interactive questions and answers with the person conducting the training session. Langan will develop and implement a written Exposure Control Plan, which will be designed to eliminate or minimize employee exposure to bloodborne pathogens . The Exposure Control Plan will contain the following elements: An exposure determination for employees; The schedule and method of implementation for Methods o f Compliance (29 CFR 191.1030(d)), Hepatitis B Vaccination and Post -Exposure Evaluation and Follow -up (29 CFR 1910.1030(f)), Communication of Hazards to Employees (29 CFR 1910.1030(g)) and (h) Recordkeeping (29 CFR 1910.1030(h)); The procedure for the eval uation of circumstances surrounding exposure incidents; Ensure a copy of the Exposure Control Plan will be accessible to employees; and, The Exposure Control Plan must be reviewed and updated at least annually. Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 57 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 Langan employees with occupational exposure t o bloodborne pathogens include any employees trained in first aid that would be expected to provide emergency medical care. This determination is made without regards to the use of PPE, which could eliminate or minimize exposure. Universal precautions must be observed to prevent contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials. According to the concept of Universal Precautions, all human blood and certain human body fluids are treated as if known to be infectious for bloodborne pathogens. Unde r circumstances in which differentiation between body fluid types is difficult or impossible, all body fluids must be considered potentially infectious materials. Work practice controls must be used to eliminate or minimize employee exposure, if applicable . Since Langan employees will have occupational exposure only during rendering of first aid, personnel protective equipment will be utilized to reduce or minimize exposure. PPE that could be available to Langan personnel when administering first aid incl udes safety glasses, gloves, and Tyvek suits or sleeves. PPE and first aid kits will be provided to employees at no cost to them. Langan employees that render first aid in office areas will have access to hand washing facilities or restrooms. For first ai d rendered at field locations, first aid kits will contain an appropriate antiseptic hand cleanser and clean cloth/paper towels or antiseptic towelettes. After using antiseptic hand cleansers or towelettes, employees must wash their hands with soap and running water as soon as feasible. After administering first aid, potentially infectious materials, including towels, personnel protective equipment, clothes and bandages, must be placed in a container, which prevents leakage during collection, handling, pro cessing, storage, transport, or shipping. All PPE will be dispose of after use. Any equipment or working surfaces which was been exposed to blood or potentially infectious materials due to an injury, will be decontaminated prior to reuse. Langan will mak e available the hepatitis B vaccine and vaccination series to all employees who have occupational exposure, and post -exposure evaluation and follow -up to all employees who have had an exposure incident. These services will be available to the employee at no cost to them through a medical provider. 17.3.7.2 Recordkeeping Langan will maintain training and medical records for each employee with occupational exposure to blood or potentially infectious materials. Medical and training records will be maintained by Langan's H&S Department. Training records will include the following: Construction Health & Safety Plan November 2022 514 & 542 Union Street Page 58 469 & 473 President Street Brooklyn , New York Langan Project No. 170361303 Dates of the training sessions; Contents or a summary of the training sessions; Names and qualifications of persons conducting the training; and Names and job titles of all persons a ttending the training sessions. Training records must be maintained for 3 years from the date on which the training occurred. Medical records will be will be preserved and maintained for the duration of employment plus 30 years. All records will be made a vailable upon request to employees, the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health, and Director of National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Director of OSHA for examination and copying. Medical records must have written consent from employee before releasing. If Langan ceases to do business, all records must be transferred to the successor employer. The successor employer must receive and maintain these records. If there will not be a successor, Langan will notify curren t employees of their rights to access records at least three months prior to the cessation of business. 18.0 RECORDKEEPING The following is a summary of required health and safety logs, reports and recordkeeping. 18.1 Field Change Authorization Request Any changes to the work to be performed that is not included in the CHASP will require an addendum that is approved by the Langan project manager and Langan HSM to be prepared.

Upon leaving the work zone, personnel will thoroughly wash their hands and face. Minimize contact with contaminated materials through proper planning of work areas and decontamination areas, and by following proper procedures. Do not place equipment on the ground. Do not sit on contaminated materials. No open flames in the work zone. Only properly trained and equipped personnel are permitted to work in potentially contaminated areas. Always use th e appropriate level of personal protective equipment (PPE). Maintain close contact with your buddy in the work zone Contaminated material will be contained in the Exclusion Zone (EZ). Report any unusual conditions. Work areas will be kept clear and unclutt ered. Debris and other slip, trip, and fall hazards will be removed as frequently as possible. The number of personnel and equipment in the work zone will be kept to an essential minimum. Be alert to the symptoms of fatigue and heat/cold stress, and their effects on the normal caution and judgment of personnel. Conflicting situations which may arise concerning safety requirements and working conditions must be addressed and resolved quickly by the site HSO. TOOLS AND HEAVY EQUIPMENT Do not, under any circu mstances, enter or ride in or on any backhoe bucket, materials hoist, or any other device not specifically designed to carrying passengers. Loose -fitting clothing or loose long hair is prohibited around moving machinery. Ensure that heavy equipment operato rs and all other personnel in the work zone are using the same hand signals to communicate. Drilling/excavating withi n 10 feet in any direction of overhead power lines is prohibited. The locations of all underground utilities must be identified and marked out prior to initiating any subsurface activities. Check to insure that the equipment operator has lowered all blades and buckets to the ground before shutting off the vehicle. If the equipment has an emergency stop device, have the operator show all perso nnel its location and how to activate it. Help the operator ensure adequate clearances when the equipment must negotiate in tight quarters ; serve as a signalman to direct backing as necessary. Ensure that all heavy equipment that is used in the Exclusion Z one is kept in that zone until the job is done, and that such equipment is completely decontaminated before moving it into the clean area of the work zone. Samplers must not reach into or get near rotating equipment such as the drill rig. If personnel must work near any tools that could rotate, the equipment operator must completely shut down the rig prior to initiating such work. It may be necessary to use a remote sampling device.

EQUIPMENT DECONTAMINATION GENERAL: Equipment to be decontaminated during the project may include tools, monitoring equipment, respirators, sampling containers, laboratory equipment and drilling equipment. All decontamination will be done by personnel in protective gear, appropriate for the level of decontamination, as determined by the s ite HSO. The decontamination work tasks will be split or rotated among support and work crews. Depending on site conditions, backhoe and pumps may be decontaminated over a portable decontamination pad to contain wash water; or, wash water may be allowed to run off into a storm sewer system. Equipment needed may include a steam generator with high -pressure water, empty drums, screens, screen support structures, and shovels. Drums will be used to hold contaminated wash water pumped from the lined pit. These d rums will be labeled as such. Miscellaneous tools and equipment will be dropped into a plastic pail, tub, or other container. They will be brushed off and rinsed with a detergent solution, and finally rinsed with clean water. MONITORING EQUIPMENT: Monitori ng equipment will be protected as much as possible from contamination by draping, masking, or otherwise covering as much of the instruments as possible with plastic without hindering the operation of the unit. The PID, HNu or OVA meter, for example, can be placed in a clear plastic bag, which allows reading of the scale and operation of knobs. The probes can be partially wrapped keeping the sensor tip and discharge port clear. The contaminated equipment will be taken from the drop area and the protective co verings removed and disposed in the appropriate containers. Any dirt or obvious contamination will be brushed or wiped with a disposable paper wipe. RESPIRATORS : Respirators will be cleaned and disinfected after every use. Taken from the drop area, the mas ks (with the cartridges removed and disposed of with other used disposable gear) will be immersed in a cleaning solution and scrubbed gently with a soft brush, followed by a rinse in plain warm water, and then allowed to air dry. In the morning, new cartri dges will be installed. Personnel will inspect their own masks for serviceability prior to donning them. And, once the mask is on, the wearer will check the respirator for leakage using the negative and positive pressure fit check techniques.

Precautionary statement Prevention Care should be taken during bulk handling to prevent accumulation/generation over time of 75 micron or finer particles. Use only non-sparking tools and natural bristle brushes. Keep away from heat/sparks/open flames/hot surfaces - No smoking. Ground/bond container and receiving equipment. Use explosion -proof electrical/ventilating/lighting equipment. Prevent dust accumulation to minimize explosion hazard. Take precautionary measures against static discharge. Response In case of fire: Use appropriate media for extinction. Storage Store in a dry place and/or in closed container. Keep away from heat, sparks and open flame - No smoking. Do not allow chips, fines or dust to contact water, particularly in enclosed areas. Disposal Reuse or recycle material whenever possible. Material that cannot be reused may be sent to a metals reclamation facility that is able to handle fines. Waste material that cannot be reclaimed for metal value should be rendered non- reactive prior to disposal. Warning Supplemental information Powder may ignite readily. Powder or dusts dispersed in the air can be explosive. Explosion/fire hazards may be present when: Powder or dust are dispersed in air. Powder or dusts are in contact with water. Powder or dusts are in contact with certain metal oxides (e.g., rust, copper oxide). FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES: Use gentle surface application of Class D extinguishing agent or dry inert granular material (e.g., sand) to cover and ring the burning material. Avoid mixing of the extinguishing agent with the burning material. If possible, isolate the burning material to prevent fire spread, and allow the material to burn itself out. Do not disturb the material until completely cool. Move undamaged containers away from heat or flame, if possible. DO NOT USE water, halogenated agents, or ABC dry chemical agents. These fire extinguishing agents will react with the burning material. IN CASE OF SPILL: Avoid dusting of powder to the greatest extent possible. Use only non-sparking tools and natural bristle brushes. ELIMINATE all ignition sources (no smoking, flares, sparks or flames in immediate area). Prohibit smoking. Use dry cleanup procedures. Place carefully in dry, water -tight containers. Seal containers. After complete clean -up by sweeping, area may be washed with large amounts of water if necessary. See Alcoa SDS Number 0123.

Exposure controls/personal protection Hand protection Use a properly fitted, air-purifying or air-fed respirator complying with an approved standard if a risk assessment indicates this is necessary. Respirator selection must be based on known or anticipated exposure levels, the hazards of the product and the safe working limits of the selected respirator.Chemical-resistant, impervious gloves complying with an approved standard should be worn at all times when handling chemical products if a risk assessment indicates this is necessary. Considering the parameters specified by the glove manufacturer, check during use that the gloves are still retaining their protective properties. It should be noted that the time to breakthrough for any glove material may be different for different glove manufacturers. In the case of mixtures, consisting of several substances, the protection time of the gloves cannot be accurately estimated.Safety eyewear complying with an approved standard should be used when a risk assessment indicates this is necessary to avoid exposure to liquid splashes, mists, gases or dusts. If contact is possible, the following protection should be worn, unless the assessment indicates a higher degree of protection: chemical splash goggles.Eye/face protection Respiratory protection ::: Body protection Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product. When there is a risk of ignition from static electricity, wear anti- static protective clothing. For the greatest protection from static discharges, clothing should include anti-static overalls, boots and gloves.:Environmental exposure controls:Emissions from ventilation or work process equipment should be checked to ensure they comply with the requirements of environmental protection legislation. In some cases, fume scrubbers, filters or engineering modifications to the process equipment will be necessary to reduce emissions to acceptable levels.Appropriate engineering controls:Use only with adequate ventilation. Use process enclosures, local exhaust ventilation or other engineering controls to keep worker exposure to airborne contaminants below any recommended or statutory limits. The engineering controls also need to keep gas, vapor or dust concentrations below any lower explosive limits. Use explosion-proof ventilation equipment. Wash hands, forearms and face thoroughly after handling chemical products, before eating, smoking and using the lavatory and at the end of the working period. Appropriate techniques should be used to remove potentially contaminated clothing. Wash contaminated clothing before reusing. Ensure that eyewash stations and safety showers are close to the workstation location.Hygiene measures :Individual protection measures Skin protection Other skin protection :Appropriate footwear and any additional skin protection measures should be selected based on the task being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product.

Material Safety Data Sheet Product Name: COBALT-BASED ALLOYS ID: 1147 ____________________________________________________________ Page 3 Date 04/22/08 Revision: 3.0000 Print Date 4/22/2008 * * * Section 6 - Accidental Release Measures * * * Small/Large Spill: Avoid generating dust. Recover using mechanical means. Collect scrap for recycling. * * * Section 7 - Handling and Storage * * * Handling/Storage Avoid generating dust. Avoid contact with sharp edges or he ated metal. Product should be kept dry. Do not eat, drink, apply cosmetics, or smoke when handling or using. Requirements for Remelting of Scrap Material and/or Ingot Molten metal and water can be an explosive combination. The risk is greatest when there is sufficient molten metal to entrap or seal off the water. Water and other form s of contamination on or co ntained in scrap or remelt ingot are known to have caused explosions in melting operations. While the products may have minimal surface roughness and internal voids, there remains the possibilit y of moisture contamination or entrapment. If confined, even a few drops of water can lead to violent explosions. During melting operations, the following minimum guidelines should be observed: * Inspect all materials prior to furnace charging and comple tely remove surface contamination such as water, ice, snow, deposits of grease and oil or other surface contam ination resulting from weather exposure, shipment, or storage. * Store materials in dry, heated areas with any cracks or cavities pointed downwards. * Preheat and dry large or heavy items such as ingot adequat ely before charging into a furnace containing molten metal. This is typically done by use of a drying oven or homogenizing furnace. The drying cycle should bring the internal metal temperature of the coldest item of the bat ch to 400\u00b0F and then hold at that temperature for 6 hours. * * * Section 8 - Exposure Controls / Personal Protection * * * Engineering Controls If dust or fumes are generated through processing: Use with adequate ventilation to meet the limits listed in Section 8, Exposure Guidelines. Personal Protective Equipment Respiratory Protection If dust or fumes are generated through processing: Use NIOSH-approved respirator y protection as specified by an Industrial Hygienist or other qualif ied professional if concentrations e xceed the limits listed in Section 8, Exposure Guidelines. Suggested respiratory protection: N95 Eye Protection Wear safety glasses/goggles to avoid eye injury. Skin Protection Wear appropriate gloves to avoid any skin injury.

INHALATION: Health effects from mec hanical processing (e.g., cutting, grinding): Can cause upper respiratory tract irritation. Chronic ov erexposures: Can cause asthma, respiratory sensitization, scarring of the lungs (pulmonar y fibrosis), central nervous system damage, secondary Parkinson's disease and reproductive harm in males. Additional health effects from elevated temperature processing (e.g., welding, melting): Acute ov erexposures: Can cause nausea, fever, chills, shortness of breath and malaise (metal fume fever). Chronic overexposures: Can cause the accumulation of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) and lung cancer. WARNING: Cobalt metal powder, Chromium (hexavalent compounds) and nickel (metallic) and nickel compounds are chemicals known to t he State of California to cause cancer (Proposition 65). Precautions: Avoid generating dust. Use with adequate ventilation. Keep material dry. Use appropriate personal protective equipment (saf ety glasses/gloves) to avoid injury. Use appropriate NIOSH approved respiratory protec tion (N95) if concentrations exceed the permissible limits. First Aid (dust or fume from processing): EYES: Flus h eyes with plenty of water or s aline for at least 15 minutes. Consult a physician. SKIN: Wash skin with soap and water for at least 15 minutes. Consult a physician if irritation persists. INHALATION: Remove to fres h air. If unconscious or severely injured, check fo r clear airway, breathing and presence of pulse. Perform CPR if there is no pulse or respiration. Consult a physician. In case of fire: Use a Class D agent, fluxing salts, graphite or dry sand on dust or fine fires. Otherwise, use fire fighting methods and materi als that are appropriate for surrounding fire. Do NOT use water around molten metal. This will react with the burning material.

Toxicological Information Routes of Exposure Toxicity Data Chronic Toxic Effects Acute Toxic Effects RG9701600 RTECS Number Not available. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid's production a precursor for fluorinated surfactants has resu lted in its release to the environment through various waste streams. If relea sed to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.0X10-3 mm Hg at 25 deg C indicates perfluorooctane sulfonic acid will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor- phase perfluorooctane sulfonic acid will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl ra dicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 110 days. I f released to soil, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid i s expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 100,000. Perfluorooc tane sulfonic acid is essentially nonvolatile. Perf luoro compound recalcitrance can be attributed to the stability co nferred by fluorine substitutes and the absence of structures susceptible to electrophilic or nucleophilic attack. Perfluoroocta ne sulfonic acid reached 0% of its theoretical BOD in four weeks using an activated sludge inoculum in the manometric respiro metry test. If released into water, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process as the com pound is essentially nonvolatile; an estimated vola tilization half-life for a model pond is 3 years if adsorption is considered. An estimated BCF of 56 suggests the potential for b ioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Monitoring studies h owever would suggest that this compound is highly b ioaccumulative. As a class, fluorinated organic compounds are resistan t to hydrolysis. Occupational exposure to perfluoro octane sulfonic acid may occur through inhalation and dermal contact wit h this compound at workplaces where perfluorooctane sulfonic acid is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to perfluoroocta ne sulfonic acid via ingestion of contaminated fish and drinking water, and dermal contact with this compound and other pro ducts containing perfluorooctane sulfonic acid.

HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION Potential Health Effects: Eye: Contact may cause mild eye irritation including stinging, watering, and redness. Skin: Severe skin irritant. Contact may cause redness, itching, burning, and severe skin damage. Prolonged or repeated contact can worsen irritation by causing drying and cracking of the skin, leading to dermatitis (inflammation). Not actually toxic by skin absorption, but prolonged or repeated skin contact may be harmful (see Section 11). Inhalation (Breathing): No information available. Studies by other exposure routes suggest a low degree of toxicity by inhalation. Ingestion (Swallowing): Low degree of toxicity by ingestion. ASPIRATION HAZARD ! This material can enter lungs during swallowing or vomiting and cause lung inflammation and damage. Signs and Symptoms: Effects of overexposure may include irritation of the nose and throat, irritation of the digestive tract, nausea, diarrhea and transient excitation followed by signs of nervous system depression (e.g., headache, drowsiness, dizziness, loss of coordination, disorientation and fatigue). Cancer: Possible skin cancer hazard (see Sections 11 and 14). Target Organs: There is limited evidence from animal studies that overexposure may cause injury to the kidney (see Section 11). Developmental: Inadequate data available for this material. Pre-Existing Medical Conditions: Conditions aggravated by exposure may include skin disorders and kidney disorders. No. 2 Diesel Fuel (MSDS #0041) Page 4 of 9 4. FIRST AID MEASURES Eye: If irritation or redness develops, move victim away from exposure and into fresh air. Flush eyes with clean water. If symptoms persist, seek medical attention. Skin: Immediately remove contaminated shoes, clothing, and constrictive jewelry and flush affected area(s) with large amounts of water. If skin surface is damaged, apply a clean dressing and seek immediate medical attention. If skin surface is not damaged, cleanse affected area(s) thoroughly by washing with mild soap and water. If irritation or redness develops, seek immediate medical attention. Inhalation (Breathing): If respiratory symptoms develop, move victim away from source of exposure and into fresh air. If symptoms persist, seek medical attention. If victim is not breathing, clear airway and immediately begin artificial respiration. If breathing difficulties develop, oxygen should be administered by qualified personnel. Seek immediate medical attention. Ingestion (Swallowing): Aspiration hazard; Do not induce vomiting or give anything by mouth because this material can enter the lungs and cause severe lung damage. If victim is drowsy or unconscious and vomiting, place on the left side with the head down. If possible, do not leave victim unattended and observe closely for adequacy of breathing. Seek medical attention. 5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES Flammable Properties: Flash Point: >125\u00b0F/>52\u00b0 OSHA Flammability Temperature: 500\u00b0F/260\u00b0C Unusual Fire & Explosion Hazards: This material is flammable and can be ignited by heat, sparks, flames, or other sources of ignition (e.g., static electricity, pilot lights, or mechanical/electrical equipment, and electronic devices such as cell phones, computers, calculators, and pagers which have not been certified as intrinsically safe). Vapors may travel considerable distances to a source of ignition where they can ignite, flash back, or explode. May create vapor/air explosion hazard indoors, in confined spaces, outdoors, or in sewers. Vapors are heavier than air and can accumulate in low areas. If container is not properly cooled, it can rupture in the heat of a fire. Extinguishing Media: Dry chemical, carbon dioxide, or foam is recommended. Water spray is recommended to cool or protect exposed materials or structures. Carbon dioxide can displace oxygen. Use caution when applying carbon dioxide in confined spaces. Water may be ineffective for extinguishment, unless used under favorable conditions by experienced fire fighters. Fire Fighting Instructions: For fires beyond the incipient stage, emergency responders in the immediate hazard area should wear bunker gear. When the potential chemical hazard is unknown, in enclosed or confined spaces, or when explicitly required by DOT, a self contained breathing apparatus should be worn. In addition, wear other appropriate protective equipment as conditions warrant (see Section 8). Isolate immediate hazard area, keep unauthorized personnel out. Stop spill/release if it can be done with minimal risk. Move undamaged containers from immediate hazard area if it can be done with minimal risk. Water spray may be useful in minimizing or dispersing vapors and to protect personnel. Cool equipment exposed to fire with water, if it can be done with minimal risk. Avoid spreading burning liquid with water used for cooling purposes. No. 2 Diesel Fuel (MSDS #0041) Page 5 of 9 6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES Flammable. Keep all sources of ignition and hot metal surfaces away from spill/release. The use of explosion-proof equipment is recommended. Stay upwind and away from spill/release. Notify persons down wind of the spill/release, isolate immediate hazard area and keep unauthorized personnel out. Stop spill/release if it can be done with minimal risk. Wear appropriate protective equipment including respiratory protection as conditions warrant (see Section 8). Prevent spilled material from entering sewers, storm drains, other unauthorized drainage systems, and natural waterways. Dike far ahead of spill for later recovery or disposal. Use foam on spills to minimize vapors (see Section 5). Spilled material may be absorbed into an appropriate material. Notify fire authorities and appropriate federal, state, and local agencies. Immediate cleanup of any spill is recommended. If spill of any amount is made into or upon navigable waters, the contiguous zone, or adjoining shorelines, notify the National Response Center (phone number 800-424-8802). 7. HANDLING AND STORAGE Handling: Open container slowly to relieve any pressure. Bond and ground all equipment when transferring from one vessel to another. Can accumulate static charge by flow or agitation. Can be ignited by static discharged. The use of explosion-proof equipment is recommended and may be required (see appropriate fire codes). Refer to NFPA-704 and/or API RP 2003 for specific bonding/grounding requirements. Do not enter confined spaces such as tanks or pits without following proper entry procedures such ASTM D-4276 and 29CFR 1910.146. The use of appropriate respiratory protection is advised when concentrations exceed any established exposure limits (see Sections 2 and 8). Do not wear contaminated clothing or shoes. Keep contaminated clothing away from sources of ignition such as sparks or open flames. Use good personal hygiene practices. High pressure injection of hydrocarbon fuels, hydraulic oils or greases under the skin may have serious consequences even though no symptoms or injury may be apparent. This can happen accidentally when using high pressure equipment such as high pressure grease guns, fuel injection apparatus or from pinhole leaks in tubing or high pressure hydraulic oil equipment. $Empty& containers retain residue and may be dangerous. Do not pressurize, cut, weld, braze, solder, drill, grind, or expose such containers to heat, flame, sparks, or other sources of ignition. They may explode and cause injury or death. $Empty& drums should be completely drained, properly bunged, and promptly shipped to the supplier or a drum reconditioner. All containers should be disposed of in an environmentally safe manner and in accordance with governmental regulations. Before working on or in tanks which contain or have contained this material, refer to OSHA regulations, ANSIZ49.1 and other references pertaining to cleaning, repairing, welding, or other contemplated operations. Storage: Keep container(s) tightly closed. Use and store this material in cool, dry, well-ventilated areas away from heat, direct sunlight, hot metal surfaces, and all sources of ignition. Post area $No Smoking or Open Flame.& Store only in approved containers. Keep away from incompatible material (see Section 10). Protect container(s) against physical damage. Outdoor or detached storage is preferred. Indoor storage should meet OSHA standards and appropriate fire codes. 8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS/PERSONAL PROTECTION Engineering controls: If current ventilation practices are not adequate to maintain airborne concentration below the established exposure limits (see Section 2), additional ventilation or exhaust systems may be required. Where explosive mixtures may be present, electrical systems safe for such locations must be used (see appropriate electrical codes). No. 2 Diesel Fuel (MSDS #0041) Page 6 of 9 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): Respiratory: A NIOSH certified air purifying respirator with an organic vapor cartridge maybe used under conditions where airborne concentrations are expected to exceed exposure limits (see Section 2). Protection provided by air purifying respirators is limited (see manufacturer\"s respirator selection guide). Use a positive pressure air supplied respirator if there is a potential for an uncontrolled release, exposure levels are not known, or any other circumstances where air purifying respirators may not provide adequate protection. A respiratory protection program that meets OSHA\"s 29 CFR 1910.134 and ANSI Z88.2 requirements must be followed whenever workplace conditions warrants a respirator\"s use. Skin: The use of gloves impervious to the specific material handled is advised to prevent skin contact, possible irritation and skin damage (see glove manufacturer literature for information on permeability). Depending on conditions of use, apron and/or arm covers may be necessary. Eyes/Face: Approved eye protection to safeguard against potential eye contact, irritation, or injury is recommended. Depending on conditions of use, a face shield may be necessary. Other Protective Equipment: Eye wash and quick-drench shower facilities should be available in the work area. Thoroughly clean shoes and wash contaminated clothing before reuse. It is recommended that impervious clothing be worn when skin contact is possible. 9.

TOXICOLOGICAL INFORMATION Diesel Fuel No. 2 (CAS# 68476-34-6) Carcinogenicity: Chronic dermal application of certain middle distillate streams contained in diesel fuel No. 2 resulted in an increased incidence of skin tumors in mice. This material has not been identified as carcinogen by NTP, IARC, or OSHA. Diesel exhaust is a probable cancer hazard based on tests with laboratory animals. Target Organ(s): Limited evidence of renal impairment has been noted from a few case reports involving excessive exposure to diesel fuel No. 2. Naphthalene (CAS# 91-20-3) Carcinogenicity: Naphthalene has been evaluated in two year inhalation studies in both rats and mice. The National Toxicology Program (NTP) concluded that there is clear evidence of carcinogenicity in male and female rats based on increased incidences of respiratory epithelial adenomas and olfactory epithelial neuroblastomas of the nose. NTP found some evidence of carcinogenicity in female mice (alveolar adenomas) and no evidence of carcinogenicity in male mice. Naphthalene has not been identified as a carcinogen by IARC or OSHA. 12. ECOLOGICAL INFORMATION Not evaluated at this time 13. DISPOSAL CONSIDERATIONS This material, if discarded as produced, would be a RCRA $characteristic& hazardous waste due to the characteristic(s) of ignitability (D001) and benzene (D018). If the material is spilled to soil or water, characteristic testing of the contaminated materials is recommended. Further, this material, once it becomes a waste, is subject to the land disposal restrictions in 40 CFR 268.40 and may require treatment prior to disposal to meet specific standards. Consult state and local regulations to determine whether they are more stringent then the federal requirements. Container contents should be completely used and containers should be emptied prior to discard. Container ?insate? could be considered a RCRA hazardous waste and must be disposed of with care and in compliance with federal, state and local regulations. Large empty containers, such as drums, should be returned to the distributor or to a drum reconditioner.

Iron, galvanized iron, and steel are suitable metal s for tanks. 2. Storage should be located away from any area subjec t to fire hazards. Storage tanks located in the ope n or underground minimize the danger of fire, vapor and health probl ems. 3. All openings in the system should terminate outdoor s and be protected by flash screen. 4. Electrical installation should conform to the Natio nal Electrical Code. 5. Storage tanks should be electrically bonded and gro unded to prevent dangerous accumulations of static electricity. (see NFPA pamphlet \"Static Electricity\") 6. Natural ventilation is all that is needed for outdo or storage installation. 7. For indoor storage : Good natural ventilation may b e sufficient. The generally considered maximum allo wable concentration is 100 ppm by volume in air for an ei ght-hour working exposure. If other than natural ve ntilation is required, 4 the ventilation equipment should be designed to han dle the heavy ethylbenzene vapor. Since ethylbenzen e vapor is heavier than air, a down draft mechanical exhaust is indica ted in those operation in which general ventilation should be to ensure a substantial air flow away from the work area. All v entilating systems require periodic inspection. SECTION 8-EXPOSURE CONTROLS, PERSONAL PROTECTION Control parameters OSHA- Final PELs : ppm TWA. ppm. TLV-STEL : ppm. Taiwan TWA : 100 ppm (skin).

NOTE (1): ALL WHMIS required information is included in appropr iate sections based on the ANSI Z400.1-1998 format. T his gas mixture has been classified in accordance w ith the hazard criteria of the CPR and the MSDS c ontains all the informat ion required by the CPR. 3. HAZARD IDENTIFICATION EMERGENCY OVERVIEW : This gas mix ture is a colorless gas which has a rotten-egg odor (due to the pres ence of Hy drogen Sulfi de). The odor cannot b e relied on as an adequate w arning of the pr esence of this gas mixture, because olfactory fatigue ide (another component of this gas mixture) are tox ic to humans in relati vely low concentrations. Ov er-ex posure to this gas mix ture can cause skin or eye irritation, nausea, dizziness, headaches, co llapse, unconsciousness, coma , and death. Additionally , releases of this gas m ixture may produce ox ygen-deficient atmospheres (especially in sma ll confined spaces or ot her poorly -ventilated env ironments); MS OF OVER-EXPO SURE BY RO UTE O F EXPO SURE : The most significant route of over-exposure for this gas mixture is by inhalation. NON-F LAMMA BLE GA S MIXT URE MSDS - 50018 EFFECTIVE DA TE: JUNE 7, 2010 PAGE 1 OF 6 INHA LATION: Due to the small size of an individual cylinder of this gas mixture, no unusual health effects from over-exposure to the produc t are anticipated under rout ine circumstances of use. A potential health hazard associated w ith this gas mixture is the potential of inhalation of Hydrogen Sulfide, a component of this gas mixture. Such over-exposures may occur if this gas mixture is used in a confined s pace or other poorly -ventilated area. Over-exposures to Hy drogen Sulfide can cause dizziness, headac he, and nausea. Over-exposure to this gas could result in respiratory arrest, coma, or unconsciousness, due to the presence of Hy drogen Sulfide. Continuous inhalation of low conc entrations of Hydrogen Sulfide may cause olfactory fatigue, so that the odor is no longer an effective warning of the presence of this gas. A summary of exposure concentrations and observed effects are as follow s: CONCENTRA TION OF HYDROGEN SULFIDE OBSERVED EFFECT 0.3-30 ppm Odor is unpleasant. 50 ppm Eye irritation. Dry ness and irritation of nose, throat. Slightly higher than 50 ppm Irritation of the respiratory system. 100-150 ppm Temporary loss of smell. 200-250 ppm Headache, vomiting nausea. Prolonged exposure may lead to lung damage. Exposures of 4-8 hours can be fatal.

Death occurs w ithin 0.5 - 1 hour of exposure. > 600 ppm Rapid onset of unconsciousness, coma, death. > 1000 ppm Immediate respiratory arrest. NOTE: This gas mixture contai ns a maximum of 250 ppm Hy drogen Sulfi de. The higher concentration values here are presented to delineate the complete health effects which have been observed for humans after exposure to Hy drogen Sulf ide. 3. HAZARD IDENTIFICATION (continued) Inhalation over-exposures to at mospheres containing more than the Threshold Limit Value of Ca rbon Monoxide (25 ppm), another co mponent of this gas mixture, can result in serious health consequences. Carbon M onoxide is classified as a c hemical asphy xiant, producing a toxic action by combining w ith the hemoglobin of the blood and replacing the available oxy gen. Through this replacement, the body is deprived of the required oxygen, and asphy xiation occurs. Since t he affinity of Carbon Monoxide for hemoglobi n is about 200-300 times that of oxy gen, o nly a small amount of Carbon Monox ide will cause a tox ic reaction to occur. Car bon Monox ide ex posures in ex cess of 50 ppm w ill produce sy mptoms o f poisoning if breathed for a sufficiently long time. If this gas mixture is released in a small, poorly ventilated area (i.e. an enclosed or confined space), sy mptoms which may develop include the follow ing: CONCENTRA TION OF CARBON MONOXIDE OBSERVED EFFECT All exposure levels: Over-exposure to Carbon Monox ide can be indicated by the lips and fingernails turning bright red. 200 ppm: Slight sy mptoms (i.e. headache) after several hours of exposure. 400 ppm: Headache and discomfort exper ienced w ithin 2-3 hours of exposure. 1,000 -2000 ppm: Within 30 minutes, slight palpitations of the heart occu rs. Within 1.5 hours, there is a tendency to stagger. 200-2500 ppm: Within 2 hours, there is mental confusion, headaches, and nausea. Unconsciousness w ithin 30 minutes. >2500 ppm: Potential for collapse and death before w arning sy mptoms. Additionally , if mixtures of this gas mi xture contain less than 19.5% Oxy gen and are re leased in a small, poorly ventilated are a (i.e. an enclosed or confined space), an oxy gen-defici ent environment may occur. Individuals breathing such an atmosphere may experience sy mptoms w hich include headaches, ringing in ears, dizziness, drow siness, unconsciousness, nausea, vomiting, and depression of all the senses. Under some circumstances of over-exposure, death may occur. The follow ing effects associated w ith various levels of oxy gen are as follow s: CONCENTRA TION OF OXYGEN OBSERVED EFFECT 12-16% Oxy gen: Breathing and pulse rate incr eased, muscular coordination slightly disturbed. 10-14% Oxygen: Emotional upset, abnormal fatigue, disturbed respiration. 6-10% Oxygen: Nausea, vomiting, collapse, or loss of consciousness. Below 6%: Convulsive movements, possible respiratory collapse, and death. SKIN and EYE CO NTACT: Hydrogen Sulfide, a component of this gas mixture, may be irritating to the skin. Inflamma tion and irritation of the ey es can occur at very low airborne concentration of Hydrogen Sulfide (less than 10 ppm). Exposure ov er several hours result in \"gas ey es\" or \"sore burning. Above 50 ppm of Hy drogen Sulfide, there is an inte nse tearing, blurring of vision, and pain w hen looking at light. Over-exposed individuals may see rings around bright lights.

SPECIFIC VOLUME (ft3/lb): 13.8 COEFFICIENT WATER/OIL DISTRIBUTION : Not applicable. The following information is for this gas mixture. ODOR THRESHOLD : 0.13 ppm (Hydrogen Sulfide) APPEARANCE AND COLOR: This gas mixture is a colorle ss gas which has an rotten egg-like odor, due to the presence of Hydrogen Sulfide. HOW TO DETECT THIS SUBS TANCE (warning properties): Continuous inhalation of low concentra tions of this gas mixture may cause olfactory fatigue, due to the presence of Hydrogen Sulfide, so t he odor is not a good warning property of a release of this gas mixture. In terms of leak detection, fittings and joints can be painted with a soap solution to detec t leaks, which will be indicated by a bubble fo rmation. Wet lead acetate paper can be used for leak detection. The paper turns black in the presence of Hydrogen Sulfide. Cadmium chloride sol utions can also be used. Cadmium solutions will turn yellow upon contact with Hydrogen Sulfide. 10. STABILITY and REACTIVITY STABILITY : Normally stable in gaseous state. DECOMPOSITION PRODUCTS : The thermal decomposition products of Methane in clude carbon oxides. The decomposition products of Hydrogen Sulfide include water and sulfur oxides. The other com ponents of this gas mixture do not decompose, per se, but can r eact with other compounds in the heat of a fire. MATERIALS WITH WHICH SUBSTANCE IS INCOMPATIBLE : Titanium will burn in Nitrogen (the main component of this gas mixture). Lithium reacts slowly with Nitrogen at ambient temperatures. Components of this gas mixture (Hydrogen Sulfide, Methane) are also incom patible with strong oxidizers (i.e. chlorine, bromine pentafluoride, oxygen, oxygen difluoride, and nitrogen trifluoride). Carbon Monoxide is mildly corrosive to nickel and iron (especially at high temperatures and pressures). Hydrogen Sulfide is co rrosive to most metals, because it reac ts with these substances to form metal sulfides. HAZARDOUS POLYMERIZATION : Will not occur. CONDITIONS TO AVOID : Contact with incompatible materials. Cylinders exposed to high temperatures or direct flame can rupture or burst.

SENSITIZATION OF PRODUCT: The components of this gas mixture are not k nown to be skin or respiratory sensitizers. REPRODUCTIVE TOXICITY INFORMATION : Listed below is information concerning the effe cts of this gas mixture on the human reproductive system. Mutagenicity : The components of this gas mixture are not reported to cause mutagenic effects in humans. REPRODUCTIVE TOXICITY INFORMATION (continued) : Embryotoxicity : This gas mixture contains components t hat may cause embryotoxic effects in humans; however, due to the small total amount of the components, embryotoxic effects are not expected to occur. Teratogenicity : This gas mixture is not expected to cause teratogenic effects in humans due to the small cylinder size and small total amount of all components. The Carbon Monoxide component of this gas mixture wh ich exists up to 1%, can cause teratogenic effects in humans. Severe exposure to Carbon Monoxide during pregnancy has caused adverse effects and the death of the fetus. In general, maternal symptoms are an indicator of the potential risk to the fetus since Carbon Monoxi de is toxic to the mother before it is toxic to the fetus. Reproductive Toxicity : The components of this gas mixture are not report ed to cause adverse reproductive effects in humans. A mutagen is a chemical which causes permanent changes to genetic material (DNA) such t hat the changes will propagate through generation lines. An embryotoxin is a chemical which causes damage to a developing embryo (i.e. within the firs t eight weeks of pregnancy in humans), but the damage does not propagate across generational lines. A teratogen is a chemical which causes damage to a developing fetus, but the damage does not propagate across generational lines. A reproductive toxin is any substance which interferes in any way with the reproductive process. BIOLOGICAL EXPOSURE INDICES (BEIs) : Biological Exposure Indices (BEIs) have been deter mined for components of this gas mixture, as follows: CHEMICAL DETERMINANT SAMPLING TIME BEI CARBON MONOXIDE Carboxyhemoglobin in blood Carbon monoxide in end-exhaled air End of shift End of shift 3.5% of hemoglobin 20 ppm 12. ECOLOGICAL INFORMATION ENVIRONMENTAL STABILITY: The gas will be dissipated rapidly in well-ventilated ar eas. The following environmental data are applicable to the components of this gas mixture. CARBON MONOXIDE: Atmospheric Fate: A photochemical model was used to quant ify the sensitivity of the tropospheric oxidants ozone (O 3) and OH to changes in methane (CH 4), Carbon Monoxide (CO), and NO emissions and to perturbations in climate and strato spheric chemistry. In most cases, increased CH 4 and CO emissions will suppress OH (negative coefficients) in increased O 3 (positive coefficients) ex cept in areas where NO and O 3 influenced by pollution are sufficient to in creased OH. In most regions, NO, CO, and CH 4 emission increased will suppress OH and increased O 3, but these trends may be opposed by strato spheric O3 depletion and climate change. HYDROGEN SULFIDE: Water Solubility = 1 g/242 mL at 20 \u00b0C. Plant toxicity: Continuous fumigation of plants with 300 or 3000 ppb Hydrogen Sulfi de caused leaf lesions, defoliation, and re duced growth with severity of injury correlated to dose. At higher (3.25 and 5.03 ppm) Hydrogen Sulfide, signific ant reductions in leaf CO2 and water vapor exchanges occurred, and stomatal openings we re depressed. When Hydrogen Sulfide gas was applied to 29 species of green plants for 5 hours, young, rapidly elongating tissues were more sensitive to injury than older ti ssues. Symptoms included scorching of youn g shoots and NON-FLAMMABLE GAS MIXTURE MSDS - 50018 EFFECTIVE DATE: JUNE 7, 2010 PAGE 5 OF 6 12. ECOLOGICAL INFORMATION(continued) leaves, basal and marginal scorchi ng of older leaves. Mature l eaves were unaffected. Seeds exposed to Hydrogen Sulfide gas showed delay in germination. Persistence: Converts to elem ental sulfur upon standing in water. Major Species Threatened: Aquatic and animal life plants ma y be injured if exposed to 5 ppm in air over 24 hours. Biodegradation: Microorganisms in soil and water are involved in oxidation-reduction r eactions that oxidize hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfur. Members of the genera Beggiatoa, Thioploca, and Thiotrix function in transition zones bet ween aerobic and anaerobic conditions where both molecular oxygen and hydrogen sulfide are found. Also, some photosyn thetic bacteria oxidize hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfu r. Members of the families Chlorobiaceae and Chromatiaceae (purple sulfur bac teria) are obligate aerobes and are phototropic, and are found i n waters with high H 2S concentrations. The interactions of these or ganisms form part of the global sulfur cycle. Bioconcentration: Does not have bioaccumula tion or food chain contamination potential. NITROGEN: Water Solubility = 2.4 volumes Nitrogen/100 volumes water at 0 \u00b0C; 1.6 volumes Nitrogen/100 volumes water at 20\u00b0 C. EFFECT OF MATERIAL ON PLANTS or ANIMALS: No evidence is currently available on this gas mixture's effects on plant and animal life. Hydrogen Sulfide and Carbon Monoxide, components of this gas mixt ure, can be deadly to exposed animal life, producing symptoms similar to those experienced by humans.

Thisgasmixture has been classified in accordance with the hazard criteria of the CPRand the MSDS contains all the information required by the CPR. 3. HAZARD IDENTIFICATION EMERGENCY OVERVIEW: This is a colorless, odorlessgasmixture.Releases of this gas mixture may produce oxygen-deficient atmospheres (especially in confined spaces or other poorly-ventilated environments); individuals in such atmospheres may be asphyxiated. Isobutylene, a component of this gas mixture, may cause drowsiness and other central nervous system effects in high concentrations; however, due to its low concentration in this gas mixture, this is unlikely to occur. SYMPTOMSOFOVER-EXPOSURE BY ROUTE OF EXPOSURE: The most significant route of over-exposure for this gas mixture is by inhalation. INHALATION: Due to the small size of an individual cylinder of this gas mixture, nounusual health effects from over-exposure tothe product are anticipated under routine circumstances of use. The chief health hazard associatedwiththis gas mixture is when this gas mixture contains less than 19.5% Oxygenand is released in a small, poorly-ventilated area (i.e. an enclosed or confined space). Under this circumstance, an oxygen-deficient environment may occur. Individuals breathing such an atmosphere may experience symptoms which include headaches, ringing in ears, dizziness, drowsiness, unconsciousness, nausea, vomiting, and depression of all the senses. Under some circumstances of over-exposure, death may occur. The effects associated with various levels of oxygen are as follows: NON-FLAMMABLE GAS MIXTURE MSDS - 50054 EFFECTIVE DATE:MAY 5, 2008 PAGE 1 OF 4 CONCENTRATION OF OXYGEN OBSERVED EFFECT 12-16%Oxygen: Breathingandpulse rate increase, muscular coor- dination slightly disturbed. 10-14%Oxygen: Emotional upset, abnormal fatigue, disturbed respiration. 6-10% Oxygen: Nausea, vomiting, collapse, or loss of consciousness. Below 6%: Convulsivemovements, possible respiratory collapse, and death. HEALTH EFFECTS OR RISKS FROM EXPOSURE: An Explanation inLayTerms. Over- exposure to this gas mixture maycause the following health effects: ACUTE: Due to the small size of the individual cylinder of this gas mixture,nounusual health effects from exposure to the product are anticipated under routine circumstancesof use. The most significant hazard associated with this gas mixture when it containslessthan 19.5%oxygenisthe potential for exposure to oxygen-deficient atmospheres. Symptoms of oxygen deficiency include respiratory difficulty, ringing in ears, headaches, shortnessof breath, wheezing, headache, dizziness, indigestion, nausea, unconsciousness, and death. The skin of a victim of over-exposure may have a blue color. Additionally, Isobutylene, a component of this gas mixture, may cause drowsiness or central nervous system effects in high concentrations; however, due to its low concentration in this gas mixture, this is unlikely to occur.

FIRST-AID MEASURES RESCUERS SHOULD NOT ATTEMPT TO RETRIEVE VICTIMSOF EXPOSURE TO THIS GAS MIXTURE WITHOUT ADEQUATE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. At a minimum, Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus must be worn. No unusual health effects are anticipated after exposure to this gas mixture, due to the small cylinder size. If any adverse symptom develops after over-exposure to this gas mixture, remove victim(s) to fresh air as quickly as possible. Only trained personnel should administer supplemental oxygenand/orcardio-pulmonary resuscitation if necessary. Victim(s) who experience any adverse effect after over-exposure to this gas mixture must be taken for medical attention. Rescuers should be taken for medical attention if necessary. Take a copy of the label and the MSDS to physician or other health professional with victim(s). MEDICAL CONDITIONS AGGRAVATED BY EXPOSURE: Acute or chronic respiratoryconditionsmay be aggravated by over-exposure to this gas mixture. RECOMMENDATIONS TO PHYSICIANS: Administer oxygen, if necessary;treat symptoms and eliminate exposure. 5.

Explosion Sensitivity to Mechanical Impact: Not sensitive. Explosion Sensitivity to Static Discharge: Not sensitive. SPECIAL FIRE-FIGHTING PROCEDURES: Structural firefighters must wear Self- Contained Breathing Apparatus and full protective equipment. 6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES LEAK RESPONSE: Due to the small size and contentofthecylinder,anaccidental release of this gas mixture presents significantly less risk of an oxygen deficient environment and other safety hazards than a similar releasefrom a larger cylinder. However, as with any chemical release, extreme caution must be used during emergencyresponse procedures. In the event of a releaseinwhich the atmosphere is unknown, and in which other chemicals are potentially involved, evacuate immediate area. Such releases should be responded to bytrainedpersonnel using pre- planned procedures. Proper protective equipment should be used. In case of a leak, clear the affected area, protect people, and respond with trained personnel. Allow the gas mixture to dissipate.Ifnecessary,monitorthesurrounding area (and the original area of the release) for oxygen. Oxygen levels must be above 19.5% before non-emergency personnel are allowed to re-enter area. If leaking incidentally from the cylinder, contact your supplier. 7. HANDLING and USE WORKPRACTICES AND HYGIENE PRACTICES: Be aware of any signs of dizziness or fatigue; exposures to fatal concentrations of this gas mixture could occur without any significant warningsymptoms, due to oxygen deficiency. Do not attempt to repair, adjust, or in any other way modify the cylinders containing this gas mixture. If there is a malfunction or another type of operational problem, contact nearest distributor immediately. STORAGE AND HANDLING PRACTICES:Cylinders should be firmly secured to prevent falling or being knocked-over.

Vapors may be ignited rapidly when exposed to heat, spark, open flame or other source of ignition. When mixed with air and exposed to an ignition source, flammable vapor s can burn in the open or explode in confined spaces. Being heavier than air, vapors may travel long distances to an ignition source and flash back. Runoff to sewer may cause fire or explosion hazard. Hazardous Combustion Products Carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and non-combusted hydrocarbons (smoke). Extinguishing Media SMALL FIRES: Any extinguisher suitable for Class B fires, dry chemical, CO2, water spray, fire fighting foam, or gaseous extinguishing agent. LARGE FIRES: Water spray, fog or fire fighting foam. Water may be ineffective for fighting the fire, but may be used to cool fire-exposed containers. Unsuitable Extinguishing Media None Fire Fighting Equipment/Instructions Small fires in the incipient (beginning) stage may typically be extinguished using handheld portable fire extinguishers and other fire fighting equipment. Firefighting ac tivities that may result in potential exposure to high heat, smoke or toxic by-products of combustion shou ld require NIOSH/MSHA- appr oved pressure-demand self- contained breathing apparatus with full facepiece and full protective clothing. Isolate area around container involved in fire. Cool tanks, shells, and containers expo sed to fire and excessive heat with water. For massive fires the use of unmanned hose holders or monitor nozzl es may be advantageous to further minimize personnel exposure. Major fires may require withdrawal, allowing the tank to burn. Large storage tank fires typically require specially trained personnel and equipment to extinguish t he fire, often including the need for properly applied fire fighting foam. * * * Section 6 - Accidental Release Measures * * * Recovery and Neutralization Carefully contain and stop the source of the spill, if safe to do so.

Consider wind direction; stay upwind and uphill, if possible. Evaluate the dire ction of product travel, diking, sewers , etc. to confirm spill areas. Spills may infiltrate subsurface soil and groundwater; professi onal assistance may be necessary to determine the extent of subsurface impact. Personal Precautions and Protective Equipment Response and clean-up crews must be properly trained and must utilize proper protective equipment (see Section 8). Environmental Precautions Protect bodies of water by diking, absorbents, or absor bent boom, if possible. Do not flush down sewer or drainage systems, unless system is designed and permitted to handle such material. The use of fire fighting foam may be useful in certain situations to reduce vapors. The proper use of water spray may effectively disperse product vapors or the liquid itself, preventing contact with ignition sources or areas/equipment that require protection.

Composition Information: Name CAS Number % Concentration Gasoline concentrations are percent by weight unless material is a gas. Gas concentrations are in percent by volume. 4. FIRST AID MEASURES First Aid Measures General Advice: In case of accident or if you feel unwell, seek medical advice immediately (show directions for use or safety data sheet if possible). Inhalation: Remove to fresh air. If not breathing, institute rescue breathing. If breathing is difficult, ensure airway is clear, give oxygen and continue to monitor. If heart has stopped, immediately begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Keep affected person warm and at rest. If symptoms occur get medical attention. Skin Contact: Immediately wash exposed skin with plenty of soap and water while removing contaminated clothing and shoes. May be absorbed through the skin in harmful amounts. Get medical attention if irritation persists. Any injection injury from high pressure equipment should be evaluated immediately by a physician as potentially serious (See NOTES TO PHYSICIAN). Place contaminated clothing in closed container until cleaned or discarded. If clothing is to be laundered, inform the person performing the operation of contaminant's hazardous properties. Destroy contaminated, non-chemical resistant footwear. Eye Contact: Flush immediately with large amounts of water for at least 15 minutes. Eyelids should be held away from the eyeball to ensure thorough rinsing. Gently remove contacts while flushing. Get medical attention if irritation persists. SDS ID NO.: 0127MAR019 Product name: Marathon Petroleum Gasoline - All Grades Page 3 of 230127MAR019 Marathon Petroleum Gasoline - All GradesRevision Date: 06/01/2016_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Ingestion: Do not induce vomiting because of danger of aspirating liquid into lungs, causing serious damage and chemical pneumonitis. If spontaneous vomiting occurs, keep head below hips, or if patient is lying down, turn body and head to side to prevent aspiration and monitor for breathing difficulty. Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. Keep affected person warm and at rest. GET IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION. Most important signs and symptoms, both short-term and delayed with overexposure Adverse Effects: Irritating to the skin and mucous membranes. Symptoms may include redness, itching, and inflammation. May cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and signs of nervous system depression: headache, drowsiness, dizziness, loss of coordination, disorientation and fatigue. Aspiration hazard. May cause coughing, chest pains, shortness of breath, pulmonary edema and/or chemical pneumonitis. Repeated or prolonged skin contact may cause drying, reddening, itching and cracking. Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed Notes To Physician: INHALATION: This material (or a component) sensitizes the myocardium to the effects of sympathomimetic amines. Epinephrine and other sympathomimetic drugs may initiate cardiac arrhythmias in individuals exposed to this material. Administration of sympathomimetic drugs should be avoided. SKIN: Leaks or accidents involving high-pressure equipment may inject a stream of material through the skin and initially produce an injury that may not appear serious. Only a small puncture wound may appear on the skin surface but, without proper treatment and depending on the nature, original pressure, volume, and location of the injected material, can compromise blood supply to an affected body part. Prompt surgical debridement of the wound may be necessary to prevent irreversible loss of function and/or the affected body part. High pressure injection injuries may be SERIOUS SURGICAL EMERGENCIES. INGESTION: This material represents a significant aspiration and chemical pneumonitis hazard. Induction of emesis is not recommended. 5. FIRE-FIGHTING MEASURES Suitable extinguishing media For small fires, Class B fire extinguishing media such as CO2, dry chemical, foam (AFFF/ATC) or water spray can be used. For large fires, water spray, fog or foam (AFFF/ATC) can be used. Firefighting should be attempted only by those who are adequately trained and equipped with proper protective equipment. Unsuitable extinguishing media Do not use straight water streams to avoid spreading fire. Specific hazards arising from the chemical This product has been determined to be an extremely flammable liquid per the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard and should be handled accordingly. May accumulate electrostatic charge and ignite or explode. Vapors may travel along the ground or be moved by ventilation and ignited by many sources such as pilot lights, sparks, electric motors, static discharge, or other ignition sources at locations distant from material handling. Flashback can occur along vapor trail. For additional fire related information, see NFPA 30 or the Emergency Response Guidebook 128. Hazardous combustion products Smoke, carbon monoxide, and other products of incomplete combustion. Explosion data Sensitivity to Mechanical Impact No. Sensitivity to Static Discharge Yes. SDS ID NO.: 0127MAR019 Product name: Marathon Petroleum Gasoline - All Grades0127MAR019 Marathon Petroleum Gasoline - All Grades Page 4 of 23Revision Date: 06/01/2016_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Special protective equipment and precautions for firefighters Firefighters should wear full protective clothing and positive-pressure self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) with a full face-piece, as appropriate. Avoid using straight water streams. Water may be ineffective in extinguishing low flash point fires, but can be used to cool exposed surfaces. Avoid excessive water spray application. Water spray and foam (AFFF/ATC) must be applied carefully to avoid frothing and from as far a distance as possible. Keep run-off water out of sewers and water sources. Additional firefighting tactics FIRES INVOLVING TANKS OR CAR/TRAILER LOADS: Fight fire from maximum distance or use unmanned hose holders or monitor nozzles. Cool containers with flooding quantities of water until well after the fire is out. Do not direct water at source of leak or safety devices; icing may occur. Withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from venting safety devices or discoloration of tank. ALWAYS stay away from tanks engulfed in fire. For massive fire, use unmanned hose holders or monitor nozzles: if this is impossible, withdraw from area and let fire burn. EVACUATION: Consider initial downwind evacuation for at least 1000 feet. If tank, rail car or tank truck is involved in a fire, ISOLATE for 5280 feet (1 mile) in all directions; also, consider initial evacuation of 5280 feet (1 mile) in all directions. 6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES Personal precautions: Keep public away. Isolate and evacuate area. Shut off source if safe to do so. Eliminate all ignition sources. Protective equipment: Use personal protection measures as recommended in Section 8. Emergency procedures: Advise authorities and National Response Center (800-424-8802) if the product has entered a water course or sewer. Notify local health and pollution control agencies, if appropriate. Environmental precautions: Avoid release to the environment. Avoid subsoil penetration. Ethanol in gasoline phase seperates in contact with water. Monitor downstream for dissolved ethanol or other appropriate indicators. Methods and materials for containment:Contain liquid with sand or soil. Prevent spilled material from entering storm drains, sewers, and open waterways. Methods and materials for cleaning up:Use suitable absorbent materials such as vermiculite, sand, or clay to clean up residual liquids. Recover and return free product to proper containers. When recovering free liquids ensure all equipment is grounded and bonded. Use only non-sparking tools. 7. HANDLING AND STORAGEInstability 0 Special Hazard -0127MAR019 Marathon Petroleum Gasoline - All Grades NFPA Revision Date: 06/01/2016 SDS ID NO.: 0127MAR019Health 1 Product name: Marathon Petroleum Gasoline - All Grades Page 5 of 23Flammability 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Safe Handling Precautions: NEVER SIPHON THIS PRODUCT BY MOUTH. Use appropriate grounding and bonding practices. Static accumulating flammable liquid. Bonding and grounding may be insufficient to eliminate the hazard from static electricity. Do not expose to heat, open flames, strong oxidizers or other sources of ignition. Vapors may travel along the ground or be moved by ventilation. Flashback may occur along vapor trails. No smoking. Use only non-sparking tools. Avoid contact with skin, eyes and clothing. Avoid breathing fumes, gas, or vapors. Use only with adequate ventilation. Avoid repeated and prolonged skin contact. Use personal protection measures as recommended in Section 8. Exercise good personal hygiene including removal of soiled clothing and prompt washing with soap and water. Do not cut, drill, grind or weld on empty containers since explosive residues may remain. Refer to applicable EPA, OSHA, NFPA and consistent state and local requirements. Hydrocarbons are basically non-conductors of electricity and can become electrostatically charged during mixing, filtering, pumping at high flow rates or loading and transfer operations. If this charge reaches a sufficiently high level, sparks can form that may ignite the vapors of flammable liquids. Sudden release of hot organic chemical vapors or mists from process equipment operating under elevated temperature and pressure, or sudden ingress of air into vacuum equipment may result in ignition of vapors or mists without the presence of obvious ignition sources. Nozzle spouts must be kept in contact with the containers or tank during the entire filling operation. Portable containers should never be filled while in or on a motor vehicle or marine craft. Containers should be placed on the ground. Static electric discharge can ignite fuel vapors when filling non-grounded containers or vehicles on trailers. The nozzle spout must be kept in contact with the container before and during the entire filling operation. Use only approved containers. A buildup of static electricity can occur upon re-entry into a vehicle during fueling especially in cold or dry climate conditions. The charge is generated by the action of dissimilar fabrics (i.e., clothing and upholstery) rubbing across each other as a person enters/exits the vehicle. A flash fire can result from this discharge if sufficient flammable vapors are present. Therefore, do not get back in your vehicle while refueling. Cellular phones and other electronic devices may have the potential to emit electrical charges (sparks). Sparks in potentially explosive atmospheres (including fueling areas such as gas stations) could cause an explosion if sufficient flammable vapors are present. Therefore, turn off cellular phones and other electronic devices when working in potentially explosive atmospheres or keep devices inside your vehicle during refueling. High-pressure injection of any material through the skin is a serious medical emergency even though the small entrance wound at the injection site may not initially appear serious. These injection injuries can occur from high-pressure equipment such as paint spray or grease or guns, fuel injectors, or pinhole leaks in hoses or hydraulic lines and should all be considered serious. High pressure injection injuries may be SERIOUS SURGICAL EMERGENCIES (See First Aid Section 4). Storage Conditions: Store in properly closed containers that are appropriately labeled and in a cool, well-ventilated area. Do not store near an open flame, heat or other sources of ignition. Incompatible Materials Strong oxidizing agents. 8.

In a similar study, no increased risk of kidney cancer was observed among petroleum refinery workers, but there was a slight trend in the incidence of kidney cancers among service station employees, especially after a 30-year latency period. Altered mental state, drowsiness, damage (so-called Petrol Sniffer's Encephalopathy), delirium, seizures, and sudden death have been reported from repeated overexposure to some hydrocarbon solvents, naphthas, and gasoline. ISOPARAFFINS: Studies in laboratory animals have shown that long-term exposure to similar materials (isoparaffins) can cause kidney damage and kidney cancer in male laboratory rats. However, in-depth research indicates that these findings are unique to the male rat, and that these effects are not relevant to humans. C9 AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS: A developmental inhalation study was conducted in laboratory mice. Increased implantation losses, reduced fetal weights, delayed ossification and an increased incidence of cleft palate were observed at the highest exposure level (1,500 ppm). This exposure level was extremely toxic to pregnant female mice (44% mortality). Reduced fetal body weights were also observed at 500 ppm. A multi-generation reproduction inhalation study was conducted in laboratory rats. Reductions in pup weights, pup weight gain, litter size, and pup survival were observed at 1,500 ppm, an exposure level at which significant maternal toxicity was observed. Reduced pup weight gain was also observed at 500 ppm. PENTANES: Studies of pentane isomers in laboratory animals indicate exposure to extremely high levels (roughly 10 vol.%) may induce cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) which may be serious or fatal. BUTANES: Studies in laboratory animals indicate exposure to extremely high levels of butanes (1-10 or higher vol.% in air) may cause cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) which may be serious or fatal. TOLUENE: Case studies of persons abusing toluene suggest isolated incidences of adverse effects on the fetus including birth defects. Abuse of toluene at high concentrations (e.g., glue sniffing and solvent abuse) has been associated with adverse effects on the liver, kidney and nervous system, and can cause CNS depression, cardiac arrhythmias, and death. Studies of workers indicate longterm exposure may be related to impaired color vision and hearing. Some studies of workers suggest longterm exposure may be related to neurobehavioral and cognitive changes. Some of these effects have been observed in laboratory animals following repeated exposure to high levels of toluene. Several studies of workers suggest longterm exposure may be related to small increases in spontaneous abortions and changes in some gonadotropic hormones. However, the weight of evidence does not indicate toluene is a reproductive hazard to humans. Studies in laboratory animals indicate some changes in reproductive organs following high levels of exposure, but no significant effects on mating performance or reproduction were observed. Case studies of persons abusing toluene suggest isolated incidences of adverse effects on the fetus including birth defects. Findings in laboratory animals have been largely negative. Positive findings include small increases in minor skeletal and visceral malformations and developmental delays following very high levels of maternal exposure. Studies of workers indicate long-term exposure may be related to effects on the liver, kidney and blood, but these appear to be limited to changes in serum enzymes and decreased leukocyte counts. Adverse effects on the liver, kidney, thymus and nervous system were observed in animal studies following very high levels of exposure. The relevance of these findings to humans is not clear at this time. XYLENES, ALL ISOMERS: Overexposure to xylene may cause upper respiratory tract irritation, headache, cyanosis, blood serum changes, nervous system damage and narcosis. Effects may be increased by the use of alcoholic beverages. Evidence of liver and kidney impairment were reported in workers recovering from a gross overexposure. Effects from Prolonged or Repeated Exposure: Impaired neurological function was reported SDS ID NO.: 0127MAR0190127MAR019 Marathon Petroleum Gasoline - All Grades Product name: Marathon Petroleum Gasoline - All Grades Page 10 of 23Revision Date: 06/01/2016_____________________________________________________________________________________________ in workers exposed to solvents including xylene. Studies in laboratory animals have shown evidence of impaired hearing following high levels of exposure. Studies in laboratory animals suggest some changes in reproductive organs following high levels of exposure but no significant effects on reproduction were observed. Studies in laboratory animals indicate skeletal and visceral malformations, developmental delays, and increased fetal resorptions following extremely high levels of maternal exposure with evidence of maternal toxicity. The relevance of these observations to humans is not clear at this time. Adverse effects on the liver, kidney, bone marrow (changes in blood cell parameters) were observed in laboratory animals following high levels of exposure. The relevance of these observations to humans is not clear at this time. 1,2,4-TRIMETHYLBENZENE: The following information pertains to a mixture of C9 aromatic hydrocarbons, over 40% of which was composed of 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene. A developmental inhalation study was conducted in laboratory mice. Increased implantation losses, reduced fetal weights, delayed ossification and an increased incidence of cleft palate were observed at the highest exposure level (1,500 ppm). This exposure level was extremely toxic to pregnant female mice (44% mortality). Reduced fetal body weights were also observed at 500 ppm. A multi-generation reproduction inhalation study was conducted in laboratory rats. Reductions in pup weights, pup weight gain, litter size, and pup survival were observed at 1,500 ppm, an exposure level at which significant maternal toxicity was observed. Reduced pup weight gain was also observed at 500 ppm. Embryotoxicity has been reported in studies of laboratory animals. Adverse effects included increased implantation losses, reduced fetal weights, delayed ossification and an increased incidence of cleft palate.<n><n> N-HEXANE: Long-term or repeated exposure to n-hexane can cause peripheral nerve damage. Initial symptoms are numbness of the fingers and toes. Also, motor weakness can occur in the digits, but may also involve muscles of the arms, thighs and forearms. The onset of these symptoms may be delayed for several months to a year after the beginning of exposure. Testicular atrophy and partial to full loss of the germ cell line were observed in sub-chronic high-dose inhalation studies of laboratory rodents. These effects appeared irreversible. Rodent reproduction studies have shown evidence of reduced fetal weight but no frank malformations. CUMENE: Overexposure to cumene may cause upper respiratory tract irritation and CNS depression. Studies in laboratory animals indicate evidence of respiratory tract hyperplasia, and adverse effects on the liver, kidney and adrenal glands following high level exposure. The relevance of these findings to humans is not clear at this time. Findings from lifetime laboratory rodent inhalation studies were as follows: In F344/N rats: an increased incidence of renal carcinomas and adenomas, respiratory epithelial adenomas, and interstitial cell adenomas of the testes. In B6C3F1 mice: an increased incidence of carcinomas and adenomas of the bronchi and lung, liver neoplasms, hemangiosarcomas of the spleen, and adenomas of the thyroid. ETHYLBENZENE: Findings from a 2-year inhalation study in rodents conducted by NTP were as follows: Effects were observed only at the highest exposure level (750 ppm). At this level the incidence of renal tumors was elevated in male rats (tubular carcinomas) and female rats (tubular adenomas). The incidence of tumors was also elevated in male mice (alveolar and bronchiolar carcinomas) and female mice (hepatocellular carcinomas). benzene as \"possibly carcinogenic to humans\" (Group 2B). Studies in laboratory animals indicate some evidence of post-implantation deaths following high levels of maternal exposure. The relevance of these findings to humans is not clear at this time. Studies in laboratory animals indicate limited evidence of renal malformations, resorptions, and developmental delays following high levels of maternal exposure with evidence of maternal toxicity. The relevance of these findings to humans is not clear at this time. Studies in laboratory animals have demonstrated evidence of ototoxicity (hearing loss) following exposure levels as low as 300 ppm for 5 days. Studies in laboratory animals indicate some evidence of adverse effects on the liver, kidney, thyroid, and pituitary gland. BENZENE: Studies of workers exposed to benzene show clear evidence that overexposure can cause cancer and other diseases of the blood forming organs including Acute SDS ID NO.: 0127MAR0190127MAR019 Marathon Petroleum Gasoline - All Grades Product name: Marathon Petroleum Gasoline - All Grades Page 11 of 23Revision Date: 06/01/2016_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Myelogenous Leukemia (AML), and Aplastic Anemia (AA), an often fatal disease. Some studies suggest overexposure to benzene may also be associated with Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). Findings from a case control study of workers exposed to benzene was reported during the 2009 Benzene Symposium in Munich included an increase in Acute Myeloid Leukemias (FL) in some occupational categories. Some studies of workers exposed to benzene have shown an association with increased rates of chromosome aberrations in circulating lymphocytes. One study of women workers exposed to benzene suggested a weak association with irregular menstruation. However, other studies of workers exposed to benzene have not demonstrated clear evidence of an effect on fertility or reproductive outcome in humans. Benzene can cross the placenta and affect the developing fetus. Cases of AA have been reported in the offspring of persons severely overexposed to benzene. Studies in laboratory animals indicate that prolonged, repeated exposure to high levels of benzene vapor can cause bone marrow suppression and cancer in multiple organ systems. Studies in laboratory animals show evidence of adverse effects on male reproductive organs following high levels of exposure but no significant effects on reproduction have been observed. Embryotoxicity has been reported in studies of laboratory animals but effects were limited to reduced fetal weight and minor skeletal variations. Benzene has been classified as a proven human carcinogen by OSHA and a Group 1 (Carcinogenic to Humans) material by IARC. The current proposed IARC classification for benzene is summarized as follows: Sufficient evidence for Acute Myeloid Leukemia; limited evidence for Acute Lymphatic Leukemia, Chronic Severe jaundice, neurotoxicity (kernicterus) and fatalities have been reported in young children and infants as a result of hemolytic anemia from overexposure to naphthalene. Persons with glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are more prone to the hemolytic effects of naphthalene. Adverse effects on the kidney have been reported in persons overexposed to naphthalene but these effects are believed to be a consequence of hemolytic anemia, and not a direct effect. Hemolytic anemia has been observed in laboratory animals exposed to naphthalene. Laboratory rodents exposed to naphthalene vapor for 2 years (lifetime studies) developed non-neoplastic and neoplastic tumors and inflammatory lesions of the nasal and respiratory tract. Cataracts and other adverse effects on the eye have been observed in laboratory animals exposed to high levels of naphthalene. Findings from a large number of bacterial and mammalian cell mutation assays have been negative. A few studies have shown chromosomal effects (elevated levels of Sister Chromatid Exchange or chromosomal aberrations) in vitro. Naphthalene has been classified as Possibly Carcinogenic to Humans (2B) by IARC, based on findings from studies in laboratory animals. CARBON MONOXIDE: is a chemical asphyxiant with no warning properties (such as odor). At 400-500 ppm for 1 hour headache and dyspnea may occur. If activity is increased, symptoms of overexposure may include nausea, irritability, increased respiration, tinnitus, sweating, chest pain, confusion, impaired judgement, dizziness, weakness, drowsiness, ataxia, irregular heart beat, cyanosis and pallor. Levels in excess of 1000 ppm can result in collapse, loss of conciousness, respiratory failure and death. Extremely high concentrations (12,800 ppm) can cause immediate unconsciousness and death in 1-3 minutes. Repeated anoxia can lead to central nervous system damage and peripheral neuropathy, with loss of sensation in the fingers, amnesia, and mental deterioration and possible congestive heart failure. Damage may also occur to the fetus, lung, liver, kidney, spleen, cardiovascular system and other organs. WHOLLY-VAPORIZED UNLEADED GASOLINE: Lifetime exposure to wholly vaporized unleaded gasoline produced an increased incidence of liver tumors in female mice exposed to the highest exposure concentration (2056 ppm) and -2 urinary globulin-mediated kidney tumors in male rats. No exposure-related tumors were observed in male mice or female rats. The male-specific rat kidney tumors are not considered relevant to human health. Mice receiving lifetime repeated skin application of various petroleum naphthas exhibited an irritation-dependent increased incidence of skin tumors. Additional studies suggest that these tumors occur through a mechanism that may not be relevant to human health. Epidemiological data from over 18,000 petroleum marketing and distribution workers SDS ID NO.: 0127MAR0190127MAR019 Marathon Petroleum Gasoline - All Grades Product name: Marathon Petroleum Gasoline - All Grades Page 12 of 23Revision Date: 06/01/2016_____________________________________________________________________________________________ showed no increased risk of leukemia, multiple myeloma, or kidney cancer resulting from gasoline exposure. Unleaded gasoline has been identified as possibly carcinogenic to humans (2B) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). COMBUSTION ENGINE EXHAUST: Chronic inhalation studies of gasoline engine exhaust in mice, rats and hamsters did not produce any carcinogenic effects. Condensates/extracts of gasoline engine exhaust produced an increase in tumors compared to controls when testing by skin painting, subcutaneous injection, intratracheal instillation or implantation into the lungs. Gasoline exhaust has been classified as possibly carcinogenic to humans (2B) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).

Section 11: Toxicological Information Routes of Entry: Inhalation. Ingestion. Acute oral toxicity (LD50): 30000 mg/kg [Rat]. Chronic Effects on Humans: May cause damage to the following organs: liver, cardiovascular system, upper respiratory tract, pancreas. Other Toxic Effects on Humans: Slightly hazardous in case of skin contact (irritant), of ingestion, of inhalation. Special Remarks on Toxicity to Animals: Not available. Special Remarks on Chronic Effects on Humans: Not available. Special Remarks on other Toxic Effects on Humans: Acute Potential Health Effects: Skin: Iron metal filings or dust: May cause skin irritation by mechanical action. Iron metal wire: Not likely to cause skin irritation Eyes: Iron metal filings or dust: Can irritate eyes by mechanical action. Iron metal wire: No hazard. Will not cause eye irritation. Inhalation: Iron dust: Can irritate the respiratory tract by mechanical action. Iron metal wire or filings: Not an inhalation hazard unless metal is heated. If metal is heated, fumes will be released. Inhalation of these fumes may cause \"fume metal fever\", which is characterized by flu-like symptoms. Symptoms may include metallic taste, fever, nausea, vomiting, chills, cough, weakness, chest pain, generalized muscle pain/aches, and increased white blood cell count. Ingestion: Iron metal wire: Not an ingestion hazard: Iron metal filings or dust: The amount of ingested iron which constitutes a toxic dose is not well defined. Proposed toxic doses of elemental iron are 20 mg/kg for gastrointestinal irritation to greater than 60 mg/kg for systemic toxicity. Gastrointestinal effects are the first signs to appear, with hemorrhagic vomiting and diarrhea, hematochezia, abdominal pain, lethargy, metabolic acidosis, coagulaopathy, shock, coma and convulsions developing from 0 to 6 hours after ingestion. Leukocytosis may also occur. An asymptomatic phase may ensue at 6 to 12 hours postingestion, followed by hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, hepatic and renal failure, severe acidosis, cyanosis, fever, CNS depression (lethargy, restlessness and/or confusion seizures), hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse/cardiac failure in 12 to 48 hours. Hepatic cirrhosis, gastrointestinal scarring and/or strictures may arise in 2 to 6 weeks. It may also cause an anaphylactoid reaction. Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema also develop in severe cases of iron intoxication. Chronic Potential Health Effects: Inhalation: Chronic inhalation of iron dust can lead to accumulation in the lungs and a characteristic stippled appearance on X-rays. This condition, called SIDEROSIS, is considered benign in that it does not interfere with lung function and does not predispose to other disease. Chronic inhalation of iron dust may also cause fibrosis in the lungs. Ingestion: Clinical signs of iron overload appear when the total body iron is 5 to 10 times higher than normal. Neurobehavioral defects including depression, decreased activity, habituation, reflex startle, and conditioned avoidance response performance may occur. However, similiar effects were also seen in iron defficiency. It is therefore likely that these behavioral effects are secondary to general toxicity. High serum iron levels may be associated with an increased risk of fatal acute myocardial infarction (MI). Skin: Prolonged or repeated contact may cause hypersensivity. Section 12: Ecological Information Ecotoxicity: Not available.p. 5BOD5 and COD: Not available. Products of Biodegradation: Possibly hazardous short term degradation products are not likely. However, long term degradation products may arise. Toxicity of the Products of Biodegradation: The product itself and its products of degradation are not toxic.

Use only explosion -proof equipment Wear leather safety gloves and safety shoes when handling cylinders. Protect cylinders from physical damage; do not drag, roll, slide or drop. While moving cylinder, always keep in place removable valve cover. Never attempt to lift a cylinder by its cap; the cap is intended solely to protect the valve. When moving cylinders, even for short distances, use a cart (trolley, hand truck, etc.) designed to transport cylind ers. Never insert an object (e.g, wrench, screwdriver, pry bar) into cap openings; doing so may damage the valve and cause a leak. Use an adjustable strap wrench to remove over -tight or rusted caps. Slowly open the valve. If the valve is hard to open, discontinue use and contact your supplier. Close the container valve after each use; keep closed even when empty. Never apply flame or localized heat directly to any part of the container. High temperatures may damage the container and could cause the pressure relief device to fail prematurely, venting the container contents. For other precautions in using this product, see section 16.

Eyes: Moderately irritating to eye tissues. ! Skin: Can be absorbed through intact skin, may cause de-fatting, potential for chloracne. ! Inhalation: Possible liver injury. ! Ingestion: Slightly toxic; reasonably anticipated to be carcinogenic. EFFECTS OF OVER-EXPOSURE Can cause dermatological symptoms; however, these are reversible upon removal of exposure source. FIRST AID MEASURES !Eyes: Irrigate immediately with copious quantities of running water for at least 15 minutes if liquid or solid PCBs get into them. !Skin:Contaminated clothing should be removed and the skin washed thoroughly with soap and water. Hot PCBs may cause thermal burns. !Inhalation: Remove to fresh air; if skin rash or respiratory irritation persists, consult a physician (if electrical equipment arcs over, PCBs may decompose to produce hydrochloric acid). !Ingestion: Consult a physician. Do not induce vomiting or give any oily laxatives. (If large amounts are ingested, gastric lavage is suggested). PROCEDURES Standard fire-fighting wearing apparel and self-contained breathing apparatus should be worn when fighting fires that involve possible exposure to chemical combustion products. Fire fighting equipment should be thoroughly cleaned and decontaminated after use. UNUSUAL FIRE/EXPLOSION HAZARD If a PCB transformer is involved in a fire-related incident, the owner of the transformer is required to report the incident. Consult and follow appropriate federal, provincial and local regulations. Note:When askarel liquid becomes involved in a fire, toxic by-products of combustion are typically produced including polychlorinated dibenzofurans and polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, both known carcinogens. The structures of these chemical species are as follows: Note: 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-dibenzo-p-dioxin is one of the most potent teratogenic, mutagenic and carcinogenic agents known to man. SPILL RELEASE PROCEDURES Cleanup & disposal of liquid PCBs are strictly regulated by the federal government. Ventilate area. Contain spill/leak. Remove spill by means of absorptive material. Spill clean-up personnel should use proper protective clothing. All wastes and residues containing PCBs should be collected, containerized, marked and disposed of in the manner prescribed by applicable federal, provincial and local laws. HANDLING AND STORAGE PRECAUTIONS Care should be taken to prevent entry into the environment through spills, leakage, use, vaporization, or disposal of liquid. Avoid prolonged breathing of vapours or mists. Avoid contact with eyes or prolonged contact with skin. Comply with all federal, provincial and local regulations. OTHER PRECAUTIONS Federal regulations require PCBs, PCB items, storage areas, transformer vaults, and transport vehicles to be appropriately labelled. RESPIRATORY PROTECTION Use OHSA approved equipment when airborne exposure limits are exceeded. Full facepiece equipment is recommended and, if used, replaces need for face shield and/or chemical splash goggles. The respirator use limitations specified by the manufacturer must be observed. VENTILATION Provide natural or mechanical ventilation to control exposure levels below airborne exposure levels. PROTECTIVE GLOVES:Wear appropriate chemical resistant gloves to prevent skin contact.

Taiwan BEI : 1 mg/l (before on duty). Engineering control 1. Process should be located at least 17 meter (50 feet) away from open flames and all high temperature operations likely to cause ignition of the styrene monomer vapor. 2. In venting styrene monomer vapors, consideration should be given to possible halogenation of the vapors by low concentrations of free chlorine and bromine with the resultant formation of lacrimations. 3. Process should be designed so that the operator is not exposed to direct contact with Toluene or the vapor. The technical problems of designing equipment, providing adequate ve ntilation and operating procedures which promise maximum security and economy, can best be handled by competent engineers. 4. It is essential for safety that equipment be used and maintained as recommended by the manufacturer. 5. Tanks used to store or process Toluene should be closed vessels vented to a safe point of discharge in the outside atmosphere away from operating stations, ro adways, and at least 17 meter (50 feet) from possible sources of ignitions. All sparks, flames, heated surface, or other sources of ignition should be kept away from all vents. It is advisable, to provide suction on vessels when inspection or observation openings are made, to minimize or eliminate escape of vapors. Personal protective equipment Eye Protection: Safety glasses equipped with side shields are recommended as minimum protection in industrial settings. Chemical goggles should be worn during transfer operations or when there is a likelihood of misting, splashing, or spraying of this material. A suitable emergency eye wash water and safety shower should be located near the work station. Skin protection: Wear impervious protective clothing, including boots, gloves, lab coat, apron or coveralls, as appropriate, to prevent skin contact. Clothing: Avoid skin contact. Wear long-sleeved fire-retardant garm ents (e.g., Nomex\u00ae) while working with flammable and combustible liquids. Additional chemical-resistant protective gear may be required if splashing or spraying conditions exist. This may include an apron, boots and additional facial protection. If product comes in contact with clothing, immediately remove soaked clothing and shower. Promptly remove and discard contaminated leather goods. Respirators: For known vapor concentrations above the occupational exposure guidelines (see below), use a NIOSH-ap proved organic vapor respirator if adequate protection is provided. Protection factors vary depending upon the type of respirator used. Respirators should be used in accordance wi th OSHA requirements (29 CFR 1910.134). Fo r airborne vapor concentrations that exceed the recommended protection factors for orga nic vapor respirators, use a full-face, positive- pressure, supplied air respirator.

Symptoms (treatments as indicated in Section 4) Eye: The liquid produces a high level of eye discomfort and is capable of causing pain and severe conjunctivitis. Corneal injury may develop, with possible permanent impairment of vision , if not promptly and adequately treated. There is evidence that material may produce eye irritation in some persons and produce eye damage 24 hours or more after instillation. Severe inflammation may be expected with pain. There may be damage to the cornea. Unless treatment is prompt and adequate there may be permanent loss of vision. Conjunctiv itis can occur following repeated exposure. Skin: Contact with the material may damage the health of the individual; systemic effects may result following absorption. The material may cause moderate inflammation of the skin either follo wing direct contact or after a delay of some time. Repeated exposure can cause contact dermatitis which is characterized by redness, swelling and blistering. Entry into the blood-stream, through, for example, cuts, abrasions or lesions, may produce systemic injury with harmful effects. Examine the skin prior to the use of the material and ensure that any external damage is suitably protected. Ingestion: Accidental ingestion of the material may be harmful; animal experiments indicate that ingestion of less than 150 gram may be fatal or may produce serious damage to the health of the individual. Swallowing of the liquid may cause aspiration into the lungs with the risk of chemical pneumonitis ; serious consequences may result. (ICSC13733). Considered an unlikely route of entry in commercial/industrial environments. The liquid may produce gastrointestinal discomfort and may be harmful if swallowed. Ingestion may result in nausea, pain and vomiting. Vomit entering the lungs by aspiration may causepotentially lethal chemical pneumonitis. Inhalation: Inhalation of vapours or aerosols (mists, fumes), generated by the material during the course of normal handling, may be damaging to the health of the individual. There is some evidence to suggest that the material can cause respiratory irritation in some persons. The body's response to such irritation can cause further lung damage. Inhalation of vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness. This may be accompanied by sl eepiness, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of co-ordination, and vertigo. Inhalation of high concentrations of gas/vapour causes lung irritation with coughing and nausea, central nervous depression with headache and dizziness, slowing of reflexes, fatigue and inco-ordination. If exposure to highly concentrated solvent atmosphere is prolonged this may lead to narcosis, unconsciousness, even coma and possible death. The use of a quantity of material in an unventilated or confined sp ace may result in increased exposure and an irritating atmospher e developing. Before starting c onsider control of exposure by mechanical ventilation. Chronic exposure: There has been some concern that this material can cause cancer or mutations but there is not enough data to make an assessment. Substance accumulation, in the human bo dy, may occur and may cause some concern following repeated or long-term occupational exposure.

Water flea: \u00d1 Biocencentration factor (BCF): 1.67 380 Persistence and degradability 1. The material are expected to form a sl ick on the surface of waters after release in calm sea conditions. This is expected to evaporate and enter the atmosphere where it will be degraded through reaction with hydroxyl radicals. 2. Some of the material will become associated with benthic sedi ments, and it is likely to be spr ead over a fairly wide area of sea floor. Marine sediments may be either aerobic or anaerobic. The material, in probability, is biodegradable, under aerobic conditions. Evidence also suggests that the hydrocar bons may be degradable under anaerobic conditions although such degradation in benthic sediments may be a relatively slow process. 3. Under aerobic conditions the material will degrade to water and carbon dioxide, while under aerobic processes it will produce water, methane, carbon dioxide and carbon dioxide. 4. Based on test results, as well as theoretical considerations, the potential for bioaccumulation may be high. Toxic effects a re often observed in species such as blue mussel, daphnia, freshwater green algae, marine copepods 104 hr Half-life (Surface water): 96 hr Half-life (Ground water): 168 672 hr Half-life (Soil): 96 528 hr Bioaccumulative potential This material is not expected to significantly bioaccumulate.
