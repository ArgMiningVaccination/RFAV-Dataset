The health and wellbeing of our staff members and guests is our top priority and has been our guiding principle throughout this unprecedented time. Whether you've dined-in or ordered take-out or delivery from us this past year, you may have noticed some changes we implemented to ensure your continued safety such as adding partitions between booths to enhance social distancing wherever possible, providing QR codes to access our digital menu on your mobile device, positioning our bakery counter's credit card machines so you can swipe your own credit card without staff assistance, and sealing our take-out bags to ensure there is no contact with your food from the kitchen to your door. We have also installed an additional air purification to the already best-in-class system in our restaurants. This new system uses Bi-Polar ionization which creates positive and negative ions to actively clean the air as it passes through the building's systems, killing bacteria and viruses, and reducing allergens and airborne particles without creating ozone or any harmful biproducts. Third party laboratory testing has shown that the iWave\u00ae air purifiers can effectively reduce pathogens including SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19. Additionally, we are encouraging all staff members to get vaccinated and boosted and are providing hourly staff with paid time off for each vaccine appointment. We are continually evolving our efforts to ensure the highest levels of sanitation and safety in our restaurants and are following the guidance of the CDC and our local health departments. We encourage you to stay healthy and we look forward to serving you soon. Sincerely, David M. Gordon President "}
