Florida](https://www.sjrp.com/services/inpatient-treatment/) might be a distanced location from where you live and we realize that you could be facing many challenges in your recovery, and that it might be difficult at times for a client to talk about their past and personal life. It may even hurt and be uncomfortable during times at treatment. This is normal because the client is learning how to let go of the past and develop new and positive habits that are unfamiliar. \"At SJRP we want you or your loved ones to have the full experience of mental, emotional, spiritual and physical treatment. We have seen nothing but a positive impact on those taking advantage of our relaxing and therapeutic program.\" During the detox period, the body starts to withdrawal from drugs and alcohol. Most clients experience physical symptoms that range from mild to severe, causing the body to be in pain and uncomfortable.
