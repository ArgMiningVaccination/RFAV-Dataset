Autism worries Who here is constantly worried about autism? I feel like I'm obsessed with reading about autism and anything and everything that could cause it... from vaccinations all the way to formula. I'm a bit of a worry wart... But lately my anxiety about this and through the roof. Who knows what really causes it, but it just seems that these days so many children seem to have autism.

He's my first he is 2 and I see a lot of signs such as language delay, gazing from the corner of his eyes, spinning in circles, no eye contact and more but I'm hoping it's just a stage or something. But all we can do is pray and be aware and then take action if it comes to be. It is me first ... I'm so sorry for your worries about your little one. But I pray he is a perfectly normal and healthy little boy Where did you read that Mylicon causes autism? thank you .. you're absolutely right No, no you're ok. I wasn't trying to deter you from posting. I was honestly asking because that seems like a pretty outrageous claim and I was trying to determine how far down the rabbit hole you are. I thought perhaps I could help ease your mind by explaining some of your sources to you. Regardless, I think this worrying is somewhat normal in that we all worry about, and want what's best for our children. You, however, seem to be a little more paralyzed by it and that leads me to believe that this should be brought up to your OB in case it's symptomatic of PPA. Also, I would just tell your pediatrician about your worries and I'm sure they can answer any questions you have. Everything is going to be okay. Don't Google (thing + autism) anymore because you will find an answer every single time and it will rarely be accurate. Try not to stress. there is nothing that proves a link.. I just am thinking things in my head. I'm so sorry I even posted this. Don't mean to worry anyone... I'm an idiot I just looked up Mylicon and autism and there were a couple of links that reference a possible link... but honestly it's just me being super anxious and thinking everything causes it because it seems like such a mystery. Don't mean to worry anyone else yes i want to know as well . I'm giving my daughter those doctors orders The rate of diagnosis has changed.. this has a lot to do with the increase in knowledge about autism. There is no evidence to show that vaccines or formula cause autism. Research at this time (that I am aware of) has not found a direct cause of most autism cases apart from genetic predisposed persons. I would personally say enjoy your baby, look for signs of autism and if your worried ensure early intervention for diagnosis and therapy if needed is undertaken. My oldest (12 yr old) has autism. He is suppper high functioning. I def worry with our new baby as well Bc they say when you have one child with autism the chances of another kid being autistic is higher. Either way we will make it work. I can tell the difference in our new baby compared to my oldest son. Everything is what you make of it. Me!!! I worry about it all the time :( My sister has twins. One is on the spectrum and the other isn't. They got exactly the same vaccines, feeding, etc. The misinformation out there is staggering. exactly!!! People think it's from something. But I'm a firm believer it's just in the person dna makeup. My sons father has 8 kids and my son is the only one with autism (or any special needs). thank you there were also zero signs at this stage, or in fact until they were at earliest around 18 months, so right now do not torture yourself trying to guess whether and when your baby checks off all the boxes on \"Leap X\" is a reason to worry about autism. It won't tell you anything useful and it's not going to do anything but feed your anxiety. ETA: and both kids are great, anyway, just different. oh wow I can tell you this....my son didn't have shots on schedule, never had any gas drops, breast fed, only ate organic baby foods and was read to/talked to and engaged with more than the average kid and guess what......he's autistic. We have no family history of autism. My son was the most social, engaging, happy baby and met all milestones months ahead of time until about 15 months. At 2.5 he hardly talks and is does some weird figity things. Bottom line is that there's nothing you can do to prevent it and no it's not something that anyone wants, but god forbid it's not the end of the world. My son is amazing and the light of my life. Autism is not THAT big of a deal. my six year old is autistic. I wouldn't change anything for the world. you are right AUTISM IS NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL! PREACH GIRL Whether there's a link between vaccines/formula and autism or not (and I'm pretty sure theres NOT) I can assure you that having an autistic child is nothing compared to a starving child or deathly ill child. I don't understand why autism has become so scary to people! I understand, we're moms and we worry, but PLEASE if you're truly concerned about this make sure you're reading RELIABLE sources and not just anything you find on google! Hang in there momma! Enjoy your sweet baby and try not to stress over things you can't control! You'll get through this, I promise he's beautiful and you're right I will come back to comment more after I pick up my son from preschool.... that's interesting because the study I read said up until two years is an indicator of not having autism but it showed up at 15 months for yours! Or maybe you didn't really notice the subtle changes. thank you! Children with autism are lovely and brilliant. You could be having some postpartum anxiety if you are really thinking about this all the time. With my first I became overly worried I was going to die and leave my kids, i thought about it all the time. It was a postpartum thing happening. I keep thinking I'm going to die and I'm so sad about dying. Did you go on meds? I didn't and the thoughts did go away after a few months. But if it's really affecting your daily life I'd def talk to your doc!! I read a study that if your baby has good eye contact and smiles between two months and two years you don't have to worry! I was worried but my 7 week old stares at us and smiles so much that I feel much more confident now. If you want reliable info on how autism can develop go to Autism Speaks website. Vaccines don't cause it. Certain illnesses during pregnancy might cause it (I forget which ones). If you had a bad fever during pregnancy .. if you have a baby too soon after the first is another possible cause.. so yes the genetic component is big but there are other possible factors as well. And mylicon cannot cause autism as it is not absorbed by the body (metabolized). dont support autism speaks, many people on the spectrum are very outspoken against them and their stance on \"curing\" autism. it says on their site that autism can't be cured so I'm not entirely sure what you're referring to well then maybe they have listened to the people they are representing then!
