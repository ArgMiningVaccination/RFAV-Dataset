Thus in 2005, I suggested to the U. S. Congress that the National Research Counc il (NRC) could help to answer questions about the data and methods that have been used in constructing records of Earth's surface temperatures from times when th ere were no scientific instruments, using proxy indicators. How has temperature varied over the last 2,000 years? How certain is the answer to this question? Subsequently, this study was requested by Representative Sherwood Boehlert, Chairman of the Committee on Science, U.S. House of Repr esentatives. Chairman Boehlert asked for a clear and concise report in a relati vely short period of time, and the NRC agreed to undertake the study quickly. An ad hoc committee was formed, with the group carefully composed to include the breadth and depth of expertis e and perspectives needed to an alyze all aspects of how surface temperatures are estimated and interpreted, and to comment generally on climate science. The NRC asked the committee to summarize current scie ntific information on the temperature record for the past two millennia, describe the main areas of uncertainty and how significant they are, describe the principal methodologies used and an y problems with these a pproaches, and explain how central is the debate over the paleoclimate te mperature record to th e state of scientific knowledge on global climate change. The committee has prepared a report that, in my view, provides policy makers and the scientific community with a crit ical view of surface temperatur e reconstructions and how they are evolving over time, as well as a good sens e of how important our understanding of the paleoclimate temperature record is within the overall state of scientific knowledge on global climate change. The report does not make policy recommendations. I thank the members of the committee, who worked intensely to produce this careful report in a short period of time and contributed much personal time, insight, and energy. The NRC staff, and all those who cont ributed papers, data, graphics, and other information, as well as the independent experts who par ticipated in the rigorous revi ew process, were essential participants. Ralph J. Cicerone, President National Academy of Sciences Chair, National Research Council ix Preface This committee was asked to describe and assess the state of scientific efforts to reconstruct surface temperature records for the Ea rth over approximately the last 2,000 years. (The full Statement of Task appears in Appendix A. ) Normally, a technical issue such as surface temperature reconstructions might not generate widespread attention, but this case brings interesting lessons about how science works and how science, especially climate science, is communicated to policy makers and the public. The debate began in 1998 when a paper by Michael Mann, Raymond Bradley and Malcolm H ughes was published in the journal Nature. The authors used a new methodology to combine data from a number of sources to estimate temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere for th e last six centuries, a nd later for the last 1,000 years. This research received wide attention, in part because it was il lustrated with a simple graphic, the so-called hockey stick curve, that many interpreted as definitive evidence of anthropogenic causes of recent climate change. The research was given prominence in the 2001 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climat e Change, and then picked up by many in the wider science community and by the popular media. Science is a process of exploration of ideas hypotheses are proposed and research is conducted to investigate. Other scientists wo rk on the issue, produci ng supporting or negating evidence, and each hypothesis either survives for another round, evol ves into other ideas, or is proven false and rejected. In the case of the hockey stick, the scientific process has proceeded for the last few years with many researchers test ing and debating the results. Critics of the original papers have argued that the statistical methods were flaw ed, that the choice of data was biased, and that the data and pro cedures used were not shared so others could verify the work. This report is an opportunity to examine the st rengths and limitations of surface temperature reconstructions and the role that they play in improving our understand ing of climate. The reconstruction produced by Dr. Mann and his collea gues was just one step in a long process of research, and it is not (as sometimes presented) a clinching argument for anthropogenic global warming, but rather one of many independent lines of research on global climate change. Using multiple types of proxy data to infer te mperature time series over large geographic regions is a relatively new area of scientific research, althoug h it builds upon the considerable progress that has been made in deducing past te mperature variations at single sites and local regions. Surface temperature reconstructions ofte n combine data from a number of specialized disciplines, and few individuals ha ve expertise in all aspects of the work. The procedures for dealing with these data are evolving there is no one \"right\" way to proceed. It is my opinion that this field is progressing in a healthy manner. As in all scientific endeavors, research reported in the scientific literature is often \"wor k in progress\" aimed at other investigators, not always to be taken as individual calls for action in the policy community. With this as context, the committee consider ed the voluminous literat ure pertinent to its charge and received briefings and written contribu tions from more than two dozen people. We have organized our report knowing that we have at least two different audiences the science community and the policy community. The principa l conclusions of the committee are listed in the Summary and explained in the Overview using nontechnical language. More extensive x SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS technical justifications for the committee's conc lusions, including references, are presented in the chapters that follow. Finally, let me thank the members of the Committee on Surface Temperature Reconstructions for the Last 2,000 Years. The committee worked tirelessly over the last few months to assess the status of th is field of research so that th e public can see exactly what is involved, what we currently know about it, a nd what the prospects are for improving our understanding. We have tried to make clear how this piece of the climate puzzle fits into the broader discussions about global climate change. Gerald R.

For example, records of Alpine glacier length, some of which are derived from painti ngs and other documentary sources, have been used to reconstruct the time series of surface temperature variations in south-central Europe for the last several centuries. Studying past climates can help us put the 20th century warming into a broader context, better understa nd the climate system, and improve projections of future climate. Starting in the late 1990s, scientists began combining proxy evidence from many different locations in an effo rt to estimate surface temperature changes averaged over broad geographic regions during the last few hundred to few thousand years. These large-scale surface temperature reconstructions have enabled researchers to estim ate past temperature variations over the Northern Hemisphere or even the entire globe, often with time resolution as fine as decades or even individual years. This researc h, and especially the first of these reconstructions published in 1998 and 1999 by Michael Mann, Raymond Bradley, and Malcolm Hughes, attracted considerable attention because the auth ors concluded that the Northern Hemisphere was warmer during the late 20th century than at any other time during the past millennium. Controversy arose because many pe ople interpreted this result as definitive evidence of anthropogenic causes of recent climate change, wh ile others criticized the methodologies and data that were used. In response to a request from Congress, this committee was assembled by the National Research Council to describe and assess the state of scientific efforts to reconstruct surface temperature records for the Earth over approximate ly the last 2,000 years a nd the implications of these efforts for our understandi ng of global climate change. Figure S-1 shows a compilation of large-scal e surface temperature reconstructions from different research groups, each using its own methodology and selection of proxies, as well as the instrumental record (beginning in 1856) of global mean surface temperature. 2 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS -1.2-1.0-0.8-0.6-0.4-0.20.00.20.40.6 900 1100 1300 1500 1700 1900 YearTemperature anomaly (deg C) -1.2-1.0-0.8-0.6-0.4-0.20.00.20.40.6Borehole temperatures (Huang et al. 2000) Glacier lengths (Oerlemans et al. 2005) Multiproxy (Mann and Jones 2003) Multiproxy (Moberg et al. 2005) Multiproxy (Hegerl et al. 2006) Tree rings (Esper et al. 2002) Instrumental record (HadCRUT2v) FIGURE S-1 Smoothed reconstructions of large-scale (Nor thern Hemisphere mean or global mean) surface temperature variations from six different rese arch teams are shown along with the instrumental record of global mean surface temperature. Each curve portrays a somewhat different history of temperature variations, and is subject to a somewhat different set of uncertainties that generally increase going backward in time (as indicated by the gray shading). This set of reconstructions conveys a qualitatively consistent picture of temperature changes over the last 1,100 years, and especially the last 400. See Figure O-5 for details about each curve. After considering all of the available evidence, including the curves shown in Figure S-1, the committee has reached the following conclusions: The instrumentally measured warming of about 0.6\u00b0C during the 20th century is also reflected in borehole temperature measur ements, the retreat of glaciers, and other observational evidence, and can be simulated with climate models. Large-scale surface temperature reconstructi ons yield a generally consistent picture of temperature trends during the preceding millennium, including relatively warm conditions centered around A.D. 1000 (identif ied by some as the \"Medieval Warm Period\") and a relatively cold period (or \"Little Ice Age\") centered around 1700. The existence and extent of a Little Ice Age from roughly 1500 to 1850 is supported by a wide variety of evidence including ice cores, tree rings, borehole temperatures, glacier length r ecords, and historical documents. Evidence for regional warmth during medieval times can be found in a diverse but more limited set of records including ice cores, tree rings, marine sediments, and historical sources from Europe and Asia, but the exact timing and duration of warm periods may have varied from region to region, and the magnitude and geographic extent of the warmth are uncertain. SUMMARY 3 It can be said with a high level of conf idence that global mean surface temperature was higher during the last few decades of the 20th century than during any comparable period during the preceding four centuries. This stat ement is justified by the consistency of the evidence from a wide variety of geographically diverse proxies. Less confidence can be placed in large-scal e surface temperature reconstructions for the period from A.D. 900 to 1600. Presently available proxy evidence indicates that temperatures at many, but not all, individual loca tions were higher during th e past 25 years than during any period of comparable length since A.D. 900. The uncertainties associated with reconstructing hemispheric mean or global mean temperatures from these data increase substantially backward in time through this period and are not yet fully quantified. Very little confidence can be assigned to statements concerning the hemispheric mean or global mean surface temperature prior to about A.D. 900 because of sparse data coverage and because the uncertainties associat ed with proxy data and the methods used to analyze and combine them are larger than during more recent time periods. The main reason that our confidence in larg e-scale surface temperatur e reconstructions is lower before A.D. 1600 and especially before A.D. 900 is the relative scarc ity of precisely dated proxy evidence. Other factors limiting our conf idence in surface temperature reconstructions include the relatively short length of the instrume ntal record (which is used to calibrate and validate the reconstructions ); the fact that all proxies are influenced by a variety of climate variables; the possibility that the relationship between proxy data and local surface temperatures may have varied over time; the lack of agreemen t as to which methods are most appropriate for calibrating and validating large-sc ale reconstructions and for sele cting the proxy data to include; and the difficulties associated with construc ting a global or hemispheric mean temperature estimate using data from a limited number of site s and with varying chronological precision. All of these considerations introduce uncertain ties that are difficult to quantify. Despite these limitations, the committee finds that efforts to reconstruct temperature histories for broad geographic regions using multip roxy methods are an important contribution to climate research and that these large-scale surface temperature reconstructions contain meaningful climatic signals. The individual pro xy series used to create these reconstructions generally exhibit strong correlations with local environmental condi tions, and in most cases there is a physical, chemical, or physiological reas on why the proxy reflects local temperature variations. Our confidence in the results of these reconstruc tions becomes stronger when multiple independent lines of evidence point to th e same general result, as in the case of the Little Ice Age cooling and the 20th century warming. The basic conclusion of Mann et al. (1998, 1999) was that the late 20th century warmth in the Northern Hemisphere was unprecedented during at least the last 1,000 years. This conclusion has subsequently been supported by an array of evidence that includes both additional large-scale surface temperature reconstructions and pronounced changes in a variety of local proxy indicators, such as melting on icecaps and the retreat of glaciers around the world, which in many cases appear to be unprecedented during at least the last 2,000 years. Not all individual proxy records indicate that the recent warmth is unprecedented, although a larger fraction of geographically diverse sites expe rienced exceptional warmth duri ng the late 20th century than during any other extended pe riod from A.D. 900 onward. Based on the analyses presented in the orig inal papers by Mann et al. and this newer supporting evidence, the committee finds it plausibl e that the Northern Hemisphere was warmer 4 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS during the last few decades of the 20th century than during any comparable period over the preceding millennium. The substantial uncerta inties currently presen t in the quantitative assessment of large-scale surf ace temperature changes prior to about A.D. 1600 lower our confidence in this conclusion compared to the high level of confidence we place in the Little Ice Age cooling and 20th century warming. Even less confidence can be placed in the original conclusions by Mann et al. (1999) that \"the 1990s are likely the warmest decade, and 1998 the warmest year, in at least a millennium\" because the uncertainties inherent in temperature reconstructions for individual years and decades are larger than those for longer time periods, and because not all of the available proxies record temperature information on such short timescales. Surface temperature reconstructions for periods prior to the industrial era are only one of multiple lines of evidence supporting the conclu sion that climatic warming is occurring in response to human activities, and they are not the primary evidence. Surface temperature reconstructions also provid e a useful source of information about the variability and sensitivity of the climate system. To within existing uncertainties, climate model simulations show that the estimated temperature variations during the two millennia prior to the Industrial Revolution can be expl ained plausibly by estimated vari ations in solar radiation and volcanic activity during the same period. Large-scale surface temperature reconstructions have the potential to further improve our knowledge of temperature variations over the la st 2,000 years, particularly if additional proxy evidence can be identified and obtained from areas where the coverage is relatively sparse and for time periods before A.D. 1600 and especially before A.D. 900. Furthermore, it would be helpful to update proxy records that were coll ected decades ago, in order to develop more reliable calibrations with the instrumental recor d. Improving access to data used in publications would also increase confidence in the results of large-scale surface temp erature reconstructions both inside and outside the scien tific community. New analytical methods, or more careful use of existing ones, may also help circumvent so me of the existing limitations associated with surface temperature reconstructions based on multiple proxies. Finally, because some of the most important potential consequences of clim ate change are linked to changes in regional circulation patterns, hurricane activity, and th e frequency and intensit y of droughts and floods, regional and large-scale reconstructions of cha nges in other climatic variables, such as precipitation, over the last 2,000 y ears would provide a valuable complement to those made for temperature. 5 Overview The Earth warmed by roughly 0.6 degrees Cent igrade (\u00b0C; 1 degree Fahrenheit [\u00b0F]) during the 20th century, and is projected to warm by an additional ~2-6\u00b0C during the 21st century.1 Paleoclimatology, or the study of past clim ates, can help place this warming in the context of natural climate variability. Lessons learned from studying past climates can also be applied to improving projections of how the clim ate system will respond to future changes in greenhouse gas concentrations a nd other climate forcings, as well as how ecosystems and societies might be affected by climate change. Widespread, reliable instrumental records are av ailable only for the la st 150 years or so. To study how climatic conditions varied prior to the time of the Industrial Revolution, paleoclimatologists rely on proxy evidence such as tree rings, corals , ocean and lake sediments, cave deposits, fossils, ice cores, borehole temperat ures, glacier length records, and documentary evidence. For example, records of Alpine glacier length, some of which are derived from paintings and other documentary evidence, have been used to reconstruct the time series of surface temperature variations in south-central Europe for the last several centuries. Until recently, most reconstructions of climate varia tions over the last few thousand years focused on specific locations or regions. St arting in the 1990s, researcher s began to combine proxy records from different geographic regions, often using a variet y of different types of records, in an effort to document large-scale climate changes over the last few millennia. Most of these large-scale surface temperature reconstructions have focused on hemispheri c average or global average surface temperatures over the last few hundred to few thousand years. These reconstructions, and in particular the following quest ions, are the focus of this report: What kinds of proxy evidence can be used to estimate surface temperatures for the last 2,000 years? How are proxy data used to reconstruc t surface temperatures over different geographic regions and time periods? What is our current understanding of how the hemispheric mean or global mean surface temperature has varied over the last 2,000 years? What conclusions can be drawn fr om large-scale surface temperature reconstructions? What are the limitations and strengths of large-scale surface temperature reconstructions? What do climate models and forcing estimat es tell us about the last 2,000 years? How central are large-scale surface temperature reconstructions to our understanding of globa l climate change? 1 This Overview is written for a nontechnical audience and uses minimal referencing. The arguments and evidence to support the committee's findings are discussed and referenced in Chapters 1-11. This statement, for example, is supported by original research by Smith and Reynolds (2005), Jones et al. (2001), and Hansen et al. (2001), as discussed in Chapter 2. 6 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS What comments can be made on the value of exchanging information and data? What might be done to improve our unders tanding of climate variations over the last 2,000 years? What kinds of proxy evidence can be used to estimate surface temper atures for the last 2,000 years? Instrumental Records Combining instrumental records to calculat e large-scale surface temperatures requires including a sufficient number of instrumental si tes with wide geographi c distribution to get a representative estimate. Instrumental temperat ure records extend back over 250 years in some locations, but only since the middl e of the 19th century has there been a sufficient number of observing stations to estimate the average temper ature over the Northern Hemisphere or over the entire globe. Tropical measurements are part icularly useful for estimating global mean temperature because tropical temperature variatio ns tend to track global mean variations more closely. Documentary and Historical Records In many parts of the world, the surface temper ature record can be extended back several centuries by examining historical documents such as logbooks, journals, c ourt records, and the dates of wine harvests. This ev idence shows that several regions we re relatively cool from about 1500 to 1850, a period sometimes referred to as the L ittle Ice Age. Historical evidence also suggests that Europe and East As ia, in particular, experienced pe riods of relative warmth during the medieval interval from roughly A.D. 900 to 1300. In contrast to the widespread warming of the 20th century, the timing of thes e earlier warm episodes appears to have varied from location to location, but the sparseness of data precludes certainty on this point. In areas where writing was not widespread or preserved, archeological evidence such as excavated ruins can also sometimes offer clues as to how climate may have been changing at certain times in history, and how human socie ties may have responded to those changes. However, the interpretation of historical, doc umentary, and archeological evidence is often confounded by factors such as dise ase outbreaks and societal cha nges. Hence, climatologists more often rely on natural proxy evidence to pr oduce quantitative rec onstructions of past climates, and use historical and archeological evidence, when it is available, to provide a consistency check. Tree Rings Tree ring formation is influenced by climatic c onditions, especially in areas near the edge of the geographic distribution of tree species. At high latitudes and/or at high elevations, tree ring growth is related to temperat ure, thus trees from these sites are commonly used as a basis for surface temperature reconstructions . Cores extracted from the trees provide annually resolved time series of tree ring width and of wood proper ties, such as density and chemical composition, within each ring. In some cases , records from living trees can be matched with records from dead wood to create a single, continuous chrono logy extending back several thousand years. Tree ring records offer a number of advantages for climate reconstr uction, including wide geographic availability, annual to seasonal reso lution, ease of replica tion, and internally OVERVIEW 7 consistent dating. Like other pr oxies, tree rings are influenced by biological and environmental factors other than climate. Site selection and quality control procedures have been developed to account for these confounding factors. In the applic ation of these procedur es, emphasis is placed on replication of records both w ithin a site and among sites, a nd on numerical ca libration against instrumental data. Corals The annual bands in coral skeletons also provide information about environmental conditions at the time that each band was formed . This information is mostly derived from changes in the chemical and isotopic composition2 of the coral, which reflect the temperature and isotopic composition of the water in which it formed. Since corals live mostly in tropical and subtropical waters, they provide a useful co mplement to records derived from tree rings. Coral skeleton chemistry is influenced by several variables, and thus care must be taken when selecting coral samples and when deriving climate records from them. Th us far, most of the climate reconstructions based on co rals have been regional in scal e and limited to the last few hundred years, but there is now work toward establishing longer records by sampling fossil corals. Ice Cores Oxygen isotopes measured in ice cores extracted from glaciers and ic e caps can be used to infer the temperature at the time when the snow was originally deposited. For the most recent 2,000 years, the age of the ice can in most places be determined by counting annual layers. The isotopic composition of the ice in each layer reflects both the temperature in the region where the water molecules originally evaporated far upwi nd of the glacier and the temperature of the clouds in which the water vapor molecules cond ensed to form snowflakes. The long-term fluctuations in temperature rec onstructions derived from ice cores can be cross-checked against the vertical temperature profiles in the holes out of which they were drilled (see below). Ice- isotope-based reconstructions are av ailable only in areas that are c overed with ice th at persists on the landscape (e.g., Greenland, Antarctica, and so me ice fields atop mountains in Africa, the Andes, and the Himalayas). The interpretation of oxygen isotope measurements in tropical ice cores is more complicated than for polar regions because it depends not only on temperature but also on precipitation in the adjacent lowlands. Marine and Lake Sediments Cores taken from the sediments at the bo ttoms of lakes and ocean regions can be analyzed to provide evidence of past climatic change. Sediment cores can be analyzed to determine the temperature of the water from which the various constituents of the sediment were deposited. This information, in turn, can be rela ted to the local surface temperature. Records relevant to temperature include oxygen isotopes , the ratio of magnesium to calcium, and the relative abundance of different microfossil types with known temp erature preferences (such as insects), or with a strong temperature correla tion (e.g., diatoms and some other algae). Changes in the properties of sediments ar e also of interest. For exampl e, during cold epochs icebergs streaming southward over the No rth Atlantic carried sand and gravel and deposited it in 2 Isotopic composition of a particular element is the relative abundan ce of atoms of that element with differing numbers of neutrons in their nuclei. 8 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS sediments at the latitudes where they melted; the properties of this material are indicative of the generally colder conditio ns in the region where the icebergs originated. Ocean and lake sediments typically accumula te slowly, and the layering within them tends to be smoothed out by bottom-dwelling orga nisms. Hence it is only in regions where sedimentation rates are extrao rdinarily high (e.g., the Bermuda Rise, the northwest coast of Africa) or in a few oxygen-depri ved areas (e.g., the Santa Barbar a Basin, the Cariaco Basin off Venezuela, or in deep crater lakes) that se diments can be dated accurately enough to provide information on climate changes during the la st 2,000 years. More slowly accumulating sediments from ocean basins throughout the world are one of our main sources of information on climate variations on timescales of millennia and longer. Boreholes Past surface temperatures can also be estimat ed by measuring the vertical temperature profile down boreholes drilled into rock, frozen soils, and ice. Temperature variations at the Earth's surface diffuse downward with time by the same process that causes the handle of a metal spoon to warm up when it is immersed in a c up of hot tea. The governing equation for this process can be used to convert th e vertical profile of temperature in a borehole into a record of surface temperature versus time. Features in the vertical temperature profile are smoothed out as they propagate downward, resulting in a loss of information. Hence, large-scale surface temperature reconstructions base d on borehole measurements typically extend back only over a few centuries, with coarse time resolution. Hundreds of holes have been drilled to de pths of several hundred meters below the surface at sites throughout the Northern Hemisphe re and at a smaller number of sites in the Southern Hemisphere. Many of these \"boreholes of opportunity\" were drilled for other reasons such as mineral exploration. Specialists acknow ledge several different types of errors in borehole-based temperature reconstructions, su ch as an imperfect match between ground temperature and near-surface air temperature, but available evidence indicates that these errors do not significantly influence reconstructions for large regions using many boreholes. Boreholes drilled through glacial ic e to extract ice cores are free from many of these problems, and can be analyzed jointly with the oxygen isotope record from the corresponding core, yielding a much longer and more accurate temperature reconstruc tion than is possible with boreholes drilled through rock or permafrost. However, ice-base d boreholes are availabl e only in areas with a thick cover of ice. Glacier Length Records Records of the lengths of many mountain glaciers extend back over several hundred years. Relatively simple models of glacier dyna mics can be used to re late changes in glacial extent to local changes in temperature on times cales of a few decades. The rates of warming inferred from this technique compare quite well with local instrumental measurements over the last century or so. Most glacier length records are derived from di rect observations reported in the historical record, such as paintings that show how far local glaciers exte nded into their valleys at specific times in history. Natural evidence can also be us ed to infer past glacier extent. For example, organic materials such as shrubs have recently been uncovered behind rapidly retreating glaciers in several locations. These relics, which were killed and incorporated into the ice when they OVERVIEW 9 were overtaken by the glacier at a time when the glacier was advancing, can be dated using radiocarbon to estimate how long it has been since th e glacier was last absent from that location. Other Proxies Several other types of proxy evidence have been used to reconstruct surface temperatures on a regional basis. For example, calcium carbona te formations in caves, such as stalagmites, and layered organisms found in marine caves called sclerosponges have been analyzed, using methods similar to those used to analyze coral skeletons, to ob tain information on past climate variations. How are proxy data used to reconstruct surface temperatures? Knowledge of chemical, biol ogical, and/or ecological pro cesses is used to guide the sampling, analysis, and conversion of natural proxy data into surface temperature reconstructions. Borehole temperature measur ements and glacier length records can be converted to temperature time series using physica lly based models with a few key variables. For all other proxies used for the reconstructions discussed in this report, statistical techniques are employed to define the relationship between the proxy measurements and the concurrent instrumental temperature record, and then this relationship is used to reconstruct past temperature variations from the remaining proxy data. The basic methodology is shown schematically in Figure O-1 and described in more detail in the paragraphs that follow. There are variations in the way in which these methods are applied to different proxies, and variations in the way that different research groups apply these methods. 1. Site selection and data collection choosing and sampling the particular site and proxy to be used for the reconstruction. In prin ciple, proxy and site sel ection should be based on an understanding of the physical, chemical, phys iological, and/or ecol ogical processes that determine how the proxy reacts to local enviro nmental conditions. In practice, the type and amount of proxy data available at any given loca tion is limited, and the relationship between the proxy and the climate variable of interest is not exactly known. Researchers follow established techniques to collect and measure the samples, while looking for sites where proxy records are as long, continuous, and representative of the target climatic variable as possible. 2. Dating and preprocessing synchronizing the individual proxy records so they can be plotted on a common time axis. For tree rings, dating is accurate to th e calendar year. Dating of corals, ice cores, and histor ical documents is also often acc urate to within a year. Other proxies typically have lower tem poral resolution. Adjustments may be performed at this stage to reduce the variations in the proxy time series th at are related to nonclimatic factors. Time histories derived from different samples from th e same area may also be averaged or spliced together to construct longer and more representative proxy records. 3. Calibration placing a temperature scale on the \"p roxy thermometer.\" This step typically involves the use of a statistical technique called linear regression . Data can be collected on how proxies respond to temperature in the laboratory or in the field, in which case statistical tests of theoretical or empirical constraints can be us ed to guide the reconstruction. Since these experimental and monitoring activiti es cannot be performed for every single proxy record, many reconstructions rely on linear regr ession to derive an em pirical relationship 10 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS FIGURE O-1 Schematic diagram of the general met hodology used to reconstruct past climates, including surface temperature reconstructions. between the proxy time series and the surface temper ature in the region of interest. The manner in which this methodology is applied (e.g., whethe r the regression is based on annual means, 10- year means or 30-year means, and whether trends are removed from the data) varies from study to study. 4. Validation testing whether the empirical rela tionship derived in step 3 has measurable skill, and quantitatively assessing its performance. Typically, portions of the instrumental record are withheld during calibration. The linear regression coefficients derived from the calibration are then used to reconstruct the temperature time series from the proxy data during this validation period, and the reconstr ucted temperatures ar e compared with the corresponding instrumental temperat ure record. A number of diffe rent metrics may be used to assess the skill of the reconstruction during the validation step. 5. Reconstruction the regression algorithm developed in step 3 is applied to the proxy data that are available pr ior to the instrumental reco rd to extend the temperature reconstruction back in time. Error bars are so metimes assigned to th e reconstruction based on how well it matches the observed surface temperatur e variations during the validation period in step 4. In general, the width of the error bars will vary in time according to the quantity and quality of available proxy evidence. As discussed in further detail below, these error bars do not account for all of the uncertainties present in the reconstruction. OVERVIEW 11 Although calibration against instrumental data is a necessary step to determine how well proxies reflect climate, proxy reco rds are not perfect thermometers, that is, the true relationship between the proxy and the local su rface temperature is not known exactly. Furthermore, all proxies are influenced by variab les other than temperature, and it can be difficult to account for these confounding factors. The us e of linear regression in the calib ration step is also a concern because reconstructions derived from linear regression models based on the method of least squares exhibit less variability than the instru mental records they are calibrated against. Additional variance can be lost if the individual proxy records with in the reconstruction are not spliced together properly. Fina lly, in applying these methods it is assumed that the correlation between the proxy data and the instrumental r ecord will hold up over the entire period of the reconstruction, but this assu mption is difficult to test. Large-Scale Surface Temperature Reconstructions Several surface temperature reconstructions carried out since the mid-1990s involve the synthesis of data from many different locations, often from disparate sources such as tree rings, corals, and ice cores, to infer patterns of te mperature variations over large geographic areas.3 The methodology used to carry out these large- scale surface temperatur e reconstructions is broadly similar to the methodology described in the preceding section, but modified in the following ways. In step 1, instead of choosing site s to sample, one chooses the particular set of proxies to be used as the basis for the reconstr uction. The reconstruction might be based on just one kind of proxy or a combinati on of several different kinds of proxies (in which case it is referred to as a multiproxy reconstruction), which may have been sampled by a number of different researchers at different times without knowledge that thei r data would be used for this purpose. To obtain enough spatial coverage, some of the reconstructions include proxies that may be more sensitive to precip itation than they are to temperature, in which case statistical techniques are used to infer the temperature si gnal, exploiting the spa tial relationship between temperature and precipitation fields. There are two general approaches that ar e commonly used to perform the calibration, validation, and reconstruction steps (steps 3, 4, and 5 in Figure O-1) for large-scale surface temperature reconstructions. In the first approac h, proxies are calibrated ag ainst the time series of the dominant patterns of spatial variability in the instrumental temp erature record and the results are combined to yield a time series of large-scale averag e temperature. In the second approach, the individual proxy data are first composited and then this series is calibrated directly against the time series of larg e-scale temperature variations. Both the number and the quality of the pr oxy records available for surface temperature reconstructions decrease dramatically moving b ackward in time. At present fewer than 30 annually resolved proxy time series are available fo r A.D. 1000; relatively few of these are from the Southern Hemisphere and even fewer are from the tropics (Figure O-2). Although it is true that fewer sites are required for defining l ong-term (e.g., century-to-century) variations in hemispheric mean temperature than for short-te rm (e.g., year-to-year) va riations, the coarse spatial sampling limits our confidence in hemispheric mean or global mean temperature 3 This report focuses on reconstructions of global mean or hemispheric mean surface te mperature. Reconstructions for the Northern Hemisphere are more common because th e number of proxy records available from the Southern Hemisphere is limited. 12 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS estimates prior to about A.D. 1600, and makes it difficult to generate me aningful quantitative estimates of global temperature va riations prior to about A.D. 900. Moreover, the instrumental record is shorter than some of th e features of interest in the pr eindustrial period, so there are very few statistically independent pieces of informati on in the instrumental record for calibrating and validating long-term temper ature reconstructions. OVERVIEW 13 FIGURE O-2 Regional distribution of tree ring, borehole, ice core, and \"other\" records used to create the large-scale surface temperature reconstructions in Figure S-1 (and Figure O-5) for (top) A.D. 1000 and (bottom) A.D. 1500. \"Other records\" include marine and lake sediment cores, cave carbonates, and documentary records. The indicated distribution is approximate; for example, several deep-sea sediment cores are not indicated geographically. 14 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS Climate Models and th e Climate System Part of the natural variability in the Ea rth's temperature is generated by processes operating within the confines of the climate system and part of it is generated by forcings external to the climate system. For the last 2,000 years, these external forcings include volcanic eruptions, variations in the intensity of incomi ng solar radiation, and ch anges in greenhouse gas concentrations. The direct effect of thes e forcings on the Earth's global mean surface temperature is modified by the presence of feedbacks in the climate system, such as the one involving the increase in water vapor with increasing temperat ure. Climate models are often used to estimate the strength of the various f eedbacks in the climate system and the overall sensitivity of the Earth's global mean surface temperat ure to a prescribed forcing, such as a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. Climate sensitivity can also be estimated by fo rcing climate models with the observed or reconstructed external forcings of the climat e system over a certain time period and comparing the model response to the observed or reconstructed surface temperature during the same period. This strategy can be applied to past climatic variations on timescales ranging from a few years (in the case of a single volcanic er uption) to tens of thousands of years (as in the simulation of the Ice Ages). Modeling climate variations on the timescale of the last 2,000 years is particularly challenging because the external forcings that ope rate on this timescale are relatively small and are not as well known as the forc ings in the above examples. What is our current understanding of how the hemispheric mean or global mean surface temperature has varied over the last 2,000 years? To understand the current state of the science surrounding large-scale surface temperature reconstructions, it is helpful to first review how these efforts have evolved over the last few decades. In a chapter titled \"O bserved Climate Variability and Change,\" IPCC (1990) presented a schematic depiction, reproduced in Figure O- 3, of global temperatur e variations extending from 1975 back to A.D. 900. The Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Ag e labels that appear in the graphic refer to features in European a nd other regional time series that were assumed to be indicative of global mean conditions. The peak-to-peak amplitude of the temperature fluctuations was depicted as being on the or der of 1\u00b0C. The pronounced warming trend that began around 1975 was not indicated in the graphic. IPCC (2001) featured the multiproxy Nort hern Hemisphere surface temperature reconstruction reproduced in Figure O-4, which includes error bars. In comparison to the previous figure, the reconstructed surface temperat ure variations prior to the 20th century were less pronounced, and the 20th century warming was rendered more dramatic by the inclusion of data after 1975. On the basis of the results summarized in this figure, the IPCC concluded that \"the increase in temperature in the 20th century is likely 4 to have been the largest of any century during the last 1000 years. It is also likely that, in the Nort hern Hemisphere, the 1990s was the warmest decade and 1998 the warmest year .\" 4 The IPCC defines \"likely\" as having an estimated confid ence of 66-90 percent, or better than two-to-one odds. Note that this falls well short of the high confidence level (>95%) considered standard for strong quantitative arguments. OVERVIEW 15 FIGURE O-3 Schematic description of global temperatur e variations in degrees Centigrade for the last 1,100 years published more than 15 years ago. SOURCE: IPCC (1990).

(1999). Th is figure has sometimes been referred to as the \"hockey stick.\" SOURCE: IPCC (2001). 16 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS Despite the wide error bars, Figure O-4 was misinterpreted by some as indicating the existence of one \"definitive\" reconstruction with small century-to-century variability prior to the mid-19th century. It should also be emphasized that the error bars in this particular figure, and others like it, do not reflect all of the uncertainties inherent in large-scale surface temperature reconstructions based on proxy data. A more recent and complete description of what we know about the climate of the last two millennia can be gleaned from an inspection of Figure O-5, which was prepared by this committee to show the instrumental record co mpiled from traditional thermometer readings, several large-scale surface te mperature reconstructions base d on different kinds of proxy evidence, and results from a few paleoclimate mode l simulations. Figure O-5 is intended only to provide an illustration of the cu rrent state of the science, not a comprehensive review of all currently available large-scale surface temperature estimates. The instrumental record shown in panel A is compiled from traditional thermometer readings that measure the temperature of the air just above the land surfac e (or, for ocean points, the temperature of the water just below the o cean's surface). Panel B shows a global surface temperature reconstruction based on changes in the lengths of many mountain glaciers, which shrink when the climate warms and grow when the climate cools, and also a global surface temperature reconstruction based on borehole te mperature measurements. Panel C shows a compilation of several recent multiproxy-based and tree-ring-based Northern Hemisphere surface temperature reconstructi ons, each performed by a differen t paleoclimate research group using its own selection of proxies and its own calibration and validati on protocols. Panel D shows results from two climate model experiments forced with time-varying estimates of natural climate forcings over the last 1,000 years plus anthropogenic forcing since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Each of the curves in Figure O-5 has diffe rent uncertainties, a nd somewhat different geographical and seasonal emphasis; no one curve can be said to be the best representation of the actual variations in Northern Hemisphere or global mean surface temperature during the last 1,100 years. Nor is it possible to assign error bars to either indi vidual reconstructi ons or to the ensemble of reconstructions that reflect all of the uncertainties inherent in the conversion of proxy data into large-scale su rface temperature estimates. Despite these limitations, the large, divers e, and coherent collection of evidence represented by the samples shown in Figure O-5 i ndicates that global surface temperatures were relatively cool between 1500 and 1850 (the Little Ice Age), and ha ve risen substantially from about 1900 to present. The tree-ring-ba sed and multiproxy-based surface temperature reconstructions shown in panel C also suggest that the Northern Hemisphere was relatively warm around A.D. 1000, with at least one reconstruction showing surface temperatures comparable in warmth to the first half of the 20th century. The timing, duration, and amplitude of warm and cold episodes vary from curve to curve, a nd none of the large-scal e surface temperature reconstructions shows medieval temperatures as warm as the last few decades of the 20th century. OVERVIEW 17 What conclusions can be drawn from large- scale surface temperature reconstructions? Based on its deliberations, the plots shown in Figure O-5, and the evidence described in the chapters that follow and elsewhere, th e committee draws the following conclusions: The instrumentally measured warming of about 0.6\u00b0C during the 20th century is also reflected in borehole temperature measur ements, the retreat of glaciers, and other observational evidence, and can be simulated with climate models. Large-scale surface temperature reconstructi ons yield a generally consistent picture of temperature trends during the preceding millennium, including relatively warm conditions centered around A.D. 1000 (identif ied by some as the \"Medieval Warm Period\") and a relatively cold period (or \"Little Ice Age\") centered around 1700. The existence and extent of a Little Ice Age from roughly 1500 to 1850 is supported by a wide variety of evidence including ice cores, tree rings, borehole temperatures, glacier length r ecords, and historical documents. Evidence for regional warmth during medieval times can be found in a diverse but more limited set of records including ice cores, tree rings, marine sediments, and historical sources from Europe and Asia, but the exact timing and duration of warm periods may have varied from region to region, and the magnitude and geographic extent of the warmth are uncertain. It can be said with a high level of conf idence that global mean surface temperature was higher during the last few decades of the 20th century than during any comparable period during the preceding four centuries. This stat ement is justified by the consistency of the evidence based on a wide variety of geographically diverse proxies. Less confidence can be placed in large-scal e surface temperature reconstructions for the period from A.D. 900 to 1600. Presentl y available proxy evidence indicates that temperatures at many, but not all, individual loca tions were higher during th e past 25 years than during any period of comparable length since A.D. 900. The uncertainties associated with reconstructing hemispheric mean or global mean temperatures from these data increase substantially backward in time through this period and are not yet fully quantified. Very little confidence can be assigned to statements concerning the hemispheric mean or global mean surface temperature prior to about A.D. 900 because of sparse data coverage and because the uncertainties associat ed with proxy data and the methods used to analyze and combine them are larger than during more recent time periods. Our confidence in the validity of large-scale surface temperature rec onstructions is based, in part, on the fact that the individual proxy data series used to create these reconstructions generally exhibit strong correlations with local environmental conditi ons. In most cases, there is a physical, chemical, or physiological reason why th e proxy reflects local temp erature variations. Our confidence is stronger when multiple independe nt lines of evidence point to the same result, as in the case of the Little Ice Age co oling and of the 20th century warming. Although the reconstructions based on bore hole temperature composites and glacier length records in Figure O-5 do not extend back far enough to provide an independent check on the tree-ring- and multiproxy-based reconstructions for periods prior to the 16th century, there is additional evidence pointing toward the unique nature of recent warmth in the context of the last one or two millennia. This evidence includes the recent melting on the summits of ice caps on Ellesmere Island and Quelccaya and other Andean m ountains, the widespread retreat of glaciers in mountain ranges around the world (which in some places has exposed decomposing organic 18 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS -1.2-1.0-0.8-0.6-0.4-0.20.00.20.40.6 900 1100 1300 1500 1700 1900Temperature anomaly (deg C) record (HadCRUT2v) 1300 1500 1700 1900Temperature anomaly (deg C) -1.2-1.0-0.8-0.6-0.4-0.20.00.20.40.6Multiproxy (Mann 2003) Multiproxy (Moberg et al. 2005) Multiproxy (Hegerl et al. 2006) Tree rings (Esper et al. 2002) -1.2-1.0-0.8-0.6-0.4-0.20.00.20.40.6 900 1100 1300 1500 1700 1900 YearTempearture anomaly (deg C) -1.2-1.0-0.8-0.6-0.4-0.20.00.20.40.6NCAR Climate System Model Energy Balance Model (Crowley, 2000) D C B A -1.2 -1.0 -0.8 -0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0.0 0.6 lengths (Oerlemans 2005) Borehole temperatures (Huang et al. 2000)OVERVIEW 19 FIGURE O-5 Large-scale surface temperature variations since A.D. 900 derived from several sources.

Panel D shows two estimates of Northern Hemisphere temperature variations pr oduced by models that include solar, volcanic, greenhouse gas, and aerosol forcings, as described by Jones and Mann (2004). All curves have been smoothed using a 40-year lowpass filter (except for th e unsmoothed instrumental data), each curve has been aligned vertically such that it has the same mean as the corresponding instrumental data during the 20th century, and all temperature anomalies are rela tive to the 1961-1990 mean of the instrumental record. 20 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS matter that dates to well before A.D. 1000), the re cent disintegration of the Larsen B ice shelf in Antarctica, and the fact that ice cores from both Greenland and coastal Antarctica show evidence of 20th century warming (whereas only Greenla nd shows warming during medieval times). Ice cores from the Andes and Tibetan plateau and the recession of the ice caps on mountains in equatorial Africa, which reflect both temperature and hydrologic processes, also suggest that the 20th century climate is unusua l in the context of the last few thousand years. What are the limitations and strengths of la rge-scale surface temperature reconstructions? The main reason that our confidence in larg e-scale surface temperatur e reconstructions is lower for periods before about A.D. 1600 is th e relative scarcity of precisely dated proxy evidence. Other factors limiting our conf idence in these reconstructions include: The relatively short length of the instru mental record (about 150 years) only provides a few pieces of independent information available to both calibrate and validate surface temperature reconstructions over large spat ial scales and multi-decade time periods. Instrumental records used for calibration and vali dation of proxy data have also been collected during a period when both global mean temperat ures and human impacts on the environment have increased substantially. Although care is taken when selecting, analyzing, and in terpreting proxy data, there is always the possibility that the relationship between the pr oxy and local surface temperatures may have varied over time. Most proxies are se nsitive to temperature only during certain times of year, and the proxy may reflect temperatur e variations on timescales longer than the calibration period. In the absence of a consensus as to which methods or statistical formulas are most appropriate for calibrating and validating these reconstruction s, different choices made by different investigators and resear ch groups also contribute to th e differences between them. In some cases the choice of whether or not to incl ude one or more proxy reco rds in a reconstruction has also been a factor. The reliability of large-scale temperature time series derived from observations at a small number of sites and with va rying levels of chronological prec ision is still unresolved. It is widely agreed that fewer sites are required for de fining century-to-century fl uctuations than year- to-year fluctuations, but errors in the reconstructions that are specifically attributable to the limited spatial sampling are difficult to quantify. The committee identified the key strengths of large-scale surface temperature reconstructions as: Proxy records are meaningful recorders of environmental variable s. These records are selected and sampled on the basis of establ ished criteria, and the connections between proxy records and environmental variables are well justified in terms of physical, chemical, and biological processes. Tree rings, the dominant data source in many large-scale surface temperature reconstructions, are derived from regional networks with extens ive replication that reflect temperature variability at the regional scale. OVERVIEW 21 Most surface temperature r econstructions incorporate pr oxy evidence from a variety of sources and wide geographic areas, and the resulting temperature esti mates are often robust with respect to the removal of individual records. The same general temperature trends emerge from different rec onstructions. Some reconstructions focus on temperature-sensi tive trees, others focus on geochemical and sedimentary proxies, and others infer the temperature signal by exploiting the spatial relationship between temperature and precipitation fields. Our overall confidence in the general character of the reconstructions for the period from around A.D. 1600 onward is high because different reconstructions based on different types of proxy evidence, different selections of proxy data of a given type, and different methodologies yield similar results. Our confidence in statem ents concerning how temperature may have varied before 1600, and, in particular, concerning the warmth of the Northern Hemisphere during medieval times compared to that of the last few decades is lower because of the limited amount of proxy evidence available and the uncertainties in reconstr ucting a large-scale average temperature from such limited datasets. The basic conclusion of Mann et al. (1998, 1999) was that the late 20th century warmth in the Northern Hemisphere was unprecedented during at least the last 1,000 years. This conclusion has subsequently been supported by an array of evidence that includes both additional large-scale surface temperature reconstructions and pronounced changes in a variety of local proxy indicators, such as melting on icecaps and the retreat of glaciers around the world. Not all individual proxy records indicate that the r ecent warmth is unprecedented, although a larger fraction of geographically divers e sites experienced exceptional warmth during the late 20th century than during any other exte nded period from A.D. 900 onward. Based on the analyses presented in the orig inal papers by Mann et al. and this newer supporting evidence, the committee finds it plausibl e that the Northern Hemisphere was warmer during the last few decades of the 20th century than during any comparable period over the preceding millennium. The substantial uncerta inties currently presen t in the quantitative assessment of large-scale surf ace temperature changes prior to about A.D. 1600 lower our confidence in this conclusion compared to the high level of confidence we place in the Little Ice Age cooling and 20th century warming. Even less confidence can be placed in the original conclusions by Mann et al. (1999) that \"the 1990s are likely the warmest decade, and 1998 the warmest year, in at least a millennium\" because the uncertainties inherent in temperature reconstructions for individual years and decades are larger than those for longer time periods, and because not all of the available proxies record temperature information on such short timescales. What do climate models and forcing estima tes tell us about the last 2,000 years? On the basis of satellite-based monitoring, wh ich began in the late 1970s, it is clear that the rapid global warming of the last few decades is not attributable to an increase in the Sun's emission. The measurements indicate that th e Sun's emission has not changed significantly during this period, apart from sma ll variations in association with the 11-year sunspot cycle. Whether variations in the Sun's brightness on lo nger timescales are large enough to constitute a significant climate forcing is stil l a matter of debate. It has b een hypothesized that reduced solar 22 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS radiation during the so-c alled \"Maunder Minimum\" in the sightings of sunspots from 1645 to 1715 could have contributed to the coldness of the Little Ice Age. Sulfate aerosols formed from gases injected into the stratosphere during major volcanic eruptions are known to increase th e fraction of the incident sola r radiation reflected back to space, cooling the lower atmosphere and the upperm ost layers of the ocean. Even though most of the particles settle ou t of the stratosphere with in a year or two, the cooling persists because it takes the ocean several years to cool down and a decade or longer to warm back up. Proxy evidence indicates that the peri od around A.D. 1000, during which wa rm intervals are evident in many of the proxy records, corresponded to an extended interval of low volcanic activity in which the incoming solar radiation was relative ly unobstructed by the presence of stratospheric aerosols. Reconstructions of temperatures and extern al forcings during the 2,000 years preceding the start of the Industrial Revolution are not yet su fficiently accurate to provide a definitive test of the climate sensitivities derived from climate models, mostly because the external forcings on this timescale (mainly solar vari ability and variations in volca nic activity) are not very well known. Climate model simulations forced with estimates of how solar emission, volcanic activity, and other natural forcings might have va ried over this time peri od, however, are broadly consistent with surface temperature rec onstructions (see panel D of Figure O-5). How central are large-scale surface temperatu re reconstructions to our understanding of global climate change? Surface temperature reconstructions have the potential to provide independent information about climate sensitivity and about the natural variability of the climate system that can be compared with estimates based on theoreti cal calculations and climate models, as well as other empirical data. However, large-scale surf ace temperature reconstr uctions for the last 2,000 years are not the primary evidence for the wi dely accepted views that global warming is occurring, that human activities ar e contributing, at least in part, to this warming, and that the Earth will continue to warm over the next centu ry. The primary evidence for these conclusions (see, e.g., NRC 2001) includes: measurements showing large increases in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases beginning in the mi ddle of the 19th century, instrumental measurements of upward temp erature trends and concomitant changes in a host of proxy indicato rs over the last century, simple radiative transfer calculations of the forcing associated with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations together with reasonable assumptions about the sign and magnitude of climate feedbacks, and numerical experiments performed with state-of-the art climate models. Supporting evidence includes: The observed global cooling in response to volcanic eruptions is consistent with sensitivity estimates based on climate models.

The stratosphere has cooled and the o ceans have warmed in a manner that is consistent with the predic ted spatial and temporal pa ttern of greenhouse warming. Surface temperature reconstructions for the last 2,000 years are consistent with other evidence of global climate change and can be co nsidered as additional supporting evidence. In particular, the numerous indications that recent warmth is unprecedented for at least the last 400 years and potentially the last several millennia, in combination with estimates of external climate forcing variations over the same period, suppor ts the conclusion that human activities are responsible for much of the recen t warming. However, the uncertain ties in the reconstructions of surface temperature and external forcings for the period prior to the instrumental record render this evidence less conclusive than the other lines of evidence cited above. It should also be noted that the scientific consensus regarding human-induced global warming would not be substantively altered if, for example, the gl obal mean surface temperature 1,000 years ago was found to be as warm as it is today. What comments can be made on the value of exchanging information and data? The collection, compilation, and ca libration of paleoclimatic da ta represent a substantial investment of time and resources, often by large teams of researchers. The committee recognizes that access to research data is a complicated, discipline-dependent issu e, and that access to computer models and methods is especially ch allenging because intellectual property rights must be considered. Our view is that all research benefits from full and open access to published datasets and that a clear explan ation of analytical methods is mandatory. Peers should have access to the information needed to reproduce publis hed results, so that increased confidence in the outcome of the study can be generated inside and outside the scien tific community. Other committees and organizations have produced an extensive body of literature on the importance of open access to scientific data and on the related guidelines for data archiving and data access (e.g., NRC 1995). Paleoclimate research would be nefit if individual res earchers, professional societies, journal ed itors, and funding agencies c ontinued to improve their efforts to ensure that these existing open access practices are followed. Tree ring researchers have recognized the im portance of data archiving since 1974, when the International Tree Ring Data Bank was establishe d to serve as a permanent repository for tree ring data (measurements, chronologies, and derive d reconstructions). It s holdings are available online via the World Data Center for Paleoclimato logy, as are a number of other proxy data from ice cores, corals, boreholes, lake and ocean sedi ments, caves, and biological indicators. As proxy datasets become increasingly availabl e on the Web, all researchers are given the opportunity to analyze data, test methods, and pr ovide their own interpretation of the existing evidence via recognized, peer-rev iewed scientific outlets. 24 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS What might be done to improve our understa nding of climate variations over the last 2,000 years? Surface temperature reconstructions have the potential to further improve our knowledge of temperature variations over the last 2,000 year s, particularly if additional proxy evidence can be identified and obtained. Additional proxy da ta that record decadal-to-centennial climate changes, especially for the pe riod A.D. 1-1600, would be particularly valuable. New data from the Southern Hemisphere, the tropics, and the oceans would improve our confidence in global temperature reconstructions, while additional data from regions that have already been sampled would help reduce the uncertainties associated with current reconstruc tions. In addition, many existing proxy records were collected decades a go and need to be updated in order to perform more reliable comparisons with instrumental reco rds. Better data cove rage would also make it possible to test whether or not past temperature changes had th e same pattern as the warming during the last century. New methods, or more careful use of existing ones, maybe also help circumvent some of the existing limitations of large-scale surface temperature reconstructions based on multiple proxies. Each individual proxy provides a record of environmental change, but the process of combining these signals into a spatially averaged temperature signal requi res careful statistical evaluation. It might be possible to circumvent some of the limitations associated with these reconstructions by employing a number of compleme ntary strategies in analyzing the proxy data, including using them to constrain climate mode ls, and by attempting to calibrate the proxy data against climatic variab les in different ways. Finally, some of the most important conse quences of climate change are linked to changes in precipitation, especi ally the frequency and intens ity of droughts and floods, as opposed to just temperature alone. Changes in regional circulation pattern s, snowfall, hurricane activity, and other climate elements over time are also of interest. Hence, it would be valuable to see both regional and large-scale reconstructions of changes in precipitation and other climate variables over the last 2,000 years, to complement those made for temperature. Efforts to improve the reliability of surface temperature reconstructions also need to be complemented by efforts to improve our understandi ng of the forcings that have c ontributed to climate variability over the past 2,000 years. When analyzed in conjunction with historic al and archeological evidence, paleoclimatic reconstructions can also tell us how past societies adapted to climate changes. This field of research is moving fo rward: Hypotheses are be ing tested, methods are being refined, and new ideas are being introduced. 25 1 Introduction to Technical Chapters The Earth's temperature varies on a wide range of timescales a nd for a variety of reasons. The variability on scales of 10,000-100,000 years is p aced by cyclic changes in the Earth's orbit, but strongly depends on the internal operation of the climate system and its connection with other environmental variables. The colder glaci al times are marked by decreased concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases, which serve to amplify the cooling at the Earth's surface, resulting in temperature swings on the order of 5\u00b0C between glacial times and the warmer interglacial periods, such as the current one (Hansen 2004). Over the last 2,000 years, the changes in the Earth's orbit have been sm all (Lean 2005). Variations in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases we re also very small during this period prior to the advent of human impacts in the 19th century (Joos 2005). The question then of how global mean surface temperature varied over the last 2,000 years is of great interest. When analyzed in co njunction with reconstructi ons of solar variability, volcanic activity, and other influences on clim ate during this period, surface temperature reconstructions can be of use in efforts to re duce the level of uncertainty in projections of human-induced greenhouse warming. Such recons tructions provide a measure of the natural variability of the climate system, against whic h projections of human-induced global warming can be compared. This chapter describes how large-scale surface temperature reconstructions contribute to our understanding of the sensitivity of global mean temperature to natural and human-induced perturbations of th e Earth's energy balance. It al so offers a perspective on the importance of surface temperature re constructions, as compared with other kinds of evidence, in assessing the extent to which the warming of th e late 20th century is attributable to human activities CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS This report focuses on surface temperature rec onstructions over large geographic scales, in particular global mean and hemispheric m ean surface temperatures. Global mean surface temperature is a particularly good in dicator of the state of the climat e system because it is closely related to the balance between incoming and outgoing energy at the top of the atmosphere. Global mean surface temperature varies in response to events outside the climate system that affect the global en ergy balance (NRC 2005). The external forcings considered to be of greatest importance for climate over the la st 2,000 years are changes in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other green house gases, aerosol concentrations, volcanic 26 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS activity, and solar radiation. Cha nges in land use (clearing of fore sts, increasing the coverage of cultivated land, and deser tification) may also contribute to cl imate variability but their influence is difficult to quantify (Ruddiman 2003). Human activities have caused increases in the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases a nd aerosols, which first became appreciable in the 19th century. The climate system also exhibits internal variability that would occur even in the absence of external forcing. A familiar example of intern al climate variability on a year-to-year scale is El Ni\u00f1o, which is a consequence of interactio ns between the tropical Pacific Ocean and the global atmosphere. Interactions among the more massive, slowly varying components of the climate system could give rise to internal va riability of the climate system on timescales of decades to centuries that may be largely unrelat ed to the external forcings on those timescales. The change in global mean surface air temperatur e that occurs in res ponse to a persistent external forcing of 1 watt per square mete r over the Earth's surface is defined as the sensitivity of the climate system (NRC 2003). An alternative un it, used extensively in this report, is the temperature increase (in \u00b0C) that would occur in response to a doubling of the preindustrial atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. Climat e sensitivity is determined by the laws of physics and can be estimated using the methods described in the ne xt section. The fluctuations in global mean surface temperature that occurred in response to pa st natural forcings provide a check on estimates of climate sensitivity. Other things being equal, the higher the sensitivity, the larger the future warming that can be expected in response to future greenhouse forcing. The strength of the various external forcings can be quantified and compared; knowledge gained from understanding the response to one kind of forci ng is applicable to pr edicting the response to other kinds of forcing. As in other physical systems, high climate se nsitivity is indicative of the prevalence of positive climate feedbacks (NRC 2004). The most important positive fee dback in the climate system involves the increase in th e concentration of atmospheric wa ter vapor as the Earth warms. Changes in concentrations of water vapor, a greenhouse gas in its own right, amplify the warming or cooling that occurs in response to changes in concentra tions of other greenhouse gases. Another positive feedback involves the decrease in the fractional area covered by snow and ice as temperatures warm, which decreases th e reflectivity of the Earth as a whole. Other feedbacks involve changes in cloudiness, lapse ra te, the atmospheric circulation, and land surface properties as the Earth warms or cools. The comb ined effect of the vari ous positive and negative feedbacks determines the sensitivity of the climat e system and the sensitivity, in turn, determines how much the Earth will warm in response to a prescribed increas e in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide or ch anges in other external forcing. Estimation of Climate Sensitivity The sensitivity of the climate system can be estimated in several different ways. The direct response to a doubling of preindustrial atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations that would be observed in the absence of feedbacks is estimated on the basis of radiative transfer calculations to be about 1\u00b0C , a nd the water vapor feedback (cal culated under the assumption of constant relative humidity) near ly doubles this response (e.g., Held and Soden 2000). Numerical experiments conducted with a variety of climate m odels that incorporate the full suite of climate feedbacks yield a range of climate sensitivities. The least sensitive models exhibit sensitivities INTRODUCTION TO TECHNICAL CHAPTERS 27 roughly comparable to what would be obtained if only the water vapor feedback were included (about 2\u00b0C for a carbon dioxide doubling) wher eas the most sensitive models estimate a sensitivity five times as large as radiative transfer calculations (Goosse et al. 2005, Webb et al. 2006, Winton 2006). The mid-range models estimat e a climate sensitivity of around 3\u00b0C for a doubling of carbon dioxide. The sensitivity estimates de rived from the models are checked by comparing observed and simulated responses to various known extern al forcings. For example, model simulations which consider surface temperature reconstruc tions for the past 700 years combined with instrumental data estimate climate sensitivity to be between 1.5 and 6.2\u00b0C (Hegerl et al. 2006). ATTRIBUTION OF GLOBAL WARM ING TO HUMAN INFLUENCES The attribution of the large-scale warming of the late 20th century to human influences is supported in part by evidence that the warmth of the most recent one or two decades stands out above the background or natural variability of the last 2,000 years. To place this paleoclimatic evidence in context, it is necessa ry to consider the other evid ence on which the attribution is based. Based on evidence summarized in Chapter 2, it is known that global mean surface temperature has risen by about 0.6\u00b0 C during the past century, and th at most of this warming took place during the period 1920-1940 and during the last 30 years. The troposphere is warming at a rate compatible with the warming of the Ea rth's surface (CCSP and SGCR 2006). The spatial pattern of the observed temperat ure trends resembles the \"finge rprint\" of greenhouse warming in climate models, with cooling of the stratosphere and an uptake of heat by the oceans (e.g., Meehl et al. 2004, Hansen et al. 2005, Barnett et al. 2005). The warming is also reflected in a host of other indicators: For example, glaciers are re treating, permafrost is melting, snowcover is decreasing, Arctic sea ice is thinning, rivers and lakes are melting earlier and freezing later, bird migration and nesting dates are changing, flowers are blooming earl ier, and the ra nges of many insect and plant species are spreading to highe r latitudes and higher el evations (e.g., ACIA 2001, Parmesan and Yohe 2003, Root et 2003, Berta ux et al. 2004, Bradshaw and Holzapfel 2006). It is also well esta blished that atmospheri c concentrations of greenhouse gases have been increasing due to human activities. In recent decades the increases have been documented on the basis of direct measurements at a network of st ations. Increases in concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide starting in the 19th century, following many millennia of nearly constant concentrations , are clearly discernible in ai r bubbles trapped in ice cores recovered from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets (Petit et al. 1999, Siegenthaler et al. 2005, Spahni et al. 2005). The attribut ion of these increases to human activities rests on both isotopic evidence and the fact that they are consistent wi th inventories of emissions of these gases from the burning of fossil fuels and other human activ ities, taking into account the storage in the oceans and the land biosphere. Based on stati on and ice core measurements, the combined forcing due to the greenhouse gases injected into the atmosphere by human activities is about 2.5 watts per square meter (IPCC 2001). Based on a climate sensitivity of 3\u00b0C for a carbon dioxide doubling, as estimated in the preceding section, a greenhouse forcing of 2.5 watts per square meter is sufficient to produce a warming of around 2\u00b0C. The observed warming during the 20th century of around 0.6\u00b0C is less than the estimated response to the greenhouse forcing for two reasons: 28 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS it is partially offset by increases in the c oncentration of sulfat e and other aerosols, which tend to produce cooling at the Earth' s surface (e.g., Santer et al. 1995); and part of the warming has not been realized yet because the oceans and polar ice sheets have not had sufficient tim e to equilibrate with the forc ing (e.g., Hansen et al. 2005). The observed 0.6\u00b0C warming during the 20th cent ury is much larger than the internal variability in climate models. Model simulations that include both externally forced and internal variability, including plausible pres criptions of time-varying sulfate aerosols, yield time series of global mean temperature that resemble the obse rvations (Stott et al . 2000, Ammann et al. 2003). To the extent that the warmth of the most recen t one or two decades stands out above the natural variability in mean surface temp erature over the last 2,000 years, the surface temperature record serves as supporting evidence that human activiti es are largely responsible for the recent warming. However, the attribution of the recen t global warming to human activities does not rest solely or even principa lly upon paleoclimate evidence. REPORT STRUCTURE The next chapter of this repor t provides a brief description of the instrumental record and some considerations that apply to estimating large-scale surface temperature variations on the basis of observations at a limite d number of sites. Most of what we know about how the temperature of the Earth has varied on the timescale of the last 2,000 years is based on proxy records , including documentary records, archeologica l evidence and a variety of natural sources including tree rings, corals, ice cores, ocean and lake sediments, borehole temperatures and glacier length records. The sources and charac teristics of the various proxy datasets are discussed in Chapters 3-8. Th e statistical procedures and a ssumptions that are used in reconstructions of surface temperatures from proxy data are discussed in Chapter 9. Paleoclimate models and an expanded discussion of variations in climat e forcing over the last two millennia are presented in Chapter 10. Fina lly, Chapter 11 describes the synthesis of evidence derived from a variety of different pr oxies to produce large-scale surface temperature reconstructions. These techniques have been a subject of controversy in a number of recent papers in the refereed literature, so Chapter 11 also assesses their strengths, limitations, and prospects for improvement. 29 2 The Instrumental Record Global average temperature estimates based on the instrumental record indicate: a near-level trend from 1856 to about 1910, a rise to 1945, a slight declin e to about 1975, and a rise to the present. The overall increase during the 20th century wa s about 0.6\u00b0C, with the highest warming rates occurring in land areas poleward of 30\u00b0N. Instrumental temperature records extend b ack over 250 years in some locations, but only since the late 19th century has there been a sufficient number of observing stations to estimate the average temperature over the Northern Hemisphere or over the entire globe. Combining instrumental records to calc ulate large-scale surface temperatures requires including a sufficient number of instrument al sites with wide ge ographic distribution to get a representative estimate. Tropical measuremen ts are particularly useful for estimating large- scale temperatures because they tend to more closely track global mean variations. Most surface temperature reconstructions depend in some way on the instrumental surface temperature record. Individual and multiproxy reconstructions based on annually or seasonally resolved proxy data use this record for both calibration and valid ation. Other types of reconstructions for instance, those derived from glacial lengths and borehole measurements implicitly use local instrumental reco rds to help develop the physical model used to turn the proxy record into a temperature record. Hence, it is useful to briefly describe the instrumental record and discuss its features a nd uncertainties before examining the manner in which it is employed in surface temperature reconstructions. INSTRUMENTAL DATA The instrumental surface temperature record (\"instrumental record\") is derived from traditional thermometer readings and provides the basis for generating the large-scale (global mean or hemispheric mean) surfac e temperature estimates used in climate change studies. The global average temperature is produced as a combination of near-surface land air temperatures and temperatures of the sea water near the surf ace (or sea surface temper atures [SSTs]) for the oceans. Land air temperatures are measuremen ts taken by thermometers mounted in shelters about 1.5 meters above the land surface, or higher in areas where snow cover may be substantial. About 2,000 stations report land air temperatures for the global compilations shown in this chapter. The stations are not spatially distributed to monitor all land areas with equal density; unpopulated and undeveloped areas have alwa ys tended to have poor coverage. 30 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS SSTs are measured by ships, buoys, bat hythermograph profilers, and, since 1981, satellites. Ships generally take the water temper ature in one of three wa ys: buckets (the oldest method), hull sensors, and water drawn in to co ol the engines (injection temperatures). The depths of ship measurements vary from 1 to 15 meters. Buoys are more standardized and report temperatures generally at 1 meter as well as se veral other depths depending on the buoy type. Very few land air temperature records begin prior to 1856, so estimates of large-scale (i.e., global and hemispheric) aver ages are uncertain before that time. The average SST for all oceans is less well known than land air temperatur e, especially during the middle to late 19th century, when large portions of th e tropical and southern oceans were poorly sampled (and these areas remain comparatively undersampled). Diffe rences in the types of measurement methods, the generally unknown calibration of instruments, and the sparse geographic and temporal sampling in many areas contribute to uncertainties in the estimates of large-scale averages. In addition, the proxy indicators discussed in Chapte rs 3-8 are generally not directly sensitive to 1.5 meter air temperature. For example, borehol e temperature profiles ar e sensitive to the ground surface temperatures, and ice isotopic ratios are sensitive to cloud-level atmospheric temperatures. Significant systemat ic differences can exist between temperatures at such different elevations with respect to ground, and these differences represent one of the inherent uncertainties in performing surf ace temperature reconstructions. FEATURES OF THE INSTRUMENTAL RECORD Large-Scale Averages Figure 2-1 shows three large-scale averag es of annual mean surface temperature anomalies from the HadCRUT2v dataset (Jones et al. 2001), which is commonly used in both proxy reconstructions and more general global climate studies.5 The three estimates are for (1) global, (2) Northern Hemisphere, and (3) Nort hern Hemisphere extratropical land areas only (20\u00b0N-85\u00b0N). The Northern Hemisphere extr atropical land area estimate has the largest variability of the three because the mid and high latitude continental climatic zones generally exhibit larger temperature swings on virtually all timescales than other regions of the globe. The Northern Hemisphere and global estimates exhi bit less variability because of the additional influence of SSTs, which have less variability th an land air temperatures from year to year, mainly due to the higher heat capacity of the oc ean mixed layer compared to the land surface. The evolving pattern of fluctuations is similar in these three large-scale averages because (a) the Northern Hemisphere extratropical land area sta tions form a major part of the larger-scale averages and (b) the larger variations in the No rthern Hemisphere extratropical land area record tend to dominate the smaller vari ations in the remaining regi ons. Since 1978, instruments on satellites have monitored the temperature of th e deep atmospheric laye r above the surface and, though regional differences occur, global aver age trends agree with the surface warming of +0.16\u00b0C per decade within \u00b10.04\u00b0C per decade (CCSP and SGCR 2006). 5 Two other widely used compilations of global surface temp erature, Hansen et al. (2001) and Smith and Reynolds (2005), yield very similar results. THE INSTRUMENTAL RECORD 31 Annual Temperature Anomalies -1.0-0.50.00.51.01.5 1850 1860 1870 1880 1890 1900 1910 1920 1930 1950 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010C\u00b0Globe NH NH-Ex-Land FIGURE 2-1 Global, Northern Hemisphere, and Nort hern Hemisphere extratropical land area annual temperature anomalies from the HadCRUT2v surface temperature dataset. SOURCE: Jones et al. (2001). In addition to substantial year-to-year vari ability, the global instrumental temperature record shows the following low-frequency features : a slight decline from 1856 to 1910, a rise of ~0.4\u00b0C between 1910 and 1945, a leveling or sli ght decline between about 1945 and 1975, and a rise of ~0.5\u00b0C from 1975 to the present. Th e overall rise during the 20th century was about 0.6\u00b0C, with an additional 0.1\u00b0C repo rted since then. If the 150 years of relatively reliable instrumental data are divided into three 50-year segments 1856-1905 (I), 1906-1955 (II), and 1956-2005 (III) the average global temperature anomalies for these three periods relative to the 1961-1990 mean are -0.32\u00b0C (I), -0.20\u00b0C (II), and +0.11\u00b0C (III), respectively. Given this variability, a large-scale surface temperature reconstruction would require exceptionally good accuracy, on the order of a few hundredths of a de gree Centigrade, to distinguish (I) from (II). To distinguish (III) from the earlier two peri ods, an error of ~0.15\u00b0C would be acceptable. Therefore, if the temperature variations observe d during the last 150 years are representative of fluctuations over the last 2,000 years, a relativ ely small (and well-charac terized throughout the time series) error allowance is required to dis tinguish in a quantitative way the global average temperature levels of the latter half of the 20t h century from earlier i ndividual 50-year periods. Decadal averages, beginning with 1856, produce global values ranging from -0.38\u00b0C (1906-1915) to +0.42\u00b0C (1996-2005). Thus, to distinguish global mean decadal temperature anomalies into, for example, thr ee categories (cool, average, warm ) in the context of the last 150 years would require errors of ~0.2\u00b0C or less. As in other types of tim e-series analysis, the magnitude of the climate signal must also be sufficiently greater than the magnitude of the potential errors in order to make confident stat ements about the relative warmth of individual periods. This must be the case over the entire length of the period under investigation to make inferences about which decades might be the warm est or the coolest. Th is is a particularly difficult subject for proxy-based records since th ere are no absolute temperature measurements 32 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS on these timescales for the preinstrumental era. Hence, the estimation of error characteristics, which are discussed in detail in Chapter 9, is a major emphasis in paleoclimate reconstructions. Seasonal and Spatial Patterns Many proxies are most sensitive to temperatur e during certain seasons: For example, tree ring measurements are usually (but not always) mo st sensitive to mean temperatures during the summer growing season. For comparison, Figure 2-2 shows the annual and summer anomalies of the Northern Hemisphere ex tratropical land area temperature record. It is clear that differences occur from year to year and, in the early period, even from decade to decade between the two averaging periods. Year-to-year Northe rn Hemisphere temperatures vary over a wider range in winter than summer, but the annual m ean temperature, being the average of four seasonal anomalies, tends to smooth out these seasonal fluctuations, which are greater in nonsummer seasons, to give roughly the same yea r-to-year variability as summer. However, note that the 150-year trend in annual mean Northern Hemisphere extratropical land area temperatures is more positive than the corresponding trend in summer mean temperatures (+0.063\u00b0C vs. +0.025\u00b0C per decade). This difference could be of consequence if the trend influences the statistical calibra tion procedures (see Chapter 9). Figure 2-3 displays the regional trends through 2005 beginning in 1870 and in 1950. The changing distribution of measurem ents is evident as the map beginning in 1870 has much poorer geographic coverage, especially over land. Since 1950, most regi ons indicate positive surface trends, especially in mid and high northern la titudes. These observed positive trends over the last few decades are sometimes not reflected in tr ee-ring-based reconstructi ons for those regions, as further discussed in Chapter 4.

Several factors influence the land air temperature measurements over time. As land use has changed (e.g., from forest to urban), many thermometers in the la nd air temperature record have responded to the changes in the thermal properties of their surr oundings, yielding temperature changes that are real but not likely due to large-scale climatic causes. The geographic distribution of the land air temperature sites has also grown significantly since 1856, so data from regions that previously had no measurements now provide a more accurate large-scale average, gi ving rise to larger errors in the earlier part of the record. Sim ilarly, compilations of SST measurements suffer from poor calibration and sampling in th e earlier decades. These type s of problems are estimated to introduce a potential error (95 percent confiden ce) of ~0.10\u00b0C for the earliest decades of the global and Northern Hemisphere average temperat ure values (Folland et al. 2001b). In the most recent decades, improved coverage and better know ledge of instrumental biases, such as the effects of urbanization, reduce th e error range to ~0.04\u00b0C (Broha n et al. in press). These potential errors are relatively small compared to the observed decadal temperature changes for the last 150 years described above. Errors in the instrumental record can re duce the effectiveness of the proxy calibration process because the fundamental relationship sought from th e calibration exercise may be compromised to a degree. For example, proxy-te mperature relationships determined on the local scale suffer from errors arising from (a) i nhomogeneous data at the land air temperature calibration site, (b) horiz ontal distance between the proxy lo cation and the land air temperature site, (c) elevation differences between the proxy location and the land air temperature site, and (d) differences between the land air temperature s ites that are composited to create the calibration and validation datasets. As a re sult, there are many opportunities fo r errors in the measurements and averaging techniques to in fluence the temperature datasets against which proxy methods are calibrated and verified. Fortunate ly, when increasing the size of the samples being averaged and tested, random and uncorrelated e rrors tend to cancel, enhancing th e confidence of the variations produced. There is also the added burden of dealing w ith new versions of pa rticular datasets. Estimates by research groups of large-scale aver age temperatures for particular periods have changed somewhat over time. This occurs wh en the different groups (a) update the primary source data used in the large-scale averages, (b) institute new adjustment procedures, or (c) adopt new spatial or temporal averaging techniques. Thus, a proxy record calibrated or verified using an early version of an instrumental record may be altered slightly if the instrumental data against which the proxy was calibrated changes. SPATIAL SAMPLING ISSUES Deducing the number of sites at which surface temperature needs to be sampled in order to represent variations in global (or hemispheric) mean temp erature with a specified level of accuracy is a challenge no less form idable than deducing the temper ature variations themselves. THE INSTRUMENTAL RECORD 35 The most obvious way to address this problem is to try replicating the va riations in the Earth's temperature in the instrumental record using limited subsets of station data. The effectiveness of this approach is limited by the length of the obs ervational record. One way of overcoming this limitation is to sample much longer time series of synthetic climate variations generated by climate models, but this strategy is compromise d by the limited capability of the models to simulate temperature variations on the century-t o-century timescale and on spatial scales that represent the highly variable ch aracter of the Earth's surface. The studies that have been performed to date suggest that 50-100 geographical ly dispersed sites are sufficient to replicate the variability in the instrumental record (e .g., Hansen and Lebedev 1987, Karl et al. 1990, Shen et al. 1994). These results indica te that the temperature fluctuati ons in the instrumental record are well resolved; that is, proxy records do generally reflect the sa me variability as instrument records where they overlap (Jones et al. 1997). However, they leave open the question of whether the proxy records are suffi ciently numerous and geographica lly dispersed to resolve the major features in the time series of the temperature of the Eart h extending back over hundreds or even thousands of years. Hopes for reliable Northern Hemisphere and global surface temperature reconstructions extending back far beyond the instrumental reco rd are based on the premise that local surface temperature variations on timescales of centuri es and longer are dominated by variations in global mean temperature that occur in response to changes in the global energy balance. If this premise is correct, it follows that temperature time series at points on Earth should be more strongly correlated with the ti me series of the global mean temperature on these longer timescales than they are on the year-to-year times cale. Several papers offer support for this view (e.g., Leung and North 1991, Shen et al. 1994), as does the time series shown in Figure 2-4 (Bradley et al. 1988). The st rong correspondence between the No rthern Hemisphere and China curves indicates that much of the decade-to-d ecade and century-to-century variability in the mean temperature of the Northern Hemisphere since 1880 can be captured using data from the Chinese station network alone. Of course, temper ature time series at individual sites within China are not as highly correlated with hemis pheric mean time series as the China-mean time series in Figure 2-4, and proxy time series do no t perfectly represent th e true time series of surface temperature variations. Much remain s to be done to place the spatial sampling requirements on a firm footing. .

The instrumental record of surface temperature shown in Figure 2-5 is instructive in this respect. Th e rise in surface air temperature that occurred during the 1920s and the slight decline during the 1950s were much more pronounced over high latitudes of the Northern Hemis phere than at lower lat itudes. In contrast, the warming of the last few decades has been mu ch more latitudinally uniform. The latitudinally dependent features in Figure 2-5 serve as a reminder that not all the variability over high latitudes, as recorded in ice core measurem ents and high-latitude proxies, is necessarily representative of variations in global mean temperature.

Europe and East Asia are the two regions of the world where temperature series more than 200 years long have been successfu lly developed from documentary evidence in a repeatable and consistent way. This evidence shows that bot h regions experienced overall medieval warming and Little Ice Age cooling, bu t because of their paucity and sometimes poor data quality, it is very difficult to know from these sources alone if the medieval period was as warm, or warmer, than the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Historical and archeological evidence can reveal how societies have responded to climate variability in the past. These show that societal responses could not have been predicted in advance and that su ccessful adaptations to new clima tic conditions depended on the good or bad choices that people made. TYPES OF EVIDENCE Historical observations, pres erved mainly in documentary form, can provide valuable records about past climate states (Lamb 1982). For example, the schematic temperature curve for the last millennium included in the first In tergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report (IPCC 1990; see also Figure O-3) drew heavily on documentary evidence. In addition to systematic weather recordings, such as those us ed by Manley (1974) to compile his record of temperatures in central England, there is a wi de range of direct a nd indirect proxy climate information available (Table 3-1). In a clas sic early study, Ladurie ( 1972) used farming and phenological6 records to document times of feast and fa mine in western Europe during the Little Ice Age (roughly 1500-1850). Logbooks and diaries, such as the diary kept by Benjamin Franklin when he was American ambassador in Paris during the 1780s , provide another, complementary source of data. Franklin reporte d a \"constant dry fog on which the rays of the sun seemed to have little effect\" along with severe late frosts, wh ich we now attribute to the Laki volcanic fissure eruption in Icela nd (Grattan and Brayshay 1995). 6 Phenology is the study of the annual cycles of plants and animals and how they respond to seasonal changes in their environment. 38 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS TABLE 3-1 Types of documentary eviden ce used for climate reconstructions.a Direct data Descriptions Weather diaries Natural disasters Direct measurements Temperature Precipitation Pressure Indirect (or proxy) data Organic Phenological data Grape and crop harvests Inorganic Flood marks Icing and break-ups Duration of snow cover Material sources Inscriptions Paintings and photographs Maps and charts Rogation processions 7 a Based on Pfister (1992) Many historical documents, rather than recording weather per se , provide indirect evidence of past climatic conditi ons. Historical paintings of al pine landscapes, for example, allow us to pinpoint the former ex tent of glaciers at pr ecise moments in time, thus contributing to the temperature reconstructions derived from glacier length records di scussed in Chapter 7. Similar, but potentially more continuous, time seri es of sea ice cover have been derived from Antarctic whaling records and from observations of drift ice around the coast of Iceland (e.g., Ogilvie 1992, de la Mare 1997). In the tropics and in dryland regions, periods of drought and flood are most frequently reported; Endfield et al . (2004), for instance, used archival sources to reconstruct rainfall fluctuations in Spanish co lonial Mexico. To qua ntify long series of documentary data such as these in climatic terms, they, like other proxies, need to be calibrated against instrumental measurements. Br\u00e1zdil et al . (2005) provide a comprehensive review of the methodological framework within which historic al archives and documents are currently utilized. LIMITATIONS AND BENEFITS OF HISTORICAL AND DOCUMENTARY SOURCES All historical sources need to be evaluated cr itically, even for relatively recent times. For example, frost fairs were routinely held on the iced-over surface of the River Thames in London during the cold winters of the L ittle Ice Age, with the last on e occurring in 1814. It would be quite wrong, however, to attribute their absence si nce that time solely to a rise in Northern Hemisphere winter temperatures : As London has grown and developed, the \"urban heat island\" effect has reduced the likelihood of frosts in the city center , and the replacement of the old London Bridge in the 1830s allowed greater uptid e incursion of saltwater, which freezes less easily. Manley's Central England temperature series indicates that the winter of 1962-63 was 7 Christian agricultural celebrations DOCUMENTARY AND HISTORICAL EVIDENCE 39 the third coldest since 1659, yet the Thames did not freeze below its tidal limit (Jones and Mann 2004). The problem of quality control becomes even more acute further back in time, so that in contrast to natural archives such as ice cores or tree rings historical records generally degrade in their utility as they become older. There ar e, for example, weather records preserved in Irish and Norse Annals back to the middle of the firs t millennium A.D., but their dating is imprecise and descriptions of weather and climate often are exaggerated. Understandably, historical observations also tend to focus on extreme events ra ther than climatic averages. For example, it was major storm events that most concerned Ve netian traders and mariners; their records were used by Grove (2004) to reconstruct the climat e of Crete in the 16th and 17th centuries. Documentary evidence is one of the few kinds available that can re gister severe floods, hurricanes, and other natural disasters. Conseque ntly, their analysis enab les an investigation of the relationship between variations in climate and the frequency a nd severity of extreme events, a subject that is of major societal concer n in relation to projected global warming. Historical observations are ty pically discontinuous through tim e and, as such, one of their most valuable roles is in providing a cross-check on recons tructions based on other proxy records, such as tree rings, and on the validity of paleoclimate model simulations. For example, modeling experiments show ma rked warming in Siberia during the winters immediately following major explosive volcanic eruptions, such as that of Pinatubo (Shindell et al. 2003). The diaries of travelers pa ssing through northern interior Asia in key years (e.g., 1815-1816, 1883-1884) would allow this prediction to be tested independently. SYSTEMATIC CLIMATE RECONSTRUCTIONS DERIVED FROM HISTORICAL ARCHIVES Europe and East Asia are the two regions of the world where long temperature series have been most successfully developed from documentary evidence in a repeatable and consistent way for periods of more than the last two centuries. Europe The documentary evidence for Europe as a whole has been reviewed by Br\u00e1zdil et al. (2005) and for the Mediterranean region by Luterbach er et al (2006). Seas onal temperature data have been compiled for most areas of central and western Europe back to 1500, and these show that the late 20th and early 21st centuries have been warmer, at high probability for three out of four seasons, than any time period in the last fi ve centuries (Xoplaki et al. 2005) (Figure 3-1). By combining documentary evidence with other proxy data, Luterbacher et al. (2004) were able to map winter and summer temperature anomalie s across Europe for individual years back to 1500, along with area-specific erro r estimates. This mapping permits a rigorous assessment of the spatial coherency of past annual to decadal climatic cha nges at a sub-continental scale, and also allowed Pauling et al. ( 2003) to calculate the best pred ictors of winter and summer temperatures from the available array of different proxy climate data for di fferent parts of Europe and the North Atlantic Ocean. It shows, for exam ple, tree rings to have been a good predictor of 40 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS past summer temperatures across northern and central Europe, whereas documentary sources are more reliable for reconstruc ting wintertime temperatures. Within Europe, only two continuous records currently extend back before 1500, namely, those from the Czech Republic (Br\u00e1zdil 1996) and the Low Countries (Netherlands and Belgium; van Engelen et al. 2001), both of which have be en incorporated into synthetic large-scale temperature reconstructions (e.g., Jones and Ma nn 2004). They mark the 20th century as exceptionally warm but also indicate milder conditions prior to about 1400, while the Czech record also shows higher temperatures around the tu rn of the 19th century. It is not possible, however, to glean systematic, quantitative temper ature data across Europe during the medieval period from historical documents alone. A lthough historical evid ence provides important anecdotal evidence for this er a, it is very difficult to know from these limited and rather imprecise sources alone if there were medieval time periods lasting a decade or more when the climate was as warm as, or warmer tha n, the late 20th and early 21st centuries. East Asia The second region for which there exist syst ematic temperature syntheses of several centuries' duration is East Asia. In Korea a nd Japan, for example, the date of the spring flowering of cherry trees has been recorded syst ematically every year for more than a thousand years (Aono and Omoto 1993). Wang et al. ( 2001) used documentary records to compile decadal average mean annual temperatures for East and North China back to 1380, and 50-year average temperatures for East China back to A.D. 800. In some cases (e.g., Yang et al. 2002), documentary data have been amalgamated with other proxy-climate data to generate regional composite temperature curves. Results from Ge et al. (2001) usi ng phenological records supplemented by winter snow-day records from historical documents, reproduced in Figure 3-1, show temperatures above the long-term mean from A.D. 950 to 1300, and again after 1925, with Little Ice Age thermal minima in the 17th and 19t h centuries. These data from the opposite ends of the Eurasian land mass give support to the id ea that medieval warming and the Little Ice Age affected much if not all of th e extratropical Northern Hemisphe re land masses, notwithstanding significant differences at annual to decadal times cales in the periods of warmth and cold. Documentary evidence is generally limited to regions with long writt en traditions. The historical time depth is probabl y sufficient in a few other re gions of the world to attempt systematic compilation of seasonal or annual temperature time series from documentary evidence. This potential exists, but has yet to be realized, in South and Southeast Asia and in the Middle East. An example of this capacity, al beit for African precipitation, is the Roda Nilometer, which has recorded annual data on th e height of the Nile flood in Egypt from A.D. 645 to 1890 (Hassan 1981). DOCUMENTARY AND HISTORICAL EVIDENCE 41 FIGURE 3-1 Seasonal temperature reconstructions based on historical evidence from Europe and China with standard errors (2 standard deviations fo r Europe, 1 standard deviation for China). Twentieth- century records (post-1950 for China) are based on instrumental data and do not show error bars. All data are subject to 30-year smoothing. SOURCES: Xoplaki et al. (2005), Ge et al. (2001). 42 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS CONSEQUENCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE FOR PAST SOCIETIES Historical documents, along with archeologi cal and paleobiological evidence, can also reveal how societies and ecosystems have responde d to climate variability in the past. This section provides a short illust rative summary of past human re sponses to climate change. However, it is important to note th e danger of circular reasoning in this sphere, in the sense that the same evidence for cultural response cannot also be used to infer climatic causality. It is also clear that past societal responses have in ge neral not been predictable or predetermined in advance. Although societies may have been requ ired to adapt to new conditions, the outcome has depended on the success of th e choices that were made (D iamond 2005, Rosen in press). The implications of changing climatic condi tions have often been most immediate for agrarian economies, particularly in environmentally marginal lands, and for long-distance communications. In the former case, there was a widespread contraction of rural settlement in upland regions of Europe to lower-lying terrain, a ssociated with the overall climatic deterioration between the late 16th and mid-18t h centuries (Parry 1978). In Icel and, an increase in storminess and in winter sea ice cover during the Little Ice Age hampered seabor ne communications across the North Atlantic, on which the island's populat ion was critically dependent. The 1780s brought not only the most severe pack ice of any decade since the 16th century (Ogilvie 1992) but also poisoning of livestock and humans by hydrogen fluoride gases released by the Laki fissure eruption. In combination, this killed mo re than 75 percent of Iceland's livestock and 25 percent of its human population, and brought society close to colla pse. Other examples where climate change may have played a part in soci etal collapse include the Classic Maya during the 9th century A.D. and the Anasazi of the American Southwest during the 12th and 13th centuries. Both of these cases were linked to periods of extended drought condi tions (Hodell et al. 1995, Dean 1998). Climate-induced stress can also act as a stimulus to innovate; for example, declines in rainfall or shifts in temperature ha ve sometimes been followed by technological developments, such as irri gation (Rosen in press). It is also possible to find ex amples of climatic changes th at were not accompanied by any obvious direct social consequences, or to find cas es where the same climatic change had sharply contrasting consequences for diffe rent social groups in the same area. A clear example of contrasting adaptations and success/failure in the same environment is provided by the Inuit and the Vikings in western Greenland and the Arctic during the onset of the Little Ice Age. The Norse settlements of Greenland were always marginal, not only because climatic conditions were poorly suited for agriculture, but also because of isolation from their pare nt cultures in northern Europe. In the face of increasingly harsh clim atic conditions, populations declined, the western Viking settlement was abandoned around 1350, and th e eastern settlement followed suit about a century later. The Norse perceived the adverse changes in climate as a function of cosmological disorder and built ever more impressive church es, rather than adopting new technologies or searching for new sources of food (Barlow et al. 1997, Buckland et al. 1996, McIntosh et al. 2000, Diamond 2005, Rosen in press). During the same period of medieval warmth that had encouraged Norse expansion, retreating sea ice appears to have allowed an eastw ard migration of native I nuits along the Arctic shore from Alaska, and thence southward into th e same areas of west Greenland being colonized by the Vikings. And like the Norse, these T hule Inuit cultures were challenged to adapt constantly in order to explo it the available resources; for ex ample, their methods of whale hunting had to adjust depending on whether the se a ice was close to, or far removed from, the DOCUMENTARY AND HISTORICAL EVIDENCE 43 shore (Wohlforth 2004). There appears to have b een little contact betw een the Norse and the Thule peoples and no cultural exchange, so that th e Norse may not even have been aware of the successful Inuit adaptations for us e of marine resources. During th e period of the Little Ice Age, the Inuit peoples had to adapt to changing environmental conditions once again. For example, to continue whaling, their populations on Alaska's North Slope congregated in the few places on the coast where open water could still be reached, such as Nuvuk (Point Barrow). As a result of this and other choices, the Inuit unlike the Norse survived in the Arctic up to modern times. 44 4 Tree Rings Measurements of tree ring parameters from regions where temperature limits tree growth can be used to recons truct surface temperature. These show that the 20th century warming is unusual since at least 1500. Tree rings have several features that make them well suited for climatic reconstruction, such as ease of replication, wi de geographic availability, annual to seasonal resolution, and accurate, inte rnally consistent dating. Tree ring records exist for the last tw o millennia, although spatial coverage decreases going back in time. Surface temperature reconstructions base d on tree rings require attention to confounding factors; guidelines exist to identify and account for these factors. DEFINITION AND PREMISES Dendroclimatology is the appli cation of tree ring science, or dendrochronology, to the study of climate (Fritts 1976). The online Bi bliography of Dendrochronology (Dobbertin and Grissino-Mayer 2004) includes more than 10,000 references addressing questions in archaeology, climatology, ecology, forestr y, hydrology, geology, geom orphology, and other areas. A considerable portion of tree ring data collected on all inhabited continents is freely available online (Grissin o-Mayer and Fritts 1997). Dendroclimatic records are commonly derive d from areas where wood growth is related to climate. For air temperature,8 preferred locations are close to the treeline, which represents the altitudinal or latitudinal lim it to tree growth (Kullman 1998, K\u00f6 rner 1999). From a review of published data, Grace (1988) concluded that \"a 1\u00b0C increase in a north temperate climate may be expected to increase plant productivity by about 10 percent, providing th at other factors like water or nutrients do not become limiting.\" Cont rolled experiments dealing with the effect of temperature on plant growth are mostly performe d on herbaceous species or seedlings (Junttila 1986, Loveys et al. 2002), and it is difficult to extrapolate those findings to the spatial and temporal scales considered by dendroclimatologist s. For example, consider the evidence for treeline shifts in many areas of the world (MacDonald et al. 1998, Esper and Schweingruber 8 This chapter does not cover the other numerous climatic variables (e.g., precipitation and drought) that can be studied using tree ring records. It also does not consider other environmental factors (such as wildfires) that can be reconstructed from tree ring features. TREE RINGS 45 2004, Millar et al. in press). Su ch observations do not easily le nd themselves to experimental testing of causal mechanisms. It has been ar gued that treeline position is not highly sensitive to interdecadal temperature change (Paulsen et al. 2000), but rather reflects environmental variability over several hundr eds of years (Lloyd and Graumlich 1997, K\u00f6rner 1999). Local disturbances, site conditions, and regional climatic regimes also influence the degree of sensitivity and rate of response of treelines to temperature changes (Kj\u00e4llgren and Kullman 2002, Daniels and Veblen 2003). The biological connection between temperatur e and tree ring variations on hourly to annual timescales has been investigated in the field using specialized instruments called dendrometers (Biondi et al. 2005), together with wood anatomy obser vations (Deslauriers et al. 2003a). For European and North American conifers living in cold environments, ring formation mostly occurs from May to the beginning of August, and peaks around the time of maximum day length (Rossi et al. 2006 and references therein). By monitoring stem size of Pinus cembra and temperature during the growing season for two fu ll years in the Alps, it was found that radial expansion ceased whenever air temperature fe ll below 5\u00b0C (K\u00f6rner 1999). Night temperature was more important than day temp erature for controlling radial gr owth of balsam fir at about 50\u00b0N latitude (Deslauriers et al. 2003b). At long er timescales (monthly to decadal), a number of dendroclimatic studies have identified a positiv e, linear relationship between mean July temperature and ring-wi dth chronologies of Pinus sylvestris in northern Fennoscandia (Mikola 1962, Kalela-Brundin 1999, He lama et al. 2002). In terms of causal mechanisms, tree ring records are likely to be the result of multivariate, and often nonlinear, biophysical processes. Models based on ecological or physiological concepts have been proposed to account for su ch processes (Fritts et al. 1991, Hunt Jr. et al. 1991, Scuderi et al. 1993, Berninge r et al. 2004, Misson 2004). An intriguing hypothesis for the ability of treeline pine species to record slowly changing surface temperat ures involves the fact that needles formed in one growing seas on remain alive and functioning for 10-30 years (LaMarche 1974). The mechanistic bases for the statistical models used to extract climate signals from tree ring data have been summarized in simulation models focusing on the activity of the tissue that forms wood, the vascular cambium (Vaganov et al. 2006). Also note that linear relationships between tree ring r ecords and climate are at least e qual to, and often exceed, those found for other proxies (Jones et al. 1998). Sta tistical techniques more responsive to nonlinear interactions have so far provide d relatively small improvements for explaining climatic variance (Hughes 2002 and references therein). All proxy records of climate are obtained from samples that are not randomly selected (Cronin 1999). Part of the rese archer's ability consists of id entifying sites where proxy records are as long, continuous, and representa tive of the target climatic vari able as possible. Guidelines have been specified in the tree ring literatu re (Schweingruber 1988, Frit ts and Swetnam 1989) to ensure that sample (site, tree, and core) selecti on is based on a priori rather than a posteriori criteria. For instance, sites are selected in remote areas where tree density is low in order to minimize the impact of stand dynamics and inte rtree competition (Biondi et al. 1994). The influence of varying local condi tions on dendroclimatic records ha s been studied for elevation, slope, and exposure (Kienast and Schweingrube r 1986, Villalba et al. 1994, Buckley et al. 1997, Tardif et al. 2003, Piovesan et al . 2005), topographic convergence and potential relative radiation (Bunn et al. 2005), and flooding patt erns (Tardif and Bergeron 1997) . Sampled trees should not show signs of disturbance fact ors such as insect infestat ion, grazing, fire damage, human utilization, fungal infestation, or mistletoe attack (Schweingruber 1988, Fritts and Swetnam 46 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS 1989). Overall, as in any other field-based inve stigation of environmental change, defining the research question is the premise to a proper se lection of materials and methods (Br\u00e4ker 2002). FIELD AND LABORATORY METHODS To ensure reliable results, tree ring scien ce places great emphasis on replication (Wigley et al. 1984, Fritts and Swetnam 198 9). At least 10-20 trees per sp ecies are sampled at a site, mostly by taking increment cores, and each tree is cored following specific guidelines (Grissino- Mayer 2003). All collected samples are transp orted back to the laboratory, where they are compared to one another. The method of cro ssdating (or pattern matching) is used to assign calendar years to the individual rings (Baillie and Pilcher 1973 , Wigley et al. 1987, Yamaguchi 1991). Initially based on a visual comparison (Stokes and Smiley 1996), crossdating is quality controlled by means of numeri cal techniques once the ring widt hs are measured (Holmes 1983, Grissino-Mayer 1997). The precision and accuracy of crossdating have allowed the refinement of radiocarbon dating techniques (LaMarche and Harlan 1973, Friedr ich et al. 2004). Tree ring chronology development follows rule s that are common to all appli cations of tree ring science, and is completely independent of any climatic da ta. Samples or portions of samples that cannot be crossdated with the rest of the spec imens are not included in the final chronology. Recommendations to archive all co llected materials, so that they remain available for future study, have been published (Eckstei n et al. 1984). The Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research at the University of Arizona still has wood samples, fi eld notes, and measuremen ts that were taken a century ago by A.E. Douglass, the Tucs on astronomer who proposed many of the dendrochronological methods st ill in use today (Webb 1983). After crossdating, tree ring parame ters other than width (such as density, stable isotopic composition, cell size and wall thickness, resin duct density, and trace meta l concentrations) can be measured. Dendroclimatic studies of past su rface temperature are mostly based on ring width or maximum latewood density; the latter usually has a higher correlation with temperature, especially during the summer (Conkey 1986, Briffa et al. 2002). Maximum latewood density is also correlated with ring anatomy as measur ed by cell number, cell diameter, and cell wall thickness (Wang et al. 2002). Measurements made on crossdated wood samples from the same species and site are typically combined in to a master chronology (Fritts 1976, Cook and Kairiukstis 1990). This proce ss is aimed at increasing the climatic signal by reducing the importance of individual sample noise. In genera l, the number of specimens required to obtain a robust chronology increases as the common variance among specimens decreases (Fritts and Swetnam 1989). Although all crossdated samp les are entered into the final chronology, standardization removes any difference in mean gr owth rate between specimens, so that faster- growing trees do not dominate the record. Any crit eria used to form a chronology out of a subset of the crossdated specimens need to be clearly reported and justified. The identification of year-to-ye ar (high-frequency) climate si gnals in tree ring records is relatively straightforward since it is based on the elimination of tim e-series autocorrelation using autoregressive models (Biondi and Swetnam 19 87, Cook and Kairiukstis 1990). If adequately long instrumental records ar e available, it is even possible to e xplore the stationari ty of statistical relationships between climatic variables and tree ring parameters by considering multiple time intervals (Biondi and Waikul 2004). TREE RINGS 47 With regard to low-frequency temperature pa tterns, the length of the individual tree ring records used to produce a master chronology (rather than the length of th e chronology itself) can influence the reconstruction (Cook et al. 1995). It is also difficu lt to distinguish the amount of temporal autocorrelation in tree ring records that is linked to biologica l processes instead of climatic ones (Fritts 1976). One wa y to resolve these issues is to compute the expected value of the tree ring parameter (width, density, etc.) as a function of biological age (i.e., time since ring formation), and use the resulting growth curve to standardize the individual tree ring series. This method, which is now called Regional Curve Stan dardization (RCS), was first proposed in the 1930s (Grudd et al. 2002), later described by Fr itts (1976), and made popul ar by Briffa et al. (1992). In addition to its theore tical appeal, the RCS method is suitable for retrieving low- frequency signals in tree ring records (Esper et al. 2003a, Bunn et al. 2004), and widely employed in dendroclimatic reconstructions of surface temperature (Esper et al. 2002a, Gunnarson and Linderholm 2002, Naurzbaev et al. 2002). TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIONS To prevent the risk that a single tree ring chronology could reflect the influence of localized nonclimatic influences (Fritts 1976, Tro tter et al. 2002), dendroc limatic reconstructions often rely on networks of site chronologies. Regional tree ring networks typically have strong intersite correlations (e.g., Hughes et al. 1984, Fi gure 2), and continenta l-to-hemispheric-scale networks are able to reproduce synoptic-scale climatological pa tterns (Fritts 1991, Briffa et al. 2002). When based on a number of sites in the Northern Hemisphere, dendroclimatic reconstructions of surface temperat ures show that the 20th century warming is unusual since at least 1500 (D'Arrigo et al. 2006; Figures 4-1 an d 4-2), in agreement with independent reconstructions derived from written documents (Xoplaki et al. 2005), borehole temperatures (Pollack and Smerdon 2004), and glacier lengths (Oerlemans 2005). When records are sought for the last two millennia, the number of avai lable tree ring chronologies declines markedly (Hughes 2002), so confidence in rec onstructed patterns is reduced. All paleoclimatic reconstructions rely on the \"uniformity principle\" (Camardi 1999), which assumes that modern natu ral processes have acted simila rly in the past, and is also discussed as the \"stationarity\" assumption in Chapter 9. Although limiting factors controlled tree ring parameters in the past just as they do today, it is possible that the role of different factors at a single location or over an enti re region could change over time . This possibility has been raised to explain the \"divergence\" (i.e., re duced correlation) between temperature and ring parameters (width and maximum latewood dens ity) during the late 20th century (Jacoby and D'Arrigo 1995, Briffa et al. 1998). In Alaska, it appears that in creasing air temperature over the past decades is not reflected in increasing tree ring records be cause water (i.e., drought stress) has become the limiting factor (Barber et al . 2000, Lloyd and Fastie 2002, Wilmking and Juday 2005). In Siberia, on the other hand, reduced corr elation of tree ring chronologies with summer temperature has been attributed to increasing winter precipitation, which leads to delayed snowmelt in permafrost environments, thus shor tening the tree growing season (Vaganov et al. 1999). Other hypotheses have been formulated fo r the reduced correlatio n between temperature and tree ring chronologies, such as a negative effect on tree grow th due to greater ultraviolet radiation reaching the ground as a result of thinni ng stratospheric ozone (B riffa et al. 2004), or the possibility that surface instrumental temper atures are affected by an upward bias (Hoyt 48 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS 2006). Elevational treeline si tes in Mongolia (D'Arrigo et al . 2001) and the European Alps (B\u00fcntgen et al. 2005) are not affected by \"div ergence\". This geographic separation was confirmed by Cook et al. (2004), who subdivi ded long tree ring records for the Northern Hemisphere into latitudinal bands, and found not only that \"divergence\" is unique to areas north of 55\u00b0N, but also that the difference between northern and southern s ites found after about 1950 is unprecedented since at least A.D. 900. An especially suitable strategy to minimize c onfounding effects is to sample sites along ecological gradients, such as elevation or latitude (Fritts and Swetnam 1989, Bugmann 1996). For example, (Naurzbaev et al. 2004) selected sites along latitudinal (from 55 to 72\u00b0N) and elevational (from 1120 to 2350 m above sea level) transects, and used the parameters of the Regional Curve Standardization to infer climatic influences and past temperature variability. Other strategies are available to improve tree ri ng reconstructions of surface temperature. Some of these strategies involve us ing maximum temperature instead of mean temperature (Luckman and Wilson 2005), combining multiple tree ring para meters related to temperature (Helle and Schleser 2004), sampling species with opposing re sponses to temperatur e (Biondi et al. 1999), and applying mechanistic models to tree ring records (Anchuka itis et al. 2006).

(1984) for bristlecone pines ( Pinus longaeva ) in the White Mountains of Ca lifornia. In old age, thes e trees can assume a \"strip- bark\" form, characterized by a band of trunk that remains alive and continues to grow after the rest of the stem has died. Such trees are sensitive to higher atmospheric CO 2 concentrations (Graybill and Idso 1993), possibly because of gr eater water-use efficiency (Knapp et al. 2001, Bunn et al. 2003) or different carbon partitioni ng among tree parts (Tang et al. 1999). Support for a direct CO 2 influence on tree ring records extracted from \"full-bark\" trees is less conclusive. Increasing mean ring width was reported for Pinus cembra from the central Alps growing well below treeline (Nicolussi et al. 1995). Free-Air CO 2 Enrichment (FACE) data for conifer plantations in the Duke Forest (H amilton et al. 2002) and at the al pine treeline (H\u00e4ttenschwiler et al. 2002) also showed increased tree gr owth after exposure to atmospheric CO 2 concentrations about 50 percent greater than pres ent. On the other hand, no convi ncing evidence for such effect was found in conifer tree ring records from the Sierra Nevada in California (Graumlich 1991) or the Rocky Mountains in Colorado (Kienast a nd Luxmoore 1988). Further evidence comes from a recent review of data for mature trees in four climatic zones, which concluded that pine growth at treeline is limited by factors other than carbon (K\u00f6r ner 2003). While 'strip-bark' samples should be avoided for temperat ure reconstructions, attention should also be paid to the confounding effects of anthropogenic nitrogen de position (Vitousek et al. 1997), since the nutrient conditions of the soil determine wood growth response to increased atmospheric CO 2 (Kostiainen et al. 2004). However, in forest ar eas below treeline where modern nitrogen input could be expected to influence dendroclimatic re cords, such as Scotland (Hughes et al. 1984) and Maine (Conkey 1986), the relationship between temper ature and tree ring parameters was stable over time. In conclusion, tree ring science provides useful insights into past te mperature variability. Promising areas of current and future research can be summarized as: 1. updating site chronologies that we re collected 20-30 years ago, 2. increasing the number and geographic covera ge of temperature-sensitive tree ring chronologies longer than 1000 years, 3. quantifying the precision and accuracy of low-frequency temperature signals, 4. performing experimental studies on biophysic al relationships between temperature and tree ring parameters, 5. refining mechanistic models of temperature effects on tree ring parameters at multiple spatial and temporal scales. 51 5 Marine, Lake, a nd Cave Proxies Annual coral records indicate a warming a nd/or freshening of surface seawater over the last century at most tropical locations, as well as shifts toward warmer and/or fresher waters during the mid-1800s and between 1920 and 1940. North Atlantic sediment records from th e Labrador Sea, Bermuda Rise, and the coast of Africa show a medieval warming and cooling during the Little Ice Age. Corals and marine sediments provide in formation about surface temperature in otherwise undersampled ocean regions. Peat and lake muds, which contain microfossils of climate-sensitive organisms, and cave calcite deposits provide information on climate events impacting land areas. Although records from marine, lake, a nd cave proxies can be annually banded, many of the proxies discussed in this chapter have only intera nnual to decadal resolution and thus mainly contribute to describing the lo w-frequency variability of past climate. Many of the records discussed in this chap ter are more sensitive to variations in hydrologic factors than variations in surface temperature. Variations in precipitation often coincide with wider changes in climate, alt hough there is no consis tent global relationship between cold/wet and warm/dry conditions, or vi ce versa. The quantity used as a proxy for temperature in most coral studies to date is also influenced by change s in isotope ratios of seawater, although newer techni ques address this limitation. CORALS Massive corals that live near the sea surf ace produce annual density bands of aragonite (calcium carbonate) that can be sampled and us ed to reconstruct monthly climate records by examining their geochemical compositi on. In particular, the ratio of 18O to 16O (commonly referred to as 18O)9 in coralline aragonite decreases with increasing seawater temperature and with decreasing 18O in water at the time of formation. The 18O of water is often strongly correlated with salinity. Hence, 18O values from a coral that grew in an open ocean location 9 The 18O of a sample is defined as follows: 18O = ((R samp - R std)/R std) \u00d7 1,000 where R samp is the 18O/16O ratio in a sample and R std is the 18O/16O ratio in a reference standard. 52 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS can be used to reconstruct a combined signal of sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity for that oceanic region. Sites for coral sampling are selected on th e basis of proximity to open ocean and generally well-flushed locations. The largest co rals are usually found in leeward locations that are minimally influenced by storms and silt. The morphology of the coral head should show a rounded shape with minimal erosion at the base caused by boring organisms or physical damage. In most cases, more than one coral is sampled from each site to obtain the longest record. Ideally, coral-based reconstructions would be base d on multiple cores from the same site but, in practice, few sites have been studied in this detail (for an exception, see Hendy et al. 2002). More commonly, coral reconstructions are calibra ted closely with instrumental data, and high correlation coefficients lend confidence to the rec onstruction of past conditions (for reviews, see Gagan et al. 2000, Cole 2003). The primary limitation of using coral 18O for SST reconstruction is the ad ded variable of water 18O, which is important in areas of high rainfall, evaporation, or river input, such as the we stern Pacific warm pool. Recently, it has been discovered that this limitation can be overcome by simultaneously measuring the elemental ratio of strontium to calcium (denoted Sr/Ca) in co ral bands, because the Sr/C a ratio changes mainly as a function of SST. Sr/Ca ratios have been shown to track SST quantitatively with a high degree of precision (Beck et al. 1992), yielding an uncertainty in SST reconstructions of less than 0.3\u00b0C. There are several long-term reconstructi ons of SSTs available using coral Sr/Ca ratios including: Great Barrier Reef (Hendy et al. 2002), Rarotonga and Fiji (Linsley et al. 2004), Madagascar (Zinke et al. 2004), a nd Hawaii (Druffel et al. 2001). A few studies have also used uranium/calcium (U/Ca) ratios to re construct SSTs (e.g., Hendy et al. 2002). Results of Coral-Based Reconstructions Continuous coral 18O records for the last 100-400 years are available for regions in the tropical and subtropical Pacifi c, Indian, and Atlantic oceans (see summary papers: Cole 2003, Lough 2004, Gagan et al. 2000). Corals from most of these sites display an overall decrease in 18O values toward the 20th century, which indica tes surface seawater that is warmer, fresher (lower salinity), or both. Most of these records also show ab rupt shifts toward warmer/fresher waters during the mid-1800s and from 1920 to 1940, the latter of which agrees with instrumental records (Gagan et al. 2000). Superimposed on the recent oceanic warming, some locations show distinct patterns of decadal va riability, with repeated shifts of several tenths of a degree Centigrade. Figures 5-1 and 5-2 show examples of is otopic and elemental records derived from corals. Using Sr/Ca and U/Ca ra tios in eight coral cores from the Great Barrier Reef, Hendy et al. (2002) (Figure 5-1) revealed that above-average SSTs were present in the 18th and 19th centuries, with cooling in the early 20th centu ry and warming until the 1980s (more so for the U/Ca results). Other coral records from the southwestern Pacific (Figure 5-2) display interdecadal changes in the 18O and Sr/Ca values that reflect both SSTs and changes in the circulation near the South Paci fic Convergence Zone (Linsley et al. 2004). These authors conclude that the degree of cross-hemisphe ric symmetry of interdecadal oceanographic variability has varied over time , with a lower correlation betw een the North and South Pacific during the mid-18th century. MARINE, LAKE AND CAVE PROXIES 53 FIGURE 5-1 Sr/Ca, U/Ca, and 18O anomalies from Great Barrier Reef composites; the Sr/Ca and U/Ca anomalies have been used to reconstruct local SST records for five-year averages, with 95 percent statistical confidence intervals indicated by dotted lines.

The long-term trend has been removed from all data; thus, the warming during the 20th century cannot be seen. Also shown are inst rumentally based indices of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation et al. 2002a) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) (Mantua et al. 1997) indices, along with the North American tree-ring-based PDO index of D'Arrigo et al. (2001) and SST data from Rarotonga, Fiji, and New Caledonia from two different datasets (HADISST1 and Kaplan et al. [1998]). SOURCE: Linsley et al. (2004). In the eastern tropical Pacific, where El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events dominate the climatology, coral r ecords primarily reflect variability of SSTs, and there is no shift toward lower 18O (warmer SSTs) by 1954 (Dunbar et al. 19 94). Other isotopic and elemental records from corals in this region also demonstr ate incidences of these events (Shen et al. 1992, Guilderson and Schrag 1998, Druffel 1981). In the western Indian Ocean, coral 18O from the Seychelles (Charles et al. 1997) and Malindi, Kenya (Cole et al. 2000) demonstrate an SST MARINE, LAKE AND CAVE PROXIES 55 increase of 0.6\u00b0C from the mid-1800s to 1980; di scontinuous records from Madagascar indicate cool conditions from 1675 to 1760 and warm conditions from 1880 to 1900 and from 1973 to 1995 (Zinke et al. 2004). The impact and nature of ENSO cycles in this region appear to have changed during this most recent warm period. In the southeast Indian Ocean, the coral 18O record suggests a rise in SST by 0.6\u00b0C since 1944 and an additional half degree rise since 1795 (Kuhnert et al. 1999). Finally, 18O data from Bermuda corals i ndicate a slight shift toward higher SSTs, whereas data from other isotope ratios (13C/12C and 14C/12C) show that mixing in the upper ocean was variable during the 19th a nd 20th centuries (Nozak i et al. 1978; Druffel 1989, 1997). Coral records from Flor ida and the Caribbean Sea show 18O variations that reflect some combination of SST and hydrologic change s (Druffel 1981, Winter et al. 1998, Swart et al. 1996). Prospects for Improving and Extending Coral Records To obtain large-scale, multicentury reconstruc tions of SSTs based on Sr/Ca ratios, it is necessary to obtain long records of Sr/Ca ratios in corals for a mu ch larger number of locations than is currently available. Uranium-thorium measurements make it possible to obtain windows of shorter records within the last few millennia to shed light on tropical and subtropical ocean climate variability. Cobb et al (2003) reported a 18O record for portions of the last 1,100 years from fossil corals at Palmyra atoll in the mid-trop ical Pacific. As shown in Figure 5-3, they find relatively cool and dry climate conditions duri ng the 10th century to increasingly warmer and wetter climate in the 20th century. ENSO activit y was found to be most intense during the mid- 17th century than during other pe riods examined. Although not a problem with these data, the possibility of diagenetic altera tion of fossil segments must be considered in coral studies. Sclerosponges and Molluscs Sclerosponges inhabit shallow, tropical caves and secrete aragonite at very low growth rates (0.1-0.2 millimeters per year); relatively small specimens can be over 1,000 years old. Sr/Ca ratios measured in scleros ponge layers demonstrat e correlation with SS T (Rosenheim et al. 2004). Long-lived shells such as the clam Arctica islandica live in cold surface waters and put on annual growth bands. Although promising (Forsythe et al. 2003), mollusc 18O and geochemical records available so far are too shor t to be used for long-term reconstruction of SSTs. 56 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS FIGURE 5-3 Composite from Cobb et al.

MARINE SEDIMENTS The utility of marine sediments in recordi ng climate change during the Holocene depends either on sufficiently rapid sediment accumu lation to overcome the mixing effects of bioturbation10 (usually up to 8 centimeters) or de position under anoxic or suboxic oceanic conditions to retain annual layers. Both types of depositional environments have been exploited in attempts to infer oceanic and atmospheric co nditions affecting the record in the sediments. Several studies of marine sediments have provi ded insight into past climate on a regional basis. The Cariaco Basin off Venezuela is an anoxic basin with annual la yers reflecting changes in atmospheric conditions that accompany shifts in the location of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), in particular, the location and inte nsity of precipitation. Ha ug et al. (2003) have studied the titanium concentrati on changes in the Cariaco Basin a nnual sediment layers to infer the variations in the ITCZ, whic h impacted rainfall on the Yucatan Peninsula. The record is somewhat ambiguous in defining the Little Ice Ag e or a warm period during medieval times, but the authors believe it indicates se veral epochs of severe drought at the beginning of medieval times that caused the collap se of the Classic Mayan civi lization. Black et al. (1999) demonstrated that decadal-to-multicentury variations in wind-driven upwelling in the Cariaco Basin, and by inference the mean position of the ITCZ, were closely linked to North Atlantic 10 Bioturbation is the mixing of sediments by bottom-dwelling organisms (see, e.g., Turekian et al. 1978). MARINE, LAKE AND CAVE PROXIES 57 SSTs over the past eight centuries. Other reco rds from upwelling area s off Pakistan (e.g., von Rad et al. 1999) and zones of layered sedi ment deposited under anoxic conditions\u2014such as fjords along the coast of British Columbia, Canada \u2014also possess marine sediments with distinct seasonal layers that offer high-resolution histories of late Holocene climate. Records from rapidly accumulating sediment s in the Atlantic Ocean also provide information about temperature changes over th e last 2,000 years. The temperature proxies derived from benthic and planktic foraminifera in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean (Keigwin and Pickart 1999, Marchitto and de Menocal 2003), the Bermuda Rise (Keigwin 1996, Keigwin and Boyle 2000) and off the west coast of Africa (deM enocal et al. 2000), as well as from marine diatoms (silica-shelled algae; Ji ang et al. 2002), all reveal change s in surface ocean temperatures or surface ocean temperatures transmitted to depth by sinking water masses. To varying degrees, both the Little Ice Age and the warm period arou nd medieval times are re vealed by these records (Figures 5-4 and 5-5). It has been suggested that Holocene clim ate variations indicated by peaks in ice-rafted lithic grain abundan ces in several North Atlantic co res were paced by variations in solar irradiance (Bond et al . 1997, 2001) (Figure 5-6).

(2001). In addition, sedimentation rates are fast enough in some estuarine and coastal settings to allow climate reconstruction for the last 2,000 years. Cronin et al . (2003) used Mg/Ca paleothermometry on ells to show temperature shif ts of 2-4\u00b0C in the Chesapeake Bay, including cold excursions during the Little Ice Age and warmer pe riods during medieval times (about A.D. 800 to 1300). Because of estu arine pollution linked to land clearance from the mid-19th century, the most recent part of this record may reflect factors other than water temperature. MARINE, LAKE AND CAVE PROXIES 59 LAKE AND PEAT SEDIMENTS In many lakes, sediments contain distinct s easonal layers, or varves, that are either biogenic (e.g., carbonate, diatom si lica, and organic matter) or mi nerogenic (alternating coarse and fine-grained particles) in origin. Both sediment types potentially allow annual dating for sequences that span many millennia, although ty pically with chronological errors of a few percent (Zolitschka 2003). Lake water biology and chemistry are often sensitive to temperature, but they are also influenced by other factors such as precipitation, watershed land use, and atmospheric pollution. To obtain unambiguous clim ate signals from lake records, researchers often choose sites in remote locations, such as the High Arctic. The summer ice-free period in Arctic Canadian lakes is highly se nsitive to temperature, for exampl e, and this in turn has been recorded in the thickness and nature of s easonal varves (Lamoureux and Bradley 1996). Lakes in tropical and dryland regions are usually more sens itive to water balance than they are to temperature per se. Consequently, lake sediment records provide one of the key natural archives for reconstruc ting histories of drought and flood in regions such as the U.S. Midwest (Laird et al. 1998), as well as long-term changes in ENSO activity (Rodbell et al. 1999). Stable isotope analysis of a varved lake seque nce by Jones et al. (2006) showed increased (i.e., more positive) 18O values corresponding to the Little Ice Age along w ith decreased (i.e., more negative) 18O values before about 1400 (Figure 5-7). However, the primary control on this and similar lake records was not temperature per se but the intensity of drought\u2014linked in this case to the intensity of the summer monsoon over S outh Asia\u2014and precipitation, determined here by winter atmospheric circulation over the North Atlantic. Alth ough the East Mediterranean was relatively dry during the Little Ice Age, low la ke levels in East Africa and North America indicate that droughts in these re gions were more extreme in medieval times than during the 20th century, possibly linked to changes in solar acti vity (Hodell et al. 2001, Verschuren et al.

SOURCE: Jones et al. (2006). 60 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS Biological Remains Fossil remains from terrestrial sediments also offer indications of past surface temperatures. Nonbiting midge larvae (chironomids) and some species of beetles are highly sensitive to temperature, and th e hard parts of both organisms ar e preserved in lake and peat sediments. However, the main application of th ese records to date has been on timescales longer than the last 2,000 years. In peat bogs, testat e-forming amoebae species are sensitive to water table depths, which in turn are generally controll ed by both rainfall and temperature. Charman et al. (in press) have used reconstructed water ta ble changes to build up de cadal-resolution climate histories for the last 4,000 years in northern Britain. Pollen analys is is a key technique for longer term climatic and vegetation history, but does not provide climatic data of sufficient time precision or reliability to assist directly in te mperature reconstruction for the last two millennia, partly because the vegetation that produces polle n lags in its response to climatic forcing. The calibration approach used fo r all of these organisms is based on modern training sets rather than matching them against past temper ature changes in the in strumental record. A minimum of about 30 sites are analyzed along a clim atic gradient for their contemporary species mix (e.g., diatoms in surface muds) and for a range of environmental measurements (pH, salinity, water, air temperature, etc). These modern training sets are then used to calibrate past species assemblages preserved in sediment core s using regression-based multivariate statistical techniques (Birks 1998). Using this approach, freshwater diatom s from Alpine lakes were found to track lake-water pH, which in turn has follo wed 20th century temperatures (Koining et al. 1998). SPELEOTHEMS Speleothems are cave deposits such as stalagmite s. They record changes in the external climate via a range of different proxies, incl uding luminescence intensity, growth rate, and elemental and isotope chemistry (McDermott et al. 1999, Lauritzen 2003). Speleothem calcium carbonate registers the changing isotopic co mposition of cave groundwater along with cave temperature. Calcium carbonate deposits grow ra dially as well as upward in a stalagmite, and records of annual isotopic changes such as 18O can be evaluated chronologically by accurate dating techniques (e.g., uranium-thorium ratio) and then converted to a climate signal. Such records represent a combined signal of temperature and pr ecipitation\u2014along w ith source area changes\u2014but each of these signals may be dominan t in different settings. In tropical and dryland regions, rainfall amount is us ually the main determinant of the 18O content of cave carbonates (Bar-Matthews et al. 2003). Thus, oxyge n isotope records obtained from caves in southern China (Wang et al. 2005a) (Figure 5-8) and Oman (Fleitmann et al. 2003) suggest that strong climatological changes have occurred in Asian monsoon in tensity over the last several thousand years. Episodic submillennial varia tions within these Holocene records generally match the North Atlantic ice-rafted debris pa ttern of Bond et al. (2001). The correlation of speleothem records from cave sites associated with the Asian monsoons to a marine record of ice advance and retreat in the North Atlantic pr ovides a suggestion of he misphere-wide century- scale climate changes resulting in different local manifestations. MARINE, LAKE AND CAVE PROXIES 61 FIGURE 5-8 18O over the Holocene derived from a cave in eastern Asia. The yellow numbered bands correspond to times of ice rafted debris in the Nort h Atlantic shown in Figure 5-6 (Bond et al. 2001). SOURCE: Wang et al (2005a). In some cool and wet regions, the cave temperature signal may be dominant in controlling the 18O and other measurements, and this is especially valuable because cave temperature is stable throughout the year and represents the m ean annual temperature of the outside environment. Modern speleothem proper ties have been used to calibrate cave sequences from northern Scandinavia in terms of Holo cene temperature variability (Lauritzen and Lundberg 1999). In addition, some speleothems cont ain annual bands much like lake varves or tree growth rings, and these have allowed very high resolution measurements of cave isotopic changes during the last 2,000 year s. Proctor et al. (2000, 2002) used one such record from northern Scotland to reconstruct annual-to-decadal climatic changes in the North Atlantic during the last three millennia. SUMMARY A key advantage of the records described in th is chapter is the ability to carry out many different types of laboratory analyses on the sa me profiles. These multiple proxies\u2014physical, biological, or chemical\u2014can have different and independent bases fo r climatic calibration; they include the use of modern training sets, sediment trap studies, and historic calibration. Some, but not all, marine, lake, peat, and cave records have annual time resolution. Those that do not have annual dating may nonetheless be ab le to capture low-frequency c limate fluctuations (Moberg et al. 2005). A major challenge in these cases is to ensure that records ar e accurately dated and correlated because, if they are not, composite records will tend to smooth out the true temperature variability. 62 6 Ice Isotopes Analyses of stable isotopes in glacial i ce provide records of climate changes at high resolution over long time periods. In the low latitudes, this signal is a combination of temperature and hydrologic variables. In the pola r ice sheets, the signal is primarily driven by temperature. Isotope records from Tibet and the Andes s how that the climate of the 20th century was unusual with respect to the preceding 2,000 year s. Current understanding does not allow us to separate the temperature part of this signal rigorously, but all evidence indicates Tibet warmed over the last century. Andean climate changes ha ve patterns over space and time that are not yet understood. Greenland had a pronounced period of warmth around A.D. 1000, a cool period from 1600 through 1900, and a modest 20th century wa rming. Some coastal sites in Antarctica show 20th century warming but interior sites do not. No Antarctic sites show a warming during medieval times. Measurements of oxygen and hydrogen isotopic ra tios in ice cores, or ice isotopic ratios, are an important temperature proxy, providing high-resolution c ontinuous records of climatic temperature change at locations with persis tent snow accumulation and low temperatures.11 The isotopic record provides information about clim ate because atmospheric moisture transported onto cold glaciers is distilled by the precipitation pr ocess as the air mass cools. This distillation combines with the temperature dependence of isotopic separations during snow formation to generate an ice isotopic ratio signal. Both of th ese factors increase in strength as temperature is reduced and, consequently, the correlation of th e ice isotopic ratio with temperature is very strong in the cold interiors of the polar ice sheets. Ice isotopi c ratio records are geographically limited to locations of significan t ice thickness, namely, polar re gions and high-altitude mountain ranges elsewhere. It is remarkably fortuitous that the high Andes, th e Tibetan and Himalayan ranges, and the great volcanoes of eastern equato rial Africa offer any ice records at all for Earth's low latitudes. 11 In this context, ice isotopic ratio refers to the oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopic composition of water molecules composing the ice itself. ICE ISOTOPES 63 PHYSICAL BASIS FOR DERIVING CLIMATE SIGNALS FROM ICE ISOTOPIC RATIO RECORDS The temperature dependence of the ice isotopi c ratio arises from f undamental physics at the molecular scale combined with geophysical processes at the plan etary scale (Dansgaard 1964, Kavanaugh and Cuffey 2003). However, additional influences on ice isotopic ratio can be significant (Dansgaard 1964, Pierrehumbert 1999, Alley and Cuffey 2001, Kavanaugh and Cuffey 2003, Jouzel et al. 1997), and, consequentl y, ice isotopic ratio measurements must be calibrated against independent temp erature information in order to be used as a quantitatively accurate thermometer (Cuffey et al. 1995). Su ch calibrations have been applied for long- timescale records from the polar ice sheets, but no t for low-latitude, high-altitude ice cores (from the Andes, Kilimanjaro, and Tibet), where it is more difficult to isolate and quantify the temperature component of the signal. In general, the ice isotopic ratio records from the interior regions of polar ice sheets yield good temper ature reconstructions (Alley and Cuffey 2001, Cuffey et al. 1995). The low-latitude ice isotopic ratios yield a climate signal that depends on a variety of hydrologic and thermal influences in the broad geographi c region that supplies moisture to the high glaciated mountains (Pie rrehumbert 1999, Tian et al. 2003, Vuille et al. 2003a, Hoffmann et al. 2003, Thompson and Davis 2005, Alley and Cuffey 2001, Jouzel et al. 1997). The connection of ice is otopic ratio to temperatur e becomes stronger at lower temperatures (e.g., Kavanaugh and Cu ffey 2003, Jouzel et al. 1997). All glacial sites in the low la titudes are cold enough that th is temperature influence will have some reflection in the ice isotopic ratio (Pierrehumbert 1999, Tian et al. 2003). Ambiguity results from significant residual influences of warmer regions upwind, and local processes related to snowfall timing and pr eservation (Hardy et al. 2003). Precipitation amount is the effect of greatest importance (Dansgaard 1964). Near sea level at lo w latitudes the isotopic ratios in precipitation are demonstrably not refl ective of temperature changes at ground level. The water distillation process here primarily happe ns in the vertical dimension in large storm clouds, resulting in a correlati on between precipitation amount a nd isotopes at ground level, rather than a correlation between temperature and isotopes. The high-altitude low-latitude ice core sites are in a transition zone where both temperature and this precipitation effect have influence (Pierrehumbert 1999). In Tibet, ice isotopic ratios in the south appear to be dominantly influenced by monsoonal precipitation, whereas in the nort h, temperature dominates (Yao et al. 1996, Tian et al. 2003). In the equatorial Andes, ice isot opic ratios retain a strong infl uence of precipitation over the Amazon lowlands, and partly correlate with both Pacific sea surface temperatures and Amazonian temperatures (Henderson et al. 1999 , Hardy et al. 2003, Vuille et al. 2003a). The local warming observed at the Quelccaya ice cap (Thompson et al. 2000 a, Mark and Seltzer 2005) does correlate with the ice is otopic ratio there. In both Ti bet and the Andes, there is no clear relationship between ice isotopic ratio and local accumulation on the ice caps. Thus, the ice isotopic ratios in these locations are not heavil y influenced by local precipitation, but hydrologic influences retained from the lowland regions upwind may still be very important. Controls on ice isotopic ratio in equato rial Africa are not known. 64 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS CALIBRATION AND RESOLUTION The correlation of the ice isot opic ratio with temperature is very strong in the cold interiors of the polar ice sheets. Calibration is nonetheless ne cessary because factors like the seasonal timing of precipitation, th e warm-weather bias of storms, and the atmospheric mixing of air masses may change with time. Calibration of the ice isotopic ratio thermometer is achieved over a range of timescales (Alley and Cuffey 2001, and references therein) by using weather station and satellite records for annual cycles, by using gas isotopic ratios for decadal-scale rapid climate changes, and by using borehole temperatures for centennial-to-millennial scale climate changes. Such studies have shown polar ice isot opic ratios to be reliable thermometers. Before calibration, temperature changes inferred from ice is otopic ratio changes are accurate to within a multiple of approximately two. Temperatures re corded by ice isotopic ratio in the polar ice sheets are representative of a broa d region in the ice shee t interior, and also in clude an imprint of temperature at much larger scales. The time-resolution of ice isotopic ratio temp erature reconstructions varies from place to place. Many sites from Greenland, the Canadian Arctic, and the tropics have nearly annual resolution, whereas sites from th e very dry interior of East Antarctica have only decadal resolution. Diffusional smoothing reduces the resolu tion from annual to a few years or more in most places, and this reduction of resolution incr eases backward in time. The time span covered by ice isotopic ratio records is greatest where snowfall rates are small and glacier thickness greatest. These vary from several hundred t housand years in central East Antarctica to 100,000 years in central Greenland to 10,000 years in the high-altitude tropics a nd coastal Antarctica and Greenland. Most glaciers in the mid-latitude mount ains cannot provide long records of this sort because the ice mass is too rapidly removed by flow. RESULTS FROM ICE ISOT OPIC RATIO RECORDS The four available ice cores from Tibet (Fig ures 6-1 and 6-2) toge ther show that 20th century climate is anomalous relative to the preceding 1,900 years for this region (Thompson et al. 1989, 1997, 2000a, 2003, in press). 12 The anomaly is some combination of apparent warm conditions and weak monsoon precipita tion. That a warming is part of this signal is clear, given that the anomaly is seen in the northern Ti betan records, and that the monsoon-dominated southern records correlate with instrumental trends in the region (Thompson et al. 2000a; the Dasuopu core). A quantitative assessment of temp erature change from the north Tibetan cores, using typical isotopic sensitivity, is prelimin ary, but both suggest warming over the last 150 years of at least 1\u00b0C.13 The ice isotopic ratio records available from three sites in the high Andes (Figures 6-1 and 6-2) together suggest warm conditions and weak Amazonian precipitation over the last two centuries, relatively cold and wet from 1400 to 1800, and relatively warm and dry before then (Thompson et al. 1986, 1995, 1998, 2000b, 2003, in press). The current warm/dry period is a 20th century phenomenon at Quelccaya, but cl early began around 1750 at Huascaran (to the north), and is absent from Sajama (to the south). This latitudinal gradient is interesting but not 12 Evidence is from Dunde, Guliya, Dasuopu, and Puruogangri cores. 13 This also matches trends in instrumental records on the Tibetan Plateau (Liu and Chen 2000). ICE ISOTOPES 65 yet understood. Ice isotopic ratios from Kilimanjaro reveal no consistent trend over the last two millennia (Thompson et al. 2002). The combined isotopic signal from all availa ble ice cores in Tibe t and the Andes show that the climate of the 20th century was unusual with respect to the preceding 1900 years (Figure 6-3). FIGURE 6-1 Isotopic records from high-altitude ice cores from the equatorial Andes (left) and the Tibetan Plateau (right). Higher isotopic values genera lly indicate warmer conditi ons, but the records from the Andes may be dominated by hydrologic fact ors such as precipitation in Amazonia. SOURCE: Thompson et al. (2003). In Greenland (Figure 6-2) and coastal Antarcti ca, ice isotopic ratio records clearly show 20th century warming, a Litt le Ice Age, and earlier warmth. In Greenland, this earlier warmth is centered at about A.D. 1000, wher eas in Antarctica it was much earlier. Borehole temperature analyses yield the same pattern (see Chapter 8). In Greenland, the 20th century warmth is not higher than that during medieval times (11th century ). In the Canadian Ar ctic, ice isotopic ratio records from the Agassiz Ice Cap on Ellesmere Island show warming over the last 150 years which is unprecedented for the last millennium (Fisher and Koerner 1995). As a group, the ice cores from interior Antarctica (Figure 6-2) show nothing anomalous about the 20th century (Masson et al. 2000).66 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS CENTRAL GREENLAND CALIBRATED TEMPERATURE -35-34-33-32-31-30-29 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000Temperature (deg C) -35-34-33-32-31-30-29 TIBETAN ICE CORES COMPOSITE -2.5-2.0-1.5-1.0-0.50.00.51.01.52.02.5 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000Isotopic enrichment -2.5-2.0-1.5-1.0-0.50.00.51.01.52.02.5 ANDEAN ICE CORES COMPOSITE -2.5-2.0-1.5-1.0-0.50.00.51.01.52.02.5 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000Isotopic enrichment -2.5-2.0-1.5-1.0-0.50.00.51.01.52.02.5 TAYLOR DOME, ANTARCTICA -2.5-2.0-1.5-1.0-0.50.00.51.01.52.02.5 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000 YearIsotopic enrichment -2.5-2.0-1.5-1.0-0.50.00.51.01.52.02.5 FIGURE 6-2 Two composite isotopic records from low latitudes, and two isotopic records from single locations on the polar ice sheets.

These records show global warming of approximately 0.6\u00b0C fr om 1850 to 1990 and cooler conditions for the prior few centuries. The majority of glaciers in high mountain ranges outside the polar regions have retreated during the last 150 years, primarily as a consequence of warming. Other evidence from glaciers suggests that the recent warmth is unprecedented on millennial timescales, including melt and retreat of Andean glaciers, and disintegration of Antarctic ice shelves. Glacier length is also influenced by changes in precipitation, but snowfall on mountain glaciers is currently incr easing on average, so the retreat pattern is not due to climatic drying. Glacier lengths provide temperature info rmation that is independent of other temperature reconstruction methods, in cluding the instrumental record. Glacier length records need to be updated to extend temperature reconstructions from 1990 to the present. Outside of the very cold polar regions, the majority of glaciers in mountain ranges worldwide retreated substantially during th e 20th century (Oerlemans 1994, 2005; Dyurgerov and 1999; Francou yurgerov 2003; Khromova et al. 2003; Thompson et al. in press). The reduction in ice cover is pronounced in ne arly every major high glaciated mountain range examined, including the Alaska Range and Alaska's Southeastern Ranges, the Canadian Rockies, the Washington Cascades, the equatorial and Pa tagonian Andes, the European Alps, the New Zealand Alps, the Tien-Shan, and the Himalaya. In the mid and high latitudes, this glacier retreat was caused primarily by widespread clima tic warming, which increased ice loss by melt (Oerlemans 2001, 2005; Dyurgerov and and Fortuin 1992). In the tropics, glacier retrea t was apparently caused by both temperature changes and moisture changes, depending on the time and region (Kaser 1999, Francou et al. 2000, M\u00f6lg et al. 2003, Vuille et al. 2003b, Kaser et al. 2004, Mark and Seltzer 2005). Warming is the dominant factor in the tropical Andes (Thompson et al. 2000b, Vuille et al. 2003b, Mark and Seltzer 2005), whereas moisture change has an influence in equatorial Africa (M\u00f6lg et al. 2003, Kaser et al. 2004). On average, snowfall rates increased modestly on these glaciers during the latter half of the 20th century (Dyurgerov and Meier 2000), providing strong evidence against drying as a caus e of retreat for this time period. GLACIER LENGTH AND MASS BALANCE RECORDS 69 RECONSTRUCTING TEMPERA TURE RECORDS FROM GLACIER RECORDS Records of glacier length changes during the 20 th century and earlier have been analyzed to reconstruct past temperature changes (Oer lemans 1994, 2005; Oerlemans et al. 1998). These analyses are based on glacier physics (Pater son 1994, Van der Veen 1999, Oerlemans 2001) and provide temperature information that is inde pendent of other temp erature reconstruction methods. In particular, the temperature reconstr uction from glacier retr eat is not calibrated against the instrumental record. Instead, it is based on glacier dynamics m odels that are highly generalized, but that are calibrated against a sma ll number of extensively studied glacier systems (Oerlemans et al. 1998, Oerlemans 2001) for wh ich realistic glacier dynamics and energy balance modeling has been completed. Glacier-l ength-based temperature reconstructions are further significant because the influence of urba n heat islands and land use changes are likely to be small. Oerlemans (2005) showed that temperatures increased by about 0.6\u00b0C from the late 19th to the mid 20th century, and were pe rsistently cool in the three centuries before this (Figure 7-1). Results also show a small cooling from 1950 to 1980, followed by renewed warming until the record ends in 1990. Data on recent and ongoing retreats have not yet been extensively compiled. It is known, however, that mass loss fro m mountain glaciers incr eased strongly in the 1990s due primarily to accelerated warming (D yurgerov 2003, Meier et al. 2003, Dyurgerov and Meier 2005). During their period of overlap (1850-1990) th e glacier length reconstruction and the instrumental record are very similar in magn itude and pattern (Oerlemans 2005). The glacier length record thus validates th e quantitative accuracy of the instrumental composite for this period, as a large-scale average. Reconstructed te mperatures from the glacier length record are similar for low- and high-altitude glaciers (Oer lemans 2005). The dominant pattern of cool climate for a few centuries followed by warming begi nning in the late 19th century is seen in all geographic regions examined, though signifi cant differences in details exist. MORE DETAILED BACKGROUND ON GLACIER-LENGTH-BASED RECONSTRUCTIONS The most recent and comprehensive temperat ure reconstruction (Oerlemans 2005) uses glacier length records for a large number of gl aciers (Oerlemans et al. 1998, Oerlemans 2001). The information needed for detailed individual modeling for most of th ese glaciers does not exist, so the analysis instead uses an approximate and generalized approach. Both the sensitivity of glacier length to temperature and the lag time for the glacier response are parameterized in terms of the dominant physical controls or correlates, which are t opographic slope, annual precipitation, and glacier length itself. The connection of these para meterizations to the underlying physics is supported in the technical literature, including detailed analyses of specific glaciers (Oerlemans et al. 1998, Oerlemans 2001). However, these parameterizations are only expected to be accurate as an aver age for a large number of glaciers. 70 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS FIGURE 7-1 (A) Glacier-length-based temperature reconstruction for various regions. The black curve shows an estimated global mean value, obtained by gi ving weights of 0.5 to the Southern Hemisphere, 0.1 to Northwest America, 0.15 to the Atlantic sector, 0.1 to the Alps, and 0.15 to Asia.

The band indicates the estimated standard deviation. SOURCE: Oerlemans (2005). GLACIER LENGTH AND MASS BALANCE RECORDS 71 The sensitivity of glacier le ngth to temperature arises fr om a fundamental aspect of glacial systems (Paterson 1994, Van der Veen 1999, Oerlemans 2001)14: A glacier forming at high altitude will advance downward, extending its fr ont into a region of net melt until all ice mass flux supplied from the high -altitude regions is removed by melt in the lower region. Glaciers will always te nd toward such a balance between mass inputs to the system and mass outflow, and this balance will be achieved w ith the glacier straddling the boundary between regions of net melt and net snowfall. Any climat e change will affect th is delicate balance and cause some adjustment of the glacier system. The dominant climatic influences are te mperature and snowfall rate, though other variables such as cloud cover can be important in some situations . A temperature increase in the overlying atmosphere increases the energy input to a melting glacier surface, through increased downward longwave radiation and increased sensible heat transfer. This increases the rate of melt. Temperature increase also causes more of the precipitation to reach the glacier surface as rain instead of snowfall. Snowfall is the suppl y of new ice mass that sustains the glacier. Reduction or increase of the snowfall rate will ca use the glacier to shri nk or grow, respectively. Considering individual glaciers, snowfall ch anges do cause advance and retreat, and this effect dominates in some situa tions (e.g., western Norway before the late 1990s). Temperature is a more powerful influence on average, however, because the melt process only acts over a small fraction of the annual cycle and uses a small fract ion of the total energy fl ux, so its capacity to change is large. A typical quantitative estimate for the leverage of temperature versus snowfall on mountain glaciers is that a 1\u00b0C temperature increase is equivale nt to a 25 percent reduction of snowfall (Oerlemans and Fortuin 1992, Oerl emans et al. 1998, Oerlemans 2001). As a consequence, glaciers on Earth exist in preci pitation regimes extending from the very wet temperate and tropical highlands down to the driest polar deserts, but are completely absent from environments spanning a large range of me dium to high mean annual temperatures. In principle, it would be possible for the gl obal population of glaci ers to have shrunken over the past century due to a global-scale pr ecipitation reduction. However, there is no evidence of such a global drying (Folland et al. 2001a), which would require an unprecedented spatial coherence. Furthermore, focused studies of individual glaciers de monstrate the dominant role of temperature change in 20th century retr eats (Oerlemans et al. 1998, Oerlemans 2001), and mass balance studies for the later 20th century show that, on average, for studied glaciers, snowfall has been increasing (Dyurgerov and Meier 2000, Dyurgerov 2003). Hence, it is reasonable to assume that precipitation changes i nduce variability (or noise) in the glacier length record but do not control its global mean patt ern. Regional patterns, on the other hand, are in some cases dominated by precipitation or other vari ables. For example, in the late 20th century, increased snowfall caused glaciers in western Scandinavia to advance (Dyurgerov and Meier 1997a,b, 2000), whereas combinations of precipita tion and temperature changes have induced retreat of the glaciers in equato rial Africa (M\u00f6lg et al. 2003, Kase r et al. 2004, Hastenrath 2005). Although warming in recent decades is an importa nt factor driving glacier recession on Mt. Kenya and the Ruwenzori summits, the much high er altitude glaciers on Kilimanjaro may be shrinking primarily as a continuing response to pr ecipitation changes earlie r in the century. The magnitude and importance of recent wa rming are still being researched. 14 Here we are discussing only glacier s that terminate on land and are in warm enough environments to lose mass primarily by melt rather than iceberg production or sublimation. 72 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS Temperature reconstructions based on glacier length and mass balance records are limited in their temporal and spatial re solution. They do not provide a y ear-to-year view of temperature change, but only averages over several years to decades (depending on resolution of the length measurements and on the accuracy of assumptions in the physics). They do not provide any information about most of the globe prior to the 19th century. Only the North Atlantic and European Alpine regions have glacier records back to around A.D. 1600, and there is only little information prior to then even in this region. The time require d for data collection, compilation, and reporting has so far prevented the most recen t 15 years from being included in the analysis. In North America, many of the glacier record s end between the mid-1970s and 1990 (Oerlemans 2005b), so for this region the late 20th century reconstruction is not yet reliable. Geographic limits arise from the obvious fact that glacier s do not exist everywhere, so the low and mid elevations of the low latitudes are entirely abse nt. There is also a pa ucity of data for the Southern Hemisphere. Finally, these reconstruc tions cannot be done for mountain glaciers in Antarctica, because it is so cold there that me lt is not the dominant mass loss process (it is iceberg production), and so, the conn ection to temperature is different. OTHER INFORMATION AVAILABLE FROM GLACIERS Though not suitable for reconstructing temper ature time series, other glacier indicators\u2014 such as melting of ice caps, organic material unc overed when glaciers melt, and disintegration of ice shelves\u2014provide temperature information. An increase of su mmertime warmth over the last 150 years caused increased melt on the Ellesmere Isla nd's major ice cap in the Canadian Arctic. This extent of melt had not occurred in th e previous 1500 years (Fisher and Koerner 1995). The recent retreat of glaciers has exposed organic material that would have decomposed if not covered by ice, including a human body (the now famous \"Ice Man\" of the Alps) and plant material (Thompson et al. in pres s). Three of these finds have been dated (from the Alps, from Washington State, and from Peru) and all have ages greater than 5,000 years before present. This suggests rather strongly that the current deglaciation is unprecedented in the last few millennia at these widespread sites. Nonetheles s, it is known from dating of organic material transported to the fronts of glaci ers in the Alps that glacier recessions more extensive than the present one have occured at some sites in Eur ope (Hormes et al. 2001), with dates ranging from A.D. 800 to 8000 B.C. Such recession thus has occu rred due to past natural variability, but this has been rare in the most recent few millennia. In the Andes, at the same glacier wher e the dated plant material was exposed (Quelccaya), melting in the 1980s was strong eno ugh to destroy the geochemical signature of annual layers in the ice beneath (Alley 2006, Thomps on et al. 2003, in press). An ice core taken from here in the late 1970s showed that such melt had not happened in the previous millennium, at least. This strongly suggests anomalous warm th in the late 20th centu ry. The Quelccaya ice cap has existed without interruption for more than 1,000 years. If its present rate of shrinkage continues, it will disappear entirely within a few decades. Over the last few decades, the floating i ce shelves along the Antarctic Peninsula have been disintegrating, following a progressively southward pattern (V aughan and Doake 1996, Cook et al. 2005). This is primarily a result of higher temperatures i nducing surface melt (van den Broeke 2005). Analysis of sediment cores from the seafloor (Domack et al. 2005) beneath one of the largest former shelves (the Larsen B, which disintegrated in the late 1990s) suggests GLACIER LENGTH AND MASS BALANCE RECORDS 73 strongly that this ice shelf had persisted thr oughout the previous 10,000 y ears, providing further evidence that recent decades have been anomalously warm. 74 8 Boreholes Measurements of temperature beneath the ground surface show widespread warming during the most recent century and cool er conditions for the four prior centuries. The magnitude of warming from 1850 to 1990 is estimated to have been approximately 0.7\u00b0C \u00b10.2\u00b0C, consistent with the instrumental record. Temperatures inferred from borehole da ta are not calibrated against the instrumental temperature record, thereby provi ding an independent measurement of past temperature. For the period 1600-1900, borehole-based te mperature reconstructions have century-scale resolution and thus provide information about long- term temperature trends, but not about decadal or annual variations. When the temperature at th e ground surface changes, the temperature of the underlying substrate (soil, rock, or ice) will also change in response, as heat diffuses and advects vertically. For example, a sustained increase of ground surf ace temperature will cause a wave of warming to propagate downward. The verti cal distribution of temperature be low the surface thus contains information about past temperatures at th e surface (Lachenbruch and Marshall 1986, Paterson 1994). Temperature-depth profiles of this sort are measured in boreholes, and analyses of these data can be used to generate reconstructions of near-surface air temperature (Lachenbruch and Marshall 1986, Huang et al. 2000, Pollack and Huang 2000, Harris and Chapman 2001, Pollack and Smerdon 2004, Majorowicz et al. 2006), provided that the ground surface temperature and the climatic temperature at the bo rehole site are closely connected. BOREHOLES IN ROCK AND PERMAFROST Analyses of a large number of continental boreholes have yielded temperature reconstructions for the last 500 years (Lach enbruch and Marshall 1986, Pollack and Huang 2000, Harris and Chapman 2001, Majorowicz et al. 2006). These reconstructions have particular value because they do not have to be calibrated ag ainst the instrumental record and because temperature itself is being measured, not a pr oxy for temperature. Important quantitative uncertainties exist, but general trends in these reconstructions are likely robust. Borehole-based temperature reconstructions averaged for broad regions (including eastern North America, western North America, Europe, Australia, and South Africa) show warming from the 19th century to the present, and persistently cool conditions for the preceding BOREHOLES 75 few centuries (Gosnold et al. 1997, Pollack and Hu ang 2000 and references therein, Huang et al. 2000, Harris and Chapman 2001, Pollack and Sm erdon 2004, Majorowicz et al. 2006). Temperature changes for earlier times are not reso lvable. Estimates of the magnitude of recent warming as a global (continental) average, or an average over the mid latitudes, are approximately 0.7-0.9\u00b0C, from the mid 19th century to the late 20th cen tury (Huang et al. 2000, Pollack and Huang 2000, Harris and Chapman 2001) , which is similar to the temperature increase estimated from the instrumental record discussed in Chapter 2 (F igures 8-1 and 8-2). Some borehole-based reconstructions also infer an earlier persis tent smaller warming of roughly 0.3\u00b0C from 1500 to 1850 (Pollack and Huang 2000, Hu ang et al. 2000) (Figure 8-1). Regional estimates for the warming of the last 150 y ears range from 2-4\u00b0C for northern Alaska (Lachenbruch and Marshall 1986, Pollack and Hua ng 2000), to 0.5\u00b0C for Australia (Pollack and Huang 2000). Estimates for the western and ea stern sectors of North America are rather different, 0.4-0.6\u00b0C and 1.0-1.3\u00b0C, respec tively (Pollack and Huang 2000).

In each bar plot, the five colu mns from left to right represent, respectively, the magnitude of temperature increase in the 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries.

The reconstructions for South America and Asia are lightly shaded to indicate the larger un certainties in these two con tinents because of the low spatial density of observations.

For each curve in the upper panel, the temperature reconstruction is used as the surface temperature for a thermal model to predict the temperature at depth. The top panel shows the six reconstructions, with zero defined as the 1961-1990 mean . The reconstruction shown in black (labeled POM-SAT) uses the borehole temperatures to constr ain the Pre-Observational Mean (POM) and uses the instrumental temperature record from 1856 onward. The measured subsurface temperature pattern (bottom panel, black circles) is explained almost pe rfectly by the instrumental record and preceding cool centuries (black curve in the top pane l). SOURCE: Harris and Chapman (2001). LIMITS ON BOREHOLE-BASED RECONSTRUCTIONS The time resolution and length of borehole-ba sed surface temperature reconstructions are severely limited by the physics of the heat tr ansfer process (Clow 1992). A surface temperature signal is irrecoverably smeared as it is tran sferred to depth. The time resolution of the reconstruction thus decreases backward in time. For rock and permafrost boreholes, this resolution is a few decades at th e start of the 20th century, and a few centuries at 1500. Borehole temperatures thus only reveal l ong-term temperature averages and trends prior to the period of instrumental record; they tell us nothing about deca dal variations or specific years, except for the most recent ones. For rock and permafrost bor eholes, the thermal smearing is strong enough to prevent recovery of clear temper ature signals prior to about 15 00. The spatial distribution of borehole temperature records is also strongly weighted toward North America, Europe, South Africa, East Asia, and Australia (Pollack a nd Smerdon 2004), with almost no information from BOREHOLES 77 South America and North or Central Africa, and spotty coverage in Asia. Furthermore, the usable boreholes are mostly a le gacy of mining exploration, so th e spatial coverage has not been chosen to optimize climate reconstruction. Important quantitative uncertainties in boreh ole-based reconstructi ons could arise from two separate sources. First, borehole temper atures respond to the ground surface temperature and not the temperature in the overlying air (Gos nold et al. 1997, Smerdon et al. 2004, Pollack et al. 2005). It is possible that these two temperatur es will vary differently over time, for example, due to changes in snow cover and soil moistu re. Thus, a key questi on is whether long-term trends in air and ground temperature are similar. Although there are clear exceptions (Gosnold et al. 1997), the majority of evidence indicates that this similarity is generally strong: As a large- scale geographic average, measured ground temperat ures match those predicted directly from air temperature changes (Harris and Chapman 2001), and air versus ground temperature trends are similar at some specific sites (Baker and Ruschy 1993, Majorowicz and Safanda 2005, Majorowicz et al. 2006). The second important potential source of error in rock borehole-based temperature reconstructions is the downward percolation of groundwater, which can reduce the temperature at depth and be misinterpreted as a warming of the surface ov er time (Chisholm and Chapman 1992, Harris and Chapman 1995, Ferguson and Woodbur y 2005, Majorowicz et al. 2006). This may introduce a \"warming\" bias to reconstr uctions based on continental boreholes, the magnitude of which has not been addressed syst ematically. However, the similarity between measured ground temperatures and ground temperat ures calculated using air temperatures (Harris and Chapman 2001) suggests th at the average bias must be small over the mid latitudes. In general, groundwater bias can only be a problem in humid climates and in rock that readily conducts groundwater (including a ll highly fractured rock and ma ny sandstones and basalts). The groundwater bias cannot be responsible for th e strong reconstructed wa rming in permafrost regions of northern Alaska (Lachenbruch and Marshall 1986), and in the semi-arid U.S. and Canadian plains (Gosnold et al. 1997), although it may be partly responsible for the stronger reconstructed warming in eastern versus west ern North America (Pollack and Huang 2000). A comparison of borehole-based and instrumental 20th century warming trends for specific regions (Pollack and Smerdon 2004) shows no consistent offset related to precipitation: borehole- inferred warming exceeds instrumental warming in the wet regions of North America, but is less than instrumental warming in the wet regions of Europe and Southeast Asia. This is further evidence that the groundwater bias is quantit atively small in borehole-based temperature reconstructions on larger scales. The borehole temperature database has been screened to eliminate other sorts of groundwater influences that are more readily apparent (Huang and Pollack 1998). A separate issue from the uncertainty of rec onstructions is that ai r temperature itself can change for many local reasons, including defo restation and urban expansion (Skinner and Majorowicz 1999, Majorowicz et al . 2006), as discussed in Chapter 2. Borehole temperatures do record such changes, which are real changes of local climate. The borehole temperature database has been screened to eliminate sites with urban influence. Effects of rural land use change are not eliminated, and represent part of the human influence on climate in rural regions. 78 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS BOREHOLES IN GLACIAL ICE A small number of boreholes in the ice sheets have also been anal yzed in conjunction with ice core studies (Cuffey et al. 1994, 1995; Cuffey and Clow 1997; Dahl-Jensen et al. 1998 1999). Ice sheet boreholes permit longer time-scal e temperature reconstructions, because of the purity of ice, the great depth of the boreholes, and the opportunity for combination with isotopic information from the ice core itself. These anal yses can only be conducted in dry cold ice, and so are limited to the polar ice sheets and some high-altitude sites. As with the continental boreholes, the time resolution of r econstructions is strongly limited by the heat flow process; ice boreholes can only be used to reconstruct l ong-term averaged temperatures. Ice borehole reconstructions have used several different me thods, yielding similar re sults (Cuffey et al. 1995, Dahl-Jensen et al. 1998, Clow and Waddington 1999). The main assu mption of these analyses is that the physical process of heat transfer in th e ice is well understood. As with continental boreholes, the ice boreholes give a temp erature history that is the local surface temperature. For central Gr eenland (Cuffey et al. 1995, Cuffey and Clow 1997, Dahl-Jensen et al. 1998), results show a warmi ng over the last 150 years of approximately 1\u00b0C \u00b1 0.2\u00b0C preceded by a few centuries of cool cond itions. Preceding this was a warm period centered around A.D. 1000, which was warmer than the late 20th century by approximately 1\u00b0C. An analysis for south-central Greenland (Dahl-Je nsen et al. 1998) shows the same pattern of warming and cooling, but with larger magnitude ch anges. Uncertainties on these earlier numbers are a few tenths of a degree Centigrade for averages over a few centuries. A borehole from Law Dome (Dahl-Jensen et al . 1999), in coastal East Antarctica, reveals a warming of approximately 0.7 \u00b0C from the midd le 19th century to present (uncertainty of approximately 0.2 \u00b0C). This was preceded by a period of comparable warmth centered on 1500- 1600, a 1\u00b0C cooler period centered on 1300, and consistently warmer conditions prior to this (with temperature at A.D. 1 being approximately 1\u00b0C warmer than late 20th century). There is no apparent warming during medieval times at this site. Uncertainties on these results for earlier time periods are on the order of a few tenths of a degree Centigrade for averages over a few centuries. 79 9 Statistical Background The standard proxy reconstructions base d on linear regression are generally reasonable statistical methods for estimating past temperatures but may be associated with substantial uncertainty. There is a need for more rigorous sta tistical error characterization for proxy reconstructions of temperature that includes ac counting for temporal correlation and the choice of principal components. The variability of proxy reconstructed temper atures will be less than the variability of the actual temperatures and may not reproduce the actual temperature pattern at particular timescales. Examining the prediction of the reconstruc tion in a validation period is important, but the length of this period sets limits on a st atistical appraisal of the uncertainty in the reconstruction. Most critically, the relatively short instrument al temperature record provides very few degrees of freedom15 for verifying the low-frequency content of a reconstruction. The differences among a collection of proxy reconstructions that have not been deliberately created as a represen tative statistical sample may not reveal the full uncertainty in any one of them. The process of reconstructing climate record s from most proxy data is essentially a statistical one, and all efforts to estimate regi onal or global climate history from multiple proxies require statistical analyses. The first step is t ypically to separate the period of instrumental measurements into two segments: a calibration period and a validation pe riod. The statistical relationship between proxy data (e.g., tree ring width or a multiproxy assemblage) and instrumental measurements of a climate variable (e.g., surface temperature) is determined over the calibration period. Past variations in th e climate variable, incl uding those during the validation period, are then recons tructed by using this statistical relationship to predict the variable from the proxy data. Before the pr oxy reconstruction is accepted as valid, the relationship between the reconstr uction and the instrumental meas urements during the validation period is examined to test the accuracy of the r econstruction. In a comple te statistical analysis, the validation step should also include the calcul ation of measures of uncertainty, which gives an idea of the confidence one should place in the reconstructed record. 15 \"Degrees of freedom\" measures the amount of information for estimating a variance; specifically, it is the equivalent number of independent observations. 80 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS This chapter outlines and discusses some key elements of the statistical process described in the preceding paragraph and alluded to in other ch apters of this report. Viewing the statistical analysis from a more fundamental level will help to clarify so me of the methodologies used in surface temperature reconstruction, and highlight the different type s of uncertainties associated with these various methods. Resolving the num erous methodological differences and criticisms of proxy reconstruction is beyond the scope of this chapter, but we will address some key issues related to temporal correlation, the use of principal componen ts, and the interpretation of validation statistics. As a conc rete example, the chapter focuses on the Northern Hemisphere annual mean surface temperature reconstructed from annually resolved proxies such as tree rings. However, the basic principles can be generalized to other climate proxies and other meteorological variables. Spatially resolved r econstructions can also be reproduced using these methods, but a discussion of this application is not possible within the le ngth of this chapter. LINEAR REGRESSION AND PROXY RECONSTRUCTION The most common form of proxy reconstruc tion depends on the use of a multivariate linear regression. This methodol ogy requires two key assumptions: 1. Linearity : There is a linear statistical rela tionship between the proxies and the expected value of the climate variable. 2. Stationarity : The statistical relationship betw een the proxies and the climate variable is the same throughout the calibrati on period, validation period, and reconstruction period. Note that the stationarity of the relatio nship does not require stat ionarity of the series themselves, which would imply constant means, constant variances, and time-homogeneous correlations. These two assumptions have precise mathema tical formulations and address the two key questions concerning climate r econstructions: (1) How is the proxy related to the climate variable? (2) Is this relations hip consistent across both the in strumental period and at earlier times? In statistical terminology, these assumpti ons comprise a statistical model because they define a statistical relationship among the data. An Illustration Figure 9-1 is a simple illustra tion using a single proxy to predic t temperature. Plotted are 100 pairs of points that may be thought of as a hypothetical a nnual series of proxy data and corresponding instrumental surface temperature measurements over a 100-year calibration period. The solid black line is the linear fit to these data, or the calibration, which forms the basis for predictions of temperatures during other time periods. Here the prediction of temperature based on a proxy with value of A is T A and the proxy with value B predicts the temperature T B. STATISTICAL BACKGROUND 81 A B Proxy FIGURE 9-1 An illustration of using linear regression to predict temperature from proxy values. Plotted are 100 pairs of points corresponding to a hypothetical dataset of proxy observations and temperature measurements. The solid black line is th e least-squares fitted line and the blue lines indicate 95 percent prediction intervals for temperature using th is linear relationship. The dashed line and the red line indicate possible departures from a linear relationship between the proxy data and the temperature data. The figure also illustrates predictions made at proxy values A and B and the corresponding prediction intervals (wide blue lines) for the temperature. The curved blue lines in Figure 9-1 present the calibration error, or the uncertainty in predictions based on the calibration (technically the 95 percent prediction interval, which has probability 0.95 of covering the unknown temperatur e), which is a standard component of a regression analysis. In this illustration, the uncer tainty associated with temperature predictions based on proxy data is greater at point A than it is at point B. This is because the calibration errors are magnified for predictions based on pr oxy values that are out side the range of proxy data used to estimate the linear relationship. In the case of multiple proxies used to predict temperature, it is not pos sible to use a two-dimensional graph to illustrate the fitted statistical model and the uncertainties. However, as in th e single proxy case, the prediction errors using several proxies will increase as the values devi ate from those observed in the calibration period. Temperature TB TA TA* 82 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS Variability in the Regression Predictions Strictly speaking, assumption 1 posits a stra ight-line relationship between the average value of the climate variable, given the proxy, an d the value of the proxy. This detail has the practical significance of potential ly reducing the variability in th e reconstructed series, which can also be illustrated using Figure 9-1. For example, note that there is some variability in the instrumental temperature measurements at th e proxy value B (i.e., near point B, there are multiple temperature readings, most of which do not fall on the calibration line). However, estimates of past temperatures using proxy data near B will always yield the same temperature, namely T B, rather than a corresponding scatter of temperatures. This difference is entirely appropriate because T B is the most likely temperature value for each proxy measurement that yields B. In general, the predictions from re gression will have less variability than the actual values, and so, time series of reconstructed temp eratures will not fully reproduce the variability observed in the instrumental record. One way to assess methods of reconstructing temp eratures is to apply them to a synthetic history in which all temperatures are known. Zori ta and von Storch (2005) and von Storch et al. (2004) carried out such an exer cise using temperature output fr om the ECHO-G climate model. These authors constructed pseudoproxies by sampli ng the temperature field at locations used by Mann et al. (1998) and corrupted them with in creasing levels of white noise. They then reconstructed the Northern Hemisphere averag e temperature using both regression methods and the related Mann et al. method, and found that in both cases the variance of the reconstruction was attenuated relative to the \"true\" temperatur e time series with the attenuation increasing as the noise variance was increased. This phenomenon, identified by Zorita and von Storch (2005) and others, is not unexpected. Within the calibration period, the fr action of variance of temperature that is explained by the proxies naturally decreases as the noise level of the proxies increases. If the regression equation is then used to reconstruct temperatures for another period during which the proxies are statistically similar to those in the calibration period, it would be expected to capture a similar fraction of the variance. Some other approaches to r econstruction (e.g., Moberg et al . 2005) yield a reconstructed series that has variability similar to the observe d temperature series. These approaches include alternatives to ordinary regression methods such as inverse regression and total least-squares regression (Hegerl 2006) that ar e not subject to attenuation. Such methods may avoid the misleading impression that a graph of an attenuated temperature signal might give, but they do so at a price: Direct regression gi ves the most precise reconstructi on, in the sense of mean squared error, and so, these other methods give up accurac y. Referring back to the example in Figure 9- 1, using the straight line relations hip is the best prediction to make from these data, and any inflation of the variability will degrade the accuracy of the reconstruction. Departures from the Assumptions The dashed line in Figure 9-1 represents a hypothetical departure fr om the strict linear relationship between the proxy data and temperature. This illustrat es a violation of the linearity assumption because, for lower values of the proxy, the relationship is not the same as given by the (straight) least-squares best-fit line. If the dashed line describes a more accurate STATISTICAL BACKGROUND 83 representation of the relationshi p between the proxy values and temperature measurements at lower proxy values, then using the dashed line will result in diffe rent reconstructed temperature series. The linear relationship among the temperature and proxy variable s can also be influenced by whether the variables are detr ended. If a temperature and a proxy time series share a common trend but are uncorrelated once the trends are removed, the re gression analysis can give markedly different results. The regression performed without first removing a trend could exhibit a strong relationship while the detrended regression could be weak. Whether to include a trend or not should be based on sc ientific understanding of the similarities or differences of the relationship over longer and shorter timescales. A departure from the stationar ity assumption is illustrated by the red line in Figure 9-1. Suppose that in a period other than the calibration period, the proxy and the temperature are related on the average by the red line, that is, a different linear relationship from the one in the calibration period. For an accurate reconstruction, one would want to use this red line and the estimate for a temperature at the proxy value A is indicated by T A* in the figure. Both the linearity and stationarity assump tions may be checked using the training and validation periods of the instrumental record. If the relationship is not linear over the training period, a variety of objective statistical approaches can be used to describe a more complicated relationship than a linear one. Moreover, one can contrast the effect of using detrended versus raw variables. Stationarity can also be test ed for the validation period, although in most cases the use of the proxy relationship will involve extrapol ation beyond the range of observed values, such as in the case of point A in the illustration given above. In cases such as this, the extrapolation must also rely on th e scientific context for its valid ity, that is, one must provide a scientific basis for the assumed relationship. The distinction between the assumptions us ed to reconstruct temperatures and the additional assumptions required to generate stat istical measures of th e uncertainty of such reconstructions is critical. For example, the error bounds in Figure 9-1 are based on statistical assumptions on how the temperature departs from an exact linear relationship. These assumptions can also be checked using the tr aining and calibration periods, and often more complicated regression methods can be used to adju st for particular featur es in the data that violate the assumptions. One example is tem poral correlation among data points, which is discussed in the next section. Inverse Regression and Statistical Calibration Reconstructing temperature or another climat e variable from a proxy such as a tree ring parameter has a formal resemblance to the statis tical calibration of a meas urement instrument. A statistical calibration exercise c onsists of a sequence of experiments in which a single factor (e.g., the temperature) is set to precise, known le vels, and one or more measurements are made on a response (e.g., the proxy). Subsequently, in a second controlled experiment under identical conditions, the response is measured for an unknown level of the factor, and the regression relationship is used to infer the value of the fact or. This approach is known as inverse regression (Eisenhart 1939) because the roles of the response and factor are reversed from the more direct prediction illustrated in Figure 9- 1. Attaching an uncertainty to the result is nontrivial, but conservative approximations are known (Fieller 1954). There remains some debate in the 84 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS statistical literature concerni ng the circumstances when invers e or direct methods are better (Osborne 1991). The temperature reconstruction problem does not fit into this framework because both temperature and proxy values are not controlled. A more useful model is to consider the proxy and the target climate variable as a bivari ate observation on a complex system. Now the statistical solution to th e reconstruction problem is to stat e the conditional distribution of the unobserved part of the pair, temper ature, given the value of the obs erved part, the proxy. This is also termed the random calibration problem by Br own (1982). If the bivariate distribution is Gaussian, then the conditional dist ribution is itself Gaussian, with a mean that is a linear function of the proxy and a constant variance. From a sample of completely observed pairs, the regression methods outlined above give unbiased es timates of the intercept and slope in that linear function. In reality, the bivariate distribution is not ex pected to follow the Gaussian exactly. In this case the linea r function is only an approximati on; however, the adequacy of these approximations can be checked based on th e data using standard regression diagnostic methods. With multiple proxies, the dimension of the joint distribution increases, but the calculation of the conditional dist ribution is a direct generaliza tion from the bivariate (single proxy) case. Regression with Correlated Data In most cases, calibrations are based on proxy an d temperature data that are sequential in time. However, geophysical data are often auto correlated, which has the effect of reducing the effective sample size of the data. This reductio n in sample size decreases the accuracy of the estimated regression coefficients and causes the standard error to be underestimated during the calibration period. To avoid these problems and form a credible measure of uncertainty, the autocorrelation of the input data must be taken into account. The statistical strategy for accommodating corre lation in the data used in a regression model is two-pronged. The first part is to spec ify a model for the correlation structure, and to use modified regression estimates (generalized least s quares) that achieve better precision. The correctness of the specification can be tested using, for example, the Durbin-Watson statistic (Durbin and Watson 1950, 1951, 1971). The second part of the strategy is to recognize that correlation structure is usually too complex to be captured with parsimonious models. This structure may be revealed by a significant Durbin-W atson statistic or some other test, or may be suspected on other grounds. In this case, th e model-based standard errors of estimated coefficients may be replaced by more robust ve rsions, discussed for instance by Hinkley and Wang (1991). For time-series data, Andrews (1991) describes estimates of standard errors that are consistent in the presence of autocorrelated errors with changing variances. For time-series data, the correlations are usually modeled as stationary ; parsimonious models for stationary time series, such as ARMA, were popularized by Box a nd Jenkins (Box et al. 1994) . Note that this approach does not require either the temperature or the pr oxy to be stationar y, only the errors in the regression equation. STATISTICAL BACKGROUND 85 Reconstruction Uncertainty and Temporal Correlation An indication of the uncertainty of a reconstruction is an impor tant part of any display of the reconstruction itself. Usually this is in the form: Reconstruction \u00b1 2 \u00d7 standard error, and the standard error is given by co nventional regression calculations. The prediction mean squared erro r is the square of the standa rd error and is the sum of two terms. One is the variance of the errors in the regression equation, wh ich is estimated from calibration data, and may be modified in the light of differences between the calibration errors and the validation errors. This term is the same for all reconstruction dates. The other term is the variance of the estimation error in the regres sion parameters, and this varies in magnitude depending on the values of the proxi es and also the degree of autoco rrelation in the errors. This second term is usually small for a date when th e proxies are well within the range represented by the calibration data, but may become large when the equation is used to extrapolate to proxy values outside that range. Smoothed Reconstructions Reconstructions are often shown in a smoothe d form, both because the main features are brought out by smoothing and because the reconstruc tion of low-frequency features may be more precise than short-term behavior. The two parts of the prediction variance are both affected by smoothing, but in different ways. The effect on the first depends on the correlation structure of the errors, which may require some further mode ling, but is always a re duction in size. The second term depends on the smoothed values of th e proxies, and may become either larger or smaller, but typically becomes a more important pa rt of the resulting stan dard error, especially when extrapolating. PRINCIPAL COMPONENT REGRESSION The basic idea behind principal components regr ession is to replace the predictors (i.e., individual proxies) with a sma ller number of objectively determ ined variables that are linear combinations of the original proxies. The new variables are designed to contain as much information as possible from the original proxi es. As the number of principal components becomes large, the principal components regressi on becomes close to the regression on the full set of proxies. However, in practice the number of principal components is usually kept small, to avoid overfitting and the conseque nt loss of prediction skill. No known statis tical theory suggests that limiting the number of principal components used in regression leads to good predictions, although this practice ha s been found to work well in ma ny applications. Fritts et al. (1971) introduced the idea to dendroclimatol ogy, and it was discussed by Briffa and Cook (1990). Jolliffe (2002) describe s many issues in the use of principal component analysis, including principal component regression, as it is used in many areas of science. 86 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS The principal components contain maximum info rmation in the sense that the full set of proxies can be reproduced as cl osely as possible, gi ven only the values of the new variables (Johnson and Wichern 2002, Suppl. 8A). In genera l, one should judge the set of principal components taken together as a group because they are used together to form a reconstruction. Comparing just single principal components between two different approaches may be misleading. For example, each of the two groups of principal components may give equally valid approximations to the full set of proxies. This equivalence can occu r without being able to match on a one-to-one basis the pr incipal components in one gr oup with those in a second group. Spurious Principal Components McIntyre and McKitrick (2003) demonstrated that under some conditions, the leading principal component can exhibit a spurious trendlike appearance, which could then lead to a spurious trend in the proxy-ba sed reconstruction. To see how this can happen, suppose that instead of proxy climate data, one simply used a random sample of autocorrelated time series that did not contain a co herent signal. If these simulated pr oxies are standardized as anomalies with respect to a calibration peri od and used to form principal components, the first component tends to exhibit a trend, even though the proxies themselves have no common trend. Essentially, the first component tends to capture those proxies that, by chance, show different values between the calibration period and the remai nder of the data. If this com ponent is used by itself or in conjunction with a small number of unaffected components to perform reconstruction, the resulting temperature reconstruction may exhibi t a trend, even though the individual proxies do not. Figure 9-2 shows the result of a simple simulation along the lines of McIntyre and McKitrick (2003) (the computer code appears in Appendix B). In each simulation, 50 autocorrelated time series of length 600 were co nstructed, with no coherent signal. Each was centered at the mean of its last 100 values, a nd the first principal co mponent was found. The figure shows the first components from five su ch simulations overlaid. Principal components have an arbitrary sign, which was chosen here to make the last 100 values higher on average than the remainder. STATISTICAL BACKGROUND 87 Time FIGURE 9-2 Five simulated principal components a nd the corresponding population eigenvector. See text for details. Principal components of sample data reflect the shape of the co rresponding eigenvectors of the population covariance matrix. The first ei genvector of the covariance matrix for this simulation is the red curve in Fi gure 9-2, showing the precise form of the spurious trend that the principal component would introduce into the fitted model in this case. This exercise demonstrates that the base line with respect to which anomalies are calculated can influence princi pal components in unanticipat ed ways. Huybers (2005), commenting on McIntyre and McKitrick (2005a), points out that normalization also affects results, a point that is reinforced by McInty re and McKitrick (2005b) in their response to Huybers. Principal components calculations are of ten carried out on a correlation matrix obtained by normalizing each variable by its sample standard deviation. Va riables in different physical units clearly require some kind of normali zation to bring them to a common scale, but even variables that are physically equivalent or normalized to a common scale may have widely different variances. Huybers comments on tree ri ng densities, which have much lower variances than widths, even after conversion to dimensi onless \"standardized\" form. In this case, an argument can be made for using the variables without further normalization. However, the higher-variance variables tend to make correspondingly higher c ontributions to the principal components, so the decision whether to equa lize variances or not should be based on the scientific considerations of the climate information represented in each of the proxies. Normalized simulated proxy component 88 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS Each principal component is a weighted co mbination of the individual proxy series. When those series consist of a common signal pl us incoherent noise, the best estimate of the common signal has weights proportional to the se nsitivity of the proxy divided by its noise variance. These weights in general are not the same as the weights in the principal component, as calculated from either raw or st andardized proxies, either of wh ich is therefore suboptimal. In any case, the principal compone nts should be constructed to achieve a low-dimensional representation of the entire se t of proxy variables that incorporates most of the climate information contained therein. VALIDATION AND THE PREDICTION SKILL OF THE PROXY RECONSTRUCTION The role of a validation period is to provide an independent assessmen t of the accuracy of the reconstruction method. As discussed above, it is possible to overfit the statistical model during the calibration period, which has the effect of underestimating the prediction error. Reserving a subset of the data for validation is a natural way to offset this problem. If the validation period is independent of the calibration period, any skill measures used to assess the quality of the reconstruction will not be biased by the potential overf it during the calibration period. An inherent difficulty in validating a climate reconstructi on is that the validation period is limited to the historical instrumental record, an d so, it is not possible to obtain a direct estimate of the reconstruction skill at ear lier periods. Because of the autocorrelation in most geophysical time series, a validation period ad jacent to the calibration period cannot be truly independent; if the autocorrelation is short term, the lack of i ndependence does not seriou sly bias the validation results. Measures of Prediction Skill Some common measures used to assess the ac curacy of statistical predictions are the mean squared error (MSE), reduction of error (R E), coefficient of efficiency (CE), and the squared correlation ( r2). The mathematical definitions of these quantities are given in Box 9.1. MSE is a measure of how close a set of prediction s are to the actual values and is widely used throughout the geosciences and statis tics. It is usually normalized and presented in the form of either the RE statistic (Fritts 1976) or the CE statistic (Cook et al. 1994). The RE statistic compares the MSE of the reconstr uction to the MSE of a reconstruc tion that is constant in time with a value equivalent to the sample mean for the calibration data. If the re construction has any predictive value, one would expect it to do be tter than just the sample average over the calibration period; that is, one would e xpect RE to be greater than zero. The CE, on the other hand, compares the MSE to the performance of a reconstruction that is constant in time with a value equi valent to the sample mean for the validation data. This second constant reconstruction depends on the validation data, which are withheld from the calibration process, and therefore presents a more demanding comparison. In fact, CE will always be less than RE, and the difference increas es as the difference between the sample means for the validation and the cal ibration periods increases.

Mean squared error (MSE) () ()21 MSE =t tyyNy , where the sum on the right-hand side of the e quation is over times of interest (either the calibration or vali dation period) and N is the number of time points.

Otherwise, CE is less than both RE and r2. 90 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIONS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS If the calibration has any pred ictive value, one would expect it to do better than just the sample average over the validation period and, fo r this reason, CE is a particularly useful measure. The squared correlation statistic, denoted as r2, is usually adopted as a measure of association between two va riables. Specifically, r2 measures the strength of a linear relationship between two variables when the linear fit is determined by regression. For example, the correlation between the variables in Figure 9-1 is 0.88, which means that the regression line explains 100 \u00d7 0.882 = 77.4 percent of the variability in the temperature values. However, r2 measures how well some linear function of the predictions matches the data, not how well the predictions themselves perform. The coefficien ts in that linear functi on cannot be calculated without knowing the values being predicted, and so, it is not in itself a useful indication of merit. A high CE value, however, will always have a high r2, and this is another justification for considering the CE. Illustration of CE and r-Squared Figure 9-3 gives some examples of a hypot hetical temperature series and several reconstruction series, where the black line is the actual temperat ures and the colored lines are various reconstructions. The red line has an r2 of 1 but a CE of -18.9 and is an example of a perfectly correlated reconstruction w ith no skill at prediction. The da shed blue line is level at the mean temperature and has an r2 and a CE that are both zero. The blue and green reconstructed lines both have a CE of 0.50. For either of thes e reconstructions to be be tter than just the mean, they must exhibit some degree of correlati on with the temperatures. In this case, r2 is 0.68 for the blue line and 0.51 for the green line. Despite a common CE, these tw o reconstructions match th e temperature series in different ways. The blue curve is more highly correlated with the short-term fluctuations, and the green curve tracks th e longer term variations of the te mperature series. The difference between the blue and green lines illustrates that the CE statistic alone does not contain all the useful information about th e reconstruction error. Time FIGURE 9-3 A hypothetical temperature series (black line) and four possible reconstructions. Temperature STATISTICAL BACKGROUND 91 Distinguishing Between RE and CE and the Validation Period The combination of a high RE and a low CE or r2 means that the reconstruction identified the change in mean levels between the calibra tion and validation periods reasonably well, but failed to track the variations within the valida tion period. One way that this discrepancy can occur is for the proxies and the temperatures to be related by a common trend in the calibration period. When the trend is large this can result in a high RE. If the validation period does not have as strong a trend and the proxies are not skillful at predicting shorter timescale fluctuations in temperature, then the CE can be substantiall y lower. For example, the reconstructions may only do as well as the mean level in the validation period, in which case CE will be close to zero. An ideal validation procedure w ould measure skill at different timescales, or in different frequency bands using wavelet or power spectrum calculations. Unfortunately, the paucity of validation data places severe limits on their sens itivity. For instance, a focus on variations of decadal or longer timescale with the 45 years of validation data used by Mann et al. (1998) would give statistics with just (2\u00d745 10) = 9 degrees of freedom, t oo few to adequately quantify skill. This discussion also motivates the choice of a validation period that exhibits the same kind of variability as the calibration period. Simply using the earliest part of the instrumental series may not be the best choice for validation. Determining Uncertainty and Select ing Among Statistical Methods Besides supplying an unbiased appraisal of the accuracy of the reconstruction, the validation period can also be used to adjust the uncertainty measur es for the reconstruction. For example, the MSE calculated for the validation pe riod provides a useful measure of the accuracy of the reconstruction; the square root of MSE can be used as an estimate of the reconstruction standard error. Reconstructions that have poor validation statistics (i.e., low CE) will have correspondingly wide uncertainty bounds, and so can be seen to be unreliable in an objective way. Moreover, a CE statistic close to zero or negative suggests that th e reconstruction is no better than the mean, and so its skill for time av erages shorter than the validation period will be low. Some recent results reported in Table 1S of Wahl and Ammann (in press) indicate that their reconstruction, which uses the same procedure a nd full set of proxies used by Mann et al. (1999), gives CE values ranging from 0.103 to -0. 215, depending on how far back in time the reconstruction is carried. Although some debate has focused on when a validation statistic, such as CE or RE, is significant, a more meaningful approach may be to c oncentrate on the implied prediction intervals for a given re construction. Even a low CE va lue may still provide prediction intervals that are useful for drawing particular scientific conclusions. The work of B\u00fcrger and Cubasch (2005) considers different variations on the reconstruction method to arrive at 64 different analyses. Although they do not report CE, examination of Figure 1 in their paper suggests th at many of the variant reconstructions will have low CE and that selecting a r econstruction based on its CE value could be a useful way to winnow the choices for the reconstruction. Using CE to judge the merits of a reconstruction is known as cross-validation, and is a common stat istical technique for selecting among competing models and subsets of data. When the validatio n period is independent of the calibration period, 92 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIONS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS cross-validation avoids many of th e issues of overfitting if models were simply selected on the basis of RE. QUANTIFYING THE FULL UNCERT AINTY OF A RECONSTRUCTION The statistical framework based on regression provides a basis for attaching uncertainty estimates to the reconstructions . It should be emphasized, howe ver, that this is only the statistical uncertainty and that other sources of error need to be addressed from a scientific perspective. These sources of error are specific to each proxy and are discussed in detail in Chapters 3-8 of this report. The quantification of statistical uncertainty depends on the stationarity and linearity assump tions cited above, the adjustment for temporal correlation in the proxy calibration, and the sensib le use of principal components or other methods for data reduction. On the basis of these assumptions an d an approximate Gaussian distribution for the noise in the relationship between temperature and th e proxies, one can derive prediction intervals for the reconstructed temperatures using standard techniques (see, e.g., Draper and Smith 1981). This calculation will also provide a theoretica l MSE for the validation period, which can be compared to the actual mean squared va lidation error as a ch eck on the method. One useful adjustment is to inflate the estim ated prediction standard error (but not the reconstruction itself) in the predictions so th at they agree with the observed CE or other measures of skill during the validation period. Th is will account for the additional uncertainty in the predictions that cannot be deduced directly from the statistical model. Another adjustment is to use Monte Carlo simulation techniques to acco unt for uncertainty in the choice of principal components. Often, 10, 30, or 50 year running m eans are applied to temp erature reconstructions to estimate long-term temperatur e averages. A slightly more el aborate computation, but still a standard technique in regressi on analysis, would be to derive a covariance matrix of the uncertainties in the reconstructions over a sequ ence of years. This w ould make it possible to provide a statistically rigorous standard error when proxy-base d reconstructions are smoothed. Interpreting Confidence Intervals A common way of reporting the uncertainty in a reconstruction is graphing the reconstructed temperature for a given year w ith the upper and lower li mits of a 95 percent confidence interval to quantify the uncertainty. Usually, the reconstructed curve is plotted with the confidence intervals forming a band about the estimate. The fraction of variance that is not explained by the proxies is associated with the residuals, and their variance is one part of the mean squared prediction error, which dete rmines the width of the error band. Although this way of illustrating uncertainty ranges is correct, it can easily be misinterpreted. The confusion arises because the uncertainty for the reconstruction is shown as a curve, rather than as a collection of points. For example, the 95 percent confidence intervals, when combined over the time of the reconstruction, do not form an envelope that has 95 percent probability of containing the true temperature seri es. To form such an envelope, the intervals would have to be inflated further with a fact or computed from a statistical model for the autocorrelation, typically using M onte Carlo techniques. Such infl ated intervals would be a valid STATISTICAL BACKGROUND 93 description of the uncertainty in the maximum or minimum of the reconstructed temperature series. Other issues also arise in interpreting the sh ape of a temperature reconstruction curve. Most temperature reconstructions exhibit a charac teristic variability over time. However, the characteristics of the unknown temperature series may be quite different from those of the reconstruction, which must always be borne in mind when interpreting a reconstruction. For example, one might observe some decadal variabili ty in the reconstruction and attribute similar variability to the real temperatur e series. However, this inference is not justified without further statistical assumptions, such as the probability of a particular pattern a ppearing due to chance in a temporally correlated series. Given the attenuati on in variability associat ed with the regression method and the temporal correla tions within the proxy record that may not be related to temperature, quantifying how the sh ape of the reconstructed temperature curve is related to the actual temperature series is difficult. Ensembles of Reconstructions One approach to depicting the uncertainty in the reconstructed temperature series is already done informally by considering a sample, or ensemble , of possible reconstructions. By graphing different approaches or variants of a reconstruction on the same axes, such as Figure S- 1 of this report, differences in variability and tr ends can be appreciated. The problem with this approach is that the collection of curves cannot be inte rpreted as a representative sample of some population of reconstructions. This is also true of the 64 variants in B\u00fcrger and Cubasch (2005). The differences in methodology and datasets su pporting these reconstr uctions make them distinct, but whether they represent a deliberate sample from the range of possible temperature reconstructions is not clear. As an alternative, st atistical methods exis t for generating an ensemble of temperature reconstruc tions that can be interpreted in the more traditional way as a random sample. Although this requires additional statistical assumptions on the joint distribution of the proxies and temperatures, it simplifies th e interpretation of the reconstruction. For example, to draw inferences about the maximum values in past temperatures, one would just form a histogram of the maxima in the different ensemble members. The spread in the histogram is a rigorous way to quantify th e uncertainty in the maximum of a temperature reconstruction. 94 10 Climate Forcings and Climate Models The main external climate forcings e xperienced over the last 2,000 years are volcanic eruptions, changes in so lar radiation reaching the Earth, and increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases and aerosols due to human activities Proxy records are available for reconstruc ting climate forcings over the last 2,000 years, but these climate forcing reconstructions are associated with as much uncertainty as surface temperature reconstructions. Greenhouse gases and tropospheric aerosols varied little from A.D. 1 to around 1850. Volcanic eruptions and solar fluctuations were likely the most strongly varying external forcings during this period, but it is currently estimated that the temperature variations caused by these forcings were much less pronounced than the warming due to greenhouse gas forcing since the mid 19th century. Climate model simulations indicate that so lar and volcanic forci ngs together could have produced periods of relative warmth and cold during the preindustr ial portion of the last 1,000 years. However, anthropogenic greenhouse gas increases are needed to simulate late 20th century warmth. As described in Chapter 1, global mean surface temperature varies in response to forcings external to the climate system that affect the glob al energy balance. For the last 2,000 years, the dominant forcings have been the natural cha nges in solar irradiance and volcanic eruptions, along with the more recent anthropogenic infl uences from greenhouse gases, tropospheric aerosols, and land use changes. This chapter la rgely focuses on the natural forcings during the preindustrial period, data for which comes from so me of the same sources as the proxy evidence for surface temperature variations, namely, historic al records, ice cores, and tree rings. These reconstructions are typically asso ciated with as much uncertainty as reconstructions of surface temperature. Climate models are often used to simulate the response of climate to variations in external forcing, including those indicated by pr oxy evidence. A variety of models have been used to estimate the surface temperature variat ions implied by the available proxy data for the last 2,000 years. Climate models can also be used to study the feedbacks that determine the response of the global mean surface temperature to external forcings, and also to estimate the natural internal variability of the climate system. CLIMATE FORCINGS AND CLIMATE MODELS 95 CLIMATE FORCINGS The temperature of the Earth is determined by a balance of the energy entering the Earth- atmosphere system and the energy leaving the system. An energy imbalance imposed on the climate system either externally or by human activities is termed a climate forcing (NRC 2005); persistent climate forcings cause the temperature of the Earth to change until an energy balance is restored. The amount of change is determin ed by the magnitudes of the climate forcings and the feedbacks within the climate sy stem that amplify or diminish the effect of the forcings (NRC 2003b). Climate forcings that di rectly affect the radiative ba lance of the Earth are termed radiative forcings and are typically m easured in watts per square meter (W\u00b7m-2) (NRC 2005). Positive global mean radiative forcings result in warming of global mean surface temperatures. Volcanic eruptions, changes in the Sun's radiative output, and th e mostly anthropogenic changes in greenhouse gases, tropospheric aerosols, and land use are the main climate forcings for surface temperatures over the last 2,000 years. Greenhouse Gases The primary natural greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), and nitrous oxide (N 2O). Water vapor is also a greenhouse gas that contributes th e largest warming, but it is treated as a feedback because its concen tration is controlled by the temperature of the atmosphere rather than by human activities. Continuous atmospheric measurements of carbon dioxide have been available since the mid-20th cen tury from the Mauna Loa Observatory, and all of the significant greenhouse gases have been monitored since 1980 by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's global air samp ling network (Keeling a nd Whorf 2005). For previous decades and centuries, greenhouse gas concentrations are obt ained by analyzing air bubbles trapped in cores and firn of ice in Antarctica and Greenland. Over the glacial-interglacial cycles of the last 650,000 years, carbon dioxide varied between about 300 ppm (parts per million by volume) during warm interglacial periods and about 180 ppm during cold glacial periods (Siegenthaler et al. 2005) . Methane and nitrous oxide atmospheric concentrations during interglacial periods did not exceed 790 ppb (parts per billion by volume) and 290 ppb, respectively (Spahni et al. 2005). Carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide varied little over the past 2,000 years prior to the industrial era (Figure 10-1). Ice core measurements indicate that carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide remained within a few ppm and ppb, respectively, of their m ean concentrations and within the uncertainties of the data (Raynaud et al. 2003, Gerber et al. 2003). Methane fluctuated between 600 and 750 ppb, changing with the climate and likely resulti ng from fluctuations in natural and early anthropogenic sources (Blunier et al. 1993, Ruddiman and Thomson 2001, Raynaud et al. 2003, Keppler et al. 2006). Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution (ca. 1750), the concentrations of these greenhouse gases in th e atmosphere have increased considerably. Currently, they are appreciably outs ide the envelope of glacial-inter glacial variations of the last 650,000 years. Carbon dioxide has increased fr om about 280 ppm during preindustrial times to current values of around 380 ppm. Methane has more than doubled from preindustrial levels, with more moderate but significan t increases of nitrous oxide. Th e radiative forcing due to the increases of these and other long-lived greenhou se gases (relative to 1750 A.D.) is about 2.5 96 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIONS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS W\u00b7m-2 (Joos 2005) (Figure 10-1). This is significantly larger than any variations or trends in the natural forcings, as we understand th em over the last 2,000 years. FIGURE 10-1 Evolution of atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane over the last 22,000 years. Left- hand axes show atmospheric concentrations (note the carbon dioxide scale does not start from zero) and right-hand axes show the radiative forcing relative to 1750 as calculated using the formulas given by Myhre et al.

Red arrows indicate the theoretical detection limit of a forcing (relative to Last Glacial Maximum and preind ustrial conditions) within a climate system model, assuming an internal climate variability or detection threshold of 0.2\u00b0C, climate equilibrium, and a mid- range climate sensitivity of 3\u00b0C for a carbon dioxide d oubling. Dashed red lines indicate the uncertainty of the detection threshold associated with the climat e sensitivity range of 1.5 to 4.5\u00b0C. SOURCE: Joos (2005). Orbital Changes in Incoming Solar Radiation The amount of energy received by the Earth from the Sun varies on many different timescales. Over the last two millennia, two m echanisms mainly have affected the amount of solar energy reaching the top of Earth's atmosphere. The first mechanism is tied to changes in the Earth's orbital parameters caused by the gr avitational pull of the Sun, Moon, and other planets. These effects combine to change the tilt of Earth's axis of rotation, the eccentricity of Earth's orbit, and the orientation of the eccentric orbit with respect to th e vernal equinox with timescales ranging from 20,000 to 400,000 years (Ber ger 1978). Over the limited period of the last 2,000 years, changes in the Earth's orbit ha ve led to small changes in the amount of solar radiation arriving at the top of the Earth's atmosphere by latitude and by season. These orbital effects should have resulted in only a small tre nd in seasonal surface temperatures over the last 2,000 years, making Northern Hemisphere summers slightly cooler and Northern Hemisphere winters slightly warmer today than they were 2,000 years ago. Because of the seasonal nature of the orbital effects, the incoming global and annual mean solar radi ation has remained essentially unchanged. CLIMATE FORCINGS AND CLIMATE MODELS 97 Solar Variability The Sun's emission of radiation also varies in association with the frequency of occurrence of dark sunspots, br ight faculae, and other sola r phenomena. Estimates of total solar irradiance over the last two millennia come from several measures. Direct space-based radiometer measurements availa ble since 1978 indicate that the total irradiance has varied by only about 0.1 percent over the last two 11-year solar cycles (Fr\u00f6hlich and Lean 2004). These direct measurements showed a good correlation of sunspot number and irradiance during cycles 21 and 22. For the most recent cycle, the irradiance is as high as during the last two cycles, but the sunspot number is 20-30 percent lo wer (Fr\u00f6hlich and Lean 2004, Lean 2005). Different solar indices, such as sunspot number, length of the solar cycle, and cosmogenic isotopes of carbon and beryllium, have been proposed as proxies for total solar irradiance during the past two millennia (Figure 10-2). Visual recordings of sunspots with telescopes have been available since 1610, but as noted above, the correlation of sunspots with irradiance has not been the same for the last th ree cycles. Measurements of beryllium isotopes in ice cores and carbon isotopes in tr ee rings are available for the pa st 1,000 to 2,000 years. The production of these isotopes is fr om galactic cosmic rays that are pushed away from Earth by the solar wind during times of strong solar activity. The relation between i rradiance and cosmogenic isotopes, though, is complex and is not necessarily linear (Wang et al. 2005a). Proxy records of solar irradiance have been used, often in combination with recent satellite measurements and solar modeling experime nts, to obtain reconstr uctions of total solar irradiance over the last two millennia. Early re constructions adopted a long-term trend in solar irradiance based on cosmogenic isotope records and comparisons to Sunlike stars, yielding a solar irradiance estimate for the Maunder Mini mum (1645 to 1715) of about 0.2 to 0.4 percent below contemporary solar minima (Hoyt and Scha tten 1993, Lean et al. 1995). The mechanisms proposed to explain this trend have been quest ioned recently, and newer reconstructions assume that solar output during the Ma under Minimum was closer to th at of the present-day solar minima (Foukal et al. 2004). The most recent r econstructions (Fr\u00f6hlich and Lean 2004, Wang et al. 2005b) indicate that solar irradi ance has varied by about 0.1 per cent over the last 2,000 years, which is equivalent to variations in radiative forcing of 0.1 to 0.2 W\u00b7m-2 between periods of low and high solar activity (Figure 10-2). Extended in tervals of low solar activity, marked by an absence of sunspots, include the periods from 1645 to 1715 (the Maunder Minimum) and from 1450 to 1550 (the Sporer Minimum). These solar minima occurred within the Little Ice Age (which extended from around 1400 to 1850). Some studies have suggested that solar activity during medieval times may have been comparable to the modern solar maximum. Significant uncertainties exist in all of th ese records because of the shortn ess of the calibration record and our incomplete physical understa nding of solar activ ity and its influence on irradiance. Additionally, indirect effects as sociated with ozone and stratospheric changes may alter the atmospheric circulation and re sponse (Shindell et al. 2001). 98 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIONS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS FIGURE 10-2 Records of sunspot number and cosmogeni c isotope fluctuations in tree rings and ice cores associated with solar activity over the past 2,000 years. SOURCE: Updated from Fr\u00f6hlich and Lean (2004). Volcanic Eruptions The radiative effect of a volcanic eruption de pends on its magnitude, location, the time of year, the vertical orientation of the eruption, and the types and si zes of the ejecta (Robock 2000). Explosive volcanic eruptions add large amounts of ash and sulfur gases to the atmosphere, which diminish the amount of solar radiation reaching th e surface, thereby cooling the Earth. Larger ash particles settle rapidly to the surface and generally only cool the surface temperature over a small region for several days to a few weeks. The sulfur gases combine with water vapor to form sulfate aerosols. In large explosive eruptio ns, the smaller sulfate aer osols are injected high into the atmosphere where they remain for up to several years. Sulfate aerosols from tropical eruptions are transported globally by high-alti tude winds, whereas sulfate aerosols from high- latitude eruptions are more spatially restricted and have less effect on global temperature. Although large eruptions can lead to significant cooling immediatel y after the eruption, such as \"the year without a summer\" after the 1815 erupti on of Mount Tambora in Indonesia, the effect is isolated to a few years. Accumulation of sulfate aerosols from several volcanoes closely spaced in time can lead to more extended global cooling. Satellite instruments provided aerosol m easurements for the large Mount Pinatubo eruption of 1991 in the Philippines. Historical records have been used to document past large eruptions in populated regions, notably Tambora in 1815 and Krak atau in 1883. Farther back, polar ice cores in Greenland and An tarctica recorded the acidity a nd sulfate in annual ice layers CLIMATE FORCINGS AND CLIMATE MODELS 99 from the settling of volcanic su lfate aerosols (Crowley 2000, Hegerl 2006). Disentangling whether the volcanic debris were from a high-latitude volcano n earby or a large tropical volcano requires using records from multiple ice cores locate d at both poles and is sensitive to which ice cores are used. Reconstructions of volcanic activ ity over the last two m illennia all distinguish the large eruptions of 1258 or 1259, 1453, a nd 1815, along with periods of more active volcanism in the late 13th centu ry, the 17th century, and the early 19th century, although the various reconstructions differ with respect to some of the details (Figure 10-3). FIGURE 10-3 Ice core estimates of global stratospheric sulfate loading from volcanoes (A.D. 1-2005). SOURCE: Hegerl (2006). Land Use Although humans have been changing the natu ral vegetation for thousands of years by clearing forests and planting crops (Ruddiman 2003), the largest re gional changes in continental vegetation cover have occurred since the mid-19th century in the Northern Hemisphere and early 20th century in the Southern Hemisphere (Bertraud et al. 2002). Changing land cover affects climate by modifying the surface reflectiv ity and the hydrological cycle. At present, estimates of the temperature change due to land use change are model and dataset dependent and cannot be independently verified with proxy data. One study estim ates a global cooling as large as 0.4\u00b0C over the last 1,000 years (Bauer et al. 2003). Another sugge sts significant regional warming in the 20th century (Christy et al. 2006). -50050100150200250300350 0 500 1000 1500 2000Sulphate Loading (MT) Year ADVesuvius (79 AD) PinatuboTambora (1815)S.

For instance, atmospheric carbon diox ide concentrations are increas ed by clearing of forests and decreased by reforestation, methane concentrati ons are increased by the cultivation of rice, and nitrous oxide concentrations are increased by the use of nitrogen fertilizers in agricultural activity. Tropospheric Aerosols Natural concentrations of tr opospheric aerosols remained re latively constant before the industrial period. Concentrations have increased over the 20th century due to human activities (Ramaswamy et al. 2001). The radiative forc ings of tropospheric aeros ols have large ranges associated with uncertainties in aerosol sour ces, composition, and properties, and their interactions with clouds (NRC 2005). Observations and models indica te that in total the direct effects of aerosols and the indirect effect associated with aerosol-c loud interactions likely lead to a reduction of solar radiative flux at the Earth's surface, although separate aerosol species, such as black carbon, may have a positive radiative forcing (Ramaswamy et al. 2001). Tropospheric aerosols persist in the atmosphere for days to weeks and have significa nt regional variation; uncertainties in their forcing effects are large, especially at smaller spatial scales (NRC 2005). CLIMATE MODEL SIMULATIONS Computer models can be used to simulate th e behavior of the climate system, taking into account both temporal and geograp hic variability, to understand bot h the natural variability of climate system and the response of the climate system to changes in climate forcings (NRC 2001). These simulations can also be used to interpret proxy-based cl imate reconstructions (Trenberth and Otto-Bliesner 2003). A hierarchy of models have been used to simulate the climate variability of the last 1,000 years. These models range from simpler energy balance models to much more detailed and computer-int ensive models of the Earth system. Climate models have been used to test various asp ects of surface temperature reconstructions. In addition, they can be used to estimate the sensitivity of the surface temperature and other climatic variables to the estimated climate forcings over this peri od and the uncertain ties inherent in those estimates. Using model simulations with several temperatur e reconstructions and instrumental data over the past seven centu ries and accounting for uncertainties in the reconstructions and forcings, Hegerl et al. (2006) give an estimate of climate sensitivity of 1.5- 6.2\u00b0C. Climate simulations of the last 1,000 years ha ve been performed with a variety of models (Jones and Mann 2004, and references therein). These simulations generally indicate that surface temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere were cooler prior to the 20th century than during the reference period from 1961 to 1990, with the second half of the 20th century being warmer than any part of the preceding mille nnium (Figure 10-4). Simulated Northern Hemisphere surface temperatures decrease from A.D. 1000 to a broad minimum extending from 1500 to 1700, and they warm substantially after 1900. Coolings associated with volcanoes are evident in the simulated surface temperatures. The average response of a climate model to CLIMATE FORCINGS AND CLIMATE MODELS 101 volcanic forcing exhibits an e-folding time of co oling consistent with that inferred from large- scale tree-ring- and multiproxy-based reconstruc tions of Northern Hemisphere summer surface temperature (Hegerl et al. 2003) (Figure 10-5). The model simu lations are consistent with published surface temperature reconstructions. FIGURE 10-4 Estimates of Northern Hemisphere surface temperature variations over the last two millennia. Shown are 40-year smoothed series. Models have been aligned to have the same mean over the common 1856-1980 period as the instrumental seri es (which is assigned zero mean during the 1961- 1990 reference period). The model simulations are based on varying radiative forcing histories and employ a hierarchy of models. SOURCE: Jones and Mann (2004).

Dotted lines represent 9-95 percent uncertainty ranges for the observed response (note the sample size decreases with time). SOURCE: Hegerl et al. (2003). Differences among the model simulations of the last millennium are related to several factors. The volcanic and solar forcing reconstr uctions used by the models differ as do their 102 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS geographic and seasonal implementation. Most climate model simulations published to date used one of the earlier reconstructions of sola r irradiance that included an increase in solar irradiance from the Maunder Minimum to present of around 0.2 to 0.4 percent. None of the long transient simulations has incl uded wavelength-dependent change s in solar irradiance, although this effect has been investigated with shorter sensitivity simulations and has been shown to impact regional surface climate (Shindell et al. 2001). Volcanic reconstructions used in the various climate model simulations show similar timing of major volcanic eruptions and temporal clusters of eruptions. The models differed in the conversion of volcanic sulfate loading into optical depth and the seasonally dependent horiz ontal and vertical dispersion of the aerosol cloud. The models also varied wi th respect to the specifics of th e radiative transfer calculations included for volcanic aerosols. For example, in some energy balance models and intermediate complexity models, volcanoes were represented as a negative deviation of the solar irradiance. Differences between the various model simulatio ns can also be related to differences in the sensitivity of the models (G oosse et al. 2005). Two of th e models, CSM and GKSS, are full three-dimensional climate models and have equili brium climate sensitivities of 2\u00b0C and 3.2\u00b0C, respectively, for doubling of atmospheric CO 2. Some simpler models have an adjustable climate sensitivity (i.e., the Gerber 1.5CO 2 and 2.5CO 2 simulations). Different models also exhibit different sensitivities to different external forc ings. The full three-dimensional climate models, which include parameterizations for the size distri bution and transport of volcanic aerosols, show stronger cooling than the models that prescribe the volcan ic forcing in terms of a reduction in the Sun's emission. ANTHROPOGENIC FORCING AND RECENT CLIMATE CHANGE Based on current estimates, variations in natu ral climate forcings over the last 2,000 years were much less than the increase in current gr eenhouse forcing due to human activities. Over the 27-year period in which it has b een monitored with satellite-borne instruments, the solar radiative forcing has varied only by 0.1-0.2 W\u00b7m-2 (Foukal et al. 2004). Volcanic activity has not been anomalous as compared to the last 1,000 years and cannot be used to explain the late 20th century warmth. Concentra tions of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have increased substantially over the 20th century and are appr eciably above their prei ndustrial levels. The radiative forcing due to the increases of th e long-lived greenhouse gases from 1750 to 2000 is about 2.5 W\u00b7m-2 (Ramaswamy et al. 2001). Troposphe ric aerosols and land use have also changed due to human activities but the magnitudes of these forcings are not as well constrained (Ramaswamy et al. 2001, NRC 2005). Results using a Monte Carlo approach, climate model simulations, and observations of atmospheric a nd oceanic warming suggest a total radiative forcing from preindustrial times to the present of 1.4 to 2.4 W\u00b7m-2, which is consistent with the observed warming (Knutti et al. 2002). Simulations with energy balance and intermed iate complexity models indicate that a combination of solar and volcanic forcings can explain periods of rela tive warmth and cold between A.D. 1000 and 1900, but that anthropogenic forcing, and particularly increases in greenhouse gases, are needed to reproduce the late 20th century warm ing (Crowley 2000, Bertrand et al. 2002, Bauer et al . 2003). Coupled atmosphere-ocean models have been used to simulate the relative roles of natural versus human-induced climate forcings in explaining the 20th century changes in global surface temperature c onstructed from instrumental records (Stott CLIMATE FORCINGS AND CLIMATE MODELS 103 et al. 2000, Ammann et al. 2003) (Figure 10-6). Although the di fferent model simulations use different specifications of the various natu ral and anthropogenic fo rcings and different parameterizations, the simulations are in agreem ent that anthropogenic forcing is the largest contributor to late 20th century warmth. Current climate models have been tuned to optimize their ability to simulate the present climate and exhibit a range of climate sensitiv ities associated with different treatments of processes such as those associ ated with clouds and snow a nd ice (Webb et al. 2006, Winton 2006). Some of these models have been compar ed against data for past time periods that encompass major changes in forcings and climate responses, for example, the Last Interglaciation (Kaspar et al. 2005, Otto-Bliesne r et al. 2006a) and the Last Glacial Maximum (Masson-Delmotte et al. 2006, Otto-Bliesner et al. 2006b). That these models' simulated climates for those epochs are consistent with proxy evidence lends credib ility to their use for attribution of 20th century climate change and projections of future climate change.

SOURCE: Ammann et al. (2003). 104 11 Large-Scale Multiproxy Re construction Techniques Using proxy evidence to study past climates helps us put the 20th century warming into a broader context, as well as to better understand the climate syst em and improve projections of future climate. The proxy climate records described in Chapters 3-8, which have been assembled and refined over a period of many decades , have been used to examine diverse aspects of climate history. Many of these studies have combined information fr om different proxy types to take advantage of the streng ths of, and minimize the limitations of, individual proxies. In the late 1990s, scientists began to use this met hodology for the specific purpose of estimating the variations in temperature over the last millennium, averaged at large (global and hemispheric) geographic scales. These large-scale multiproxy-based surface temperature reconstructions offer a quantitative assessment of large-scale surface te mperature variations. They generally fall into two categories: those that combine multiple reco rds of the same type of proxy (e.g., tree rings from various locations) and those that combine different types of records (e.g., tree rings together with documentary evidence, sediment record s, etc.). Large-scale surface temperature reconstructions based on multiproxy techniques ofte n have a time resolution as fine as decades or individual years; they also enab le researchers to estimate the stat istical uncertainties associated with the reconstruction technique, as described in Chapter 9. To improve spatial coverage, some reconstructions include proxies th at may be more sensitive to pr ecipitation than to temperature, in which case statistical techniques are used to in fer the temperature signal, exploiting the spatial relationship between temperature and precipitation. There are two general approaches that are commonly used to perform the calibration, validation, and reconstruction steps for large-s cale surface temperature re constructions. In the first approach, proxies are calibrated against tim e series of the domina nt patterns of spatial variability in the instrumental temperature record and the results are combined to obtain a time series of large-scale mean surface temperature. In the second approach, the individual proxy data are first composited, and this composite series is then calibrated directly against the time series of large-scale temperature variations. Both the number and the quality of the pr oxy records available for surface temperature reconstructions decrease dramatically from cen tury-to-century moving backward in time (see, e.g., Figure O-2). At present, fewer than 30 an nually resolved proxy time series extend farther back than A.D. 1000; relatively few of these are from the Southern Hemisphere and even fewer are from the tropics. Although fewer sites are re quired for defining long-term (e.g., century-to- century) variations in hemispheric mean temper ature than for short-term (e.g., year-to-year) variations (see Chapter 2), the coarse spatial samp ling limits our confidence in hemispheric mean or global mean temperature estimates prior to A.D. 1600 and makes it very difficult to generate meaningful quantitative estimates of global temperature variati ons prior to about A.D. 900. LARGE-SCALE MULTIPROXY RECO NSTRUCTION TECHNIQUES 105 Moreover, the instrumental record is shorter th an some of the features of interest in the preindustrial period (i.e., the exte nded period of sporadic warmth from A.D. 800 to 1300 and the subsequent Little Ice Age), so there are very fe w statistically independent pieces of information in the instrumental record for calibrating and validati ng long-term temperature reconstructions. EVOLUTION OF MULTIPROXY RECONSTRUCTION TECHNIQUES The first systematic, statistically based synt hesis of multiple climate proxies was carried out in 1998 by M.E. Mann, R.S. Bradley, a nd M.K. Hughes (Mann et al. 1998); their study focused on temperature for the last 600 years in the Northern Hemisphere. The analysis was later extended to cover the last 1,000 years (Mann et al. 1999), a nd the results were incorporated into the 2001 report of the In tergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2001). Later, Mann and Jones (2003) extended the multiproxy rec onstruction further back to cover the last 1,800 years (see Figure 10-4). On the basis of these reconstruc tions, it was concluded that temperatures gradually dropped fr om a relative maximum at a bout A.D. 1000 to a minimum at about 1850 and then increased shar ply through the 20th century. The graph illustrating the trend, often called the hockey stick curve (reproduced in Figure O-4), received wi de attention because it was interpreted by some people as definitive evidence of human-induced global warming. The ensuing debate in the scientific literature continue s even as this report goes to press (von Storch et al. 2006, Wahl et al. 2006). The Mann et al. large-scale su rface temperature reconstructions were the first to include explicit statistical error bars, wh ich provide an indication of the confidence that can be placed in the results. In the Mann et al . work, the error bars were relatively small back to about A.D. 1600, but much larger for A.D. 1000-1600. The lo wer precision during earlier times is caused primarily by the limited availabi lity of annually resolved paleoc limate data: That is, the farther back in time, the harder it is to find evidence that provides reliable annual information. For the period before about A.D. 900, annual data series are very few in number, and the non-annually resolved data used in reconstructions introduce additional uncertainties. Since the late 1990s, a number of alternative reconstructions have been generated using different statistical methods and proxy datase ts (Esper et al. 2002a,b et et al. Amman 2006; Hegerl et al. 2006; D'Arrigo et al. 2006). Figur e 11-1 shows the results of several of these efforts, some of which are described in additional de tail in the next section. Criticisms and Advances of Reconstruction Techniques There have been criticisms of the tec hniques used to create large-scale surface temperature reconstructions and, in particular, of the work done by Mann et al. (e.g., Zorita and von Storch 2001; McIntyre and McKitrick von Storch et al . 2004; Moberg et al. 2005). One criticism is related to the question of whether century-to-cent ury climate variations are underestimated in proxy records that have st rong year-to-year variab ility and consist of segments that have been spliced together to obtain a chronology l onger than any of the segments. Several research groups developed reconstruction methods to addre ss this problem. For instance, Esper et al. (2002) developed a tr ee-ring-based reconstruction that a ttempted to remove the bias 106 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS -1.2-1.0-0.8-0.6-0.4-0.20.00.20.40.6 900 1100 1300 1500 1700 1900Temperature anomaly (deg C) -1.2-1.0-0.8-0.6-0.4-0.20.00.20.40.6Multiproxy (Mann 2003) Multiproxy (Moberg et al. 2005) Multiproxy (Hegerl et al. 2006) Tree rings (Esper et al. 2002) FIGURE 11-1 Four different large-scale multipro xy- and tree-ring-based peri od A.D. 900-2005. See Figure O-5 fo r additional information on each data series. by using improved statistical methods explicitly designed to preser ve low-frequency variability. Moberg et al. (2005) separated annual records (tree rings) from smoot her (nonannual) records (such as ice borehole temperatur es and sediment based records) by using wavelet analysis. These studies indicate that the true amplitude of temperature va riations over the last 1,000-2,000 years may have been roughly twice as large as was previously proposed (see Figure 11-1), although their results differ in ge ographic emphasis and in the deta ils of the time sequence of the temperature changes. Von Stor ch et al. (2004) used a long-te rm climate model simulation to produce artificial proxy data a nd then compared reconstructions of hemispheric mean temperature with varying degrees of noise cont amination, and found that the full amplitude of century-to-century variations were underestimated to an increasi ng degree as the noise level was increased. Thus, the reconstruction of century-l ong trends has substantial uncertainty when it is based on data that exhibit year-to-year variability. A second area of criticism focuses on statistica l validation and robustn ess. McIntyre and McKitrick (2003, 2005a,b) question the choice and application of statistical methods, notably principal component analysis; th e metric used in the validati on step of the reconstruction exercise; and the selection of proxi es, especially the bristlecone pi ne data used in some of the original temperature reconstructi on studies. These and other critic isms, explored briefly in the remainder of this chapter, raised concerns th at led to new research and ongoing efforts to improve how surface temperature re constructions are performed. As part of their statistical methods, Mann et al. used a type of principal component analysis that tends to bias the shape of the recons tructions. A description of this effect is given in Chapter 9. In practice, this method, t hough not recommended, does not appear to unduly influence reconstructions of hemispheric mean temperature; reconstruc tions performed without using principal component analysis are qualitatively similar to th e original curves presented by Mann et al. (Crowley and Lowry 2000, Huybers 2005, D'Arrigo et al. 2006, Hegerl et al. 2006, LARGE-SCALE MULTIPROXY RECO NSTRUCTION TECHNIQUES 107 Wahl and Ammann in press). The more important aspect of this criticism is the issue of robustness with respect to the choi ce of proxies used in the recons truction. For periods prior to the 16th century, the Mann et al . (1999) reconstruction that us es this particular principal component analysis technique is strongly dependent on data from the Great Basin region in the western United States. Such issu es of robustness need to be take n into account in estimates of statistical uncertainties. Huybers (2005) and B\u00fcrger and Cubasch (2005) raise an additional concern that must be considered carefully in future research: There are many choices to be made in the statistical analysis of proxy data, and these choices influence the conclusi ons. Huybers (2005) recommends that to avoid ambiguity, simple av erages should be used rather than principal components when estimating spatial means. B\u00fcrger and Cubasch (2005) use several dozen statistical methods to generate examples of reco nstructions, and show that these reconstructions differ substantially even though they are based on the same data. Many of these issues can be decided by using the validation data to select among competing models and focusing on the prediction intervals associated with a recons truction (see Chapter 9). When the prediction intervals are taken into acc ount, the differences among compe ting reconstructions may be deemed small relative to th e large uncertainty of each individual estimate. Regarding metrics used in the validation step in the reconstruction exercise, two issues have been raised (McIntyre and McKitrick 2003, 2005a,b). One is that the choice of \"significance level\" for the reduction of error (R E) validation statistic is not appropriate. The other is that different statistics, specifically th e coefficient of efficiency (CE) and the squared correlation ( r2), should have been used (the various va lidation statistics are discussed in Chapter 9). Some of these criticisms are more relevant than others, but taken together, they are an important aspect of a more general finding of this committee, which is that uncertainties of the published reconstructions have been underestimated . Methods for evaluation of uncertainties are discussed in Chapter 9. Several recent research effort s have explored how the select ion of proxies affects surface temperature reconstructions. Os born and Briffa (2006) used an alterative approach based on 14 proxy records, most of which extend back to A.D. 800, taken from sites widely dispersed throughout the Northern Hemisphere . Instead of reconstructing temperatures, they chose proxy records that correlated well with local thermometers over the last 150 years (regardless of whether they show warming), smoothed and sta ndardized each record to have zero mean and unit standard deviation, and analyzed the excurs ions of the smoothed time series above or below selected thresholds (\u00b1 1 or 2 st andard deviations). The authors showed that the excursions on the warm side were largest in the 20th century and that the deviation index produced graphs similar to those from other research (F igure 11-2). Osborn and Briffa's method shifts the focus of the argument from the statistical methods used to rec onstruct temperature time series to the selection of proxy and site. The degree of spatial cohere nce shown by Osborn and Briffa (2006), together with other reconstructions, pr ovide supporting evidence for the statement that the warming during the late 20th century is more spatially co herent than during previous warm episodes back to at least A.D. 900 (see al so Bradley et al. 2003). 108 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS FIGURE 11-2 Upper panel: Fourteen temperature related proxy records selected on the basis of their correlation with the instrumental r ecord, as described by Osborn and Briffa (2006), filtered to remove variations on timescales less than 20 years and then normalized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation during the period A.D. 800-1995. Lower pane l: Fraction of records available in each year that have normalized values greater than zero (red line), great er than one (light red shading), greater than two (dark red shading), less than zero (blue line), less th an negative one (light blue shading), and less than negative two (dark blue shading), with the latter thre e series multiplied by -1 before plotting. SOURCE: Osborn and Briffa (2006). LARGE-SCALE MULTIPROXY RECO NSTRUCTION TECHNIQUES 109 The basic conclusion of Mann et al. (1998, 1999) was that the late 20th century warmth in the Northern Hemisphere was unprecedented during at least the last 1,000 years. This conclusion has subsequently been supported by an array of evidence that includes the additional large-scale surface temperature reconstructions and documentation of the spatial coherence of recent warming described above (Cook et al. 2004, Moberg et al. 2005, Rutherford et al. 2005, D'Arrigo et al. 2006, Osborn a nd Briffa 2006, Wahl and Amma nn in press), and also the pronounced changes in a variety of local proxy indicators described in previous chapters (e.g., Thompson et al. in press). Based on the analyses presented in the orig inal papers by Mann et al. and this newer supporting evidence, the committee finds it plausibl e that the Northern Hemisphere was warmer during the last few decades of the 20th century than during any comparable period over the preceding millennium. The substantial uncerta inties currently presen t in the quantitative assessment of large-scale surf ace temperature changes prior to about A.D. 1600 lower our confidence in this conclusion compared to the high level of confidence we place in the Little Ice Age cooling and 20th century warming. Even le ss confidence can be placed in the original conclusions by Mann et al. (1999) that \"the 1990s are likely the warmest decade, and 1998 the warmest year, in at least a millennium\" because the uncertainties inherent in temperature reconstructions for individual years and decades are larger than those for longer time periods, and because not all of the available proxies record temperature information on such short timescales. However, the methods in use are evolving and are e xpected to improve. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF LA RGE-SCALE SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIONS The committee identified the following key stre ngths of large-scale surface temperature reconstructions: Large-scale surface temperatur e reconstructions are based on proxy records that are meaningful recorders of environmental variable s. The connections be tween proxy records and environmental variables are well justified in terms of physical, chemical, and biological processes. Tree rings, the dominant data source in many reconstructions, are derived from regional networks with extensiv e replication, and they are a good indicator of environmental variables at the regional scale. Regional tree ri ng series are highly correl ated with measures of temperature and drought. These connections have a convincing biophysical basis related to tree physiology and growing-season climate. Temper ature dominates in some environments and precipitation in others, as is consistent with ecological expectations of limits to growth (Fritts 1976). The same general temperature trends emerge from different rec onstructions. Some reconstructions focus on temperat ure-dependent trees and use wood density measures (Briffa et al. 2002), others focus on temperature-dependent trees and use ring wi dths (D'Arrigo et al. 2006), and still others incorporat e extensive data from precipi tation-dependent trees and ice cores and use climate field correlations to deri ve temperature (Rutherf ord et al. 2005). One reconstruction does not use tree ri ng networks at all for century-scale and longer changes, but instead relies on a combination of geochemical and sedimentary proxies (Moberg et al. 2005). 110 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS Temperature records from about A.D. 1600 to the present derived from large-scale surface temperature reconstructions are consistent with other sources of temperature information for the period, including borehole temper atures and glacier length records. Prior to about 1600, information is spar ser and the pattern of change is not necessarily synchronous, but periods of medieval warmth are seen in a number of diverse records, including historical information from Eu rope and Asia; cave deposits; marine and lake sediments; and ice cores from Greenland, Ellesm ere Island, Tibet, and the equatorial Andes. Many challenges remain as research progres ses to use large-scale surface temperature reconstructions to learn about climate history (Hughes 2002, Rutherford et al. 2005, D'Arrigo et al. 2006). There are two major structural challe nges. First, the amount of high-quality proxy data available for analysis decreases markedly as one moves back in time. The great richness of tree ring network data available for 1700, for exampl e, is largely depleted by A.D. 1000. Large- scale temperature reconstructions should always be viewed as having a \"murky\" early period and a later period of relative clarity. The boundary between murkiness and clar ity is not precise but is nominally around A.D. 1600. Second, the finite length (about 150 years) of the instrumental temperature record available for calibration of large-sc ale temperature estimates places limits on efforts to demonstrate the accuracy of temperatur e reconstructions. Furt her research should be aimed at providing independent checks on reconstr uctions using borehole temperatures, glacier length records, and other proxies. The role of statistical methods is not trivial. Each indivi dual proxy provides a record of environmental change, but the process of combining these environmental signals into a large- scale spatially averaged temperat ure requires statistical evaluation. Even if a single proxy is a perfect recorder of the local environment, the question remains of whether the local environments are adequately or representatively sampling the large-scale temperature field. In addition, most proxy records lack the annual ch ronological precision found in tree ring data; the typical dating error might be 1-5 percent of the age of the sample for annually layered records such as lake varves and 5-10 percent for radi ometrically dated record s spanning the last 2,000 years. The committee identified the following limita tions of large-scale surface temperature reconstructions that would be nefit from further research: There are very few degrees of freedom in validations of the reconstructed temperature averaged over periods of decades an d longer. The validation metric (RE) used by Mann et al. (1998, 1999) is a minimum requirement, but the committee questions whether any single statistic can provide a definitive indi cation of the uncertainty inherent in the reconstruction. Demonstrating performan ce for the higher-frequency component (e.g., by calculating the CE statistic) woul d increase confidence but still w ould not fully address the issue of evaluating the reconstruction's ability to capture temperature variations on decadal-to- centennial timescales. Using proxies sensitive to hydrologic variab les (including moisture-sensitive trees and isotopes in tropical ice cores and speleothem s) to take advantage of observed correlations with surface temperature could lead to pr oblems and should be done only if the proxy- temperature relationship has climatologic justification. The observed discrepancy between some tree ring variables that are thought to be sensitive to temperature and the temperature ch anges observed in the la te 20th century (Jacoby MULTIPROXY RECO NSTRUCTION TECHNIQUES 111 1998) reduces confid ence that the correl ation between these proxies and temperature has been consistent over time. Future wo rk is needed to understand the cause of this \"divergence,\" which for now is cons idered unique to the 20th century and to areas north of 55\u00b0N (Cook et al. 2004). For tree ring chronolog ies, the process of removing biological trends from ring- width data potentially obscures informa tion on long-term changes in climate. Temperature reconstructions for period s before about A.D. 1600 are based on proxies from a limited number of geographic re gions, and some reconstr uctions are not robust with respect to the removal of proxy records from individual regions (see, e.g., Wahl and Ammann in press). Because the data are so lim ited, different large-scale reconstructions are sometimes based on the same datasets, and thus ca nnot be considered as completely independent. Reconstructions of low-frequency variations in the temperature record that make use of proxies other than tree rings (Moberg et al. 2005) are li mited by the small number of available records, by dating uncertainties, and by the sensitivity of many proxies to hydrologic variables as as to temperature. These data ga ps highlight the need for continued coordinated efforts to collect proxy data over broad geographic regions. Specifically concerning the reconstructed temper ature variability over short time periods (year-to-decade scale), the committee identified the following as limitations that would benefit from further research: Large-scale surface temperature reconstructi ons demonstrate very limited statistical skill (e.g., using the CE statistic) for proxy sets before the 19th century (Rutherford et al. 2005, Wahl and Ammann in press). Published informa tion, although limited, also suggests that these statistics are sensitive to the in clusion of small subsets of the da ta. Some of the more regionally focused reconstructions (D'Arrigo et al. 2006) have better demons trated skill back to the 16th century or so, and possibly earlier. To improve the skill of reconstructions, more data need to be collected and possibly new assi milation methods developed. Accurately inferring the absolute values of temperature for single years and decades from proxies sensitive to variability at this timescale requires accurate reconstruction of the longer-term mean. OVERALL FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS Based on its deliberations and the materials presented in Chapters 1-11 and elsewhere, the committee draws the following overall conclusi ons regarding large-scale surface temperature reconstructions for the last 2,000 years: The instrumentally measured warming of about 0.6\u00b0C during the 20th century is also reflected in borehole temperature measur ements, the retreat of glaciers, and other observational evidence, and can be simulated with climate models. Large-scale surface temperature reconstructi ons yield a generally consistent picture of temperature trends during the preceding millennium, including relatively warm conditions centered around A.D. 1000 (identif ied by some as the \"Medieval Warm Period\") and a relatively cold period (or \"Little Ice Age\") centered around 1700. The existen ce and extent of a Little Ice 112 SURFACE TEMPERATURE RECONSTRUCTIO NS FOR THE LAST 2,000 YEARS Age from roughly 1500 to 1850 is supported by a wide variety of evidence including ice cores, tree rings, borehole temperatures, glacier length r ecords, and historical documents. Evidence for regional warmth during medieval times can be found in a diverse but more limited set of records including ice cores, tree rings, marine sediments, and historical sources from Europe and Asia, but the exact timing and duration of warm periods may have varied from region to region, and the magnitude and geographic extent of the warmth are uncertain. It can be said with a high level of co nfidence that global me an surface temperature was higher during the last few decades of the 20th century than during any comparable period during the preceding four centuries. This stat ement is justified by the consistency of the evidence from a wide variety of geographically diverse proxies. Less confidence can be placed in large-scal e surface temperature reconstructions for the period from A.D. 900 to 1600. Presentl y available proxy evidence indicates that temperatures at many, but not all, individual loca tions were higher during th e past 25 years than during any period of comparable length since A. D. 900. The uncertainties associated with reconstructing hemispheric mean or global mean temperatures from these data increase substantially backward in time through this period and are not yet fully quantified. Very little confidence can be assigned to statements concerning the hemispheric mean or global mean surface temperature prior to about A.D. 900 because of sparse data coverage and because the uncertainties associat ed with proxy data and the methods used to analyze and combine them are larger than during more recent time periods. WHAT COMMENTS CAN BE MADE ON THE VALUE OF EXCHANGING INFORMATION AND DATA? The collection, compilation, and calibration of paleoclimatic data represent a substantial investment of time and resources, often by large teams of researchers. The committee recognizes that access to research data is a complicated, discipline-dependent issu e, and that access to computer models and methods is especially challenging because intellectual property rights must be considered. Our view is that all research benefits from full and open access to published datasets and that a clea r explanation of analytical methods is mandatory. Peers should have access to the information needed to reproduce publis hed results, so that increased confidence in the outcome of the study can be generated inside and outside the scientific community. Other committees and organizations have produced an extensive body of literature on the importance of open access to scientific data and on the related guidelines for data archiving and data access (e.g., NRC 1995). Paleoclimate research would be nefit if individual res earchers, professional societies, journal ed itors, and funding agencies c ontinued to improve their efforts to ensure that these existing open access practices are followed. Tree ring researchers have recognized the im portance of data archiving since 1974, when the International Tree Ring Data Bank was establishe d to serve as a permanent repository for tree ring data (measurements, chronologies, and derive d reconstructions). It s holdings are available online via the World Data Center for Paleoclimato logy, as are a number of other proxy data from ice cores, corals, boreholes, lake and ocean sedi ments, caves, and biological indicators. As proxy datasets become increasingly available on the Web, all researchers are given the opportunity to analyze data, test methods, and pr ovide their own interpretation of the existing evidence via recognized, peer-rev iewed scientific outlets. LARGE-SCALE MULTIPROXY RECO NSTRUCTION TECHNIQUES 113 WHAT MIGHT BE DONE TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF CLIMATE VARIATIONS OVER THE LAST 2,000 YEARS? Surface temperature reconstructions have the potential to further improve our knowledge of temperature variations over the last 2,000 year s, particularly if additional proxy evidence can be identified and obtained. Additional proxy da ta that record decadal-to-centennial climate changes, especially for the peri od A.D. 1-1600, would be particularly valuable. New data from the Southern Hemisphere, the tropics, and the oceans would improve our confidence in global temperature reconstructions,while additional data from regions that have already been sampled would help reduce the uncertainties associated wi th current reconstructio ns. In addition, many existing proxy records were collected decades a go and need to be updated in order to perform more reliable comparisons with instrumental reco rds. Better data cove rage would also make it possible to test whether or not past temperature changes had the same pattern as the warming during the last century. New methods, or more careful use of existing ones, may also help circumvent some of the existing limitations of large-scale surface temperature reconstructions based on multiple proxies. Each individual proxy provides a record of environmental change, but the process of combining thes e signals into a spatially averag ed temperature signal requires careful statistical evaluation. It might be possible to circumvent some of the limitations associated with these reconstructions by empl oying a number of complementary strategies in analyzing the proxy data, includi ng using them to constrain climate models, and by attempting to calibrate the proxy data against clim atic variables in different ways. Finally, some of the most important conse quences of climate change are linked to changes in precipitation, esp ecially the frequency and inte nsity of droughts and floods, as opposed to just temperature alone. Changes in regional circulation pattern s, snowfall, hurricane activity, and other climate elements over time are also of interest. Hence, it would be valuable to see both regional and large-scale reconstructions of changes in precipitation and other climate variables over the last 2,000 years, to complement those made for temperature. Efforts to improve the reliability of surface temperature rec onstructions also need to be complemented by efforts to improve our understandi ng of the forcings that have c ontributed to climate variability over the past 2,000 years. When analyzed in conjunction with historic al and archeological evidence, paleoclimatic reconstructions can also tell us how past societ ies adapted to climate changes. 114 References ACIA (Arctic Climate Impact Assessment). 2004.

Appendixes 135 A Statement of Task The committee will describe and assess the st ate of scientific efforts to reconstruct surface temperature records for the Earth over approximately the past 2,000 years. The committee will summarize current scientific information on the temperature record for the past two millennia, describe the main areas of uncertainty and how significant they are, describe the principal methodologies used and any problems with these appro aches, and explain how central the debate over the paleoclimate temperature record is to the state of scientific knowledge on global climate change. As part of this e ffort, the committee will address tasks such as: Describe the proxy records that have been used to estimate surface temperatures for the pre-instrumental period (e.g., tr ee rings, sediment cores, isotope s in water and ice, biological indicators, indicators from co ral formations, geological bore holes, historical accounts) and evaluate their limitations. Discuss how proxy data can be used to reconstruct surface temperature over different geographic regi ons and time periods. Assess the various methods employed to combine multiple proxy data to develop large-scale surface temperature reconstructions, the major assumptions associated with each approach, and the uncertainties as sociated with these methodologies. Comment on the overall accuracy and preci sion of such reconstructions, relevant data quality and access issues, and future research challenges. 136 B R Code for Figure 9-2 n <- 600; <- (j in 1:p) lwd = 2); 138 C Biosketches of Committee Members Gerald R.
