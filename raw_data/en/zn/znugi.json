This guide is not a substitute for reading the law and its regulations. State board and commission members who have further questions should contact their board chair or staff. The Ethics Act applies to all current and former executive branch public employees and members of statutorily created boards and commissions . Scope of Ethics Act (AS 39.52.110) Service on a state board or commission is a public trust. The Ethics Act prohibits substantial and material conflicts of interest. Further, board or commission members, and their immediate family, may not improperly benefit, financially or personally, from their actions as board or commission members. The Act does not, however, discourage independent pursuits, and it recognizes that minor and inconsequential conflicts of interest are unavoidable. Misuse of Official Position (AS 39.52.120) Members of boards or commissions may not use their positions for personal gain or to give an unwarranted benefit or treatment to any person. For example, board members may not: x use their official positions to secure employment or contracts; x accept compensation from anyone other than the State for performing official duties; x use State time, equipment, property or faci lities for their own personal or financial benefit or for partisan political purposes; x take or withhold official action on a matt er in which they have a personal or financial interest; or x coerce subordinates for their personal or financial benefit. x attempt to influence outcome of an administ rative hearing by privately contacting the hearing officer. Terry knew that a proposal that was before the board would harm Terry's business competitor. Instead of publicly disclosing the matter and requesting recusal, Terry voted on the proposal. Board member Mick has board staff employee Bob type an article for him that Mick hopes to sell to an Alaskan magazine. Bob types the article on State time. 11Improper Gifts (AS 39.52.130) A board member may not solicit or accept gifts if a person could reasonably infer from the circumstances that the gift is intended to influence the board member's action or judgment. \"Gifts\" include money, items of value, services, loans, trav el, entertainment, hospitality, and employment. All gifts from registered lobbyists are presumed to be improper, unless the giver is immediate family of the person receiving the gift. A gift worth more than $150 to a board member or the board member's immediate family must be reported within 30 days if: x the board member can take official action that can affect the giver, or x the gift is given to the board member because he or she is on a state board. The receipt of a gift worth less than $150 may be prohibited if a person could reasonably infer from the circumstances that the gift is intended to influence the board member's action or judgment. Receipt of such a gift should be disclosed. Any gift received from another government, regardless of value, must be reported; the board member will be advised as to the disposition of this gift. A form for reporting gifts is available at www.law.alaska.gov/doclibrary/ethics or from the board or commission staff. This restriction on gifts does not apply to lawful campaign contributions. The commission is reviewing Roy's proposal for an expansion of his business. Roy invites all the board members out to dinner at an expensive restaurant. He says it will be okay, since he isn't excluding any of the members. Jody receives a holiday gift every year from Sam. Jody was recently appointed to a state board, but Sam has no business that is before the board. Jody may accept the gift. Improper Use or Disclosure of Information (AS 39.52.140) No former or current member of a board may use or disclose any information acquired from participation on the board if that use or disclosure could result in a financial or personal benefit to the board member (or immediate family), unless that information has already been disseminated to the public. Board members are also prohibited from disclosing confidential information, unless authorized to do so. 12Sheila has been on the board for several years. She feels she has learned a great deal of general information about how to have a successful business venture. So she sets up her own business and does well. Delores has always advised and assisted the other doctors in her clinic on their continuing education requirements. After Delores is appointed to the medical board, she discloses this role to the board and continues to advise the doctors in her clinic. Jim reviews a confidential investigation report in a licensing matter. He discusses the practitioner's violation with a colleague who is not a board member. Improper Influence in State Grants, Contracts, Leases or Loans (AS 39.52.150) A board member, or immediate family, may not apply for, or have an interest in a State grant, contract, lease, or loan, if the board awards or takes action to administer the State grant, contract, lease, or loan. A board member (or immediate family) may apply for or be a party to a competitively solicited State grant, contract or lease, if the board as a body does not award or administer the grant, contract, or lease and so long as the board member does not take official action regarding the grant, contract, or lease. A board member (or immediate family) may apply for and receive a State loan that is generally available to the public and has fixed eligibility standards, so long as the board member does not take (or withhold) official action affecting the loan's award or administration. Board members must report to the board chair any personal or financial interest (or that of immediate family) in a State grant, contract, lease or loan that is awarded or administered by the agency the board member serves. A form for this purpose is available at www.law.alaska.gov/doclibrary/ethics or from the board or commission staff. John sits on a board that awards state grants. John hasn't seen his daughter for nearly ten years so he figures that it doesn't matter when her grant application comes up before the board. The board wants to contract out for an analysis of the board's decisions over the last ten years. Board member Kim would like the contract since she has been on the board for ten years and feels she could do a good job. 13Improper Representation (AS 39.52.160) A board or commission member may not represent, advise, or assist a person in matters pending before the board or commission for compensation A nonsalaried board or commission member may represent, advise, or assist in matters in which the member has an interest that is regulated by the member's own board or commission, if the member acts in accordance with AS 39.52.220 by disclosing the involvement in writing and on the public record, and refraining from all participation and voting on the matter. This section does not allow a board member to engage in any conduct that would violate a different section of the Ethics Act. Susan sits on the licensing board for her own profession. She will represent herself and her business partner in a licensing matter. She discloses this situation to the board and refrains from participation in the board's discussions and determinations regarding the matter. Restriction on Employment After Leaving State Service (AS 39.52.180) For two years after leaving a board, a former board member may not provide advice or work for compensation on any matter in which the former member personally and substantially participated while serving on the board. This prohibition applies to cases, proceedings, applications, contracts, legislative bills, regulations, and similar matters. This section does not prohibit a State agency from contracting directly with a former board member. With the approval of the Attorney General, the board chair may waive the above prohibition if a determination is made that the public interest is not jeopardized. Former members of the governing boards of public corporations and former members of boards and commissions that have regulation-adoption authority, except those covered by the centralized licensing provisions of AS 08.01, may not lobby for pay for one year. The board has arranged for an extensive study of the effects of the Department's programs. Andy, a board member, did most of the liaison work with the contractor selected by the board, including some negotiations about the scope of the study. Andy quits the board and goes to work for the contractor, working on the study of the effects of the Department's programs. Andy takes the job, but specifies that he will have to work on another project. Aiding a Violation Prohibited (AS 39.52.190) Aiding another public officer to violate the Ethics Act is prohibited. 14Agency Policies (AS 39.52.920) Subject to the Attorney General's review, a board may adopt additional written policies further limiting personal or financial interests of board members. Disclosure Procedures DECLARATION OF POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS BY MEMBERS OF BOARDS OR COMMISSIONS (AS 39.52.220) A board member whose interests or activities could result in a violation of the Ethics Act if the member participates in board action must disclose the matter on the public record and in writing to the board chair who determines whether a violation exists. A form for this purpose is available at www.law.alaska.gov/doclibrary/ethics or from the board or commission staff . If another board member objects to the chair's ruling or if the chair discloses a potential conflict, the board members at the meeting (excluding the involved member) vote on the matter. If the chair or the board determines a violation will occur, the member must refrain from deliberating, voting, or participating in the matter. For more information, see Ethics Act Procedures for Boards and Commissions available at the above noted web site. When determining whether a board member's involvement in a matter may violate the Ethics Act, either the chair or the board or commission itself may request guidance from the Attorney General. ATTORNEY GENERAL'S ADVICE (AS 39.52.240-250) A board chair or a board itself may request a written advisory opinion from the Attorney General interpreting the Ethics Act. A former board member may also request a written advice from the Attorney General. These opinions are confidential. Versions of opinions without identifying information may be made available to the public. REPORTS BY THIRD PARTIES (AS 39.52.230) A third party may report a suspected violation of the Ethics Act by a board member in writing and under oath to the chair of a board or commission. The chair will give a copy to the board member and to the Attorney General and review the report to determine whether a violation may or does exist. If the chair determines a violation exists, the board member will be asked to refrain from deliberating, voting, or participating in the matter. Complaints, Hearings, and Enforcement COMPLAINTS (AS 39.52.310-330) Any person may file a complaint with the Attorney General about the conduct of a current or former board member. Complaints must be written and signed under oath. The Attorney General may also initiate complaints based on information provided by a board. A copy of the complaint will be sent to the board member who is the subject of the complaint and to the Personnel Board. All complaints are reviewed by the Attorney General. If the Attorney General determines that the complaint does not warrant investigation, the complainant and the board member will be notified of 15the dismissal. The Attorney General may refer a complaint to the board member's chair for resolution. After investigation, the Attorney General may dismiss a complaint for lack of probable cause to believe a violation occurred or recommend corrective action. The complainant and board member will be promptly notified of this decision. Alternatively, if probable cause exists, the Attorney General may initiate a formal proceeding by serving the board or commission member with an accusation alleging a violation of the Ethics Act. Complaints or accusations may also be resolved by settlement with the subject. CONFIDENTIALITY (AS 39.52.340) Complaints and investigations prior to formal proceedings are confidential. If the Attorney General finds evidence of probable criminal activity, the appropriate law enforcement agency shall be notified. HEARINGS (AS 39.52.350-360) An accusation by the Attorney General of an alleged violation may result in a hearing. An administrative law judge from the state's Office of Administrative Hearings serves as hearing officer and determines the time, place and other matters. The parties to the proceeding are the Attorney General, acting as prosecutor, and the accused public officer, who may be represented by an attorney. Within 30 days after the hearing, the hearing officer files a report with the Personnel Board and provides a copy to the parties. PERSONNEL BOARD ACTION (AS 39.52.370) The Personnel Board reviews the hearing officer's report and is responsible for determining whether a violation occurred and for imposing penalties. An appeal may be filed by the board member in the Superior Court. PENALTIES (AS 39.52.410-460) When the Personnel Board determines a board member has violated the Ethics Act, it will order the member to refrain from voting, deliberating, or participating in the matter. The Personnel Board may also order restitution and may recommend that the board member be removed from the board or commission. If a recommendation of removal is made, the appointing authority will immediately remove the member. If the Personnel Board finds that a former board member violated the Ethics Act, it will issue a public statement about the case and will ask the Attorney General to pursue appropriate additional legal remedies. State grants, contracts, and leases awarded in violation of the Ethics Act are voidable. Loans given in violation of the Ethics Act may be made immediately payable. Fees, gifts, or compensation received in violation of the Ethics Act may be recovered by the Attorney General. 16The Personnel Board may impose a fine of up to $5,000 for each violation of the Ethics Act. In addition, a board member may be required to pay up to twice the financial benefit received in violation of the Ethics Act. Criminal penalties are in addition to the civil penalties listed above.

Ms. 68 Carrillo also added that the official letter from Dr. Schaber on behalf of the AKPhA regarding 69 white bagging had also been received and added to the Onboard packet for Agenda Item #10, but 70 was not reflected in the public version already pu blished. A slide deck from Melissa DeNoon with 71 the South Dakota PDMP was also added to correspondence for discussion around drug takeback 72 programs. 73 74 On a motion duly made by Lana Bell to appr ove the meeting agenda, seconded by Justin 75 Ruffridge, and approved unanimously, it was: 76 77 RESOLVED to accept the May 20, 2021 meeting agenda as written. 78 79 APPROVE DENY ABSTAIN ABSENT 80 Leif Holm x 81 Richard Holt x 82 Justin Ruffridge x 83 Lana Bell x 84 20 3 Alaska Board of Pharmacy May 20-21, 2021 Meeting T a m m y L i n d e m u t h x 85 J a m e s H e n d e r s o n x 86 S h a r o n L o n g x 87 88 The motion passed with no further discussion. 89 90 Agenda Item 3 Ethics Time: 9:09 a.m. 91 92 There were no ethics to report; however, Chair Holt reminded the board and the public that he 93 currently participates in the biweekly healthcare board chairs meeting as well as the biweekly 94 PDMP board chairs meeting. 95 96 Agenda Item 4 Review/Approve Meeting Minutes Time: 9:10 a.m. 97 98 The board reviewed the February 18 and 19, 2021 draft meeting minutes. 99 100 Sonia Lipker joined the room at 9:10 a.m. 101 Greg Francois joined the room at 9:11 a.m. 102 103 On a motion duly made by Lana Bell to appr ove the meeting agenda, seconded by Justin, 104 and approved unanimously, it was: 105 106 RESOLVED to approve the February 18 - 19 meeting minutes as written. 107 108 APPROVE DENY ABSTAIN ABSENT 109 Leif Holm x 110 Richard Holt x 111 Justin Ruffridge x 112 Lana Bell x 113 T a m m y L i n d e m u t h x 114 J a m e s H e n d e r s o n x 115 S h a r o n L o n g x 116 117 The motion passed with no further discussion. 118 119 TASK 1 120 Ms. Carrillo will send the minutes to Chair Holt fo r signature and request they be published to the 121 board's meeting page. 122 123 124 125 21 4 Alaska Board of Pharmacy May 20-21, 2021 Meeting Agenda Item 6 PDMP Update Time: 9:14 a.m. 126 127 James Henderson entered the room at 9:25 a.m. 128 129 PDMP - Pharmacy Report 130 Ms. Sherrell provided the board's report. Updates included the new contract with Appriss Health 131 starting on April 1st and the re-launch of the license integration project on June 15th. Ms. Sherrell 132 stated updates to the user manual would be posted soon, which will include instructions on new 133 features implemented as a result of the new contract. Ms. Sherrell reminded the board that the 134 license integration project will assess for di screpancies between the licensing system and the 135 PDMP platform, AWARxE, and will deactivate accounts where there are discrepancies with 136 license #s, license status, and name. New license types had been created during the pandemic, so 137 the file transfer list needs to be updated accordingly. According to the list now, there are about 138 156 pharmacists that would be deactivated. 139 140 As of now, there are 1,082 licensed pharmacist, 736 are registered, and only 716 are directly 141 dispensing. Ms. Sherrell explained the breakdown by role, e.g.: pharmacist, pharmacist-in-charge, 142 IHS dispenser, and VA dispenser. Ms. Sherrell then provided an update on delinquent reporters. 143 The April analysis revealed 17 pharmacies as being delinquent for the first time; letters were sent 144 to all and 10 had returned responses. 145 146 Ms. Sherrell reviewed recommendations to prescribing boards, such as using delegates to 147 maximize PDMP use and providing guidance to licensees on judicious prescribing practices and 148 dangerous combinations. The annual Awareness and Feedback questionnaire will be launched this 149 summer, which will help us understand apprehension of usage and provide insight into topics to 150 include in education and outreach. Ms. Sherrell shared that she participated in training with a 151 dentist who provided valuable feedback on their interactions with the PDMP; this provided an 152 opportunity to educate the provider on how to submit a UCF report and how to submit zero 153 reports. Ms. Sherrell stated that in-person education and outreach will start in Juneau with 154 pharmacies and expand to other providers throughout Alaska. Chair Holt expressed that in-person 155 is preferable and more effective, but that logistic ally, the state may not appr ove travel. Ms. Sherrell 156 stated there are rollover funds from the previous year to use for education and outreach travel 157 purposes. 158 159 Forthcoming updates to the system include a de linquent reporting communications module to 160 notify providers when they had missed a reporting day. Dr. Holm asked about the timeline of the 161 launch, expressing it will be helpful in reducing the number of missed days. Ms. Sherrell stated 162 there are some issues with reporting submission settings that may create false alarm flags of 163 delinquency. For example, a pharmacy may be re porting consistently at 10:00 p.m. and have a 164 system update that causes the report to transm it at 10:15 p.m., which would trigger a delinquent 165 notice. This was an issue with another rollout st ate that has since been corrected with another 166 state, but there was another issue with delivery language in messaging. 167 168 22 5 Alaska Board of Pharmacy May 20-21, 2021 Meeting It was also explained that clean-up with prescribing boards also needed to be done because 169 prescribers indicated on their renewals that they were directly dispensing (and therefore required 170 to report), when they weren't actually dispensing. The board of nursing sent a notice to its 171 licensees to clarify dispensing status, and nearly half of them indicated it was an inadvertent 172 mistake. Time is needed to clean up our dispenser/reporter list so those who are not truly 173 dispensing will not receive delinquent notices. 174 175 Ms. Gray expressed the report was informative and suggested similar reports be shared with other 176 boards and associations to facilitate connectedness of information. Ms. Sherrell stated there are 177 similar board reports issued to prescribing boards. 178 179 About the provider outlier module, Chair Holt inquired whether reports are sent to the provider 180 or to the board, to which Ms. Sherrell clarified it is visible administratively for analysis only. The 181 function will also include the ability to see distances traveled for medications, which may indicate 182 doctor shopping. 183 184 Resources 185 Ms. Carrillo provided a refresher of resources found on the state website, pdmp.alaska.gov , 186 including where to access the data dispensing submission form and a zero-reporting video. Ms. 187 Carrillo reminded the board that zero reporting ca n only be done via ClearingHouse and stated the 188 user manuals would be updated and posted soon to reflect add-ons as a result of the new contract. 189 190 Agenda Item 6 Investigative Update Time: 9:42 a.m. 191 192 Investigator Bowles presented the board's report which included activity from February 5th 193 through May 6th. There are 33 open cases and 4 have closed. 194 195 Investigator Bowles addressed the recusal document sent to board members and stated that in 196 cases where the matter may advance to a hearing, the board needs to make sure there is no 197 possibility of bias or sway by a reviewing board member for a proposed disciplinary action. Dr. 198 Holm inquired whether board members are allowed to be present for discussion, to which 199 Investigator Bowles affirmed. Chair Holt inquired whether it is an absolute requirement that 200 reviewing board members must recuse themselv es from voting because the document from 201 Director Chambers states it is still possible to vote. Chair Hol t's understanding is that the 202 reviewing board member can put on record to request to recuse themselves, but that as Chair, he 203 could decline the request. Investigator Bowles highly recommended recusals not be denied. Dr. 204 Ruffridge agreed, stating reviewing board members should be able to vote on a matter if they are 205 already providing a recommendation to the board. 206 207 On a motion duly made by Lana Bell in accord ance with AS 44.62.310(c)(2), seconded by 208 James Henderson and with unanimous approv al, the board moved to enter executive 209 session for the purpose of discussing subjects that tend to prejudice the reputation and 210 character of any person, provided the person may request a public discussion. 211 23 6 Alaska Board of Pharmacy May 20-21, 2021 Meeting RESOLVED to enter into

documents to Investigator 336 Bowles. 337 338 Agenda Item 7 DEA Update Time: 10:45 a.m. 339 340 Ms. Carrillo welcomed the DEA officials, Thomas Ol sen, tactical diversion group supervisor and 341 Samuel Curtis, Investigative Analyst. Agent Olsen stated agent Pitt was unable to make the 342 meeting. 343 344 Agent Olson shared that the Tactical Diversi on Squad, which has been in place since 2016, is 345 identifying problematic prescribing practices in a collaborative effort with the PDMP and division 346 investigators to combat the opioid epidemic. Over the years, the team has identified offenders 347 prescribing high amounts of opioids resulting in adverse outcomes within communities. 348 349 Samuel Curtis highlighted that in analyzing mechan isms by which practitioners write prescriptions, 350 they noticed a trend two years ago where doctors and nurses were writing large amounts of 351 prescriptions for 28 to 30-days at one time, sometimes for a 30 day-supply in 3 separate 352 prescriptions written in 90-day intervals, 4 t imes per year. More recently; however, Mr. Curtis 353 stated the trend has shifted: prescribers are moving away from high daily limits to smaller 354 prescriptions that pharmacies are comfortable fillin g. In many cases, practitioners are taking what 355 used to be 30-day prescriptions for oxycodone to now prescribing 40 days-supply within a 7-day 356 period. Now, prescriptions are often being filled 2 days early, for example, 7-day prescriptions are 357 being filled after 5 days. 358 359 Mr. Curtis also shared that in reviewing th e patterns from PDMP data, they are seeing 360 prescriptions written for varying quantities of days, e.g.: every 28 days, then 23, then 26, then 29, 361 then 30; quantities are continuously. The DEA notes that looking at the quantity of pills is not as 362 valuable anymore as providers seem to be doing the math on prescription days to add more 363 prescriptions. The DEA is also seeing more va riation in personal details given, for example, 364 variations of different names and different zi p codes to receive oxycodone and methadone. Mr. 365 Curtis expounded on this, offering the example that a prescriber will write a prescription for 366 methadone to Sam Curtis at Walmart using a street address and then write another prescription 367 for oxycodone for Samuel Curtis using the PO box address, which creates a channel for same-day 368 prescribing and patient pick-up before reporting systems are able to update these transactions for 369 visibility into the PDMP until the following day. These smaller prescriptions are ones that 370 pharmacists are comfortable filling without realiz ing there are more opioid pills being dispensed 371 over the course of a month. 372 373 27 10 Alaska Board of Pharmacy May 20-21, 2021 Meeting Dr. Holm commented he hadn't filled a methadone prescription in a long time and inquired when 374 this co-prescribing trend started. Mr. Curtis stated this has been an existing trend for some time, 375 that it used to be geographically concentrated in one area of Alaska but it is now more spread out. 376 Chair Holt inquired whether the DEA has presented similar updates to the practitioner boards, to 377 which Mr. Curtis stated they have been. Mr. Curtis stated the trend of breaking up prescriptions 378 into smaller day amounts to give patients higher quantities of opioids for a month is a more recent 379 trend seen in the last two months. Agent Olson st ated that as they have had success intervening 380 with the most egregious prescribers, other pres cribers engaging in problematic behaviors have 381 become more sophisticated; it seems there ha s been communication between the egregious 382 prescribers with other prescribers on how to continue these practices. Agent Olson stated some 383 prescriptions are being consumed and some are being sold on the street. 384 385 Dr. Ruffridge stated he has observed a more recent trend of the 7-day fill becoming a requirement 386 from insurance payers or they will not pay for a larger quantity without a prior authorization. Dr. 387 Ruffridge is concerned providers are writing 7-day fills to avoid prior authorization. Prior 388 authorization allows for review of medications commonly abused and the 7-day supply may avoid 389 this. From the payer perspective, Dr. Ruffridge stated that while the intent may be to help, payers 390 may not realize the burden being placed on the enforcement end and on the pharmacists 391 attempting to notice whether this is contributing to a concerning trend. Mr. Curtis stated this 392 trend isn't specific to one insurance program; it is seen across private payers, military, veteran, and 393 CMS programs. Regardless of practitioner or payer type, Mr. Curtis stated across programs, the 394 DEA is estimating that 30-day prescriptions every 28 days amounts to 13 months of prescriptions. 395 The DEA further estimates that up to 22-months of supply days are put into the hands of patients 396 each year with 7 days prescriptions being filled every 5 days. 397 398 Chair Holt also suggested to the DEA that th ey share updates with the AKPhA. Agent Olson 399 shared that they held a program, Practitioner Diversion Awareness Conference (PDAC) to 400 educate pharmacists on DEA trends in the past. The DEA plans to continue to provide this 401 opportunity to providers. Ms. Gray shared that the AKPhA's next annual conference will be held 402 on February 11-13, 2022, which would be a great opportunity to host a PDAC as the association 403 has hosted this program before. 404 405 Ms. Carrillo inquired whether these trends are reflect ive of what the DEA is seeing nationally or if 406 it is specific to Alaska. Mr. Curtis stated the trends are more specific to Alaska, both the co- 407 prescribing of oxycodone and methadone and the shortening of supply days. Data is showing the 408 DEA that these practices are originating from sp ecific geographic locations and are radiating out 409 from there to other providers. Mr. Curtis added these are providers that have been practicing in 410 the state for 20 or more years, so it is believed these practices are purposeful. 411 412 Ms. Carrillo also inquired whether the practices are intentionally done with a nefarious motive, or 413 if the issue is more on the patient drug seeking end. Agent Olson stated that based on the level of 414 awareness of the opioid epidemic, it is hard to imagine providers altering their prescribing 415 practices, including creating separate profiles, out of ignorance, that it is intentional. Mr. Curtis 416 28 11 Alaska Board of Pharmacy May 20-21, 2021 Meeting added that there seems to be conversations between patients and providers leading to mutual 417 decisions to receiving more prescriptions. 418 419 Dr. Holm stated he had to step out at 11:30 a.m. 420 421 Agenda Item 8 Public Comment #1 Time: 11:15 a.m. 422 423 There was nobody on the record for public comment. 424 425 Agenda Item 10 Board Business Time: 11:21 a.m. 426 427 With no public comment, the board moved to discussing board business. 428 429 Disciplinary matrix 430 Ms. Carrillo pointed to the disciplinary matrix precedence document put together by the Board of 431 Barbers and Hairdressers as a reference example for the board. Mr. Henderson had requested the 432 board discuss development of a matrix to help guide appropriate decision making for disciplinary 433 actions. As part of this request, Investigator Bowles provided to Ms. Carrillo a copy of more 434 recent disciplinary actions the board has taken. The board reviewed the precedence list. 435 436 Chair Holt agreed a disciplinary matrix would be useful, though recommended the board take a 437 little more time to review the decisions that were made. As there were different disciplinary actions 438 taken for the same violations, Chair Holt expressed a need to do a deeper dive into the precedence 439 list to understand the nuances of the cases as there appeared to be varying levels of egregiousness. 440 441 Chair Holt recommended that the board members review the precedence list and be prepared to 442 discuss what actions the board may want to add to the disciplinary matrix. Ms. Carrillo stated she 443 would compile a chart and tally the types of actions/reprimands most commonly issued. Chair 444 Hold noted the board had already established a matrix for PDMP-related violations and at some 445 point had established a standard violation for issues related to continuing education. Mr. 446 Henderson recalled this discussion, stating it was a dollar amount per hour of missed continuing 447 education activity. 448 449 TASK 3 450 Ms. Carrillo will create a draft matrix charting the most common types of reprimands on the 451 different types of violations for furthe r discussion at the September meeting. 452 453 TASK 4 454 Ms. Carrillo will look for the decision on fine am ounts per hour of missed continuing education 455 and will add it to the September meeting agenda. 456 457 Agenda Item 9 Lunch Time: 11:31 a.m. 458 459 29 12 Alaska Board of Pharmacy May 20-21, 2021 Meeting Off record for lunch at 11:31 a.m. 460 On record at 12:19 p.m. 461 462 Board members present, constituting a quorum: 463 464 Richard Holt, PharmD #PHAP2008, MBA - Chair 465 Leif Holm, PharmD #PHAP1606 - Vice Chair (joined at 2:07 p.m.) 466 Lana Bell, RPh #PHAP893 467 Tammy Lindemuth, Public Member (joined at 2:15 p.m.) 468 James Henderson, RPh #PHAP1683 (joined at 9:25 a.m.) 469 Justin Ruffridge, #PHAP1787 470 471 Upon return from lunch, Chair Holt shared the update that Ms. Noe was able to find the August 472 2017 meeting minutes reflecting the discussion of the fine amounts per missed hour of continuing 473 education. 474 475 Agenda Item 10 Board Business Time: 12:20 p.m. 476 477 Disciplinary matrix 478 Upon return from lunch, Chair Holt shared the update that Ms. Noe was able to find the August 479 2017 meeting minutes reflecting the discussion of the fine amounts per missed hour of continuing 480 education. Mr. Henderson inquired about the medical board and nursing board's matrices. Chair 481 Holt stated he was aware the medical board did have a PDMP and general practice matrix. 482 483 TASK 5 484 Ms. Carrillo will retrieve a copy of the Medical Board's matrix and will provide it to the board at 485 their next meeting in September. 486 487 Chair Holt shared that the New York licensing boards provide a website for the public to search 488 for disciplinary actions and asked the board of they were aware of any other states that publish 489 these. Ms. Carrillo screen shared how to access the disciplinary actions page, which isn't specific to 490 the Board of Pharmacy but includes any disciplin ary actions searchable by quarter. Ms. Carrillo 491 noted the New York search is interactiv e whereas the CBPL action page is not. 492 493 Inspections 494 Included in the OnBoard packet were items requested from the November, 2020 meeting. Chair 495 Holt recalled for the board that the investigat ive unit had stated f ew inspections per year is 496 reasonable cost-wise. The board reviewed the sample letter to pharmacies from the investigative 497 unit notifying them of the status of their inspec tion. A copy of the inspection template used to 498 assess compliance with established standards and protocols was also included in the packet for 499 review. Chair Holt advised that the board shou ld discuss what aspects the board wants the 500 investigator to focus on. 501 502 30 13 Alaska Board of Pharmacy May 20-21, 2021 Meeting Mr. Henderson inquired who the investigator wou ld be assigned to perform inspections. Chair 503 Holt asked for a volunteer from the board to partner with Investigator Bowles to engage in 504 training on inspection needs. Ms. Bell offered to train Mr. Bowles. 505 506 Chair Holt stated he had provided markups on the inspection template. 507 508 TASK 6 509 Ms. Bell will touch base with Investigator Bowles to review the inspection process. 510 511 TASK 7 512 Ms. Carrillo will locate the inspection template markups from Chair Holt and will incorporate it 513 into the September meeting materials. 514 515 TASK 8 516 All board members will be prepared to provide input on inspection report by the September 517 meeting. 518 519 On a motion duly made by Lana Bell in accord ance with AS 44.62.310(c)(2), seconded by 520 James Henderson and with unanimous approv al, the board moved to enter executive 521 session for the purpose of discussing subjects that tend to prejudice the reputation and 522 character of any person, provided the person may request a public discussion. 523 RESOLVED to enter into executive session in accordance with AS 44.62.310(c)(2). 524 525 APPROVE DENY ABSTAIN ABSENT 526 Leif Holm x 527 Richard Holt x 528 Justin Ruffridge x 529 Lana Bell x 530 Tammy Lindemuth x 531 J a m e s H e n d e r s o n x 532 S h a r o n L o n g x 533 534 The motion passed with no further discussion.

Lobbyi st, Caren Robinson, was also available to provide 669 updates: 670 671 Ms. Gray informed the board there was an inaugural leadership development event scheduled for 672 September 24th at the BP Energy Center and an AKPhA academy of health system pharmacy 673 seminar on September 25th. Ms. Gray added the association is currently accepting proposals for 674 presentations. Ms. Gray then addressed HB 145 , which proposed to expand pharmacy practice 675 authority will be rolled over to next session, though it was starting to be looked at as vehicle for 676 other legislation, primarily regarding CO VID-19, so was stalled in house rules. 677 678 Ms. Robinson expressed optimism for the expansion bill but reiterated that COVID-19 provisions 679 related to mandatory testing and vaccine passports were discussed and potentially weighed down 680 the bill. 681 682 Dr. Schaber introduced the issue of white bagging, which she indicated was brought to her 683 attention through ANMC as they were receiving requests from insurance companies to use this 684 process to purchase infusion medications. AKPhA has looked into this and realizes it is a more 685 widespread problem. White bagging is a process where an insurance company doesn't pay a 686 provider or insurance provider but uses a specialty pharmacy. Dr. Schaber highlighted the 687 problems this poses, including the inability of the patient's pharmacy to ensure adequate storage 688 and chain of custody to meet the FDA's Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) and negative 689 financial impacts to facilities. Another problematic process is with brown bagging where a patient 690 brings the medication to the infusion center for administration. A third issue, clear bagging is 691 when the health system's own specialty pharmacy delivers the medications directly to the clinic. 692 Chair Holt advised the board that if it wishes to seek changes statutorily, the board should be 693 prepared to make the recommendation. Dr. Schaber pointed out there are examples of recent state 694 legislation, which Ms. Carrillo had included in the board's packet. 695 696 DHSS - Medicaid 697 Ms. Carrillo noted to the board that Dr. Erin Nar us wasn't able to make the meeting but provided 698 an update by email: 699 700 - This upcoming Monday, May 24 at 1pm, the Division of Health Care Services will be 701 hosting a public scoping meeting related to regulations for the Medicaid Pharmacy Services 702 program. 703 - Dr. Charles Semling was also on the line to reiterate the importance of attending this 704 meeting. 705 706 Agenda Item 13 Budget Report/ Division Update Time: 2:34 p.m. 707 708 Deputy Director, Sharon Walsh, joined the room at 2:30 p.m. 709 35 18 Alaska Board of Pharmacy May 20-21, 2021 Meeting Deputy Director, Sharon Walsh, joined the board to present their Quarter 3 budget report. As of 710 March 31st, the board's total revenu e was at $996,647; non-investigat ive expenditures were at 711 $231,870, investigative expenditures were at $ 304,019; indirect expenditures (internal costs, 712 departmental costs, statewide costs such as IT) was $192,331; with the board's ending surplus of 713 $719,527. For the PDMP, Deputy Director Walsh shared that there were $166,915 in non- 714 investigative expenditures with an ending cumu lative surplus of $226,768. Chair Holt thanked 715 Deputy Director Walsh for the update and affirmed to the board they are on track financially. 716 717 Ms. Carrillo reminded the board that the fingerprin t fee will be looked at during the board's next 718 fee analysis as this fee wasn't figured into f ee changes when the new facility license types were 719 effective in October 2019. 720 721 TASK 13 722 Ms. Carrillo will follow-up on the fingerprint fees for wholesale drug distributors, outsourcing 723 facilities, and third-party logistics providers. 724 725 Deputy Director Walsh also provided an upda te on HB 145 and the PDMP exemption bill, HB91. 726 HB 145 was in the House Rules Committee and HB 91 didn't get referred out of House Labor 727 and Commerce. As session has ended and special se ssion is beginning, it is the expectation these 728 bills will be rolled over into the second session. 729 730 Agenda Item 10 Board Business Time: 2:45 p.m. 731 732 Hearing nothing further on division updates, Chair Holt prompted the board to return to the 733 board business agenda item. 734 735 Review Lost/Stolen Rx 736 The board reviewed the reports from Safeway Pharmacy #18118 and Safeway Pharmacy #1821. 737 738 Strategic Plan 739 Ms. Carrillo informed the board that she had taken Ms. Bell's draft document on guiding 740 principles, goals, and strategies and formatted it into a final version for 2021. Ms. Carrillo asked 741 the board for feedback and suggested edits, for which there were none. Ms. Carrillo stated there 742 would be a new 2022 strategic plan for the boa rd to review at their September meeting. 743 744 TASK 14 745 Ms. Carrillo will request a new page for the board's Strategic Plan to be created with the 2021 plan 746 uploaded to it. 747 748 TASK 15 749 Ms. Carrillo will work on the draft 2022 plan fo r review and discussion at the board's September 750 meeting. 751 752 36 19 Alaska Board of Pharmacy May 20-21, 2021 Meeting Annual Report 753 Ms. Carrillo provided the board with a dr aft of its 2021 Annual Report, due June 30th. Ms. Carrillo 754 pointed out new updates to the report, includin g SWOTs (strengths, opportunities, weaknesses, 755 and threats) created for licensing and PDMP purpos es to help illustrate barriers to progress in 756 achieving goals and objectives in these areas. 757 758 Ms. Carrillo stated the report was near done, wi th only the budgetary recommendations (travel) 759 left. Ms. Carrillo recalled in the 2020 report, travel was included for two board members to attend 760 a compounding conference, so stated she would pencil this into the report. Chair Holt also 761 requested to add budget recommendations for inspections as the board had determined, with 762 guidance from Chief Francois, that 15-20 inspections could be performed every two years. Dr. 763 Ruffridge recommended the NABP Annual Confer ence in Arizona from May 19 - 22, 2022 be 764 included. Ms. Carrillo also indicated she would pe ncil in a board member to attend the National 765 Drug Abuse and Heroin Summit \"Rx Summit\" from April 18 - 21, 2022. Ms. Sherrell also plans 766 to attend this summit with Ms. Carrillo using gran t-funds as it is a federally-required deliverable. 767 768 TASK 16 769 Ms. Carrillo will add in budgetary recommenda tions to the 2021 Annual Report for conference 770 travel and training, including the NABP annual report and district meetings, MPJE workshops, 771 compounding conferences, and the Rx Summit. 772 773 TASK 17 774 Ms. Carrillo will finalize the 2021 Annual Repor t and submit it to the board for review and 775 approval. 776 777 Board of Nursing Letter Update 778 Ms. Carrillo informed the board that the Board of Nursing met in the beginning of May but was 779 not able to review the board's letter addressing 12 AAC 44.440(c)(2). The Board of Nursing plans 780 to review this at their next meeting scheduled fo r August. Chair Holt commented that if the Board 781 of Nursing wishes to maintain the regulation, that the Board of Pharmacy may want to consider 782 regulation changes to clarify how pharmacists can manage identifier requirements on prescription 783 labels, for example, adding language stating APRN -issued prescriptions are valid as long as the 784 proper credentials are listed. 785 786 TASK 18 787 Ms. Carrillo will follow-up with the Board of Nursing on their plan to address the board's letter at 788 their next meeting in August. 789 790 Correspondence 791 The board reviewed a vaccine safety document from the FDA and correspondence from the 792 NABP on its Model Act, 503B survey, request for information to Vermont. Ms. Carrillo informed 793 the board she provided a response to the Vermont inquiry, sharing the Alaska Board of Pharmacy 794 does not require pharmacy technicians to be registered to work in 503B facilities. 795 37 20 Alaska Board of Pharmacy May 20-21, 2021 Meeting Additional correspondence for review included a slide deck from Melissa DeNoon with the South 796 Dakota PDMP. Ms. Carrillo explained she met with Ms. DeNoon and members of DHSS 797 OSMAP to discuss involvement in a compr/ehensive drug takeback program. Ms. Carrillo shared 798 that the SD PDMP wrote into their BJA grant applic ation funds to cover drug takeback activities. 799 The Alaska PDMP applied for the same grant, but did not request funds specifically to support 800 this activity; however, Ms. Carrillo explained OSMAP has separate funds to assist with this project. 801 Ms. Carrillo's understanding is the board doesn't ha ve specific statutory aut hority to regulate this, 802 but that pharmacies wanting to become designat ed takeback sites would amend their existing 803 DEA registration to seek \"Collector\" status and follow the DEA's regulations and guidelines. Ms. 804 Carrillo asked for interest from the board and whether there were concerns about liability, since 805 the responsibility of these receptacles would fall to the pharmacist-in-charge. 806 807 Ms. Carrillo also noted that in this meeting, it was the request of DHSS to gauge interest from 808 pharmacies through its ListServ. Chair Holt suggeste d first getting feedback from the department 809 of law as to whether the board can establish an approved mechanism for pharmacies to at least 810 notify the board they are engaging in takeback programs. Chair Holt believes it may be reasonable 811 that authority exists for the board to create a notification requirement through AS 08.80.030(d). 812 Dr. Ruffridge commented he has researched this extensively and that because it can be a complex 813 process, a good approach is to partner with local law enforcement agencies because their rules 814 aren't the same as pharmacies. Ms. Carrillo added that the law enforcement collaboration was also 815 suggested by Ms. DeNoon. 816 817 TASK 19 818 Ms. Carrillo will request legal guidance on whether the board can require pharmacies to notify 819 them if they are engaged in drug takeback programs. 820 821 Board nominations 822 Chair Holt then moved to nominations, reminding the board that his last on the board will be on 823 June 30th. Dr. Holm offered his vote of confidence for Dr. Ruffridge to take on the roll of board 824 chair. 825 826 On a motion duly made by Lana Bell to no minate Justin Ruffridge as board chair and 827 approved unanimously, it was: 828 829 RESOLVED to nominate Justin Ru ffridge as the board chair. 830 831 APPROVE DENY ABSTAIN ABSENT 832 Leif Holm x 833 Richard Holt x 834 Justin Ruffridge x 835 Lana Bell x 836 Tammy Lindemuth x 837 38 21 Alaska Board of Pharmacy May 20-21, 2021 Meeting James Henderson x 838 S h a r o n L o n g x 839 840 The motion passed with no further discussion. 841 842 Dr. Holm, Ms. Bell, and Ms. Lindemuth would remain as vice chair, secretary, and chair of the 843 CSAC, respectively. 844 845 Agenda Item 11 Work Groups/Sub committee Updates Time: 3:28 p.m. 846 847 COVID-19 board chairs 848 Chair Holt reminded the board the COVID-19 chairs meeting is continuing to occur biweekly, 849 though it has become more of a general meeting for board chairs during legislative session.

Ms. Carrillo 856 inquired when a copy of the meeting minutes would be posted as the last published meeting 857 minutes are from 2018. Ms. Lindemuth stated she wrote the minutes and inquired how to post 858 them. Ms. Carrillo recalled that the legislation ch anging the chair of the CSAC being a Department 859 of Law designee to the Board of Pharmacy's chair or chair's designee was the only change; any 860 administrative duties, including writing meeting minutes, is to be retained within DOL. 861 862 TASK 20 863 Ms. Carrillo will follow-up on expecta tions for CSAC administrative duties. 864 865 Compounding 866 Dr. Holm stated he and Dr. Ruffridge have not been able to meet. 867 868 PDMP board chairs 869 Chairs from the boards with PDMP requirements continue to meet biweekly.

At present, the only authorized reason is for the purpose of providing 899 COVID-19 immunizations, which went into effect on November 6, 2020. Ms. Carrillo clarified 900 that these aren't tied to an emergency declaratio n as it is in the board's emergency preparedness 901 regulations. Dr. Ruffridge recommended rounding it out at the end of the fiscal year. Mr. 902 Henderson inquired how many licenses were used fo r this purpose, to which Ms. Carrillo stated 903 there were 12 issued to pharmacists and 6 to technicians, but whether they were actually used is 904 unknown. 905 906 On a motion duly made by Justin Ruffridg e to cease courtesy license application 907 approvals related to COVID-19 immunization s beginning June 30, 2021, seconded by 908 Tammy Lindemuth and approved unanimously, it was: 909 910 RESOLVED to end issuance of courtesy licenses for the purpose of providing 911 COVID-19 vaccinations on June 30, 2021. 912 913 APPROVE DENY ABSTAIN ABSENT 914 Leif Holm x 915 Richard Holt x 916 Justin Ruffridge x 917 Lana Bell x 918 Tammy Lindemuth x 919 James Henderson x 920 S h a r o n L o n g x 921 922 40 23 Alaska Board of Pharmacy May 20-21, 2021 Meeting The motion passed with no further discussion. 923 924 TASK 21 925 Ms. Carrillo will update the board's Authorized Emergency Courtesy License Activities document 926 to provide an end date and will request to take down the courtesy license application on June 30. 927 928 Task list review 929 The board reviewed the task list. Dr. Ruffridge stated he is about a quarter of the way through 930 looking at the board's FAQs to determine which need to be removed and which can be made into 931 position statements. 932 933 A brief discussion was had between Chair Holt and Dr. Ruffridge on drafting regulation changes. 934 Chair Holt shared it is helpful to draft regulations in a format as close to drafting format as 935 possible. Ms. Carrillo stated it has been past practice to append agreed upon regulatory changes to 936 the minutes. Dr. Ruffridge inquired whether it's possible to append markups to the most current 937 version of the published statutes and regulations booklet. 938 939 TASK 22 940 Ms. Carrillo will inquire with the regulations speciali st whether it is possible to include most recent 941 regulatory markups in published statutes and regulations. 942 943 Upcoming travel/conference/workshops 944 The following events are upcoming: 945 946 MPJE Review Committee (not stat e-specific) - June 1 - 11, 2021 947 Program Review and Training (staff only) - June 15, 2021 948 949 Task 23 950 Ms. Carrillo will plan to attend the staff NABP training on June 15th. 951 952 Agenda Item 15 Public Co mment #2 Time: 4:00 p.m. 953 954 Ms. Sherrell inquired about the use of medication disposal bags in the PDMP education and 955 outreach plan, asking for input on whether it would be helpful to send bags to pharmacies for 956 distribution to their patients and if there was a sp ecific brand that was most effective. Chair Holt 957 agreed it would be useful, adding that if there was a bag available for ever y prescription, he would 958 provide one. Chair Holt suggested either Dettera or DisposeRx. Dr. Ruffridge added that he 959 received a grant for 1,500 Mallinckrodt disposal bags several years ago and it was well received in 960 the community. Pharmacist, Dan Nelson shared that Alaska Native Medical Center (ANMC) 961 previously received a large stock of Deterra disposal bags, which were handed out for some time 962 and especially helpful in rural areas.

The board has not implemented a 10 feet rule as of yet but automated dispensing kiosks 1092 regulations are in draft form and will be discussed in the future. 1093 1094 Agenda Item 5 Legal Opinion Updates Time: 9:26 a.m. 1095 1096 AAG Weigand joined the room at 9:32 a.m. 1097 Expedited partner therapy 1098 The board reviewed guidance on issuing expedited partner therapy. Ultimately, pharmacists are 1099 still required to obtain the patient's information prior to dispensing medication, which would 1100 include partners; without this information, the prescription order cannot legally be filled. DOL 1101 suggests the board amend 12 AAC 52.460 to exempt partner information from being obtained for 1102 partner therapies. Dr. Ruffridge expressed concern about patient safety and instead suggested a 1103 new regulation section on partner therapy so the board can address allergies, contraindications, 1104 and other verbiage to address standards for patient safety. 1105 1106 Negative implication canon 1107 This topic is in follow-up to the board's Febru ary meeting. Dr. Ruffridge inquired how applicable 1108 this canon is in all measures of statute and regu lation projects because it doesn't seem most people 1109 are aware of this and that there are significant implications. In testimony for HB 145, for example, 1110 medical providers felt strongly that language was added to ensure limitations were placed on 1111 pharmacist prescribing, though Dr. Ruffridge's opinion is that it's not necessary to specify what is 1112 limited. AAG Weigand stated the canon is always applicable; when statements are affirmatively 1113 provided in a list, this means other areas not included in the list are automatically excluded. AAG 1114 Weigand added that one way we can avoid implications of this canon are to make a non-inclusive 1115 list, e.g.: \"including\", which already means including but not limited to; they are only providing 1116 examples. 1117 1118 Medication management of out-of-state pharmacies 1119 The board reviewed the guidance from DOL, which provides that out-of-state pharmacies cannot 1120 engage in telepharmacy services because a telepharmacy system can only be used by central and 1121 remote pharmacies under direct supervision of a pharmacist located in Alaska. Chair Holt 1122 recommended that statutory changes be made to regulate telepharmacies, much in the same way 1123 the board would need to seek legislative change to know what Internet pharmacies are providing 1124 services to Alaska. Chair Holt reminded the board that Alaska only registers non-resident 1125 pharmacies, which limits the board's ability to enforce and discipline. It has been the board's 1126 interest to seek legislative change to license rather than register these pharmacies. 1127 1128 Chair Holt also recommended clarifying in statute or regulation what activities constitute 1129 telepharmacy services. Mr. Henderson agreed with these changes as it would provide much needed 1130 clarity to the board. Ms. Lindemuth also expressed that legislative change would be ideal; with tele- 1131 services growing, the board should be statutor ily prepared to address concerns and avoid any 1132 loopholes that might otherwise be present. Ms. Ca rrillo suggested these items could possibly be 1133 rolled into HB 145 for second session. Ms. Gray commented there is a telehealth bill, SB78, which 1134 45 28 Alaska Board of Pharmacy May 20-21, 2021 Meeting could also include telepharmacy services next session. Ms. Gary also informed the board of 1135 Governor-introduced SB93 and HB13 for a payer healthcare database under the Division of 1136 Insurance, adding these may also be vehicles to introduce telepharmacy legislation. 1137 1138 Chair Holt stated if it is the will of the board to seek changes through a Governor's bill, language 1139 would need to be prepared by July. Chair Holt added that it would be timely to also update the 1140 definition of \"drug\" to include compressed gasses and blood banks through legislative change. 1141 1142 Medicolegal investigative access 1143 Ms. Carrillo addressed medical/coroner's access to PDMP information. Guidance was previously 1144 provided clarifying medicolegal investigators with in the M/CO office can also have acess to the 1145 data. At present, access is through direct login credentials. The basis of the follow-up on this 1146 guidance is to determine whether a subpoena is required since other investigator, for example, 1147 CBPL and DEA investigators, must submit a subpoena. 1148 1149 Chair Holt called for a brief break. 1150 1151 Off record at 10:55 a.m. 1152 On record at 11:08 a.m. 1153 1154 Upon return from record, it was clarified Ms. Lindemuth would be out for the rest of the meeting. 1155 1156 Collaborative practice agreements 1157 The board reviewed the guidance on approval of collaborative practice agreements through the 1158 board's executive administrator (EA). As writte n, 12 AAC 52.240 doesn't allow the EA to approve 1159 these; however, if this section was amended to create a checklist of required items and if the EA 1160 regulation, 12 AAC 52.993, was amended to add approval of these agreements, the board's 1161 preference to administratively approve these would be met, rather than requiring full board 1162 approval as per the State Medical Board's co rresponding regulations in 12 AAC 40.983(k). Ms. 1163 Carrillo added that later on in the agenda, th ere will be further discussion on a proposed 1164 collaborative agreement join approval process with the Medical Board. 1165 1166 Agenda Item 6 Regulations Update Time: 11:02 a.m. 1167 1168 x 12 AAC 52.990 - Display of licenses - The board discussed this and landed on the 1169 following amendment: \"A licensee shall retain all licenses, certifications, registrations, or 1170 permits in the practice site. This documentation shall be made available to the board, law 1171 enforcement, or inspector upon request. The division's licensing website printout 1172 confirming active credentials is acceptable in lieu of a printed document.\" 1173 x 12 AAC 52 (new) - Drug and device expiration date on labels - Chair Holt inquired if the 1174 board would be interested in mandating expiration dates are on labels, which Dr. Ruffridge 1175 agreed would be beneficial for patient safety. Mr. Henderson's thought was that most 1176 pharmacies already indicate the expiration date on their label, to which Chair Holt stated 1177 46 29 Alaska Board of Pharmacy May 20-21, 2021 Meeting was standard practice for some pharmacies but not might be for all. Chair Holt confirmed 1178 it is standard in some pharmacies but can't speak to all others. Dr. Ruffridge stated the 1179 FDA's 1979 law sets expiration dates and reco mmended the board could consider adding a 1180 separate expiration dates for unit dosed medication packs, which should have a much 1181 shorter expiration date than the one year. 1182 1183 TASK 24 1184 Chair Holt will put language together addressi ng expiration dates into 12 AAC 52.480 for the 1185 board's consideration at their next meeting in September. 1186 1187 x 12 AAC 52 (New) - Facility standards for equi pment and supplies - \"all pharmacies have in 1188 their possession the equipment and supplies necessary to engage in the practice of 1189 pharmacy relevant to the pharmacy services offered. The equipment is in good repair and is 1190 available in sufficient quantity to meet the needs of the practice of pharmacy conducted 1191 therein. 1192 x 12 AAC 52 (New) - Inspections - the board re viewed Chair Holt's suggested language for 1193 inspections, which included language requirin g that for pharmacies in which findings are 1194 discovered during the inspection process, the discrepancies will need to be addressed 1195 within a certain timeframe. Ms. Bell suggested suggesting giving pharmacies and facilities 1196 90 days to correct the issues or submit a corrective action plan. Mr. Henderson inquired 1197 whether this would be enough time and recommended the plan be approved by the board. 1198 1199 To clarify this applies to pharmacies and facilities located in the state and authorized CBPL 1200 investigators to perform inspections, Ms. Carrillo suggested amending this to read, \"A 1201 wholesale drug distributor, pharmacy, drug room, or remote pharmacy located in this state 1202 shall permit an authorized investigator assigned to the board, who shows proper 1203 identification, to enter and inspect the facili ty at reasonable times and in a reasonable 1204 manner, and to inspect the pharmacy or facility's record and written operating procedures. 1205 Ms. Carrillo inquired about the chain of even ts, for example, whether the inspection report 1206 with findings needs to be reviewed by the board before being notified they must address 1207 the discrepancies or if the pharmacy/facility can simply receive the findings, correct them, 1208 then notify the board or investigator that th ey have been corrected. Ms. Bell envisioned the 1209 investigator would identify the discrepancies and the pharmacy/facility would submit a 1210 correct action plan. Ms. Bell inquired whether there should be a penalty for discrepancies. 1211 1212 Mr. Henderson also inquired whether the inspector would then need to go out and verify 1213 the pharmacy/facility did in fact correct the discrepancies, suggesting we may need to 1214 institute a fee if the investigator is expected to perform a subsequent review. Dr. Ruffridge 1215 believes 30 days is more appropriate and th at the inspector should not go back out a 2nd 1216 time for the pharmacy/facility to prove that corrections were made. Instead, Dr. Ruffridge 1217 states simply acknowledging th at corrections is needed would be sufficient, but that if 1218 pharmacies/facilities show up as deficient mu ltiple times, the board could assess a fine. 1219 47 30 Alaska Board of Pharmacy May 20-21, 2021 Meeting Chair Holt suggested requiring a notification form so there is a record of acknowledging 1220 the discrepancy. 1221 1222 Dr. Ruffridge believes the board is financially solvent to provide inspection services using 1223 its surplus without implementing a separate insp ection fee, but agreed an analysis would be 1224 useful. Chair Holt recalled investigations had indicated 10 - 15 inspections per year was 1225 doable, adding previous investigator, Mr. Howes had been doing these. Ms. Carrillo 1226 inquired whether inspections were done in the Anchorage and surrounding areas or if 1227 travel was involved, which might increase the cost. 1228 1229 TASK 25 1230 Ms. Carrillo will create a draft notification form acknowledging discrepancies of an inspection and 1231 will present it to the board at their September meeting. 1232 1233 TASK 26 1234 Ms. Carrillo will look into the cost of the inspections if the board were to do 10-15 inspections 1235 and will add this into the board's annual report. 1236 1237 Agenda Item 7 Lunch Time: 12:01 p.m. 1238 1239 Chair Holt called for lunch at 12:01p.m. 1240 Back on record at 1:04 p.m. 1241 1242 Board members present, constituting a quorum: 1243 1244 Richard Holt, PharmD #PHAP2008, MBA - Chair Bell, Lisa Sherrell, PDMP Manager 1253 Heather Noe, Occupational Licensing Examiner 1254 Bethany Carlile, Occupational Licensing Examiner 1255 1256 Agenda Item 8 PDMP Registration (May 6, 2021) 1259 Ms. Carrillo reviewed the changes to 12 AAC 52.855 re garding registration, which went into effect 1260 on May 6th and now requires providers to register with the PDMP within 30 days of meeting the 1261 mandatory registration requirement. The amendment also includes a requirement for non- 1262 48 31 Alaska Board of Pharmacy May 20-21, 2021 Meeting dispensing pharmacists to submit a dispensation exemption form within 30 days of licensure if the 1263 pharmacist does not plan to dispense controlled substances in the state. update to the registration 1264 regulations, which went into effect on May 6th for all licensees required to register with the PDMP. 1265 Add to disciplinary matrix. 1266 1267 Renewal and notifications 1268 The board previously discussed additional changes to PDMP regulations during its February 1269 meeting and had left off on discussing language re lated to the registration process. The board 1270 discussed use of secure email accounts and ultimately landed on \"non-shared email address\" to 1271 align with existing the existing end user lang uage agreement (EULA). The board also previously 1272 addressed the need to include language regarding delegates and renewal, as both exist but are not 1273 codified. 1274 1275 Ms. Carrillo provided draft language, including a sect ion on notifying the board within 10 days of a 1276 change in dispensing or distributing status by pharmacies and pharmacists. Chair Holt inquired 1277 whether the intent is to assist in reporting comp liance clean-up. Ms. Carrillo recalled that during 1278 the previous meeting, Ms. Bell inquired whether pharmacies can report when they are no longer 1279 dispensing or distributing controlled substances. Pr esently, the main opportunity is every two years 1280 at renewal, though licensees could notify us in writing at any time. Ms. Carrillo added that when 1281 pharmacy reporting analyses started in January and Ms. Sherrell was following up with pharmacies 1282 receiving a notice of delinquency, several pharmacies had responded they were 1283 dispensing/distributing at the time of their renewal but had since stopped. This notification would 1284 assist in timely and more accurate status capture of dispensing/distributing and avoid sending 1285 notices to licensees where reporting doesn't ap ply. Ms. Carrillo added that the 10 days was 1286 suggested because there is also a 10-day PIC change timeframe. 1287 1288 Chair Holt further inquired whether receipt of thes e notices will prompt removal of the licensee 1289 from the PDMP. Ms. Carrillo stated pharmacists would be removed if they are no longer 1290 dispensing. Ms. Sherrell clarified we would also manually remove pharmacies from Compliance 1291 Reporting in AWARxE as license integration won' t automatically deactiva te these accounts. Ms. 1292 Carrillo commented that if a similar integrati on project between the compliance function in 1293 AWARxE and the dispensing/DEA designations in Portal was implemented, it would be helpful 1294 and worth pursuing in the feature. 1295 1296 Regarding delegate access, Chair Holt inquired about the process for this and whether a form is 1297 required. Ms. Sherrell clarified that delegates aren't required to pay or submit a form; as long as the 1298 delegate is regulated under AS 08 and at least one supervising provider has approved their 1299 account, admin will approve the delegate to have access. Mr. Henderson inquired whether the 1300 board wished to clarify the role of delegates among all provider types, including veterinarians, 1301 nurses, doctors, etc. Ms. Carrillo suggested a se parate regulations section on delegates might be 1302 appropriate; providers have expressed a desire to appoint a delegate for the purpose of that 1303 delegate reviewing how a provider's treatment prac tices aligns with their institutional prescribing 1304 practices; however, quality review isn't the intent of delegate access. Ms. Carrillo stated the intent 1305 49 32 Alaska Board of Pharmacy May 20-21, 2021 Meeting is for delegates to review and report for patients they are involved in a treating relationship with 1306 under the supervision of their practitioner. Dr. Ruffridge commented a new section may not be 1307 necessary since delegates are able to have the same abilities as the supervising provider. It was 1308 ultimately decided not to create a separate section for delegate access at this time. 1309 1310 Supply day exemptions to reviewing and reporting 1311 Ms. Carrillo addressed AS 17.30.200(k)(A), inquiring whether it is the intent for any supply day to 1312 be exempt from being reviewed in these scenarios as these are not tied specifically to any supply 1313 day as is (B). Chair Holt stated it would be appropriate to defer to prescribing boards as to what 1314 supply days don't have to be reviewed. Ms. Sherrell added that we have in the past referred 1315 licensees to their prescribing boards, but the bo ards did not know either. Ms. Carrillo added that 1316 (B) implies any non-refillable prescription intended to last more than 3 days must be reviewed. 1317 1318 Ms. Carrillo addressed AS 17.30.200(t), also inquiring whether a (1)(A)(B) constitutes exempted 1319 reporting for any supply day. Ms. Carrillo also asked the board if their understanding of (2)(A)(B) 1320 means that providers working in inpatient pharmacies or emergency departments must comply 1321 with the reporting requirement if the outpatient supply is for more than 24 hours. Dr. Ruffridge 1322 stated there typically aren't instances where i npatient pharmacies dispense more than a 24-hour 1323 supply because they are prepackaged. The board agreed emergency providers issuing any 1324 prescription more than a 24-hour supply is to be reported. 1325 1326 TASK 27 1327 Ms. Carrillo will clarify with the prescrib ing board chairs that AS 17.30.200(t) requires 1328 prescriptions written for more than a 24-hour supply to be reported. 1329 1330 On a motion duly made by Justin Ruffridge to approve the PDMP regulations as 1331 discussed for cursory review by the Departme nt of Law, seconded by Rich Holt, and 1332 approved unanimously, it was: 1333 1334 RESOLVED to accept the proposed PDMP regulation amendments for cursory 1335 review by the Department of Law. 1336 1337 APPROVE DENY ABSTAIN ABSENT 1338 x 1341 Lana Bell x 1342 T a m m y L i n d e m u t h x 1343 James Henderson x 1344 S h a r o n L o n g x 1345 1346 The motion passed with no further discussion. 1347 50 33 Alaska Board of Pharmacy May 20-21, 2021 Meeting 1348 1349 12 AAC 52.855. Registration with the prescription drug monitoring program controlled substance 1350 prescription database. (a) A prescriber shall register with the prescription drug monitoring program's 1351 controlled substance prescription database (PDMP) not later than 30 days after the date of initial 1352 licensure or the date of registration with th e federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), 1353 whichever is later. 1354 (b) A licensed pharmacist practicing in this st ate shall register with the PDMP. Registration 1355 must be completed not later than 30 days after in itial licensure if the pharmacist's practice is 1356 expected to involve dispensing a schedule II, III, or IV controlled substance under federal law. If not 1357 dispensing in this state, a pharmacist shall submit , not later than 30 days after initial licensure, a 1358 PDMP dispensation exemption form provided by the board. A pharmacist who submitted a 1359 dispensation exemption form shall register with the PDMP before dispensing a schedule II, III, or IV 1360 controlled substance under federal law in this state. 1361 (c) Except as provided in (a) of this section, before dispensing, prescribing, or administering a 1362 schedule II, III, or IV controlled substance under federal law, a pharmacist or practitioner required to 1363 register with the PDMP must 1364 (1) register online on the PDMP [WEBSITE; by B. password; 1367 C . u s e r r o l e ; 1368 D. healthcare specialty; 1369 51 34 Alaska Board of Pharmacy May 20-21, 2021 Meeting E. the drug enforcement administration (DEA) number issued to the 1370 prescriber, or if a pharmacist, the employer's DEA; and 1371 (2) pay the fee established in 12 AAC 02.107. 1372 (d) After completing the registration requiremen ts, a pharmacist or practitioner required to 1373 register with the PDMP will be issued a [U SER ACCOUNT, LOGIN NAME, AND PASSWORD BY THE 1374 DEPARTMENT] registration number . 1375 (e) A pharmacist or practitioner required to register with the PDMP must access information 1376 in the PDMP using the [USER ACCOUNT, LOGIN NAME, AND PASSWORD ISSUED BY THE 1377 DEPARTMENT] credentials created in (c)(1)(A)(B) of this section . 1378 (f) A pharmacist or practitioner required to register with the PDMP may access information in 1379 the PDMP using another registrant's credentials only as authorized by a contract executed by the 1380 department for the purposes of AS 47.05.270.

As a recap, the board 1430 previously defined \"continuous delinquency\" as pharmacies appearing in subsequent quarterly 1431 delinquent pharmacy analysis lists as well as pharmacies who have been notified of their 1432 delinquencies but have not attempted to respond to the notice or attempted to correct the data. 1433 1434 It was recommended the board revisit their complian ce analysis as the primary limitations are that 1435 analytics functions only display a 30-day lookback period and the system doesn't display when a 1436 pharmacy has since submitted missed data or correct ed errored data. Another issue discovered is 1437 that the system only allows admin to enter a st atic date for running delinquency reports; it was 1438 previously believed that the date entered would dis play all the pharmacies flagged as delinquent for 1439 every day up until that date; however, the result s actually display pharmacies that were delinquent 1440 on a specific date. PDMP staff have asked Appriss to add the ability to enter dynamic timeframes 1441 as opposed to one single date. 1442 1443 Ms. Sherrell stated that in most cases, pharmac ies don't just appear on the list once; pharmacies 1444 typically are delinquent for many days. Ms. Sher rell added that the communications reporting 1445 module will likely resolve delinquencies, to which Dr. Holm agreed. 1446 54 37 Alaska Board of Pharmacy May 20-21, 2021 Meeting Ms. Carrillo stated that in light of the new in formation on limitations wi th monitoring and not 1447 knowing whether any data has since been corrected , she did not yet forward the 50 or so potential 1448 delinquent pharmacies to the Investigations Unit during the April analysis. The 17 pharmacies 1449 who appeared as delinquent for the first time were notified and Ms. Sherrell has been in follow-up. 1450 Ms. Sherrell reiterated that th e problem isn't that we can't forward potential non-compliance 1451 matters to Investigations, it's that PDMP staff wouldn't be able to confirm whether any of the 1452 pharmacies had since corrected the data without al locating a significant amount of datamining 1453 work. Notices that missing data has since been su bmitted is not a feature of the current system; 1454 there is no automation to inform staff of when the data has been corrected. Chair Holt and Dr. 1455 Ruffridge expressed frustration and disbelief in these limitations. Ms. Carrillo shared Appriss is 1456 aware of the limitations and are finding ways to strategize solutions. Dr. Ruffridge stated there 1457 should be a way for pharmacies to easily login and see a green checkmark when a submission has 1458 been successfully reported. 1459 1460 Ms. Carrillo commented the board may need to amend its disciplinary matrix if it is agreed that 1461 analysis of compliance should change from quarterly to monthly. As included in the 1462 recommendations document, Ms. Carrillo shared th at simplifying the non-compliance criteria by 1463 grouping licensees into dichotomous categories (w as a report submitted? yes/no) would help align 1464 with system capabilities, though it may be unpo pular because this approach doesn't take into 1465 account the egregiousness of the missing data; rather, it categorizes pharmacies into a box of 1466 whether or not they missed one day of reporting, regardless of how many prescriptions were not 1467 reported, what types of drugs were not reported, and what the schedules were. 1468 1469 The board continued to discuss the issues. Ms. Sh errell suggested the reports would need to be 1470 run daily and then on a monthly basis, all the pharmacies who ever appeared as delinquent on at 1471 least one day would be forwarded to the Investig ative Unit. Mr. Henderson inquired if it would 1472 matter if the pharmacy fixed the data the next day, to which Ms. Sherrell stated they would still be 1473 non-compliant for missing the reporting day. Dr. Ruffridge added that within the disciplinary 1474 matrix, the part about responding to the notice\u2014whether through contacting the office or 1475 correcting the data\u2014would need to be removed. Chair Holt suggested requesting guidance from 1476 DOL on whether we can require pharmacies to respond to notices of delinquency. Ms. Carrillo 1477 stated a certified mail letter is an offici al way to provide notice to licensees. 1478 1479 Ms. Bell inquired about what other boards have done to address reporting non-compliance. Ms. 1480 Carrillo explained they are beginning to track licensees required to report but have not yet defined 1481 non-compliance parameters. Ms. Carrillo commented that as the board of pharmacy smooths out 1482 their process, it can be shared with the prescrib ing boards. Dr. Ruffridge asked if other prescribing 1483 boards have to analyze their data, to which Ms. Sher rell and Ms. Carrillo stated they don't; it is just 1484 them, but that the bulk of the work will be upfr ont and it should get smoother as more providers 1485 become compliant and boards establish their own processes. The board discussed when to start 1486 the new daily running of reports for monthly referrals. Ms. Carrillo stated that since licensees were 1487 made aware of the board's quarterly analysis plan in September, a similar notice should be sent 1488 informing licensees of the new process. Ms. Sherre ll suggested a do-over would be appropriate if 1489 55 38 Alaska Board of Pharmacy May 20-21, 2021 Meeting new criteria for delinquency is being establishe d. Chair Holt recommended that for the first 1490 month, licensees are notified they are missing data , and that in subsequent months, licensees will 1491 be referred to the investigative unit. The board di scussed that the fine would be imposed only in 1492 subsequent appearances as a delinquent reporter. 1493 1494 TASK 29 1495 Ms. Carrillo will update the board's PDMP disciplinar y matrix to reflect daily tracking of reporting 1496 compliance for monthly referrals to the Investigative Unit. 1497 1498 TASK 30 1499 Laura will draft letter of new plan and will send the notice to the board for review/approval with 1500 the aim to mail it out on June 1st. 1501 1502 Agenda Item 9 Potential Statute Changes Time: 3:30 p.m. 1503 1504 White bagging 1505 The board returned to discussion of white bagging, which was a topic presented by Dr. Schaber 1506 on day 1. Chair Holt clarified it would require a st atute change. Ms. Carrillo commented it may be 1507 a legislative change with division of insurance under Title 21. Chair Holt encouraged the board to 1508 think about the different avenues of pursuing this: seeking support in the next 2 months for a 1509 proposal as a Governor's bill; to work with th e association to add onto HB145 in the second 1510 session; or to act independently as a board to find its own sponsors. Chair Holt stated that if it is 1511 the will of the board to try to seek the Governor's support, that a meeting within the next 30-45 1512 days would be ideal. 1513 1514 Ms. Carrillo asked for clarification on brown bagging, to which Dr. Schaber stated is when 1515 medication is shipped to the patient, and the patien t then goes to the hospital to have prescription 1516 administered there. Dr. Schaber added that this is commonly seen in infusion pharmacies. Mr. 1517 Henderson inquired whether white bagging and brown bagging is the same. Dr. Schaber clarified 1518 that this is when a payer requires the hospital to purchase from a specific specialty pharmacy and 1519 then ships that to the hospital for administrati on to the patient. White bagging is distinguished 1520 from brown bagging in that only the latter involves direct shipment to the patient. 1521 1522 Chair Holt recommended the board review other state' s legislation. Included in the board's packet 1523 were an ASHP slide deck from April 2021including examples of state legislation. Dr. Schaber 1524 stated Texas and Virginia had passed legislation, so it would be most us eful to look at their 1525 language. 1526 1527 Outstanding statute project 1528 Chair Holt reviewed the board's pending legislativ e changes the board has previously discussed 1529 but as potential amendments but not yet officially approved to move forward. Among these topics 1530 are requirements related to affida vits of moral character, licensing versus registration of out-of- 1531 56 39 Alaska Board of Pharmacy May 20-21, 2021 Meeting state pharmacies, prohibiting the use of the te rm \"apothecary\" by unlicensed pharmacies, and 1532 automated dispensing machines. 1533 1534 Agenda Item 6 Regulations Update Time: 3:58 p.m. 1535 1536 Ms. Carrillo reviewed the cooperative practice im provement plan she developed with Natalie 1537 Norberg, EA for the State Medical Board. The bo ard of pharmacy had developed its own process 1538 for reviewing and approving these applications b ecause the medical board hadn't been approving 1539 them; however, the Medical Board recently revisi ted this topic and wishes to become more 1540 involved. The improvement plan outlines how coop erative practice agreements relates to HB 145 1541 and a plan for next administrative steps. As part of next steps, Ms. Carrillo provided a markup of 1542 the board's collaborative practice regulation s in 12 AAC 52.240, which strikes most of the 1543 language because it is not necessary to verbat im have what the Medical Board has in their 1544 cooperative practice agreement regulations in 12 AAC 40.983. Ms. Carrillo also created form 1545 markups to merge the board of pharmacy's form and the medical board's form. 1546 1547 Ms. Carrillo explained that the idea is the State Medical Board would have primary approval of the 1548 cooperative practice agreement application, and once approved, it would be forwarded to the 1549 board of pharmacy to be endorsed by the EA. The hope is that this would also be another avenue 1550 to avoid full-board approval as previously described in day 1. 1551 1552 Chair Holt cautioned that the language may only relate to medical board licensees, but that most 1553 of the agreement applications are coming fr om Board of Nursing licensees. Ms. Carrillo 1554 acknowledged this, stating she recently reignite d cooperative/collaborati ve practice agreements 1555 with the prescribing boards since the language stat es it involves providers with the authority to 1556 prescribe rather than specifying the type of healthcare provider. 1557 1558 Ms. Bell inquired whether pharmacists from IH S facilities can participate in collaborative 1559 relationships without seeking board approval. Ms. Bell was asked by an IHS-employed pharmacist 1560 about this and didn't believe approval was requi red. Chair Holt recalled previous discussions on 1561 what requirements the board could hold licen sees to who were employed by the HIS. 1562 1563 TASK 31 1564 Ms. Carrillo will follow up with EA Norberg on the Medical Board's discussion of the joint 1565 cooperative practice agreement plan. 1566 1567 TASK 32 1568 Ms. Carrillo will follow-up with the Board of Nurs ing, Board of Dental Examiners, and Board of 1569 Examiners in Optometry on their intent to pu rsue similar cooperative practice agreement 1570 regulations. Ms. Carrillo will provide an update at the September meeting. 1571 1572 TASK 33 1573 57 40 Alaska Board of Pharmacy May 20-21, 2021 Meeting Ms. Bell will provide language to Ms. Carrillo on a potential request to DOL regarding IHS 1574 pharmacists and collaborati ve practice agreements. 1575 1576 Agenda Item 13 Public Comment #4 Time: 4:00 p.m. 1577 1578 Lorri Walmsley inquired on what the board's legislativ e priorities are, and if it includes technician 1579 immunizations. Chair Holt stated these were addressed via emergency preparedness regulations. 1580 1581 Agenda Item 11 Farewell Chair Holt/Upc oming 4:10 p.m 1582 1583 Farewell Dr. Holt 1584 Day 2 of this meeting marks Chair Holt's last m eeting day after several productive years on the 1585 board. Ms. Carrillo thanked Dr. Holt for his commit ment to the board and expressed gratitude for 1586 how knowledgeable, accessible, de dicated, and proactive he has been for the board and pharmacy 1587 profession. Ms. Bell, Mr. Henderson, and Dr. Ru ffridge expressed their thanks with similar 1588 sentiments that he has been an exceptional chair and will be sorely missed. 1589 1590 Chair Holt expressed his gratitude for the opportunit y to serve on the board, adding it has been a 1591 wonderful experience. Chair Holt expressed he would still participate when he can through 1592 providing comment on regulations, maybe eventually returning to Alaska. 1593 1594 Next meeting dates 1595 September 23 - 24th - Anchorage 1596 November 18 - 19th - Anchorage 1597 February 17-18 - Juneau 1598 1599 TASK 34 1600 Ms. Carrillo will submit travel requests for the September and November meetings in Anchorage 1601 and February 2022 meeting in Juneau. 4:28 On a motion duly made by Lana Bell, seconded by James Henderson, and approved unanimously 1606 to adjourn the meeting, the meet ing was adjourned at 4:28 p.m. 1607 1608 1609 Ruffridge, Chair 581 Alaska Board of Pharmacy August 12, 2021 Meeting State of Alaska 1 Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development 2 Division of Corporations, Business and Professional Licensing 3 4 Alaska Board of Pharmacy 5 6 DRAFT MINUTES OF THE EMERGENCY MEETING 7 8 August 12, 2021 Videoconference 9 10 By authority of AS 08.01.070(2), and in compliance with the provisions of AS 44.62, 11 Article 6, a scheduled meeting of the Board of Pharmacy via videoconference on 12 August 12, 2021.

US Food and Drug Administration Hello, The FDA Intergovernmental Affairs team would like to bring to your attention that today, FDA's Acting FDA Commissioner, Janet Woodcock, M.D. and Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Research and Evaluation, issued thefollowing statement. FDA will follow the science on COVID-19 vaccines for young children 192The following is attributed to Acting FDA Commissioner, Janet Woodcock, M.D. and Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Research and Evaluation As schools around the country are re-opening for in-person learning and families are returning to their busy school year schedules, we know many parents are anxious about the pandemic andprotecting their children. Many parents have questions about COVID-19 and when vaccines willbe available for children younger than 12 years of age. Many of our team at the FDA are parents and grandparents themselves, and our team shares the same concerns as many in our country about protecting our loved ones from COVID-19. Weare therefore also eager to see COVID-19 vaccines available for young children. We also knowthat we all share the interest in making sure this process is done with safety at top of mind. Asregulators, we recognize we have an important task ahead of us that will require us to act expeditiously while undertaking an extremely meticulous and thoughtful review once we receiverequests to authorize a COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use or submissions for approval of a COVID-19 vaccine for this population. We know there have been questions and public commentary on the process surrounding vaccines for young children, so we think it's important to share information about the processand the necessary considerations involved to provide greater clarity to the public about thiseffort. It's important that the public recognize that, because young children are still growing and developing, it's critical that thorough and robust clinical trials of adequate size are completed toevaluate the safety and the immune response to a COVID-19 vaccine in this population. Childrenare not small adults - and issues that may be addressed in pediatric vaccine trials can includewhether there is a need for different doses or different strength formulations of vaccines alreadyused for adults. Steps the FDA will take to ensure the safety and efficacy of these products for children: First, vaccine manufacturers have reported that the necessary clinical trials involving children as participants are currently underway. Some have stated that they are stillenrolling, and some are still administering doses or following participants. This process isexpected to include a follow-up period of at least about two months, to allow for propersafety monitoring following the administration of vaccine doses for at least half of theclinical trial vaccine recipients. Once the manufacturers complete the relevant portion of their clinical trials, they have tocomplete the analysis of the data from the studies to understand how safe the vaccine isand how well it works in the clinical trial participants. The FDA will work closely with eachmanufacturer to ensure this data analysis is robust and meets regulatory standards. Aftermanufacturers analyze their clinical trial data, they will compile the information and mayrequest an emergency use authorization (EUA) or submit for approval a biologics licenseapplication (BLA), as appropriate, for this young population to the FDA. When a completed request for EUA or approval has been received by the FDA, theagency will carefully, thoroughly and independently examine the data to evaluate benefitsand risks and be prepared to complete its review as quickly as possible, likely in a matter of weeks rather than months. However, the agency's ability to review these submissions 193rapidly will depend in part on the quality and timeliness of the submissions by manufacturers. Just like every vaccine decision we've made during this pandemic, our evaluation of data on the use of COVID-19 vaccines in children will not cut any corners. Conducting clinical trials to determine an appropriate vaccine dose in children requires additional work over that done in theadult studies, including ensuring that the vaccine dosage and formulation strength used is the appropriate one from the perspective of safety and generating an immune response. Our multi- disciplinary teams of doctors, scientists, statisticians and other experts will thoroughly assessthis complex data in making any determination about COVID-19 vaccines in young children. Wemay also consult with our Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee on any questions that warrant a public discussion by external experts. Importantly, once a decision to authorize or approve a vaccine for a younger population has been made, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will meet todiscuss further clinical recommendations. Parents may be wondering if they can ask their health care providers to go ahead and vaccinate their kids using one of the currently available vaccines outside of the FDA-authorized orapproved uses. Parents need to remember that the vaccine doses that are currently being studied in younger children are not necessarily the same vaccine doses that were authorized forindividuals 12 years and older or approved for individuals 16 years of age and older\u2014there are different dosing regimens being investigated. It is important for the clinical trials to be completedbefore vaccinating young kids, so the FDA's team can conduct a thorough evaluation and ensure the data show that the vaccine under consideration is likely to work to prevent COVID-19 in young children and doesn't cause unexpected safety issues separate from those that havealready been observed in adolescents and adults. Just like you, we are eager to see our children and grandchildren vaccinated against COVID-19 as soon as possible. We have to let the science and data guide us. The FDA is working aroundthe clock to support the process for making COVID-19 vaccines available for children. Asoutlined above, this process is complex and relies on robust manufacturer trials and data, andwhile we cannot offer a specific date or timeline for when it may be completed for the variousmanufacturers' vaccine candidates, we can assure the public we are working as expeditiously aspossible to meet this critical public health need and we very much hope to have pediatricCOVID-19 vaccines available in the coming months. Until we authorize or approve a vaccine for this younger population, it's especially important thatparents and others who interact closely with children under 12 years of age get vaccinated, wearmasks, and follow other recommended precautions so that we can protect those who cannot yetprotect themselves through vaccination.

The 9thamendment provides liability immunity to and expands the scope of authority for licensed pharmacists to order and administer COVID-19 therapeutics to populations authorized by the FDA. In addition, the amendment also authorizes pharmacy technicians and pharmacy interns to admini ster COVID-19 therapeutics when certain criteria are met. The attached fact sheet contai ns additional details about the 9thamendment. If you have any questions, please contact me at jbolin@nabp.pharmacy . cc: NABP Executive Committee Lemrey \"Al\" Carter, - PUBLIC Expanding Access to COVID-19 Therapeutics HHS PREP Act Declaration: 9thAmendment COMMITMENT TO ENDING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC Saving Lives. Protecting Americans. www.PHE.govCLASSIFICATION - PUBLIC Throughout the COVID-19 response, the federal governme nt has remained steadfast in providing support to states and territories as part of the whole-of-Ame rica approach to fighting the pandemic. The Biden administration remains committed to developing safe and effective therapeutics against the COVID-19 virus and making these drugs accessible across the country. To support this priority effort, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) amended the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act declaration to provide liability protection to licensed pharmacists, pharmacy technicians , and pharmacy interns . By expanding PREP Act coverage to include these trained professionals for the administration of covered COVID-19 therapeutics, we are providing a pathway for increased access to COVID-19 therapeutics, particularly in surge states with rising numbers of CO VID-19 cases and in rural areas where access to inpatient and outpatient services may be more limited. COVID-19 PREP ACT DECLARATION What is the Impact on SLTTs? The PREP Act and Declaration preempt stat e requirements, such as more limited licensing or scope of practice requirements, that effectively prohibit a qualified person from prescribing, dispensing, or administering COVID-19 therapeutics. Requirements that do not effectively prohibit qualified pe rsons, such as additional training, are not preempted. Ultimately, states and territories may choose which qualified persons to use for administering COVID-19 ther apeutics in their jurisdiction.The PREP Act allows the Secretary of the U.S. Depa rtment of Health and Human Services (HHS) to issue a declaration that extends liability protections to en tities and individuals who manufacture, distribute, or administer covered medical countermeasures against a public health threat or emergency. In March 2020, the Secretary issued a PREP Act Declaration covering COVID-19 tests, drugs, and vaccines providing liability protections to manufacturers, dist ributors, SLTTs, licensed healthcare professionals, and others identified by the Secretary (qualified pe rsons) who administer COVID-19 countermeasures. What is a PREP Act Declaration? 9/8/2021For more information on the COVID-19 PR EP Act Declaration, please visit: phe.gov 197CLASSIFICATION - PUBLIC QUALIFIED PERSONS PREP Act Declaration 9thAmendment - Who's Covered? The 9thamendment to the COVID-19 PREP Act Declaration provides liability immunity to and expands the scope of authority for licensed pharmacists to order and administer select COVID-19 therapeutics to populations authorized by the FDA and for pharmacy technicians and pharmacy interns to administer COVID-19 therapeutics to populations authorized by the FDA when the following criteria are meet: For more information on the COVID-19 PR EP Act Declaration, please visit: phe.govThe COVID-19 therapeutic must be authorized, approved, licensed, or cleared by the FDA. In the case of a licensed pharmacist ordering a COVID-19 therapeutic, the therapeutic must be: oordered for subcutaneous, intramuscular, or oral administration and oin accordance with the FDA approval, au thorization, clearance, or licensing. In the case of licensed pharmacists, qualified pharmac y technicians, and licensed or registered pharmacy interns administering the COVID-19 therapeutic, the therapeutic must be: administered subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or orally in accordance with the FDA approval, authorization, clearance, or licensing. In the case of qualified pharmacy technicians, the su pervising pharmacist must be readily and immediately available to the qualified pharmacy technician. In the case of COVID-19 therapeutics administered through intramuscular or subcutaneous injections, the licensed pharmacist, licensed or re gistered pharmacy intern and qualified pharmacy technician must complete a practical training program that is approv ed by the ACPE. This training program must include: ohands-on injection technique, oclinical evaluation of indications and contraindications of COVID-19 therapeutics, othe recognition and treatment of emergency reactions to COVID-19 therapeutics, and oany additional training required in the FDA appr oval, authorization, clearance, or licensing. The licensed pharmacist, licensed or registered pharmacy intern and qualified pharmacy technician must have a current certificate in basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

FDA Warnings and Recalls FDA is informing health care providers, health care facility risk managers, and procurement staff to immediately stop using and discard all ultrasound gels andlotions manufactured by Eco-Med Pharmaceutical, Inc., due to risk of bacterial contamination with Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc). Products manufactured by Eco-Med are distributed by a number of distributors under various product names,including MediChoice Ultrasound Gel distributed by both Owens & Minor and MacMedical Supply Co., Inc. ( See full list here ). 200Eco-Med initiated a voluntary recall on Aug. 4, 2021, to stop use of EcoGel 200 Ultrasound Gel due to risk of bacterial contamination. However, the FDA has determinedthat all ultrasound gels and lotions manufactured by Eco-Med are at risk for bacterial contamination. The FDA's determination is based on concerns that the company did notcomplete its investigation of the issues, the root cause and extent of bacterialcontamination was not identified, and multiple products could be affected bymanufacturing issues associated with the company's ultrasound gel (such as inappropriatetesting of finished product, inadequate testing of raw materials, and a lack ofenvironmental controls).

The Board of Pharmacy recognizes the recent increase of patients receiving prescriptions for the anti-parasitic drug, Ivermectin, to treat COVID-19. The board also recognizes the challenging position our frontline pharmacists are facing in advising patients regarding this treatment, recommending alternatives, and consulting with prescribers. The board continues to support pharmacists in exercising their independent professional judgment and approaching each patient/prescriber scenario individually. FAQs: Q1. If a patient receives a prescription for ivermectin, am I obligated to fill it? A1. If, after assessing for the patient's severity of illness, underlying con dition(s), drug interaction(s), and other considerations to determine the appropriateness of treatment, the pharmacist may c hoose to fill this pr escription, but is not obligated to. Pharmacists are encouraged to seriously consider the AMA, APhA, and ASHP 's position to \"strongly oppose the ordering, prescribing, or dispensing of ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID-19 outside of a clinical trial. \" Q2. Can I contact the practitioner to discuss a patient's ivermectin prescription? A2. Yes. Pharmacists are encouraged to co ntact or attempt to contact the practitioner to discuss appropriateness of treating the patient with ivermectin. Q3. What is an appropriate response to patients expecting their prescription to be dispensed? A3. The following are all appropriate examples: x Inform the patient ivermectin is not FDA approved, it is not supported by the AMA, APhA, and ASHP, and that there is insufficient data to support its use as a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19. x Recommend an alternative treatment op tion, such as monoclonal antibodies. x Recommend the patient discuss this with their primary care provider. x Recommend the patient seek care immediately by visiting the emergency room if moderate to severe symptoms are present. x Other recommendations the pharmacist believes is in the best interest of the patient. Q4. I have attempted to refuse to fill ivermectin prescriptio ns, but the patient continues to insist this must be filled. If, after consulting with the prescribing practitioner, s/he also reiterates the need for it to be filled, what is the most appropriate course of action? A4. Pharmacists can only do their best to ex plain the reason behind refusing to fi ll. If consulting wit h the practitioner provides the pharmacist with additional information to determine the prescription should be dispensed, that decision should be made because the pharmacist believes it is in the best interest of the patient to do so, not because of pressure from the practitioner to fill it. If either a practitioner or a pharmaci st is concerned about the prescribing or dispensing of this medication, the licensee may choose to file a complaint with the Investigative Unit.

Professional conduc t by a licensee includes adherence to these guidelines. See 12 AAC 52.400. 340-61- STERILE PHARMACEUTICALS February 2008 Scope and Purpose. The purpose of this pamphlet is to provide standards for the preparation, labeling, and distribution of sterile products by pharmacies, pursuant to or in anticipation of a prescrip tion drug order. These standards are intended to apply to all sterile products, notwithstanding the location of the patient (eg. home, hospital, extended care facility, hospice, practitioner's office). Definitions. (a) \"Biological Safety Cabinet\" - a containment unit suitable for the preparation of low to moderate risk agents where there is a need for protection of the produc t, personnel and environment, according to National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) Standard 49. (b) \"Class 100 Environment\" - an atmospheric environment which contains less than 100 particles 0.5 microns in diameter per cubic foot of air, according to Federal Standard 209D. (c) \"Cytotoxic\" - a pharmaceutical that has the capability of killing living cells. (d) \"Parenteral\" - a sterile preparation of drugs for injection through one or more layers of the skin. (e) \"Sterile Pharmaceutical\" - dosage form free from living micro-organisms (aseptic). Policy and Procedure Manual. (a) A policy and procedure manual is prepared and maintained for the compounding, dispensing, and delivery of sterile pharmaceutical drug orders. The manual is reviewed and revised as necessary on an annual basis by the pharmacist-in-charge and is available for inspection at the pharmacy. (b) The manual includes policies and procedures, as applicable, for: (1) Clinical services; (2) Sterile product handling, preparation, dating, storage and disposal; (3) Major and minor spills of cytotoxic agents; (4) Disposal of unused supplies and medications; (5) Drug destruction and returns; (6) Drug dispensing; (7) Drug labeling; (8) Duties and qualifications for professional and nonprofessional staff; (9) Equipment use and maintenance; (10) Handling of infectious waste pertaining to drug administration; (11) Infusion devices and drug delivery systems; (12) Training and orientation of professional and non-professional staff commensurate with the services provided; (13) Dispensing of investigational medications; (14) Quality control and quality assurance; (15) Recall procedures; (16) Infection control; (17) Suspected contamination of sterile products; (18) Orientation of employees to sterile technique; (19) Sanitation; (20) Security; and (21) Transportation. Physical Requirements. (a) The pharmacy designates an area for the preparation of sterile products that is functionally separate from areas for the preparation of non-sterile products and is constructed to minimize traffic and airflow disturbances. It is used only for the preparation of these specialty products. It is of sufficient size to accommodate a laminar airflow hood and to provide for the proper storage of drugs and supplies under appropriate conditions of temperature, light, moisture, sanitation, ventilation, and security. 341-62- (b) The pharmacy preparing parenteral products has: (1) Appropriate environmental contro l devices capable of maintaining at least a Class 100 environment condition in the workspace where critical objects are exposed and critical activities are performed; furthermore, these devices are capable of maintaining Class 100 environments during normal activity; (2) When cytotoxic drug products are prepared, a ppropriate environmental control also includes appropriate biological safety cabinets; (3) Sink with hot and cold running water which is convenient to the com pounding area for the purpose of hand washing prior to compounding; (4) The designated area shall have hard cleanable surfaces, walls, floors and ceilings; (5) Appropriate disposal containers for used needles, syringes, etc. and if applicable, for cytotoxic waste from the preparation of chemotherapy agents and infectious wastes from patient's homes; (6) Refrigerator/freezer with thermometer; (7) Temperature controlled deliver y container, if appropriate; (8) Infusion devises, if appropriate; (9) Supplies adequate to maintain an environment suitable for the aseptic preparation of sterile products. (c) Laminar flow hood certification (or clean room certification, if applicable) are conducted at least every six months by an independent contractor according to Federal Standard 209B or National Sanitation Foundation 49 for operational efficiency. These reports are maintained for at least two years. In addition, prefilters are replaced on a regular basis and the replacement date documented. (d) The pharmacy has current reference materials related to sterile products. These reference materials will contain information on stability, incompatibilities, preparation guidelines, and the handling of chemotherapy drug products. Personnel. (a) All personnel participating in the preparation and/or dispensing of compounded sterile pharmaceuticals are trained in this specialized function, including the principles of aseptic technique. All duties and responsibilities of personnel are consistent with their training and experience. (b) Pharmacies providing parenteral products to non-hospitalized patients have a pharmacist accessible twenty- four hours per day to respond to patient's and other health professional's questions and needs. Drug Distribution and Control. (a) In addition to labeling required for all dispensed prescription drug orders, the labeled container of a sterile pharmaceutical bears the expiration date of the preparation based upon published data. (b) Delivery Service. The pharmacist-in-charge assure s the environmental control of all products shipped. Therefore, any compounded sterile pharmaceutical is shipped or delivered to a patient in appropriate temperature controlled (as defined by United States Pharmacopeia Standards) delivery containers and stored appropriately in the patient's home or outpatient location. (c) Disposal of Infectious/Hazardous Waste. The pharmacist-in-charge is responsible for assuring there is a system for the disposal of cytotoxic waste and infectious waste in a manner so as not to endanger the public health. (d) Emergency Kit. When sterile pharmaceuticals ar e provided to home care patients, the pharmacy may supply the licensed nurse with emergency drugs, if the prescribing practitioner has authorized the use of these drugs by a protocol for use in an emergency situation (e.g. anaphylactic shock). 342-63- Cytotoxic Drugs. The following additional requirements are necessary for thos e pharmacies that prepare cytotoxic drugs to assure the protection of the personnel involved: (a) All cytotoxic drugs are compounded within a vertical flow, Class II, Biological Safety Cabinet. Policy and procedures are developed for the cleaning of the la minar airflow hood between compounding cytotoxic drugs and other parenteral products, if applicable. (b) Protective apparel is worn by personnel compounding cytotoxic drugs. This includes disposable gloves and gowns with tight cuffs. (c) Appropriate safety and containment techniques for compounding cytotoxic drugs are used in conjunction with the aseptic techniques required for preparing sterile products. (d) Disposal of cytotoxic waste complies with all applicable local, state, and federal requirements. (e) Written procedures for handling both major and minor spills of cytotoxic agents are developed and included in the policy and procedure manual. (f) Prepared doses of cytotoxic drugs are dispensed, labeled with proper precautions, and shipped in a manner to minimize the risk of accidental rupture of the primary container. Patient Training. If appropriate, the Pharmacist demonstrates or document s the patient's training and competency in managing the type of therapy provided by the Pharmacist to the patient in the home environment. A pharmacist is involved in the patient training process in any area that relates to drug compounding, labeling, storage, stability, or incompatibility. The Pharmacist is responsible for seeing the patient's competency in the above areas is reassessed on an ongoing basis. Quality Control and Quality Assurance Procedures. (a) Quality Control. There is a documented, ongoing quality control program that monitors and evaluates personnel performance, equipment and facilities. Pro cedures are in place to assure the pharmacy is capable of consistently preparing pharmaceuticals which are ster ile and stable. Quality co ntrol procedures include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) recall procedures; (2) storage and dating; (3) documentation of appropriate functioning of refrigerator, freezer, and other equipment; (4) documentation of aseptic environmental control device certification and the regular replacement of prefilters; (5) a process to evaluate and confirm the qualit y of the prepared pharmaceutical product; and (6) if bulk compounding of parenteral solutions is performed utilizing non-sterile chemicals, extensive end product testing is documented prior to the release of the product from quarantine. This process includes appropriate tests for particulate matter and pyrogens. (b) Quality Assurance. (1) There is a documented, ongoing quality assurance program for monitoring and evaluating personnel performance and patient outcomes to assure efficient drug delivery, patient safety, and positive patient outcomes. (2) There is documentation of quality assurance audits at regular, planned intervals which may include infection control, sterile technique, delivery systems/times, order transcription accuracy, drug administration systems, adverse drug reactions, and drug therapy appropriateness. 343-64- (3) A plan for corrective action of problems identified by quality assurance audits is developed which includes procedures for the documentation of identified problems and action taken. (4) A periodic evaluation of the effectiveness of the quality assurance activities is completed and documented. This pamphlet is prepared by the Alaska Board of Pharmacy to establish guidelines for a pharmacy or pharmacist that prepares or dispenses sterile pharmaceuticals. Prof essional conduct by a licensee includes adherence to these guidelines. See 12 AAC 52.430. 344-65- GOOD COMPOUNDING PRACTICES February 2008 (a) A pharmacist may compound drugs in limited quantities before receiving a valid prescription drug order if the pharmacist has a historical basis of valid prescription drug orders generated solely within an established relationship between the pharmacist, a patient, and a prescribing practitioner for the amount of drugs compounded. Compounding drugs in an amount above that for which there is a historical basis is considered manufacturing. (b) Compounding includes the preparation (1) according to a prescription drug order of drugs or devices that are not commercially available; (2) of commercially available products from bulk when the prescribing practitioner has prescribed the compounded product on a per prescription basis and the patient has been made aware that the compounded product will be prepared by the pharmacist. (c) When a compounded product is to be substituted fo r a commercially available product, both the patient and the prescribing practitioner must authorize the use of the compounded product. The pharmacist shall document these authorizations on the prescription drug order or in the computerized patient medication record. The prescribing practitioner's authorization is in addition to signing to permit substitution on a prescription drug order or advising verbally that substitution is permitted. The reconstitution of commercially available products according to the manu facturer's guidelines is permissible without notice to the prescribing practitioner. (d) A pharmacist may not offer compounded drug pr oducts to prescribing practitioners, pharmacists, or pharmacies for resale except in the course of professional practice for a prescribing practitioner to administer to an individual patient. The distribution of inordinate amounts of compounded products without a relationship between the pharmacist and the prescribing practitioner and patient is considered manufacturing. (e) A pharmacist may receive, store, and use drug substa nces for compounding prescriptions that meet official compendia requirements. A pharmacist shall use the ph armacist's professional judgment to receive, store, and use drug substances for compounding prescr iptions not found in official compendia. PERSONNEL A pharmacist engaging in compounding shall maintain proficiency through current awareness and training. Continuing education should include training in the art and science of compounding and the rules and regulations of compounding. COMPOUNDING FACILITIES (a) A pharmacy engaging in compounding shall have a specifically designated and adequate area for the orderly compounding of prescriptions that is maintained in a good state of repair and for the placement of materials and equipment. There is a minimum of three linear feet by a minimum of 18 inches in depth of counter working space for each pharmacist or intern compounding or filling prescriptions at the same time. (b) Bulk medications and other chemicals or materials used in the compounding of medications must be stored in adequately labeled containers in a clean, dry, and temperature controlled area or, if required, under proper refrigeration. (c) Adequate lighting and ventilation must be provided in all drug compounding areas. Potable water must be supplied under continuous positive pressure in a plumbing system free of defects that could contribute contamination to any compounded drug product. Adequate washing facilities, easily accessible to the compounding area of the pharmacy must be provided. The facilities must include hot and cold water, soap or detergent, and air-driers or single use towels. (d) The area used for the compounding of drugs must be maintained in a clean and sanitary condition. It must be free of infestation by insects, rodents, and other vermin. Trash must be held and disposed of in a timely and sanitary manner. Sewage and other refuse must be disposed of in a safe and sanitary manner. (e) If drug products with special precautions for contamination, such as penicillin, are involved in a compounding procedure, appropriate measures, including either the dedication of equipment or meticulous 345-66- cleaning of contaminated equipment prior to its use for the preparation of other drugs, must be used in order to prevent cross-contamination. RECORDS AND REPORTS (a) A pharmacist shall keep records of all compounded products for two years. The records must be readily available for authorized inspection at the pharmacy. (b) A pharmacist shall ensure that there are formulas maintained electronically or manually. A formula must include ingredients, amounts, methodology and equipment, if needed, and special information regarding sterile compounding. (c) A pharmacy engaging in compounding must have written procedures for the compounding of drugs to assure that the finished products have the identity, strength, quality, and purity they are represented to possess. The procedures must include a listing of the components, their amounts in weight or volume, the order of component mixing, and a description of the compounding process. The procedures must list all equipment and utensils and the container or closure system relevant to the sterility and stability of the intended use of the drug. The procedures must be followed in the execution of the drug compounding procedure. (d) A pharmacist shall accurately weigh, measure, or subdivide as appropriate the components for drug product compounding. The compounding pharmacist shall check these operations at each stage of the compounding process to ensure that each weight or m easure is correct as stated in the written compounding procedures. If a component is transferred from th e original container to another container, the new container must be identified with the component name and the weight or measure. (e) To assure the reasonable uniformity and integrity of compounded drug products, written procedures must be established and followed that describe the tests or examinations to be conducted on the product compounded. The control procedures must be established to monitor the output and to validate the performance of those compounding processes that include the following when appropriate: (1) capsule weight variation; (2) adequacy of mixing to assure uniformity and homogeneity; (3) clarity, completeness, or pH of solutions; (f) A pharmacy engaging in compounding shall establish and follow appropriate written procedures designed to prevent microbiological contamination of compounded drug products purporting to be sterile. The procedures must include validatio n of any sterilization process. (g) For the purpose of compounding in quantities larger than required for immediate dispensing by a prescriber or for future dispensing upon prescription, a pharmacy shall maintain records that include (1) the date of preparation; (2) the lot numbers - the lot numbers may be the manufacturer's lot numbers or new numbers assigned by the pharmacy. If a lot number is assigned by the pharmacy, the pharmacy shall record the original manufacturer's lot numbers and expiration dates, if known. If the original manufacturer's lot numbers and expiration dates are not known, the pharmacy shall record the source and acquisition date of the components; (3) the expiration date of the finished product. This date may not exceed 180 days or the shortest expiration date of any component in the finished product unless a longer date is supported by stability studies in the same type of packaging as furnished to the prescriber or to be stored in until dispensing. Shorter dating than set forth in this subsection may be used if it is deemed appropriate in the professional judgment of the responsible pharmacist; (4) the signature or initials of the pharmacist performing the compounding; (5) initials of the person preparing each process; (6) initials of the pharmacist supervising each process; 346-67- (7) a formula for the compounded product maintained in a readily retrievable form; (8) the name of the manufacturer of the raw materials; (9) the quantity in units of finished products or grams of raw materials; and (10) the package size and the number of units prepared. (h) \"Component\" means any ingredient intended for use in the compounding of a drug product, including those that may not appear in the product. This pamphlet is prepared by the Alaska Board of Pharmacy to establish guidelines for a pharmacy or pharmacist on compounding practices. Professional conduct by a licensee includes adherence to these guidelines. See 12 AAC 52.440. 347 MOTION SHEETS EXECUTIVE SESSION MOTION Sec. 44.62.310. Government meetings public.

No Yes No No Majority BEST PRACTICES Makers of motions should write them down before verbalizing, then hand the written motion to the secretary once the motion has been made on the floor. It is appropriate for the chair to call for a brief break (\"at ease\") to untangle the motions when operations become confused. Do not proceed in confusion. It is a misconception that the chair can only vote in the case of a tie. From www.robertsrules.com : If the chair is a member of the voting body, he or she has exactly the same rights and privileges as all other members have, including the right to make motions, to speak in debate, and to vote on all questions. So, in meetings of a small board (whe re there are not more than about a dozen board members present), and in meetings of a committee, the presiding officer may exercise these rights and privileges as fully as any other member. When will the chair's vote affect the result? On a vote that is not by ballot, if a majority vote is required and there is a tie, he or she may vote in the affirmative to cause the motion to prevail. If there is one more in the affirmative than in the negative, the chair can create a tie by voting in the negative to cause the motion to fail. Similarly, if a two-thirds vote is required, he or she may vote either to cause, or to block, attainment of the necessary two thirds. Unanimous consent occurs when all members vote in favor of a motion. Sometimes unanimous consent simply occurs after a vote, when all members vote th e same way. Other times, unanimous consent may be requested as part of a motion. Typically, this request happens when the person making the motion knows the item is not controversial. The person making the motion might say, \"Mr. [or Madam] Chair, I move to approve the minutes from the July 2021 meeting and ask unanimous consent.\" The chair then asks if there is any objection. If there is none, the item is adopted by unanimous consent. Discussion may also be permitted but usually only for clarification. If there is objection, th en debate occurs and the matter goes to a roll call vote. Alaskans have to right to know how board and commission members voted, so unanimous consent should not be used to avoid debate or pressure a board into a vote. Member who are unsure how to vote should engage in debate so they may offer an informed vote. In boards where quieter members or public members shy away from engagement, the chair should always request a roll call vote to ensure their voices are not disenfranchised. 351MEETINGS 201 DD 3 Executive session: Why? When? How? As reviewed in Module One, all board meetings must be publicly noticed per AS 44.62.310: Sec. 44.62.310. Government meetings public. (a) All meetings of a governmental body of a public entity of the state are open to the public except as otherwise provided by this section or another provision of law. Attendance and participation at meetings by members of the public or by members of a governmental body may be by teleconferencing. Agency materials that are to be co nsidered at the meeting shall be made available at teleconference locations if practicable. Except when voice votes are authorized, the vote shall be conducted in such a manner that the public may know the vote of each person entitled to vote. The vote at a meeting held by teleconference shall be taken by roll call. This section does not apply to any votes required to be taken to organize a governmental body described in this subsection. (b) If permitted subjects are to be discussed at a meeting in executive session, the meeting must first be convened as a public meeting and the question of holding an executive session to discuss matters that are listed in (c) of this section shall be determined by a majority vote of the governmental body. The motion to convene in executive session must clearl y and with specificity describe the subject of the proposed executive session without defeating the purpose of addressing the subject in private. Subjects may not be considered at the executive session except those mentioned in the motion calling for the executive session unless auxiliary to the main question. Action may not be taken at an executive session, except to give direction to an attorney or labor negotiator regarding the handling of a specific legal matter or pending labor negotiations. (c) The following subject may be considered in an executive session: (1) matters, the immediate knowledge of which would clearly have an adverse effect upon the finances of the public entity; (2) subjects that tend to prejudice the reputation and character of any person, provided the person may request a public discussion; (3) matters which by law, municipal charter, or ordinance are required to be confidential; (4) matters involving consideration of government records that by law are not subject to public disclosure. EXECUTIVE SESSION PROTOCOL In reading the law above, we see that we need to do a few things to appropriately manage executive session: 1. Hold a publicly noticed meeting of the board. 2. By motion, state the statutory reason for entering executive session. (A cheat sheet is provided in PL-1.) 3. Go off record and \"close the doors.\" 4. Ensure the topic stays on to pic during executive session. 5. By motion, exit executive session and go back on record. 6. Take any resulting action in the open meeting. It is a best practice to have a supervisor attend th is process the first few times a staff member shepherds a board through executive session. The board can state in the motion that they would like division staff to attend and should identify who they mean if it is unclear. 352MEETINGS 201 DD 4 EXCEPTION TO PUBLIC NOTICE OF A MEETING In accordance with 44.62.310(d), public notice of meeti ngs called for the sole purpose of making a decision on an adjudicatory proceeding is not required. (Meeting minu tes, however, are still requir ed to record the official action taken.) Adjudicatory proceedings include board consideration of hearing officer decisions, petitions for reconsideration filed in accordance with AS 44.62, stipulations, memoranda of agreement, license surrenders, and s ummary suspensions. Adjudicatory proceedings should be supervised by a seasoned investigator, executive administrator, and/or AAG. An administrative la w judge will also provide procedural guidance. Expectations of board member participation At the very least, board members are expected to attend scheduled meetings and vote on appropriate matters via OnBoard during the interim. When board members do not meet these minimal standards of participation, important business, such as license action or regulatory progress can be delayed. Inaction by a board can impact individuals' economic welfare, a community' s health care outcomes, or public safety. If a board member fails to attend a meeting or vote online, find out why. Sometimes, absences cannot be avoided. However, nonparticipation should be rare. If the board requires review and approval of license applications, those members may need to let staff know when they may be on vacation or unavailable for extended periods. This will allow staff to set expectations for workflow and alert applicants to potential delays. Knowing whether a quorum is possible can also help investigators and administrative law judges manage urgent disciplinary matters. Per AS 08.01,020, boards may adopt regulations providing for removal after several unexcused absences. However, a candid conversation is the best and fastest route to resolving a member's nonparticipation. 1. First, staff should find out why the member has been missing meetings or votes. Is it because staff's email goes to the member's spam filter? Is the memb er having technical difficu lties such as internet connectivity or using Zoom or OnBoard? These simple matters can usually be resolved quickly and easily. 2. When the matter goes deeper or the member is simply not responding, consult the board chair. The chair should make a call to discuss these issues and plot a path forward. Does the workload exceed the member's expectations? Is the member having regret in saying \"yes\" to the commitment? Perhaps the member has a long-term family emergency that is diverting time and energy. 3. If the board chair is unsuccessful in reaching the member or resolving the issue, discuss with your supervisor. Sometimes the division director is the best person to reach out to the member. This discussion can often yield fruit when there is an interpersonal conflict on the board or when the member doesn't want to share their concerns with a peer. 4. Lastly, when all else fails, the division director can reach out to the director of the Office of Boards and Commissions (B&C) for guidance. As the appointing authority representing the governor, the B&C director can \"go deep\" and even withdraw appointment, if necessary. Additional detailed information can be found in the CBPL Guide to Excellence in Regulation and PL-1 Board Meeting Handbook . 353ORDER OF OPERATIONS TO ACT AS A BOARD 1. A member seeks recognition from the chair. 2. The member is recognized by the chair and \"has the floor.\" 3. The member makes a motion. 4. The motion is seconded (if appropriate, see chart on other side). 5. The chair (or staff, if delegated) restates the motion to the body. 6. Board or commission debates the motion. 7. Subsidiary motions are made, if any: Amend, ta ble, send to committee (s ee chart on other side). 8. Board or commission votes on subsidiary motion, if any. 9. Board or commission votes on the main motion either by roll call or unanimous consent. 10. The chair (or staff) announces the result of the vote. Best practices: 1. Makers of motions should write them down before verbalizing, then hand the written motion to the secretary once the motion has been made on the floor. 2. It is appropriate for the chair to call for a brie f break (\"at ease\") to untangle the motions when operations become confused. Do not proceed in confusion. PURPOSE YOU SAY INTER- RUPT? 2ND?
