Any imbalance due to internal or external factors causes disease and the treatment consists of restoring the equilibrium through various interventions including therapeutic procedures, regimens, medicines and lifestyle management.

Homoeopathy was brought into India around 1810 A.D. by European missionaries and received official recognition by a Resolution passed by the Constituent Assembly in 1948 and then by the Parliament. The first principle of Homoeopathy 'Similia Similibus Curentur', says that a medicine which could induce a set of symptoms in healthy human beings would be capable of curing a similar set of symptoms in human beings actually suffering from the disease. The second principle of 'Single Medicine' says that one medicine should be administered at a time to a particular patient during the treatment. The third principle of 'Minimum Dose' states that the bare minimum dose of a drug which would induce a curative action without any a d v e r s e e f f e c t s h o u l d b e administered. Homoeopathy is based on the assumption that the causation of a disease mainly depends upon the susceptibility or proneness of an individual to the incidence of the particular disease in addition to the action of external agents like bacteria, viruses, etc. Homoeopathy is a method of treating 2.5.2 2.5.3Rheumatic disorders, Chronic liver d i s o r d e r s , B e n i g n p r o s t a t e hypertrophy, bleeding piles, peptic ulcer including various kinds of Dermatological disorders of non- psoriatic nature. During the last six decades, there has been continuous development in Siddha medical education and this has led to the establishment of the National Institute of Siddha at Chennai as apex Institute having six specialties in post-graduate teaching leading to the award of M.D.(S) Degree. These are Maruthuvam ( G e n e r a l M e d i c i n e ) , S i r a p p u Maruthuvam (Special Medicine), K u z h a n t h a i M a r u t h u v a m ( P a e d i a t r i c s ) , G u n a p a d a m ( P h a r m a c o l o g y ) , N o i N a d a l (Pathology) and Nanju Nool & Maruthuva Neethinool (Toxicology). For development of focused research in Siddha System of medicine, Government has constituted Central Council for Research in Siddha (CCRS), as an autonomous body. The Unani System of Medicine originated in Greece and passed through many countries before establishing itself in India during the medieval period. It is based on well- established knowledge and practices relating to the promotion of positive health and prevention of disease. The Unani System has grown out of the fusion of traditional knowledge of ancient civilizations like Egypt, Arabia, Iran, China, Syria and India. It emphasizes the use of naturally 2.3.3 2.3.4 2.4 UNANI SYSTEM 2.4.1occurring, mostly herbal, medicines and also uses some medicines of animal, marine and mineral origin. This system of medicine was documented in Al-Qanoon,a medical classics, by Sheikh Bu-Ali Sina (Avicena) (980-1037 AD), in Al-Havi by Razi (850-923 AD) and in many other books written by the Unani physicians. The Unani system is based on the humoral theory i.e. the presence of blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black b i l e i n e v e r y p e r s o n . T h e temperament of a person can accordingly be sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric and melancholic depending on the presence and combination of humors. According to Unani theory, the humors and the drugs themselves are assigned temperaments. Any change in quantity and quality of the humors brings about a change in the status of the health of the human body. A proper balance of humors is required for the maintenance of health. The treatment consists of four components, namely, preventive, promotive, curative and rehablitative. Unani system of medicine has been found to be efficacious in many conditions, particularly chronic and d e g e n e r a t i v e d i s o r d e r s e . g . Rheumatoid Arthritis, Hepatitis, Filariasis, Eczema, Sinusitis and Bronchial Asthma etc. For the prevention of disease and promotion of health, the Unani System emphasizes on six essential pre- r e q u i s i t e s o f l i f e ( A s b a b - e - SittaZarooria) - (a) pure air (b) food 2.4.2 2.4.3 2.4.4 10ANNUAL REPORT 2014-15 11ANNUAL REPORT 2014-15and beverages (c) physical movement and rest (d) psychic movement and rest (e) sleep and wakefulness and (f) retention of useful materials and evacuation of waste materials from the body.

These are Maruthuvam ( G e n e r a l M e d i c i n e ) , S i r a p p u Maruthuvam (Special Medicine), K u z h a n t h a i M a r u t h u v a m ( P a e d i a t r i c s ) , G u n a p a d a m ( P h a r m a c o l o g y ) , N o i N a d a l (Pathology) and Nanju Nool & Maruthuva Neethinool (Toxicology). For development of focused research in Siddha System of medicine, Government has constituted Central Council for Research in Siddha (CCRS), as an autonomous body. The Unani System of Medicine originated in Greece and passed through many countries before establishing itself in India during the medieval period. It is based on well- established knowledge and practices relating to the promotion of positive health and prevention of disease. The Unani System has grown out of the fusion of traditional knowledge of ancient civilizations like Egypt, Arabia, Iran, China, Syria and India. It emphasizes the use of naturally 2.3.3 2.3.4 2.4 UNANI SYSTEM 2.4.1occurring, mostly herbal, medicines and also uses some medicines of animal, marine and mineral origin. This system of medicine was documented in Al-Qanoon,a medical classics, by Sheikh Bu-Ali Sina (Avicena) (980-1037 AD), in Al-Havi by Razi (850-923 AD) and in many other books written by the Unani physicians. The Unani system is based on the humoral theory i.e. the presence of blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black b i l e i n e v e r y p e r s o n . T h e temperament of a person can accordingly be sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric and melancholic depending on the presence and combination of humors. According to Unani theory, the humors and the drugs themselves are assigned temperaments. Any change in quantity and quality of the humors brings about a change in the status of the health of the human body. A proper balance of humors is required for the maintenance of health. The treatment consists of four components, namely, preventive, promotive, curative and rehablitative. Unani system of medicine has been found to be efficacious in many conditions, particularly chronic and d e g e n e r a t i v e d i s o r d e r s e . g . Rheumatoid Arthritis, Hepatitis, Filariasis, Eczema, Sinusitis and Bronchial Asthma etc. For the prevention of disease and promotion of health, the Unani System emphasizes on six essential pre- r e q u i s i t e s o f l i f e ( A s b a b - e - SittaZarooria) - (a) pure air (b) food 2.4.2 2.4.3 2.4.4 10ANNUAL REPORT 2014-15 11ANNUAL REPORT 2014-15archaeological evidence of existence of Yoga is found in Stone Seals of excavated from Indus Valley.

These two are the most important meanings of the word Yoga according to 'Panini', the most well- known Sanskrit grammarian. Yoga is being practiced as part of healthy lifestyle and has become part of our spiritual heritage. In the present era, Yoga is popular world- wide because of its spiritual values, therapeutic credentials, its role in the prevention of diseases, promotion of health and management of lifestyle related disorders. Several clinical studies have lucidly demonstrated the therapeutic potentials of Yoga in the treatment of many lifestyle related or psychosomatic disorders.

According to Naturopathy the primary cause of disease, barring accidental or surgical injury, is violation of Nature's laws and the effects of violation of Nature's laws are- 1. Lowered vitality; 2. Abnormal composition of blood and lymph; 3. Accumulation of morbid matter in the body. The science of Naturopathy teaches us that the disease is Nature's effort to eliminate the morbid matter from the body to restore the health. Hence, we must not suppress the outward symptoms of disease like fever, cough, loose motions etc. but cooperate with Nature in the process of eliminating morbid matter from the body. Some of the basic concepts of Naturopathy are outlined as under: 1. Naturopathy believes in the concept of unity of disease and unity of cure. According to it root cause of all diseases are one that is accumulation of morbid matter in the body and the remedy also is one i.e. elimination of those toxins from the body. 2. Naturopathy considers bacteria and virus to be secondary cause of disease. The primary cause of disease is accumulation of morbid matter in the body. The microbes survive in the body only when a favourable atmosphere for their growth is established by the accumulation of morbid matter. 2.7.2 2.7.3 2.7.4Hence, the basic cause of disease is morbid matter and microbes are only the secondary cause. 3. Acute diseases are self-healing efforts of the body. Hence, they are taken as our friends, not enemies. Chronic diseases are outcome of wrong treatment and suppression of the acute diseases. 4. Human body has remarkable recuperative powers when left alone. Nature is the greatest healer. The human body is a self-healing machine. It is endowed with inherent healing power to prevent itself from disease and regain health when fallen ill. 5. In Naturopathy the patient is at the center of intervention and treatment, cure of disease is effected automatically with the i n c r e a s e i n v i t a l i t y a n d detoxification of body. 6. Naturopathy believes in holistic treatment. It not only treats the body as a whole, instead of specific organs but also take into account intervention at mental, moral and spiritual planes. 7. N a t u ro p a t hy d o e s n o t u s e medicines. According to it, \"Food is Medicine\". 8. Naturopathy accepts prayers also as a modality of treatment. According to Gandhiji \"Rama N a m a i s t h e b e s t N a t u ra l Treatment\" meaning thereby that prayer according to one's own faith is an important part of treatment. iii) Doctrine of various kinds of \"shuddhis\" found in Patanjala Yoga Suntra and Hathayoga. iv) Doctrine of opening blocked channels of vayus and prana (nadishuddhi), opening of l o t u s e s a n d c h a k r a s , kumbhakapranayamas, muderas and dristis as found in Hatha Yoga and Kundalini Yoga. v) Working with the mind on the lines of Patanjala Yoga Sutra, Mantra Yoga and Hatha Yoga. vi) Working on the lines of \"Karma- J n a n a ' B h a k t i \" f r o m Bhagawadgita. vii) Certain aspects of Tantra Yoga also get integrated in various Yoga practices. The following Yogic practices are being practiced for prevention and management of diseases: i) Shatkarma: These are six cleansing techniques in Yoga used to clean the internal organs and systems of the body. These are c a l l e d a s t h e p r o c e s s o f detoxification. Shatkarmas are Neti, Dhouti, Basti, Kapalabhati, Nauli, special patterns of body that stabilise the mind through static stretching. Yogasanas are psycho-physical in nature. They play a significant role in toning up the neuro-musculo and glandular systems of the body. There are more than 84 asanas mentioned in the classical texts.2.6.9iii)Pranayama: Pranayama is a practice which helps to regulate vital energies through regulation of breathing. iv)M u d ra : T h e s e a re s p e c i a l gestures/techniques formed with the combination of Asana and Pranayama and are used in channelization of Prana the vital force. v)Dhyana: Sustain concentration on the object is Dhyana.

NATIONAL MEDICINAL PLANTS BOARD (NMPB) 9.1 Introduction India has the unique distinction of possessing a substantial bio-diversity of medicinal plants, knowledge associated with their use and a good network of infrastructure required for their promotion, propagation etc. Indian systems of medicine use various raw materials and medicinal plants constitute 90% of it. About 3000 plants species are reported to be used in the codified Indian Systems of medicines like Ayurveda (900 species), Siddha (800 species), Unani (700 species) and Amchi (300 species). The rest of the species are used in local health traditions and in folk systems of medicine. Medicinal plants thus constitute an important component of the plant resource wealth of our country. In addition to their use in the preparation of Tradition medicines, the medicinal plants are being used in preparation of various pharmaceuticals and health products under the modern medicine system. Keeping in view the need for availability of authentic raw drugs, the vast potential of herbal product/ herbal drugs and the role India could play in the global market, Government of India has taken the lead by establishing National Medicinal Plants Board (NMPB) under Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India. NMPB is an apex national body which coordinates all matters relating to medicinal plants in the country. To tap the potential and comparative advantage of India in the medicinal plants sector so that it can realise its potential of Global Leadership in this field by comprehensive development o f c o n s e r va t i o n , c u l t iva t i o n , collection, processing, marketing, research and extension support system for the sector. Strengths of India in the Medicinal Plants Sector Resource Base: With its 15 Agro- Climatic zones and 16 Forest Types, India is home to 7% of the world's bio-diversity making it one of the 17 mega bio-diversity rich countries in the world. A p p rox i m a te ly 1 5 , 0 0 0 a re medicinal plants. About 6000- 7000 plants are used in Indian Systems of Medicine, 960 of these have been recorded in trade and 178 are traded in high volumes, in quantities exceeding 100 Metric Tonne (MT) per year.

Traditional Knowledge: The Indian Systems of Medicine like Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani and Sowa Rigpa are well codified and documented. These systems are officially recognized and have been validated through centuries of practice and today form an integral part of therapies being opted for by the people at large. Modern Scientific capability: There are scientific institutions both government owned as well as in the private sector which are equipped with state-of-the-art i n f ra s t r u c t u re a n d s k i l l e d manpower dedicated to research in medicinal plants required for validation of this knowledge.
