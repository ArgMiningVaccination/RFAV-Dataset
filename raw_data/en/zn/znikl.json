So even though I did over two years of professional therapy, and did over a decade of inner work while on a mystic path\u2014to include: dream work, inner-child work, shadow work, The 7 Essene Mirrors, etc.\u2014this retreat has taken my healing and transformation to a whole other level, and on all energetic levels: mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual. Granted, I'm open to continue healing, learning, growing, evolving, and expanding my individual and Collective consciousness; hence, I consider returning for another retreat in Divine perfect timing and order, and here's why it was worth it. I've been drawn to a real-deal ayahuasca experience for years. And though I came upon various opportunities, one place stood out from the rest; and it became my first experience. It felt like the perfect combination package that I hadn't seen before, that integrates: connecting deeper with our whole self (physical self)/Self (Spiritual Self), as well as inner-child work, shadow work, other interesting workshops, a transparently informative website, and Silvia's extensive, experiential background. This 11 day ayahuasca retreat this month (July 3-13, 2022)\u2014including 5, mind-blowing, challenging, thought-provoking, deeply healing, and/or heavenly ayahuasca ceremonies\u2014was profoundly transformational and overall amazing. It was the most invaluable investment and unconditionally loving gift that I ever gave to myself; and I highly recommend it to others. Granted, no matter what I experience, I always like to follow my inner guidance/Heart/intuition/gut feeling/inner-wisdom FIRST AND FOREMOST, only taking onboard what FEELS light/true to my Heart, and discarding the rest. The retreat center itself is like paradise, a Heaven on Earth\u2014meticulously, beautifully, and perfectly designed by Silvia, and whom she co-created and built with her family-like team of employees. The consolidation of an abundance of different trees, plants, bushes, flowers, pond, etc. are like puzzle pieces that reveal a giant, gorgeous picture. Before coming to this retreat, there was no way that I was going to swim in a pond (was never interested and never planned on it). However, I trust that ayahuasca has helped me to overcome my fear of the so-called \"dark\" murky water. And it was such a liberating, empowering, refreshing and magical new experience; plus, the water felt so smooth and healing, as others have shared as well. Silvia is a highly intelligent, very organized, meticulous, creative, innovative, wise and powerful Soul teacher, a major game changer. Her refreshing, straightforward approach has gifted me with obvious blessings and blessings in disguise, especially profound insights, epiphanies, and life-changing realizations. Ti0, Silvia's Assistant, who is very authentic, honest, free-spirited, gentle kind, and helpful, was continually there for all the retreat participants 24/7. He was so trustworthy and reliable. The retreat's very talented and very friendly chef, Lou, generously created various healthy, vegan, colorful, beautiful, and delicious buffet style meals, drinks, and desserts for all of us on a daily basis, which was impressive. This retreat's yoga teacher, Andrea, is wonderful. Her overall relaxing, yet pleasantly challenging style of Hatha yoga\u2014that she taught with unconditional kindness, patience, encouragements, a great sense of humor, and full support\u2014was deeply appreciated and memorable. She also does heavenly massages that felt like I was melting into a higher realm, along with the other masseuse whose name escapes me, but is very talented and heartfelt kind as well. The rest of the staff, to include the housekeeping ladies, were friendly and helpful as well. Thank you so much to everyone who made this retreat possible, to include the retreat participants whom I was able to deeply connect with, interact with, share, learn from, and grow together in so many ways....
