Footnotes: Pennsylvania Page 1 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 12 of 323STRENGTHS AND NEEDS OF THE SERVICE SYSTEM Legislative Base The mental health system in Pennsylvania is organized in conformance with the Mental Health/ Mental Retardation (MH/MR) Act of 1966, the Mental Health Procedures Act (MHPA) of 1976 as amended, and the Public Welfare Code. Primary authority for the Commonwealth's public mental health program derives from the MH/MR Act of 1966 and the MHPA of 1976, as amended. The location of the Office of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services (OMHSAS) and t he state hospitals within the Department of Public Welfare is established in the Pennsylvania Public Welfare Code. Role of State Government State government has the statutory responsibility to oversee the provision of community mental health services i n the Commonwealth, and has direct operational responsibility for the state mental hospitals. Responsibility for operation of the state mental hospitals and oversight of the public mental health system is vested in the Office of Mental Health and Substanc e Abuse Services (OMHSAS) within the Department of Public Welfare (DPW), which is a multi - program human services agency. Through OMHSAS, the state develops programs and policy, licenses most of the service components, allocates funds for services, develop s guidelines for county service planning, and administers and purchases the services for the managed Medicaid behavioral health care initiative. OMHSAS administers community mental health funds, Behavioral Health Services Initiative (BHSI) funds for both mental health and substance abuse services for individuals no longer eligible for Medical Assistance, and Act 152 funds to provide non-hospital residential substance abuse services. Pennsylvania prides itself in its innovative efforts to support a robust mental health service system by investing nearly $3.8 billion state and federal dollars per year towards mental health care in the state. The Bureau of Children's Behavioral Health Services (hereafter known as the Children's Bureau) within OMHSAS helps en sure focused attention on the behavioral health needs of children and adolescents. Children's Bureau provides leadership in the planning, program development, and implementation of a comprehensive statewide behavioral health services plan for children and adolescents with serious emotional disturbance (SED). The Bureau collaborates with state, county, and local agencies in the development of programs to support the best provision of care to children and families. The Bureau provides an array of children' s behavioral health services that are comprehensive and community -based, and that express the importance and continuous application of the Child and Adolescent Service System Program (CASSP) principles. OMHSAS entered into an Intergovernmental Agreement w ith the University of Pittsburgh, a state affiliated university, to establish the Pennsylvania Youth and Family Training Institute beginning in September, 2007. The Youth and Family Training Institute is the centerpiece of the effort to transform Pennsylv ania's Children's Behavioral Health System. The vision of the transformed system is one which will engage and empower youth and family teams as the primary determinants of service. Pennsylvania Page 2 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 13 of 323 In addition to Mental Health, DPW programs include Income Maintenance ( public assistance), Medical Assistance (Medicaid), Children, Youth, and Families (child welfare and juvenile justice), Developmental Programs (intellectual disabilities), Long Term Living, Child Development & Early Learning, and programs for persons who ar e blind, hearing impaired or need other social services. Programs in other state agencies, which have a relationship with the mental health system, include the Departments of Aging, Corrections, Education, and Health, and the Office of Vocational Rehabili tation within the Department of Labor and Industry. OMHSAS utilizes the counsel and recommendations of the Mental Health Planning Council in the planning, provision, and development of behavioral health and substance abuse services in the state. The State's Mental Health Planning Council is comprised of th ree distinct committees for adults, older adults, and children, as well as two subcommittees for transition -age youth and persons in recovery. State Mental Hospitals OMHSAS directly operates six state mental hospitals and one long -term nursing facility . The six hospitals are general purpose psychiatric hospitals for adults. The long term nursing facility, South Mountain Restoration Center, provides licensed skilled nursing and intermediate long-term care services to elderly with special needs whose ne eds cannot be met by other community nursing facilities. Children and adolescents are not served in state hospitals. Each state mental hospital has a nine -member citizen advisory board of trustees, the members of which are appointed by the Governor and c onfirmed by the State Senate. For past three decades, Pennsylvania has been on the leading edge of developing local partnerships and community based service options that promote recovery for people living with mental illness. The closure of Allentown State Hospital in December 2010 is a continuation of the State's plan to create a more unified approach to funding community services and supports for those living with mental illness. Highlights of the Projected Mental Health Budget for FY 2013/14 Commun ity Mental Health Services: $584.9 million , that include: Base Funds for Community Programs Children's programs The Community/Hospital Integration Projects Program (CHIPPs ) Southeastern Integration Projects Program ( SIPPs ) Behavioral health Services Initiative (BHSI) - Mental Health Federal MH Block Grant MH allocation of the federal Social Services Block Grant Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH) federal grant Other federal grants State Hospitals: $390.2 million OMHSAS , including managed -for-service. Special Pharmaceutical Benefits Program ( SPBP): $2.3 million Pennsylvania Page 3 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 14 of 323Role of Counties The Mental Health and Mental Retardation (MH/MR) Act of 1966 requires county governments to provide community mental health services, including short -term inpatient treatment, partial hospitalization, outpatient care, emergency services, specialized rehabi litation training, vocational rehabilitation, and residential arrangements. Services may be operated directly by the county or contracted out to provider agencies, with many counties utilizing a combination of both. The 67 counties in the state are group ed into 48 single -county or multi - county MH/MR Program Offices that operate under the direction of the County MH/MR Administrators. The county commissioners hire and supervise the MH/MR County Administrator, who has a board of 13 individuals to provide adv ice and consultation in the operation of the program. All County Administrators also function as the directors of the county Mental Retardation programs and, in 35 counties, as the Drug and Alcohol (D&A) Program Administrators. OMHSAS allocates funds to the county governments for the provision of community mental health services. County MH/MR and D&A Programs are uniquely positioned to coordinate behavioral health services with other county human services programs. This control and authority over nec essary ancillary services such as housing, family courts, and welfare programs are pivotal to a working infrastructure that is capable of providing a seamless system of care. Counties also take leadership roles in their communities by promoting activities aimed at increasing awareness of mental illness among community human service agencies, professional personnel, and the general public. Implementation of behavioral health managed cared was completed in July 2007, when the final set of counties moved to HealthChoices , Pennsylvania's managed care system . The success of the HealthChoices Behavioral Health (HC -BH) managed care program was built in partnership with county governments. County governments were given the right of first opportunity to bid on the HC -BH program to manage risk -based contracts. HC -BH unifies service development and financial resources at the local level, closest to the people served. Individuals receiving Medicaid are automatically enrolled in the BH program in the county of their residence. A risk -based contract allows flexibility to make decisions that meet the unique needs of the county and, if savings are created, the county must reinvest the money in approved programs and supports that meet the needs of people served. The HC-BH model has achieved its mission and fostered counties' success in controlling the growth of Medicaid spending while increasing access and improving quality. As of January 2013, 1.852 million individuals are enrolled in HC -BH, with a projected funding of $2.9 billion in fiscal year 2013/2014. Funding a nd Other Resources for Counties The general state revenue funds, county funds, Medicaid dollars, Mental Health Block Grant, Substance Abuse Block Grant, Social Services Block Grant, PATH grant, and oth er federal grants comprise much of the funding pool that County MH/MR programs use to provide services to their consumers. Some other resources available to the counties and providers include OMHSAS funded/sponsored technical assistance (TA) and training on a variety of areas. Some examples are Peer Specialist training, Case Management training, TA in the development Pennsylvania Page 4 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 15 of 323of evidence -based practices like Assertive Community Treatment , the Youth and Family Training Institute, and TA for the development of housi ng options in the counties. County Human Services Planning Process In 2012, as part of Department's continuing efforts to streamline the planning and reporting requirements for county human services programs , the County Mental Health Planning process and the Integrated Children's Services Planning process were replaced with a County Human Services planning process . The H uman Services Plan ning guidance issued by the Department asked that the counties in their leadership role, with input from their stakehol ders, identify local needs, develop goals, create strategies, and identify and track outcomes that support the implementation of quality, cost effective and efficient services. Each county had to create a county planning team that also include d representat ives of other aspects of the human services system and individuals who receive services and their families. Many counties utilized their existing groups developed through System of Care, Integrated Children's Services, Community Support Programs or other multi system initiatives to assist with the planning process . The new planning process, while consolidated to present a holistic view of the human services system, also included specific planning requirements for different service areas, namely, Mental Health, Drug and Alcohol Services under DPW's jurisdiction, Intel lectual Disabilities, Child Welfare, and Homeless Assistance Programs. For the mental health part, the c ounties had to describe how they intended to provide an array of services to meet the mental health needs of the county residents including children an d adults in the least restrictive setting appropriate to those needs. The counties are expected to review data and various indicators to determine local needs and develop a plan to meet those needs. The Plans also need to contain strategies to be implem ented including specific activities to monitor and improve outcomes. New Initiatives Mental Health Matters DPW/OMHSAS has launched a broad, long -term campaign called Mental Health Matters to help eliminate mental health stigma and prejudices that prevent people from reaching out for help. With this initiative, the Department hopes to increase awareness that mental health disorders are real and that they can be treated or managed just like physical illnesses. OMHSAS intends to build on the state's commitment to people seeking behavioral health solutions and increase awareness of where, when and how they and their families can seek help. The Mental Health Matters campaign will build awarenes s through multiple efforts, for example: Additional mental health first aid training : Providing support to enable Counties to sponsor Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) and Youth Mental Health First Aid (YMHFA) training. The goal is to have MHFA and/or YMHFA available in all counties in the Commonwealth . Part of these efforts also would include training non-professionals such as librarians or soup kitchen volunteers to quickly identify a mental disorder and equip them with the means to help. This training is already provided to many police, medics and school counselors. Pennsylvania Page 5 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 16 of 323 Families as first responders : Empower families with the knowledge to identify the early signs of mental illness before a crisis occurs because families are truly on the front lines of mental health awareness. Reduce suicides among veterans: Pennsylvania has the second highest suicide rate for veterans: 16 a day. A collaborative public -private effort is underway to address the needs of our veterans returning from war. Service Members, Veterans, Family Members Military Project This is a project done in collaboration with other state agencies and other entities in the field. The priorities for this project include: Suicide Prevention; Increasing training for providers; Improving behav ioral health system to meet the needs of population; Developing referral system. STATUTORY CRITERIA ADDRESSED IN THE STATE PLAN Criterion 1: Comprehensive Community -Based Mental Health Service Systems [The system/services discussed under this criterion apply to both adults as well as children (if the services are age appropriate for children) . Services specific to children are discussed under criterion 3] (a) Establishment of System of Care Community Suppo rt Program Pennsylvania is guided by the Community Support Program (CSP) principles for the development and delivery of mental health services for adults. Pennsylvania's public mental health system is shaped by a strong influence of family members, consumers, and ad vocacy groups, who provide valuable input into the development of programs and policies that shape changes in the public mental health system throughout the Commonwealth. The CSP philosophy embraces the notion that services should be provided in such a wa y as to maintain the dignity of the individual and respect his/her desires, choices, strengths and treatment needs. Quality Management Data Strategy An OMHSAS Data Strategy for Fiscal Years 2009 -2011 was the framework that capitalized on the system's da ta-oriented strengths, while implementing a multi -faceted approach to overcome data -related shortcomings. This document offered a description of the two -year course that OMHSAS charted to maximize the use of data in support of its organizational mission. The data strategy is outlined using five SMART goals ( Strategic, Measurable, Actionable, Realistic, Timely). The goals include: Realign Resources to Build Infrastructure: Realign essential resources in order to build needed data infrastructure; Enhance Da ta Consolidation: Enhance the consolidation of data collection and storage processes in order to eliminate redundancies and maximize efficiencies; Pennsylvania Page 6 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 17 of 323 Improve Data Integrity: Improve the integrity of behavioral health data to make certain that the data is of a n inherent high quality; Enrich Information Sharing: Enrich the capacity of, and opportunities for, information sharing that support the interests and needs of the varied stakeholders. To align the data strategy with actions, OMHSAS has embarked on the Consolidated Community Reporting Initiative to build a statewide infrastructure necessary to report consumer level service utilization and outcome information on persons receiving County b ase-funded mental health services. OMHSAS has also contracted with an External Quality Review Organization (EQRO) vendor to provide a multi -year HealthChoices (HC) encounter data validation process. Quality encounter data serves multiple purposes, such as determining capitation rates, the identification of utilization trends, patterns of care and potential waste. Root Cause Analysis Pennsylvania continues to progress towards a data driven recovery -oriented behavioral healthcare system. In order to a ssess its transformation towards recovery, OMHSAS employed the Plan -Do-Check -Act method of Quality Management. OMHSAS has collaborated the EQRO vendor to demonstrate a quality improvement function by requiring that the BH -MCOs (Behavioral Health Managed Care Organizations) would perform a Root Cause Analysis if their average for a performance measure fell into three categories of evaluation. These categories are if the measure was statistically significantly: 1) lower than the prior year, 2) lower than the st ate BH -MCO average for that particular measurement, or 3) had remained the same when the one year was compared to the former year. The performance measurements and the BH -MCO average results for the measurement years 2009, 2010 & 2011 follow: Statewide BH -MCO averages (%) Performance Measures 2009 2010 2011 Follow up after Hospitalization for Mental Illness -7 days (QI-1) 45.2 45.4 45.8 Follow up after Hospitalization for Mental Illness -30 days (QI-2) 65.4 66.2 66.8 PA Specific Follow up after Hospitalization for Mental Illness -7 days (QI -A) 58.6 57.5 57.6 PA Specific Follow up after Hospitalization for Mental Illness -30 days (QI -B) 74.8 74.1 74.7 Readmission within 30 Days of an Inpatient Psychiatric Discharge (REA) 12.3 12.4 12.3 Pennsylvania Page 7 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 18 of 323The Statewide BH -MCO averages show consistent, non -significant improvement in 2009, 2010 and 2011 for Follow -up after a Mental Health Hospitalization in QI 1 & QI 2.

In 2013, meetings with the HC Quality Improvement Directors changed from semiannual meetings to quarterly meetings. One of the areas planned will be to discuss the barriers that are impeding significant improvements in these performance measures. Additional Health Care Quality Measures for Medicaid -Eligible Adults The Affordable Care Act (Section 1139B) requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to identify and publish a core set of health quality measures for adult Medicaid enrollees. The initial publishing of the Adult Core measures occurred in 201 1, with the final measure specifications published in February 2013. Pennsylvania has made the decision to implement all the measures published by HHS.

(NEW 2013) All Cause Readmission within 30 Days of a Physical Health, Substance Abuse and/or Mental Health Inpa tient Discharge Using the Physical Health (PH) & Mental Health (MH) encounter data, this study will look at the PH, MH, and Substance Abuse (SA) claim history of individuals readmitted to the hospital within a thirty day period after discharge. The areas studied will be polypharmacy, ambulatory care, d emographic data, cost and specific PH diagnoses. Statistical analyses will occur to determine the relationships between the above factors and readmission rates. Performance Improvement Projects -Annual. The results are used for federal compliance & monit oring, and provide ongoing information to the County and BH-MCO regarding the relative impact of activities designed to improve health status and outcomes. Performance Measures monitoring (other uses) Annually, Semiannually, or as determined by the QM work plans submitted by the HC Contractors. Monitoring the various processes provides current information to the BH -MCO, HC Contracts and to OMHSAS to identify areas of compliance, needed improvement or to initiate corrective action plans. Behavioral Health Consumer/ Beneficiary Focus Groups - Consumer/Family Satisfaction Surveys. The local surveys are conducted quarterly with a small subset of questions asked of all consumers and family members across the HC Contracts. This survey is used locally to asses s satisfaction with plan, providers, Pennsylvania Page 9 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 20 of 323identify service needs, access issues, and areas for improvement or new services. The statewide questions are reported quarterly to OMHSAS and used as an on - going source of information about the satisfaction of adult a nd children HC members External Quality Review - The EQR -related activities that must be included in an annual detailed technical report are reviewed to determine MCO compliance with the: o structure and operations standards established by the State, o validation of performance improvement projects, o validation of plan performance measures. o In addition, OMHSAS will implement additional voluntary EQR Protocols with BH -MCOs to meet Pennsylvania's data strategic goals & initiatives. These include the follo wing: BH encounter data validation BH-MCO HEDIS\u00a9 performance measure compliance Informational System Capabilities Assessment Data analysis (non -claims) - Behavioral Health Denials of Referral Requests - Annual reviews/quarterly data; Results of the reviews entered into a database and summarized; Findings used to complete the annual Program Evaluation Performance Summary (PEPS) for each County/BH -MCO. Behavioral Health Complaints, Grievances and Appeals Data - Semi - annual/quarterly data; Used to track and trend denied service grievances and other problems within the system; Can also be used to identify problems with the County, BH -MCO or providers. Health Status/ Outcomes - Annually; Monitoring and reporting provide ongoing information to the County and BH -MCO regarding the relative impact of activities designed to improve health status and outcomes. At the OMHSAS level, the activity provides a systemic overview of activities at local levels and allows for the identification of areas for improvement and succ essful/ potential best practices. (This report is currently undergoing a revision as we have moved into a new waiver.) Provider Self Report Data - Survey of Providers - Annual; Activity provides information related to the provider perspective as to how t he BH -MCO manages the network. Analysis of results leads to identification of barriers to quality operation and opportunities to improve provider related processes. Program Evaluation Performance Summary (PEPS) - Annual; Periodic review of compliance with programmatic standards. Reviews are conducted using the federal & state standards and findings are applied to maintain the expected standard for a state Medicaid Managed Care program. PEPS review findings found to be less than full compliance can result in a Corrective Action Plan (CAP), which is followed until resolution. OMHSAS has implemented a PEPS web -based application to speed the collection of monitoring data and to increase the efficiency of the input of data and data retrieval for program monit oring needs. Pennsylvania Page 10 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 21 of 323(b) Available Services Health, Mental Health, and Rehabilitation Services: Medical Assistance for Workers with Disabilities (MAWD) Pennsylvania's Medical Assistance for Workers with Disabilities (MAWD) Program is a medical insurance program that supports individuals with disabilities to obtain employment, earn more money and still maintain their Medicaid coverage. Through MAWD availability, individuals with disabilities, desiring to return to work, can do so without fear of losing their medi cal benefits. A key and continued goal in the MAWD program is steady increase in the number of individuals with disabilities returning to competitive employment in the community workforce. Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) Over the past few years, OMHSAS has been strongly promoting the expansion of fidelity -based ACT programs in the state. Pennsylvania currently has 42 ACT or ACT -like programs (also called Community Treatment Teams - CTT) in the state. The ACT bulletin issued by OMHSAS in 2008 established the standards for the delivery of ACT services in the state. In late summer 2010, OMHSAS piloted a standard statewide licensing tool, with the intention of using the tool to license ACT teams across the state. This tool is currently being used to license all ACT teams across the state. Licensing began late 2011, and as of March 2013, 20 of 42 teams have been licensed. Partial Hospitalization Partial Hospitalization is a non -residential treatment service licensed by OMHSAS for persons with mental illness who require less than 24 hour continuous care but require more intensive and comprehensive services than are offered in outpatient treatment. Partial hospitalization services may be: A day service designed for persons able to return to their home in the evening An evening service designed for persons working and/or in residential care A weekend program Outpatient Services Outpatient services are treatment - oriented services provided to consumers living in the community. The services, which are directed by the client's treatment plan, are provided to the individual and/or the family. Outpatient services are intended to prevent the need for a more intensive level of care and act as a follow -up to inpatient services. The services include: Psychiatric, psychological, or psycho -social therapy Supportive counseling for the client's family, friends and other interested community persons Individ ual or group therapy Treatment plan development, review and reevaluation of a client's progress Psychiatric services, including evaluation, medication clinic visit, and medical treatment required as part of the treatment of the psychiatric service Psychol ogical testing and assessment Pennsylvania Page 11 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 22 of 323Mental Health Crisis Intervention Services Mental Health Crisis Intervention Services are immediate, crisis -oriented services designed to ameliorate or resolve precipitating stress. These services are provided to adults and children, and their families, who exhibit an acute presentation of disturb ed thought, behavior, mood or social relationships. The telephone crisis service must be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. A crisis service may extend to petitioning for commitment but may not include the functions of review, approval or disa pproval. These services are always considered to be on an emergency basis. Rehabilitation Service: Psychiatric rehabilitation assists persons, 18 years or older, with functional disabilities resulting from mental illness to develop, enhance, and/or retain: psychiatric stability; social competencies; personal adjustment; and/or independent living compete ncies so that they experience more success and satisfaction in the environments of their choice and function as independently as possible. These interventions should occur concurrently with necessary clinical treatments and should begin as soon as clinica lly possible, following diagnosis. A planned program of goal setting, functional assessment, identification of needed and preferred skills and supports, skill teaching, and managing supports and resources, is needed to produce the desired outcomes consist ent with a person's wishes, ambitions, choice, and cultural environment. From 2001 until 2013 Psychiatric Rehabilitation Services (PRS) in the Commonwealth operated under a set of standards developed in 2001. PRS providers and other key stakeholders have noted inconsistencies in the 2001 Standards. The new regulation, Chapter 5230, is carefully designed to improve consistency of PRS design, delivery and licensure and is in accordance with evidence -based and best practice approaches and with the principles and practices of the United States Psychiatric Rehabilitation Association (USPRA). Chapter 5230 is projected to be published in final -form in May 2013 with an effective date 90 days after publication. PRS has expanded from 22 licensed providers in 2005 , to 130 licensed providers in 2013. Pennsylvania has the largest chapter of the United States Psychiatric Rehabilitation Association (USPRA) in the country, the Pennsylvania Association of Psychiatric Rehabilitation Services (PAPSRS). The Commonwealth a lso has the largest professional workforce of Certified Psychiatric Rehabilitation Practitioners (CPRP) in the nation. Fairweather Lodge: Fairweather lodges are small groups of four to eight people who share a house and own a small business. Each group mu st select a business to operate, for which they develop and implement a business plan. Lodge businesses include transportation, Medicaid - funded peer supports, lawn care, custodial or laundry services, printing, furniture building, shoe repair, catering, an d other services. Lodge members assume specific positions of responsibility within the household and the business. Pennsylvania currently has 35 Fairweather lodges with an additional 20 lodges in various stages of development. Pennsylvania is at the f orefront of the development of a nationally endorsed certification plan and process to insure fidelity to the Fairweather lodge standards. Certification of all Pennsylvania lodges, regarding adherence to Fairweather lodge fidelity standards. Pennsylvania recognizes the importance of continued and consistent participation in Pennsylvania Page 12 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 23 of 323national outcome reporting by all Pennsylvania lodges. Currently several Pennsylvania lodges participate in national outcome reporting. OMHSAS continues to promote the development o f a statewide coalition of Fairweather lodge coordinators. The Fairweather lodge programs hold regional meetings to further the growth of the lodge principles and practices among the Pennsylvania lodges. Clubhouse : Clubhouse is a community -based, social and vocational rehabilitation program based on the world famous Fountain House model. This model features work and membership as the primary methods for providing participants with increased opportunities in employme nt, housing, education, skill development, and social activities. Based on the successful model established by Fountain House in New York City in 1948, the unique feature of clubhouses is the focus on work as the primary rehabilitative tool through which members are engaged and recover functioning. Member participation and involvement in all aspects of clubhouse operation, functions, and decision -making, is integral to the clubhouse model. Peer support, education, self -determination, responsibility, and the opportunity to be employed in real work settings, are also of vital importance. Membership in the Pennsylvania Clubhouse Coalition (PCC) is contingent upon a clubhouse having or moving toward International Center for Clubhouse Development (ICCD) certification and fidelity to the clubhouse principles. The PCC has the second greatest number of ICCD certified clubhouses of any state in the nation. PCC currently has 19 of 24 clubhouses ICCD certified, and 14 of those 19 are OMHSAS licensed. When the n ew regulation for Psychiatric Rehabilitation Services goes into effect in 2013, all clubhouses will be required to be OMHSAS licensed. OMHSAS is providing technical assistance and training in order to bring all PA Clubhouses, as well as all other all PRS a gencies, into compliance with the new regulation Facility Based Vocational Rehabilitation Services: Facility Based Vocational Rehabilitation Services are programs designed to provide remunerative developmental and vocational training within a community -based, specialized facility (sheltered workshop) using work as the primary modality. Sheltered workshop programs include vocational evaluation, personal work adjustment training, work activity training, and regular work training and are provided in faciliti es licensed under Vocational Facilities regulations. Employment Services The Employment Transformation Project In 2007, OMHSAS began a pilot project providing 15 counties with consultation to help them implement the evidence -based practice of Supported Employment. In 2011, OMHSAS embarked on a different phase of the project, providing technical assistance and cons ultation with the help of four of the exemplary counties from the initial pilot projects. Those counties were Allegheny, Beaver, Cumberland/Perry and Montgomery and represented urban, suburban and rural interests. The four counties, with technical assistan ce and training from two state - contracted consultants from Temple University, provided technical assistance to five (5) additional counties/MH -ID joinders during FY 2011 -2012, continuing to December 2012. The additional counties were Armstrong/Indiana (dro pped out after change in county administration), Bucks, Delaware, Franklin/Fulton, and Northampton. Two more counties/joinders, Blair and Pennsylvania Page 13 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 24 of 323Luzerne/Wyoming, were also offered phone consultation/technical assistance, but chose not to pursue the opportunity. Throughout the project, these counties received assistance from the exemplary counties, Temple consultants, and OMHSAS. As part of the project, we also held monthly teleconferences which were then opened up to all stakeholders from July 2012 to December 2012. The exemplary counties have continued on their paths of making employment a priority, while the additional counties have all taken steps to increase knowledge of employment for the stakeholders in their counties and have made some policy/programmati c changes to begin the transformation. Employment Development Initiative (EDI) Grant In January 2012, OMHSAS was one of nine states to be awarded an Employment Development Initiative grant from SAMHSA/NASMHPD. OMHSAS contracted with consultants from Temp le University Collaborative on Community Inclusion to facilitate and provide technical assistance for this project. As part of this project, we established an advisory committee that assisted in developing an OMHSAS guidelines document that clarifies the roles of certified peer specialists (CPS)in supporting the employment goals for individuals under the current Medicaid regulations. We will hold a webinar for all interested BH -MCOs, county staff, and provider staff in March 2013 to discuss these guideli nes. Additionally, OMHSAS contracted with consultants from Mental Health Association of SE Pennsylvania to develop a classroom CPS curriculum and with Recovery Opportunities, Inc. to develop an online CPS curriculum, both for enhancing employment support for individuals. The classroom curriculum was piloted with 30 CPS and CPS Supervisors in December 2012. The online curriculum was piloted with over 40 CPS and CPS Supervisors in January 2013. We are currently in the process of working with Temple Uni versity Collaborative to develop a community of practice setting for CPSs, who support individuals in the area of employment. Temple University Collaborative is also in the process of assessing the effectiveness of the two curricula that were developed an d piloted. Medicaid Infrastructure Grant In 2009, DPW recruited AHEDD, a private, non -profit organization that promotes the development and employment of people with disabilities, to serve as the grant administrator to assist in the coordination of key p roject activities associated with the Medicaid Infrastructure Grant (MIG). The MIG provides funding for programs that address the employment issues of individuals with disabilities. Throughout the past two years, AHEDD and DPW solicited requests for mini -grants from counties or agencies. The topics for these requests included: promotional activities for the employment of people with disabilities, and outreach and education activities targeted to students with disabilities and/or their families in order t o assist them in seeking employment or postsecondary education. Throughout each request process, a workgroup of various stakeholders convened to determine which requests would provide for the most efficient use of funding and would impact the widest range of individuals. The mini -grants provided up to $5000 for plans that addressed the specific topics. OMHSAS participated in this process, and the final round of mini -grants was given during the winter of 2011/2012, as the MIG funding has ended. Pennsylvania Page 14 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 25 of 323DPW uti lized MIG funds to provide training to agencies, stakeholders, and individuals. The \" Work Incentives Training: A Practical Introduction to the Work Incentives Available for People with Disabilities\" that was held in various regions of the Commonwealth to reach a more diverse audience. As many of the trainings reached participant capacity, additional training dates were added to the agenda. Housing Services See Housing addressed under IV. Narrative Plan M. Recovery Educational Services Supported Education Through OMHSAS support, the Horizon House Inc. Technical Assistance team promotes the development and expansion of the Education Plus model Supported Education programs to selected partners across Pennsylvania. In 2008 this partnersh ip led to the selection of a proposal from Northwest Human Services (NHS) Foundation Scholarship Program. The Mosaic House Education Plus Program in Berks County is a component of their Clubhouse program. Horizon House currently has two Education Plus pr ograms, one for adults and one for transition -age youth. The College Plus Program at Bucks County Community College (BCCC) Voice and Vision, Inc. (formerly Bucks County CSP), has educational specialists who work with students attending BCCC. It is anticipated that the Education Plus model will provide a framework for markedly improved student performance, retention and graduation outcomes within the existing NHS Scholarship Program. The program tracks outcome information including grades, attendanc e, retention, and student satisfaction. Education PLUS hosts a combined graduation ceremony every year at the Philadelphia Community College for both Horizon House and Mosaic House participants. Horizon House has had numerous students who graduated with their degrees, including Master's degrees, each year. Mosaic House has also begun to have progressively more students graduate each year, since its inception in 2007. Substance Abuse Services: With the passage of Act 50 of 2010, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania established the Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs (DDAP) with the statutory authority for administering all substance use services. The new Department was funded and implemented in Fiscal Year 2012/13 state budget. The Department maintains responsibility for the development of the State Plan, and for the control, prevention, intervention, treatment, rehabilitation, research, education, and training aspects of substance use issues. Th e Department is responsible for the allocation of the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant (SAPTBG) in combination with state appropriations to the Single County Authorities (SCAs). The SCA Pennsylvania Page 15 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 26 of 323system provides the administrative oversight to l ocal substance use programs that are required to provide prevention, intervention, and treatment services. The SCA system contracts with the local licensed treatment providers for the availability of a full continuum of care for individuals who qualify fo r substance use services within their geographical region. The continuum of substance use services includes outpatient, intensive outpatient, partial, non -hospital detoxification, non -hospital residential, halfway house, medically managed detoxification, and medically managed residential treatment. Within the Department of Public Welfare, OMHSAS is responsible for the oversight of two state funding streams to support substance use services. Additionally, OMHSAS oversees the statewide mandated Medicaid behavioral health managed care program (mental health and substance use services) known as HealthChoices, as well as, the Medicaid fee -for-service funds for mental health and substance use services. For HealthChoices members, the continuum of care prov ides an array of treatment interventions as well as additional ancillary services to support a recovery environment. Clinical services are determined based upon the comprehensive assessment process and the application of standardized placement criteria suc h as the American Society of Addiction Medicine Patient Placement criteria (ASAM -PPC-2R) for children and adolescents under the age of 21. The Pennsylvania Client Placement Criteria (PCPC) is utilized for adults. Within HealthChoices, substance use ser vice expansion opportunities are provided through reinvestment dollars (unexpended capitation money). Counties, in partnership with their stakeholders and managed care organizations, identify service gaps in their continuum of care and community recovery support resources and develop plans for the use of reinvestment funds to support additional services . All the plans are reviewed by OMHSAS for various factors before granting approvals. Medical and Dental Services: Medical Provisions Medicaid covers a variety of services including hospital care (both inpatient and outpatient), nursing home care, physician services, laboratory and x -ray services, immunizations and other early and periodic screening, diagnostic and treatment (EPSDT) services for childr en, family planning services, health center and rural health clinic services, nurse midwife services, and nurse practitioner services. Under the Fee -for-Service Program, individuals use their \"ACCESS\" card to pay for doctor visits, hospital care, and other types of healthcare, services, and items. Another program in Medicaid is ACCESS Plus, a Primary Care Case Management program. In this program recipients are assigned a Primary Care Provider (PCP), who is the care giver for basic services. If a specia list is needed the PCP would make referral to the necessary physician enrolled in the program. The third option is the enrollment in a managed care program. Pennsylvania's Medicaid benefit program is one of the most comprehensive in the country and extend s eligibility to a number of optional populations, such as: (1) individuals who are in an institution, such as a nursing home, and whose income is under 300 percent of the FPL; Pennsylvania Page 16 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 27 of 323(2) individuals who would be eligible if institutionalized, but who are receivi ng care and home and community -based services (HCBS) waivers; (3) children with disabilities, regardless of their family's income and assets; (4) certain individuals with disabilities that work and have a family income of less than 250 percent of the FPL, who would qualify for SSI if they did not work; and (5) certain uninsured or low -income women who are screened for breast or cervical cancer through a program administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Pennsylvania also covers \"medically needy\" individuals. Medically needy individuals would be eligible for Medicaid under one of the mandatory or optional groups, except that their income and/or resources exceed the eligibility level. However, eligible medical expenses may be used to reduce their income, thus making them eligible for Medical Assistance. Pennsylvania also has a 100% state -funded medical assistance program \"General Assistance.\" Single individuals can qualify for coverage (subject to income and resource limits) under the General Assistance program if they are unable to work due to a temporary or permanent disability, are a pending SSI recipient, are blind, or fit into other General Assistance related categories. Dental Provisions The availability of dental benefi ts that a Medical Assistance (MA) recipient is eligible for varies according to the category of assistance. MA provides coverage for the following dental services: All medically necessary dental services for children under age 21 Categorically needy indi viduals 21 years of age or older are eligible for all medically necessary dental services. Families who meet the financial eligibility requirements for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or an optional state supplement are defined as categorically needy. Dental services are also provided for medically needy only adults for palliative treatment or if the condition of the patient requires services to be provided in a Short Procedure Unit (SPU), Ambulatory Surgi cal Center (ASC), or Inpatient Hospital. Beneficiaries in nursing homes and Intermediate Care Facilities for Persons with Mental Retardation (ICF -MR) are afforded the same coverage as adults. Support Services Suicide Prevention Pennsylvania follows the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention in advancing suicide prevention throughout the Commonwealth. In 2006, Pennsylvania developed a state plan for suicide prevention among Adults and Older Adults. This Plan governs the work of the state's suicide prevention activities involving multiple state offices including the Department of Aging, Department of Corrections, Department of Health, and State Police, as well as key stakeholder groups throughout the state including the Veterans Affairs. In 2012 , the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention was revised. Pennsylvania's state plan for suicide prevention is in the process of being reviewed and updated to include what is in the current National Strategy. Pennsylvania Page 17 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 28 of 323The Pennsylvania Adult/Older Adult Suicide P revention Coalition merged with Feeling Blue Suicide Prevention Council to become a 501(c)3 non -profit organization. The Coalition currently has 363 members, and has expanded its Board of Directors to include members from most regions of the state. The B oard also has various Committees for Coalition members to serve on: Executive, Finance, Training, and Communications. The Communications Committee is fostering a relationship in facilitating the exchange of information between the Coalition and local coun ty task forces. The Coalition has expanded its infrastructure by creating a website, www.preventsuicidepa.org . The Coalition has also created a quarterly newsletter. The Coalition sponsored 30 Question P ersuade and Refer (QPR) trainings since July 2011. Two regional Suicide Prevention Training Forums and one Strategic Planning for Suicide Prevention training were held in the second half of 2011. The Coalition is currently in the process of planning two events for 2013, an annual Statewide Conference and a Veterans Symposium. Supporting veterans is a priority of the Coalition. OMHSAS is also sponsoring a member of the Suicide Prevention Coalition to attend the 46th Annual Conference of the American Asso ciation of Suicidology to be held in Austin, Texas in April 2013. In 2011 Pennsylvania was awarded a second Federal grant to continue statewide efforts to prevent youth suicide and promote early intervention. Awarded by SAMHSA, the grant provides Pennsyl vania with $477,706 for three years to continue efforts that promote early intervention, assessment services to at -risk youth, and collaboration among programs and services. The new grant has expanded to include six counties in the southeast ( Berks, Buck s, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery and Philadelphia ) and two counties in the west ( Allegheny and Westmoreland ), in addition to Monroe County and the counties covered under the original grant (Lackawanna, Luzerne, and Schuylkill). Through the grant, called Y outh Suicide Prevention in Primary Care (YSP -PC), the Department will continue to partner with Primary Care Offices to screen youth ages 14 -24 and coordinate referrals with local behavioral health providers for community mental health treatments as well as provide immediate support and information and resources to families. YSP-PC will give primary care providers the resources necessary to increase their knowledge of, and comfort with, assessing for suicide risk, increase the identification of youth at increased risk for suicide, and increase the number of youth referred from primary care who successfully engage in behavioral health treatment. The grant will expand YSP -PC to at least 30 primary care practices by the third year of the project, enabling over 7,500 youth to be screened annually. In year one of the renewal grant, a new partnership was solidified with the newly established Pennsylvania Physical Health/Behavioral Health Learning Community (PH/BH LC). This statewide group consists of representa tives from the State Departments of Welfare and Health; the stat medical, psychiatric, psychological and social work associations; and a number of advocacy groups across the state. The vision of the PH/BH LC is to \"advance Commonwealth wide efforts to imp rove the provider focused planning, policy development, communications, Pennsylvania Page 18 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 29 of 323and practice enhancing collaboration and coordination of care between behavioral health providers and primary care providers serving Pennsylvania residents of all ages. Compeer Com peer matches caring, sensitive and trained volunteers in one -to-one friendships with adults and older adults referred by mental health professionals. The PCC (Pennsylvania Compeer Coalition) has 9 active Compeer affiliates throughout the state. Representat ives from PCC partnered with Compeer Incorporated and submitted an application to NREPP (National Registry for Evidence Based and Promising Practices) for potential national recognition as an evidence - based practice. The application is currently in the re view process. Compeer Inc. is looking to begin a new pilot program called CompeerCorps \"Vet to Vet\" program, which is currently operating as a pilot program in several counties in New York. CompeerCorps fosters elements of mentoring, support and camarade rie. These elements provide natural supports and help lower the cost of treatment by reducing crisis services, intervention, and dependency on behavioral health systems for veterans who are affected by mental injury or illness. Pennsylvania is collaborat ing with Compeer Inc. to begin several pilot programs as well. A statewide Compeer retreat will be held in April 2013 where representatives from all Pennsylvania programs will be in attendance. The last retreat was held in April 2012. Those in attendanc e received training in QPR (Question, Persuade and Refer) Gatekeeper Suicide Prevention , WRAP PALS, and Compeer: Where Recovery, Peer Support and Community Integration Unite . Family Support Services Family Support Services refers to supportive services provided to persons with mental illness and their families. These services are designed to enable persons with mental illness to live at home with minimal stress or disruption to the family unit, or to enable the person to live independently in the commun ity. Peer Support Services Pennsylvania's peer specialist initiative continued to grow and develop over the past year. Currently, more than 2,500 individuals have met the 75 -hour, 10 -day training requirement to become Certified Peer Specialists (CPS) and nearly 1,000 individuals ha ve been trained as supervisors of CPS. Pennsylvania currently has the largest cadre of CPS of all states. An estimated 55% to 60% of CPS are employed either full -time or part -time primarily in Medicaid - funded peer support services; however, CPS are conti nuing to find other field -related employment opportunities and opportunities for career advancement. As of February 2013, Pennsylvania has 93 approved and licensed peer support service programs. Pennsylvania has undertaken multiple peer support initia tives. Over the past year Pennsylvania has developed a one -day, five -hour documentation training course for CPS to enhance their Medicaid documentation skills. Moreover, Pennsylvania, in collaboration with the Temple University Collaborative on Community Inclusion, is administering a survey of 200 -300 recipients of peer support services at targeted peer support providers. Pennsylvania intends to use the survey data to refine the delivery of peer support services in the Commonwealth. In addition, Pennsyl vania's Department of Corrections is instituting the 75 -hour, 10 -day CPS training program within its facilities and has trained roughly 100 CPS so far, 10 percent of whom are serving life sentences. Finally, Pennsylvania has developed two curricula \u2014a one -day, face - Pennsylvania Page 19 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 30 of 323to-face training course and an online training course \u2014for CPS in supporting individuals with employment goals. Pennsylvania has also produced a policy guidance paper for CPS that identifies Medicaid -reimbursable employment services. Forensic S ervices A Center of Excellence (CoE) for the development and improvement of programs serving adults with mental illness involved in the criminal justice system was established in 2010 through a joint grant to Drexel University and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center to act as a clearinghouse for information and resources related to criminal justice, mental health, and substance abuse. Activities and priorities of the CoE are guided by the Advisory Committee and include cross -systems mapping for counti es. To date, 27 counties have successfully completed cross -systems mapping workshops and 6 counties are waiting to complete their session. In addition the CoE has completed a cross -systems mapping for the PA Department of Corrections as it relates to ind ividuals with mental illness serving a state sentence. The CoE completed a survey of 33 county law enforcement and criminal justice offices. Of those surveyed, 56% identified needs focused on training for behavioral health issues. In partnership with Pennsylvania Mental Health Consumers Association (PMHCA) and Drexel University, OMHSAS developed a forensic peer support curriculum and trained 100 individuals throughout the state. In addition, a total of 14 individuals have been trained as trainers. In collaboration with Pennsylvania Department of Corrections (DoC), a curriculum for Certified Peer Specialist training has been developed. A total of 5 trainings were conducted throughout various State Correctional Institutions and a total of 90 incarcerat ed individuals were trained as Certified Peer Specialists. In partnership with the Department of Corrections, OMHSAS is assisting in the development of a Train the Trainer program to help expand and sustain the Certified Peer Specialist program throughout all State Correctional Institutions. Criminal Justice Mental Health Advisory Committee, a collaborative effort between OMHSAS and the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency (PCCD), advocates the \"Sequential Intercept Model\" as a best practic e for mental health consumers in the criminal justice system. This model delineates five points of interception; (1) Law Enforcement and Emergency Services; (2) Initial Detention and Initial Hearings; (3) Jail, Courts, Forensic Evaluations, and Forensic Co mmitments; (4) Reentry from Jails, State Prisons, and Forensic Hospitalization; and (5) Community Corrections and Community Support . Each point of contact provides an opportunity to divert mental health consumers from funneling further into the criminal j ustice system. Based on the most recent Forensic Plans submitted by the counties in the state , forty -one (41) County MH/MR offices (out of 48) have services in all five intercepts. Forty -six (46) counties/joinders have initiatives pertaining to Intercept 1, while forty -three (43) counties/joinders have initiatives on Intercept 2. Forty -seven (47) counties/joinders have stated they have initiatives to address Intercept 3, forty -seven (47) counties/joinders have initiatives around Intercept 4, and forty -six (46) counties/joinders stated they have initiatives related to Intercept 5. Pennsylvania Page 20 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 31 of 323Mobile Mental Health Mobile Mental Health Treatment (MMHT) is an array of services for individuals who have encountered barriers to, or have been unsuccessful in, rece iving services in an outpatient clinic. MMHT has been an in -plan Medicaid service since 2006. The purpose of MMHT is to enhance the array of services by providing treatment traditionally offered in an outpatient clinic in the least restrictive setting po ssible to reduce the need for more intensive levels of service. MMHT encompasses evaluation and treatment, including individual, group and family therapy, as well as medication visits, in an individual's residence or other appropriate community -based settings. The target population for MMHT consists of adults 21 years of age or older who meet the medical necessity guidelines for psychiatric outpatient services, and have a medical or psychiatric condition that impairs their ability to participate in psych iatric outpatient services, or have one or more significant psychosocial stressors that impair their ability to participate, or preclude participation, in psychiatric outpatient clinic services. Adult Developmental Training (ADT) Adult Developmental Trai ning programs are community -based programs designed to facilitate the acquisition of prevocational skills, enhance activities of daily living, and improve independent living skills. As a prerequisite for work -oriented programming, ADT programs concentrate on improving cognitive development, communication development, physical development, and working skills development. Adult development training programs are provided in facilities licensed under Adult Day Centers regulations. Services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Discussed under Criterion 3. Case Management Services In Pennsylvania, mental health case management services are categorized as Administrative Case Management and Targeted Case Management. Targeted Ca se Management includes Intensive Case Management, Resource Coordination, and Blended Case Management. Administrative Case Management Administrative Case Management refers to those activities and administrative functions undertaken to ensure intake of consumers into the county mental health system so that they can access available resources and specialized services. The activities include, but are not limited to: Processing intake into the Base Service Unit; Verifying disability; Determining liability; Authorizing services; Maintaining records and case files; Pennsylvania Page 21 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 32 of 323Targeted Case Management Targeted Case Management (TCM) is provided in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to adults with severe and persistent mental illness, and children with a serious emotional disturbance who are eligible for Medical Assistance under the State Plan as categorically needy (aged, blind, disabled -eligible for SSI, and families and children who are eligible for TANF), and medically needy (aged, blind, disabled, families an d children). Consumers who meet the medical necessity criteria for targeted case management, but are not eligible for Medicaid and do not have other means to pay could be eligible for targeted case management services paid for from state funds. Targeted Case Management services are administered either directly by the County MH/MR administrations or by the providers contracted by the County MH/MR administrations. Targeted Case Management services are available in the entire state. Authorized under Secti on 1915(g) of the Social Security Act, Case Management services are services that will assist mentally ill individuals eligible under the State Plan in gaining access to needed medical, social, educational and other services. OMHSAS continues to introduce innovative case management practices to facilitate recovery for adults and resiliency for children. This is consistent with the guiding principle to provide services that are responsive to an individual's unique strengths and needs. The following are the categories of Targeted Case Management services provided in Pennsylvania: Intensive Case Management: Intensive Case Management (ICM) provides assistance to persons with serious and persistent mental illness in a variety of ways and is intended to assist the consumer to achieve specific outcomes such as independent living, vocational/educational participation, adequate social supports and reduced hospitalization. Intensive Case Managers coordinate efforts to gain access to needed resources such as medica l, social, educational, and other resources through natural supports, generic community resources and specialized mental health treatment, rehabilitation and support services. Resource Coordination: Resource Coordination (RC) is targeted to individuals with serious and persistent mental illness who do not need the intensity and frequency of contacts provided through Intensive Case Management, but who do need assistance in accessing, coordinating, and monitoring resources and services. Resource Coordina tion services assess an individual's strengths and needs, and assist the person to access resources and services in order to achieve stability in the community. Blended Case Management: In the Blended Case Management model, an individual is able to keep the same \"blended case manager\" despite a change in level of service need, from ICM to RC level or RC to ICM level. This model does not change the Case Management services being delivered, b ut rather how these services are delivered. It was theorized that by permitting the blended case manager to adjust service intensity based on consumer need, there would be improved continuity of care for the individual receiving services. In essence, the blended case manager would provide either ICM or RC level of service, essentially eliminating the distinction between RC and ICM. There are other ways that consumers receive case management -like services that are not distinctly identified as Case Management, and are n ot currently captured by existing data collection systems as Case Management, including: community treatment teams, the case Pennsylvania Page 22 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 33 of 323management provided by primary therapists, and finally, case management -like activities provided by peers, friends, families, natur al supports and other human service systems OMHSAS believes Case Management is a core service, and a lot of emphasis is placed on training case managers. Two training institutes (Drexel University Behavioral Health Education, Penn State Education and Hea lth Services, Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic) provide core Case Management training, approved and required by the state, to all new case managers. A biennial \"refresher\" training for all case managers was also mandated beginning in 2012. Servic es for Persons with Co -Occurring (Substance Abuse/Mental Health) Disorders Co-occurring services continue to be supported as a collaborative effort between the Department of Public Welfare, Office of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services and the Depar tment of Health. This collaboration began in 1997 with the convening of a statewide stakeholder workgroup charged with developing recommendations for a system of care that would meet the needs of individuals diagnosed with a co -occurring substance use and psychiatric disorder. Four key areas were identified to transform the existing system: competent workforce, co-occurring training courses, clinical standards, and adolescent services. Pennsylvania has made progress in the aforementioned areas and contin ues to work towards true integration of the behavioral health system. The state collaborated with the Pennsylvania Certification Board (PCB) to develop a co - occurring disorders certification process for clinical professionals. The Certified Co -Occurring Disorders Professional (CCDP) credential requires documentation of education, clinical experience, supervision, and completion of a written examination. Over 1,000 professionals in Pennsylvania have received this credential. In January of 2007, the Inter national Certification and Reciprocity Consortium (IC&RC) announced it would offer an international and reciprocal certification for clinicians working with individuals with co -occurring substance use and psychiatric disorders. This international credenti al was based upon the Pennsylvania certification model. Professionals continue to meet the criteria and test for this credential. Training opportunities to enhance clinical skills related to co -occurring disorders continue to be provided by Drexel Universi ty, Western Psychiatric Institute, as well as other entities in a variety of locations across the state. Additionally, the state has provided web -based training opportunities in partnership with the Institute for Research, Education, and Training in Addict ions (IRETA). The Departments of Public Welfare, OMHSAS, and the Department of Health, Division of Drug and Alcohol Program Licensure issued a joint Bulletin outlining the core competency criteria for any licensed treatment program to achieve to be certi fied as a co -occurring competent program in the Commonwealth. The bulletin criteria could be applied to any level of care for either a mental health or substance use program. It allowed programs with a single license to expand their programs to serve ind ividuals with a co -occurring disorder. Licensed facilities continue to use the Bulletin criteria to shape their programs to become competent to provide services to individuals with co -occurring disorders. Pennsylvania Page 23 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 34 of 323To continue to develop a true integrated treatmen t system that would create minimal burden on the existing provider network, the Departments, in conjunction with a statewide stakeholder workgroup, developed a set of integrated treatment regulations applicable to outpatient facilities. The goal is to hav e each Department promulgate the same set of regulations which will allow licensed facilities to provide integrated treatment under a single licensure framework. The draft regulations were completed at the end of the previous administration and were not p romulgated. The draft regulations remain an interest for OMHSAS moving forward and are a part of the current regulatory review process requested by the new administration. Stakeholders continue to support the integrated treatment regulations. Various r egional coalitions continue to develop co -occurring programming resources and support training opportunities for professionals. The counties and MCOs have partnered to increase access to co -occurring services and supports across the state. Other Activiti es Leading to Reduction of Hospitalization Pennsylvania has two approaches to impacting the rate of hospitalization: 1) the development of new services designed specifically to meet the needs of persons with serious mental illness or serious emotional disturbance; and 2) the reduction of available state mental hospital beds through the Community Hospital Integration Program Project (CHIPP) and other funding sources. The Community/Hospital Program Project (CHIPP) is a state initiative, in partnership with local county mental health programs, that enables the discharge of people served in Pennsylvania state hospitals, who have extended lengths of stay or complex service needs, to less restrictive community -based programs and supports. CHIPP was designed to develop the needed resources for successful community placement of individuals that include: Case Management services, residential services and rehabilitation/treatment services. CHIPP was created to build local community capacity for diversionary serv ices to prevent unnecessary future hospitalizations. CHIPP is dependent on the involvement of the consumer and family in the design, implementation, and monitoring of individual Community Support Plans. CHIPP was built upon Community Support Program prin ciples that require consumers, family members and persons in recovery be involved in the decision making process. Details regarding how CHIPPs initiative works: County submits a proposal to the state for CHIPP discharges as part of annual plan. Assessmen ts are completed with people identified for likely CHIPP discharge County submits CHIPP budget to state for approval County works with local area provider agencies to begin the discharge process and identify best match of consumers State hospital beds are closed as people are discharged State transfers state hospital funds to the county budget to support those discharged CHIPP funding is annualized Process takes approximately 12 months to complete History of CHIPPs Pennsylvania Page 24 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 35 of 323 CHIPP builds community capacity and infra structure through transition of funds to meet consumer needs in the community. Approximately 4 people can be served in the community with the funds needed to support 1 person in a state hospital. Started in fiscal year 1991/92 with an initial funding of $6 .5 million . As of the end of January 2013, hospital census for the six state hospitals was 1 421 (including both civil and forensic populations). This signifies a decrease of 32 from the census (1452) at the beginning of July 2012. More than 87% of the sta te mental health budget is now spent on community - based services. With the closure of Allentown State Hospital in December 2010, only six state hospitals remain in Pennsylvania. Through CHIPP -funded opportunities, 3134 people have been discharged since in ception (including those expected to be discharged through June 2013) . By June 2013, total funding of $3,234.2 million will have been distributed to support discharge and transition to community. During FY 2012/13, Community Hospital Integration Project Program (CHIPP) funding included annualizing 90 CHIPPs at Norristown State Hospital. The CHIPP/SIPP funding for FY 2012/13 is $244.2 million. Positive Practice Resource Team (PPRT) The Positive Practice Resource Team (PPRT) is a joint initiative between OMHSAS and the Office of Developmental Programs (ODP) to serve those individuals with a dual diagnosis of mental health challenges and developmental delays. The goals of this initiative are twofo ld: To build capacity within the provider network in Pennsylvania to serve dually diagnosed individuals (MH/MR). This is accomplished by providing consultative/educational services to the provider network. To encourage state hospital diversion through th e provision of consultative services that assist the provider in continuing to serve the consumer in their home environment. All referrals for PPRT services are obtained through the consumer's county of residence. After a review of the present situatio n, a PPRT team is organized to assist the consumer, the provider and the county. All team members are state employees of either a Pennsylvania State Hospital or Pennsylvania State ODP Center. Team members, along with regional office staff (OMHSAS and ODP ) and county staff meet with the consumer, the provider, and the county, to assess the present situation. The consumer's present crisis, barriers to obtaining services, medical concerns, and any other identified issues are assessed. A work plan for meeti ng the needs of the consumer is developed and shared with all team members. PPRT teams, on average, meet with the consumer/provider/county for 3 -4 visits before concluding the referral. In the event that another crisis occurs, teams can be re -activated t o serve the parties involved. Since its inception in 2006, PPRT has served a total of 416 consumers with a dual diagnosis of intellectual disabilities and mental health challenges. In 2011 there were 64 referrals for PPRT services from across the Commonw ealth. Of these 63 individuals, a possible Pennsylvania Page 25 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 36 of 323state hospital/state center admission was discussed or considered for 28 individuals. However, following PPRT intervention, 16 of these individuals were admitted to a state hospital/center. Due to a change in a dmission policy within the state hospitals, any individual who is identified as having an intellectual disability must have a PPRT referral prior to admission. There were 7 individuals in 2011 slated for admission to a state hospital/center (either by the county or a county judge) that was not a previous PPRT referral. These 7 individuals had a PPRT completed after the state hospital/center admission request. After PPRT involvement, 1 of these individuals was diverted from a state hospital/center admissi on and was able to continue residing in the community. In 2012 there were 22 referrals for PPRT services from across the Commonwealth. Of these 22 individuals, a possible state hospital/center admission was discussed or considered for 10 consumers. H owever, following PPRT intervention, 7 consumers were admitted to a state hospital/center. These seven consumers include one consumer slated for an admission to a state hospital/center that did not have a previous PPRT. She was admitted to a State Center prior to referral being formulated. Due to changes in 2012, all consumers being considered for a state hospital admission must be assessed by qualified staff to determine if a state hospitalization is appropriate. There were 2 reviews done in 2012. One of these individuals was admitted to a State Hospital. The State continues to refine and improve the referral process in response to input from the counties and the staff that serve on the team. OMHSAS has developed a plan of action for the county and the providers to follow for future crisis events. OMHSAS also developed a Pre - PPRT course of action for counties and providers to follow to ensure that all interventions and resources are utilized at the first signs of impending difficulties. OMHSAS cur rently has over 230 volunteer staff from the state hospitals/centers involved in the PPRT initiative. These professional staff members serve on PPRT teams in addition to their primary job commitments. Money Follows the Person (MFP): In 2010 - 2011, 8 individuals were transitioned from state hospitals into the community utilizing the MFP demonstration program. In 2011 , OMHSAS applied for and received 100% federal funding for 3 full -time staff positions dedicated to MFP: one Human Serv ices Program Specialist Supervisor to coordinate and oversee the MFP demonstration program within OMHSAS, one Adult Transition Coordinator to work with transitioning adults from State Hospitals, and one Youth Transition Coordinator to work with youth under 21 to transition from Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities (RTF). OMHSAS continues to partner with the State Hospitals to review individuals for MFP eligibility on a regular basis. Currently, effort is being made to update the protocol for nurs ing home referrals from the state hospitals with the intention of diverting more individuals into community -based living. A proposal to transition persons under the age of 21 in Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities (PRTF) through Pennsylvania's MFP program has been approved by CMS. OMHSAS is pursuing different options to move forward with this addition to the program . Pennsylvania Page 26 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 37 of 323Criterion 2: Mental Health System Data Epidemiology (a) Estimate of Prevalence The newest federal prevalence estimates released in July 2010 indicate that there are 538,690 adults aged 18 and older with Serious Mental Illness in Pennsylvania. This is 5.4% of the total civilian population of age 18 and over (9, 975,732 ). The estimates also indicate that Pennsylvania has 14 3,892 children {age 9 -17, level of functioning less than or equal to 60 (average of low and high)} with Serious Emotional Disturbance (S ED). The following tables show the number of distinct adults (age 18 and above) and children (age 17 and below) that received mental health services during the state FY periods indicated in the tables: *Number of Adult Consumers Served Under HealthChoi ces Fiscal Year totals are unduplicated within each payment stream (i.e. HealthChoices, FFS). There may be some duplication between the two payment streams in the FY totals. * 2010/11 was the most recent FY for which complete information was available. (b) Quantitative Targets OMHSAS continue s to encourage the trend towards moving funding from state administration to county administration. For the proposed 2013/14 budget, it is estimated that 87% of state dollars ($3,434,292,571) will be under county administration, with only 13% of funds ($509,963,494) under state administration. During FY 2012/13, Community Hospital Integration Project Program (CHIPP) funding included annualizing 90 CHIPPs at Norristown State Hospital. Pennsylvania Page 27 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 38 of 323As of January 1, 2013: 1.852 million people were enrolled HealthChoices -Behavioral Health (HC -BH). The projected HC fiscal year 2013/14 is $2.9 billion. OMHSAS continues to research the possibility of using a different instrument and mechanism for collecting and reporting outcomes data. Currently, a customized version of the Mental Health Statistics Improvement Program (MHSIP) report card survey instrument is being utilized to survey adult consumers and family members. In 2012, we s ent surveys to 5,000 adults, 5,000 families, and about 1,700 adult consumers of peer services. Our response rate for those mailings was about 30%. This was an increase from about 17% in previous years, due in part to our using reminder postcards that were sent a week after the initial mailing. Medicaid Targets Specific to Children's Services Based on the expenditure data from the past fiscal year, it is estimated that $1,046,972,033 of HealthChoices (Pennsylvania's Medicaid managed Care Program) funding will be spent on inpatient, residential, and community based services for children in FY 2013/14 . In addition to the Health Choices funding, it is estimated that $27,335,231 Medicaid fee for services (FFS) dollars will be spent on inpatient, residential, and community based services for children. These numbers do not include services funded fully with state, local, or grant (federal or other) dollars. The following chart shows the breakdown of Health Choices and fee for services funding for various childr en's services: Service Name HC Expenditures Inpatient Psychiatric $75,195,334 Inpatient D & A $5,946 Non Hospital D & A $2,028,041 Outpatient Psychiatric $116,908,944 Outpatient D & A $8,850,139 Behavioral Health Rehab Services $553,107,374 RTF - Accredited $110,188,239 RTF - Non Accredited $35,339,445 Ancillary Support $668,365 Other Community Support $4,277,712 Inpatient D & A $10,785 Outpatient Psychiatric $6,966,507 Outpatient D & A $45,455 Pennsylvania Page 28 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 39 of 323Behavioral Health Rehab Services $12,474,360 RTF - Accredited $1,852,186 RTF - Non Accredited $533,016 Ancillary Support $9,444 Community Support Services (CSS) $1,165,766 Crisis $67,537 Family Based $829,445 ICM/RC $268,784 Total $27,335,231 Criterion 3: Children's Services Child and Adolescent Service System Program (CASSP) Pennsylvania is guided by the Child and Adolescent Service System Program (CASSP) for the development and delivery of services to children and adolescents with serious emotional disorders and their families. The CASSP principles require that services prov ided be child - centered, family -focused, community -based, multi -system, culturally competent, and least restrictive/intensive. Each county or joinder has at least one person identified as a CASSP or children's behavioral health coordinator who serves as th e contact person for children with multi -system needs. This comprehensive and effective system of care recognizes that children and adolescents with severe emotional disorders and behavioral health needs often require services from more than one child -serving system. Behavioral Health Rehabilitation Services Behavioral Health Rehabilitation Services (BHRS) are individualized, based on the specific needs of the child and family, and built on the strengths of the child and family. Specific BHR services av ailable through Pennsylvania's expanded Medical Assistance Program for children up to age 21 include: mobile therapy, therapeutic staff support, behavioral specialist consultation and other unique services developed for individual children/adolescents. Ch ildren must be Medical Assistance eligible and a licensed practitioner must establish medical necessity for services. Interagency teams are utilized to review recommendations and plan services for the child and their family. Children and families must be included in the interagency team meeting. Pennsylvania System of Care Partnership Pennsylvania has been awarded a federal grant to develop Systems of Care to serve youth ages 8 -18 that have serious mental health needs, and their families. These youth are also involved with child welfare or juvenile justice, and are in, or at risk of, out -of-home placement. The $9 million grant from SAMHSA covers 6 years and will be implemented in fifteen Pennsylvania counties. With this grant, Pennsylvania has joined the national movement to utilize organized, multi -level and multi -disciplinary systems, in partnership with youth and families, to more effectively serve multi -system youth with serious behavioral health challenges and their families . Pennsylvania Page 29 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 40 of 323The System of Care Partnership builds on and enhances cross -systems efforts that have been underway for several years to integrate and more effectively provide services to youth. Each participating county will utilize High Fidelity Wraparound (HFW) as the engagement and car e planning process for 25 - 50 youth annually, with over 1,000 youth and families to be served during the course of the cooperative agreement with SAMHSA. The Youth and Family Training Institute, a division of the University of Pittsburgh and Western Psych iatric Institute and Clinic of UPMC, will train, support, monitor, and evaluate the HFW teams in each county. The initial counties, Erie, York, Lehigh, Chester and Montgomery counties began in 2010 and in 2011 were joined by Philadelphia. In 2012, 5 add itional counties, Crawford, Venango, Northampton, Northumberland and Greene were approved to be in the next wave of system of care counties. The goal is to eventually expand the structured approach of System of Care development to all Pennsylvania counties . Early Childhood Mental Health OMHSAS has been working with the Office of Child Development and Early Learning (OCDEL) and other program offices in the Department of Public Welfare to promote healthy social -emotional development in young children whil e also preventing challenging behaviors. One model that is being used is Early Childhood Mental Health (ECMH) consultation, which addresses current emotional and behavioral challenges with the purpose of preventing the need for more intensive intervention in the child's future. The project has been implemented statewide, through the regional offices of the Pennsylvania Key. Early care and learning facilities enrolled in OCDEL's Keystone STARS quality improvement program have access to the services of an early childhood mental health consultant. The ECMH consultation project works closely with practitioners in early care and learning facilities to help them create environments that assist healthy social and emotional development, and minimize challenging behavior. They also observe and possibly refer individual children who are experiencing difficulties. The project enhances the practitioners' capacity to encourage development of positive relationships and create a learning environment that promotes pos itive behaviors. In the most challenging scenarios, and as appropriate, the county CASSP Coordinators help the ECMH consultants through the referral process to the mental health system. OMHSAS offers a child psychiatrist who is available to provide phone and e -mail clinical consultation services to the ECMH consultants. The psychiatrist is also available to provide professional development in early childhood mental health topics to the consultants. A contracted staff person from OMHSAS helps to promote early childhood mental health in various publications and on the web. OMHSAS is also supporting the expansion throughout the Commonwealth of Parent - Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT), an evidence -based practice especially well -suited for work with young ch ildren and their families. OMHSAS staff are members of a statewide steering committee for a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health that will help to training clinicians from at least 70 agencies across the state in PCIT. Behavioral health man aged care organizations are also assisting counties in providing training in PCIT. Pennsylvania Page 30 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 41 of 323 Family -Based Mental Health Services Pennsylvania's model of intensive in -home services is called Family -Based Mental Health Services (FBMHS). Family -Based services are team -delivered, rapid response, time - limited, holistic treatment and support, that provide clinical intervention for families including skill-building, crisis management, linkages to community services and family support services. The guiding principle is that children thrive in their own homes and communities. Families are partners and resources in treatment planning and delivery. FBMHS teams are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They also ensure coordination of services among all child -serving agencies. Children must have a serious emotional disturbance and be determined at risk for out of home placement, and at least one adult member of the child's family must agree to participate in the service. The Children's Bureau has been collaborat ing with the three approved FBMHS trainers to strengthen the role of the clinical supervisor in the model which will in turn strengthen the clinical service delivery to families. The process involves intensifying the role of the supervisor within the train ing program; requiring all staff to pass certification requirements and modifying the exam process to reflect the certification requirements. Evidence Based Practices (EBP's) The Children's Bureau continues to meet with Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency (PCCD), Office of Children Youth and Families (OCYF), and the Center for Evidence Based Practices to coordinate roles related to funding, data collection, and technical assistance to providers. The Bureau also works to utilize appropriate resources to identify further EBPs and promising practices. These meetings have been instrumental in supporting the implementation of EBPs in Pennsylvania and have resulted in the development of a new data system to better monitor the outcomes of EBPs in the Commonwealth. In addition to coordination with state partners for EBPs OMHSAS also conducts annual site visits to ensure providers are meeting Medical Assistance standards, as well as maintaining fidelity to the national models. Multisystemic Therap y (MST) Multisystemic Therapy (MST) is an intensive family and community -based treatment program that works with youth who are at -risk for out -of home placements. It is a time -limited therapeutic program that typically provides services for four to six mo nths. MST's distinctive characteristics include 24 hour availability of staff and delivery of services in the home, school, and community. The program focuses on making improvements in the psychosocial functioning of the youth and family. Family interve ntions are aimed at promoting parental capacities to monitor the adolescent's behaviors and to provide effective discipline. MST peer interventions focus on removing youth from their deviant group of peers and encouraging pro -social peer relationships. Currently there are 14providers of MST in Pennsylvania, operating a total of 48 teams. All of these programs are enrolled in Medical Assistance. MST providers are approved to bill Medical Assistance for youth served in 47 counties. The target population is adolescents who Pennsylvania Page 31 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 42 of 323exhibit severe or chronic acting out behaviors, many of whom have been involved with Juvenile Probation due to delinquent activities. Functional Family Therapy (FFT) : Functional Family Therapy (FFT) is an outcome -driven, evidence -based intervention program that treats at -risk adolescents and their families. The program includes children and adolescents from 11 to 18 years of age. It focuses on targeting risk and protective factors in the family system that can be changed, and then sys tematically working to make the necessary modifications. The treatment interventions address known causes of delinquency that are related to peer and family dynamics along with school and community factors. There are currently 10 FFT sites in the Commonw ealth that have been approved by OMHSAS for Medical Assistance funding. The Children's Bureau, in conjunction with the OMHSAS Field Offices, has conducted site reviews of FFT providers. The reviews are based on an extensive survey tool that assesses com pliance with a variety of FFT practices along with state regulations and policies. Respite Services: Respite care is defined as temporary short -term care that helps a family take a break from the daily routine and stress associated with caring for a chi ld with serious emotional and/or behavioral disorders. Respite care can be provided to families on either a planned or unplanned basis and can take place in the family's home or in a variety of out of home settings. Respite care is used to help prevent f amily disruptions, allow families the time they need to renew their energy. It also enables them to continue caring for their children at home and prevent out -of- home placement of a child with serious emotional disturbances and behavioral difficulties. Many County MH/MR Programs in Pennsylvania provide some respite services for families whose children receive behavioral health services. OMHSAS wants to support counties in their efforts to better meet the respite needs of families. The Pennsylvania State Budget for Fiscal Years 2007 -2008, 2008 -2009 and 2009 -2010 included $500,000 each year for all county MH/MR Programs to receive funds for respite services. The formula used to determine allocation of funds is based on the number of children served in counties' behavioral health system in 2007. For example, if a county served 10% of the total number of children served in the state, that county received 10% of the available funds. In 2012 -2013 the total respite allocation awarded was $451,860 and no county received more than $101,366. The chart below shows statistical data from FY 2011 -2012 and the previous Fiscal Years: Fiscal Year 2011 -2012 Fiscal Year 2010 -2011 Fiscal Year 2009 -2010 Amount of allocation spent 95 percent 94 percent 91 percent Number of counties spending 90% - 100% of allocation 37 36 34 Number of 1,137 1,694 1,369 Pennsylvania Page 32 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 43 of 323unduplicated children served Number of of respite provided 57,304 51,047 67,185 Number of days/weeks of respite provided 256 days/night 508 524 days Unspent allocation 3 counties/joinders spent less than half the money allocated to them (reasons for not spending the allocation included liability issues, criminal clearance issues, and lack of providers) 5 counties/ joinders spent less tha n half of the money allocated to them (reasons for not spending the allocation included delay in receipt of funds, lack of providers, and liability issues) 8 counties/joinders spent less than half of the money allocated to them (reasons for not spending th e allocation included delay in receipt of funds, lack of providers, and liability issues) The table below illustrates the final FY 20 12-2013 Respite Allocation for each County: County 33 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Page Utilized $451,860 School Based Behavioral Health (SBBH) The Children's Bureau is working in conjunction with the Department of Education to ensure that schools are supportive environments that maximize learning, and promote healthy social, emotional, and behavioral development. SBBH brings together schools, county mental health programs, and community resources to develop a conti nuum of services that enable children to have their educational and mental health needs met within their school districts. The Children's Bureau is moving forward in several areas of the state to support school -based mental health initiatives. Pennsylv ania began implementing School -Wide Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (SWPBIS) through a small pilot project four years ago. Currently, over 200 schools in Pennsylvania are in some stage of the implementation process. As of spring 2012, SWPB IS has been fully implemented in 74 elementary schools, 13 middle schools, 10 high schools and 14 k - 12 schools, and long -term high fidelity SWPBIS is likely to occur. In addition, the Pennsylvania Page 34 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 45 of 323Commonwealth has been supporting the growth of program -wide PBIS in the Early Childhood learning setting. Outpatient Psychiatric Clinic Services Outpatient mental health services are delivered in a community treatment setting under medical supervision. Services include examination, diagnosis, and treatment for children and adolescents with serious emotional disturbance. Outpatient services are delivered on a planned and regularly -scheduled basis. Satellite outpatient clinics may provide services to children in schools, detention centers, or childcare facilities. Partial Hos pitalization Services Partial hospitalization is a nonresidential form of treatment in a freestanding or school - based program providing 3 -6 hours per day of structured treatment and support services to enable children to return to, or remain at, home, in school and in their com munity. Activities include therapeutic recreation, individual, family and group therapies, and social skill development. Persons receiving this level of care do not require 24 -hour care, but do require more intensive and comprehensive services than are o ffered in outpatient clinic programs. Children attending partial programs must have a moderate to severe mental or emotional disorder. Community Residential Rehabilitation Services Community Residential Rehabilitation Services (CRRS) are transitional re sidential programs delivered in community settings. They provide short -term, out -of-home, therapeutic living environments in a family setting, with personal assistance and a full range of psychosocial rehabilitation services. CRRS are for children and ad olescents who display severe interpersonal adjustment problems and who require an intensive, structured living environment. The child or adolescent must be under the age of 18, an un -emancipated minor, and have demonstrated, over a period of time, maladapt ive interpersonal behavior that significantly impairs the child's functioning within the family and among peers. Residential Treatment Facilities Residential treatment facilities (RTF) provide a 24 -hour care where children and adolescents receive intensiv e and structured comprehensive behavioral health services. The RTF works actively with the family and other agencies to create brief, intense treatment that will result in the child's successful return home or to a less restrictive community living settin g. The child/adolescent must have a serious emotional disorder, be Medical Assistance eligible, and have the medical necessity for that level of care. Psychiatric Inpatient Hospitalization Psychiatric inpatient hospitalization is the most intensive and r estrictive treatment setting for treating children and adolescents. This highly structured environment provides acute treatment interventions, diagnostic evaluations, stabilization and treatment planning so that the child can be quickly stabilized and app ropriately discharged to less restrictive services. The child/adolescent must have a serious emotional disturbance or mental illness. Pennsylvania Page 35 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 46 of 323Crisis Intervention and Emergency Services These services are designed to provide a rapid response to crisis situations that threaten the well - being of children, adolescents, and their families. Crisis services include intervention, assessment, counseling, screening, and disposition. Commonweal th Student Assistance Program The Commonwealth Student Assistance Program (SAP) is a state mandated multidisciplinary school -based program for students k -12. It is a systematic process designed to assist school personnel in identifying students who are ex periencing behavioral and/or academic difficulties, which pose a barrier to learning and academic success. The primary goal of SAP is to help students overcome barriers to learning so that they may achieve, remain in school and advance. SAP teams use con crete, observable behaviors to identify student's barriers to learning. SAP team members do not diagnose, treat, or refer to treatment ; however they may refer a student for a MH or D&A screening to assess the need for further treatment if needed. SAP Lia isons from county MH and D&A agencies are contracted by the schools to perform the screening and assessments and refer to treatment as necessary. Parents and guardians are vital members of the team, and must give written permission for SAP involvement. OMHSAS, the Department of Education and the Department of Health collaboratively oversee the Student Assistance Program through the PA Network of Student Assistance Programs (PNSAS), and representatives from each agency make up the SAP Interagency Committee . The Interagency Committee meets regularly to discuss and problem -solve issues as they arise. In addition, there are 10 regional coordinator positions, 5 of which are funded by OMHSAS (PDE funds the remaining 5 through a contract with the IU's.) The R egional Coordinators are responsible for the oversight of county SAP operations, as well as of the Commonwealth Approved Trainers, the statewide training network responsible for training school SAP teams. The Regional Staff members are the most direct sou rce of information and SAP coordination at the County level. In addition, the SAP training model has recently changed to a k -12 training design. CAT's were required to submit a comprehensive k -12 training design and manual for review and approval by PNSA S staff for the 2012 -2013 school year. During the 2011 -2012 school year, there were 70,032 students referred to the SAP program statewide. Of those students referred to the SAP process, 21,063 were referred for a MH, D& A or co -occurring assessment by a qualified professional or SAP Liaison Services Provided Under Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), first signed into law in 1975, established that all children with disabilities have a right to a free, appropriate public education. It offers funding and policy assistance to states in providing appropriate support services (e.g., counseling, transportation) to students with special needs. In light of si gnificant amendments to the Act in 1997 (known as IDEA 97), Pennsylvania developed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Departments of Education, Public Welfare, Health, and Labor and Industry that defines the way those departments must work tog ether to ensure appropriate educational services for children with disabilities. The reauthorization of IDEA in 2004 along with the No Child Left Behind provisions, have strengthened the partnerships created by the MOU. Pennsylvania Page 36 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 47 of 323 Individualized Education Plans ( IEP) An Individualized Education Plan (IEP) is a written education program developed for students eligible for special education services. The IEP addresses the student's needs and the educational supports and services required to meet those needs. The I EP is developed by an IEP team consisting of the student's parents, a regular education teacher, a special education teacher, a representative of the local education agency, a person qualified to interpret test results and other findings relevant to their student, and others who may have special knowledge or expertise about the educational services needed by the student. The collaborative efforts between the Departments of Education and Public Welfare have been promoting the practice of developing the IEP in conjunction with the Interagency Service Plan or Treatment Plan when appropriate for children and adolescents with serious emotional disturbance. Criterion 4: Targeted Services to Rural and Homeless Populations and Older Adults [The system/services discussed under this criterion apply to both adults as well as children/adolescents (if the services are age appropriate for children/adolescents)] . (a) Homeless Outreach and Services The following guiding principles direct the work of t he Commonwealth's Interagency Council on Homelessness: Assure that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provides a continuum of services, coordinated and delivered by agencies, which offer homeless consumers choices in the manner and amount of assistance they will need to achieve and maintain their maximum level of independence. Seek creative ways to utilize current resources and to leverage new resources to prevent homelessness and to assist the homeless population. Assure access to supportive services and af fordable housing in all areas of the state. Assure that the quantity and quality of affordable housing and services meets the needs of the homeless population. Assure that each state department and agency, in conjunction with the Council, devises plans and strategies designed to prevent homelessness and address the needs of the homeless population that are consistent with the vision statement and guiding principles. Assure that the state departments and agencies identify outcomes and strategies to monitor those outcomes. Develop and maintain state and local intergovernmental relationships to coordinate and manage resources to assure access by homeless families and individuals. Develop community partnerships with private sector businesses, foundations, lender s, civic organizations, hospitals, childcare, and community based social and treatment services to address local homeless needs. Assure the prevention of homelessness through improved discharge planning and other prevention techniques and by expanding the number of affordable accessible housing options. Pennsylvania Page 37 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 48 of 323Pennsylvania's approach to providing services to persons who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless, is to expand and improve the community programs in each locality, especially those critical suppor t services such as housing, crisis outreach, and benefit acquisition. Pennsylvania has also focused specific attention on the homeless population by developing specialized outreach and supportive and housing services, and through the utilization of state and federal funds, particularly in the large metropolitan areas of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. Every county mental health program has identified a housing specialist. The specialists receive technical assistance from OMHSAS. Alignment with SAMHSA's Str ategic Initiative #3: Military Families OMHSAS supports Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH) programs that have developed collateral contacts with local veterans' organizations to identify and enroll eligible homeless veterans. The PATH coordinator, during the site visits, strongly encourages all PATH providers to continue to make special efforts to reach veterans who are among the unsheltered homeless. Additionally, counties have been working with their local VA and other agencies that service homeless veterans and their families in establishing partnerships in order to better serve homeless veterans within the community. In the attached IUPs, counties have highlighted many different and sometimes unique activities to service veterans and their families. OMHSAS will provide support and leadership through a collaborative and comprehensive approach to increase access to appropriate services, prevent suicide, promote emotional health, and reduce homelessness among the veteran population. OMHSAS will continue to encourage the use of PATH funding to facilitate PATH -eligible innovative community -based solutions that foster access to evidence -based preven tion, treatment, and recovery support services for military service members, veterans, and their families. Alignment with SAMHSA's Strategic Initiative #4: Recovery Support In November 2006, A Plan for Promoting Housing and Recovery -Oriented Services , was drafted with support from consumers, providers, County MH/MR programs and other stakeholders, to provide guidance to County MH/MR Programs for their planning, resource allocation and development of effective supportive housing models and modernization of housing approaches. The Plan spells out specific actions for OMHSAS, its state partners and County MH/MR Programs for housing policy and development. With this, many counties began partnering with various supportive housing programs within the county to p rovide PATH related services to its PATH consumers. OMHSAS recognizes that in order for people to recover, people need a safe, stable place to live. Therefore many PATH programs provide rental assistance and security deposit payments for many of its PAT H consumers to secure stable housing and receive the range of supports they need to manage mental illnesses or other disabilities. OMHSAS also recognizes that in order for people to recover, individuals need to be full, participating members of their comm unities . Individuals with behavioral health conditions do not recover in isolation \u2014they recover with families and in the community. Therefore, PATH counties have partnered with local drop -in centers and club houses to provide community based services to its Pennsylvania Page 38 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 49 of 323PAT H consumers. This provides the much needed socially valued activity, adequate income, personal relationships, recognition and respect from others. Our PATH programs have formed successful collaborations with other community agencies in an effort to prom ote rehabilitation and support, to increase and accelerate the likelihood of recovery for those with behavioral health illnesses. Some PATH funds programs employ a peer support specialist to assist PATH consumers in their recovery journey. Additionally, OMHSAS allocates funds to programs that provide linkage and referral services to PATH consumers. Homeless Continuum of Care Steering Committee Serving as the working body to support the efforts of the Interagency Council on Homelessness, DCED and DPW/OM HSAS continue to manage the statewide Homeless Steering Committee, which addresses programs and policies to assist the homeless in the Commonwealth. The state PATH coordinator also serves on this committee. This Committee works with and through the four rural Regional Homeless Advisory Boards (RHABs) which develop and maintain a Continuum in each region, representing 55 of the state's 67 counties. The Continuum of Care Steering Committee defines and addresses those barriers which could ultimately result in homelessness for individuals and their families. Agenda for Ending Homelessness The Commonwealth developed the \"Agenda for Ending Homelessness in Pennsylvania\" to govern the work of the Interagency Council and guide the efforts of the Homeless Steer ing Committee and local Continuums of Care. Pennsylvania's Agenda for Ending Homelessness is based upon three state -driven strategies. These strategies serve as the backbone for the implementation of the Plan's Action Steps, which will occur at both th e state and local levels. Those strategies include: To improve coordination between state agencies and promote targeting of resources consistent with the state vision and guiding principles . A central part of the Agenda is to assess the effectiveness o f the current state and local housing and human service delivery systems, and to ensure that they support the above vision and guiding principles. To foster and support local efforts to end homelessness. Given the size and diversity of the Commonwealth, the health of the local network of homeless housing and service providers is a critical factor in successfully implementing the Agenda for Ending Homelessness in Pennsylvania. Since every region of the state is different, the Plan must be designed to support local participation, while accommodating regional differences. Training and technical assistance are needed to build local capacity, especially in areas of the state where resources are limited. To promote recovery -oriented housing and services for homeless individuals with serious mental illness, substance abuse and/or co -occurring disorders. The Commonwealth of Pennsylva nia and its Office of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services has embraced the recovery model for the provision of housing and services to individuals served through the mental health system, including homeless Pennsylvania Page 39 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 50 of 323individuals and families. The goals and ob jectives for preventing and ending chronic and episodic homelessness reflect the state's commitment to the recovery model for all people with serious mental illness. Currently, 55 counties (out of a total of 67 counties in the state) have formed LHOTs in which representatives from the County Office of Mental Health, Public Housing Authority, and other public and private agencies meet regularly to plan for increased availability of accessible, affordable housing opportunities for people with mental illne ss. The major purpose of the LHOT is to bring together the key stakeholders in the community to identify the housing needs of people with disabilities and to take action to meet those needs. Any local agency that is willing to dedicate time and admini strative support to the LHOT may serve as facilitator. In many of the LHOTs these roles are assumed by the County Mental Health Housing Specialist (who is also usually the county PATH coordinator if the county receives PATH funding) from the county departm ent of mental health/mental retardation.

Each CoC in Pennsylvania provided the data that they assembled for submission to HUD on the 2012 HDX, the re porting software used to report on Housing Inventory and Populations and Subpopulations for the McKinney - Vento/HEARTH Continuum of Care (CoC) application process. The number of homeless people with serious mental illness reported for each CoC includes all people with serious mental illness who were in an Emergency Shelter, Transitional Housing, Safe Haven or were unsheltered on the night of the CoC's Point -in-Time count. It does not, however, include unsheltered homeless in the four regions. They will co nduct their next unsheltered count in January 2013. While the Homeless Subpopulations Chart in the HDX is the primary data source available at the present time, OMHSAS continues to recognize the following limitations: 1. This data is collected through a Poi nt-in-Time count and does not reflect the total number of homeless individuals over the course of a year. 2. The data is based on HUD's very specific definition of homeless - those living in emergency shelters, transitional housing for the homeless, safe ha vens for homeless individuals and in places not intended for human habitation (unsheltered). 3. The data on the number of homeless who have serious mental illness is generally self - reported by the individuals being surveyed or by shelter staff or outreach wo rkers. This can result in inaccuracies and varying assumptions about what constitutes serious mental illness. We continue to strive toward generating a count of homeless with serious mental illness using the Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) in each CoC, however, currently the level of participation is not adequate for an accurate count. The PA Depart ment of Community and Economic Development (DCED) has established an HMIS for the 55 Counties included in the four rural regions of the Commonwealth as well as York and Bucks Counties.

The various CoCs have made significant progress in upgrading their systems to meet changing HUD data quality standards and in achieving full participation; however, they still do not have full coverage. In addition, domestic violence programs are not covered by the HMIS so th ere will remain a need for a manual point in time count of a portion of homeless programs in each CoC. One of the major changes in the HMIS standards that was introduced with the implementation of HPRP was a designation of people who are not homeless but received homeless prevention services. This will enable the HMIS to better report on people with mental illness who are at risk of homelessness and therefore PATH eligible. Further, in the coming year, we anticipate a higher level of participation in HMIS by PATH funded programs. Finally, through the HMIS, we will be able to generate an unduplicated count of all homeless individuals with mental illness served throughout the year, rather just a point in time count. Projects for Assistance in Transition f rom Homelessness (PATH) Created under the McKinney Act, the PATH Program is a federal formula grant that supports service delivery to individuals with serious mental illnesses, as well as individuals with co-occurring substance use disorders, who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. Since 2001, OMHSAS has employed a full time staff person to manage the PATH grant. The PATH Coordinator oversees all activities related to the PATH program and monitors County MH/MR Programs that receive PATH funds as well as the local programs they may sub -contract with. This staff pers on is also the OMHSAS point person for all homelessness -related activities. OMHSAS contracts with 24 County MH/MR Program Offices to provide PATH services. Many of the MH/MR program offices that receive the PATH grant then sub -contract with local community providers to provide PATH services. More than 5 ,000 eligible individuals receive d PATH - funded services in FY 2011. The counties and contracted providers have developed innovative PATH programs to best serve the needs of the SMI homeless populat ion in their geographical areas, with some of the recent awardees adopting evidence -based practices like Critical Time Intervention (CTI). In general, the services provided for PATH eligible individuals include: outreach; screening and diagnostic treatmen t; habilitation/rehabilitation; community mental services; alcohol or drug treatment; staff training; case management; supportive and supervisory services in residential settings; referrals for primary health; job training; educational services; an d allowable housing services. Most of the PATH programs provide services to all PATH eligible adults, while there are a few programs that focus on transition -age youth that meet the PATH eligibility criteria. The age-wise breakdown of number of individ uals served per the last completed state -wide PATH report is as follows: Age: # Served Less than 13 0 13-17 7 Pennsylvania Page 42 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 53 of 32318-34 934 35-49 963 50-64 660 65-74 97 75 and older 201 Unknown 21 (b) Services in Rural Areas Pennsylvania has a large number of residents living in rural areas, which are consistently distributed across the state. According to the Center for Rural Pennsylvania , a legislative agency of the Pennsylvania General Assembly, Pennsylvania has 48 rural counties and 19 urban counties. In 2010, nearly 3.5 million residents, or 27 percent of the state's 12.7 million residents, lived in a rural county. From 2000 to 2010, rural Pennsylvania's popu lation grew about 2 percent. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2011 American Community Survey, Public Use Microdata Sample (ACS -PUMS), in 2011, there were an estimated 15% of rural Pennsylvanians with disabilities. Among those, 51% had physical dif ficulties, followed by cognitive difficulties (43%), and independent living difficulties (34%). From 2000 to 2010, rural Pennsylvania became more racially diverse. In 2000, there were about 157,200 residents, or 5 percent of the total population, who wer e non -white and/or Hispanic. In 2010, 260,300 rural residents, or 8 percent of the total population, were non -white and/or Hispanic. At the school district level, 235 of the state's 501 public school districts are rural. In the 2009 -2010 academic year, an estimated 451,137 students were enrolled in Pennsylvania's 235 rural school districts. From 2006 to 2010, the number of rural students decreased 5 percent; Pennsylvania Department of Education's enrollment projections predict that total enrollment in r ural schools will decline by 7 percent from 2010 to 2020. Rural counties frequently utilize satellite clinics, mobile teams, or other specialized services designed for that population. Several counties have shortages of dentists, psychiatrists, psycholog ists, and social workers. Services are generally more decentralized and outreach is more evident since transportation and distance are obstacles. OMHSAS has worked collaboratively with the Office of Medical Assistance Programs (OMAP), Medical Assistance Transportation Program (MATP) providers, and consumer advocate organizations to review and assess Medical Assistance Transportation Program services, standards, and county practices, in order to improve statewide access to transportation. In many areas, m obile behavioral health services are being offered to assist individuals who may not have access to transportation. Managed Care provides many opportunities for rural counties. Under managed care, there are required services and access standards. In r ural areas services must be available within 60 minutes of travel time. In addition, emergency services must be available in one hour, urgent services in 24 hours, and routine services in 7 days. Rural counties, in order to come into compliance with mana ged care standards are required to increase both the number and array of service providers. Pennsylvania Page 43 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 54 of 323Telepsychiatry Telepsychiatry is a service shown to be effective in rural settings. Telepsychiatry is the use of electronic communication and information technologies to provide or support clinical psychiatric care at distance. The service includes evaluating patients in crisis and in need of inpatient hospitalization, assessment, medication managemen t, and psychotherapy. It is appropriate in situations where on -site services are not available due to distance, location, time of day, or availability of resources. These services would be provided by a psychiatrist or licensed psychologist within their s cope of practice using real -time, two -way interactive audio -video transmission. Currently, Pennsylvania has Telepsychiatry programs serving the counties listed below, several of which also serve children and adolescents. Beaver County Berks County Carbon County Monroe County Pike County Schuylkill County Bucks County Cambria County Clarion County Clearfield County Elk County Jefferson County Erie County Fayette County Warren County Greene County Indiana County Bradford County Luzerne Cou nty Lycoming County Cameron County McKean County Wyoming County McKean County Potter County Tioga County Somerset County York/Adams Counties Chester County Allegheny County Mifflin County Clinton County Blair County Dauphin County Cumberland County Perry County Sullivan County Lackawanna County Susquehanna County Wayne County (c) Services for Older Adults Priorities for older adults are established and monitored through the Older Adult Advisory Committee of the State Mental Health Planning C ouncil. Those priorities include systems collaboration, advocacy, training, and development of older adult services. The development of peer supports for older adults and Mobile Mental Health Treatment (MMHT) are consistent with OMHSAS' goals of supportin g recovery and resiliency. OMHSAS' objective for older adults is \"to assure that behavioral health services and supports recognize and accommodate the unique needs of older adults.\" The implementation s of peer support services and Mobile Mental Health Treatment (MMHT) in 2007 were major milestones in providing access to recovery promoting services for older adults. Pennsylvania Page 44 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 55 of 323Transformation Transfer Initiative In July 2008 OMHSAS piloted an older - adult competent, one day training class for Certified Peer Specialists (CPS) interested in learning more about working with older adults. This pilot was funded by a Transformation Transfer Initiative (TTI) grant from SAMHSA. An enhanced three day training clas s was also piloted for CPS who would like to specialize in working with older adults. Over the past year Pennsylvania has developed and expanded two 18 hour continuing education courses for CPS desiring to specialize in either Older Adult Peer Supports In December 2011 Pennsylvania was awarded a third TTI Grant. The third phase of TTI was a collaborative process with New Jersey. The grant allowed a class of 20 Peer Specialists from New Jersey to be trained in the 18 hour Certified Older Adult Peer Spec ialist Curriculum. The grant also allowed for a class of 20 PA COAPS to be trained in Wellness Coaching which was developed by the University of Medicine and Dentistry, New Jersey. Following the trainings, Pennsylvania created an internship for a COAP S/Wellness Coach in a Federally Qualified Health Center. Plans for a second COAPS/Wellness Coach internship are in development. The second internship will be housed in either the aging or housing arena. PA continues to work towards utilizing CPSs in non -traditional service settings. Collaboration with Other Systems on Older Adults OMHSAS continues to collaborate with the Department of Aging to provide support and involvement with the Pennsylvania Behavioral Health and Aging Coalition. A product of thi s collaboration is the regional Behavioral Health and Aging Forums. Five regional training forums were held in 2012. The forums focused on innovative and promising practices that county MH, Aging and Single County Authorities (SCAs) can utilize to better meet the mental health and substance use disorders needs of Older Adults. Mental Health/Aging Memorandum of Understanding Since 2006/07 all counties are required to create a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the County Offices of Mental Health a nd County Offices of Aging to address the needs of older adults in behavioral health system. OMHSAS and the Department of Aging, in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania, conducted trainings to help counties to work effectively to remove barri ers and overcome obstacles that interfere with the collaborative process. One of the most significant innovations in the development of supports for older adults is the ongoing work with \"Share the Care,\" the collaboration between the County Mental Heal th Offices and the Area Agencies on Aging (AAA) to improve consumer services and outcomes for older adults. Initially started in 2005, it was a complex care review process between Aging and OMHSAS to assist with complex care resolution in three specific c ounties. \"Share the Care\" has since evolved into a statewide initiative to foster MH/AAA partnership to address the broader needs of older adults with behavioral health and other social needs. In 2010 as part of the \"Share the Care\" initiative, an MOU wo rkbook was developed to offer technical assistance to counties in the development and/or revision of their MOUs. The Pennsylvania Page 45 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 56 of 323workbook was distributed to every County MH/MR Administrator and each Area Agency on Aging. The workbook is also available online at www.parecovery.org . Additionally, an MOU Evaluation Tool was developed and finalized in May, 2011. This tool will be used to evaluate each MOU and to help identify best and promising practices as well as counties in need of technical assistance. Each County MOU was evaluated in August 2011 by a team of reviewers comprised of Aging, Mental Health and MH Planning Council members. The MOU evaluation tool was used to identify promising practices within counties. T he tool also helped in identifying counties that may benefit from technical assistance to improve collaboration between MH, Aging and SCAs. Counties were made aware of the availability of T/A during the Regional Forums held in the spring of 2012, via emai ls sent to county programs via the PA Association of Area Agencies on aging, the PA Association of County Administrators of Mental Health and Developmental Services, and the PA County Drug and Alcohol Administrators Association. Counties were also offered TA during meetings of PBHAC, or at events in which PBHAC participated. Six counties were selected and received technical assistance. The counties identified next steps to strengthen collaboration and improve services to Older Adults. Follow -up with the counties will occur at three and six months. Pennsylvania Adult & Older Adult Suicide Prevention Plan The Pennsylvania Adult and Older Adult Suicide Prevention State Plan governs the work of the state's suicide prevention task force which consists of multiple state offices including the Department of Aging, Department of Corrections, Department of Health, and State Police, as well as key stakeholder groups throughout the state including the Veterans Affairs. Criterion 5: Management Systems [Most of the discussions under this criterion apply to both adults as well as children/adolescents, while some apply exclusively to adults or children. The ones that apply only to one group are identified as such]. (a) Resources for Mental Health Providers Financial Resources The general state revenue funds, county funds, Medicaid dollars, Mental Health Block Grant, Substance Abuse Block Grant, Social Services Block Grant, PATH grant, and other federal grants comprise much of the funding pool that County MH/ MR Programs use to provide services to their consumers. Training Resources OMHSAS sponsors technical assistance (TA) and training on a variety of areas to counties and provider agencies. Some examples are: Peer Specialist training, Case Management training, TA in the development of evidence -based practices like ACT, and TA for the development of housing options in the counties. Pennsylvania Page 46 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 57 of 323The State also contracts with three training institutes, namely, Drexel University Behavioral Health Education, Penn State E ducation and Health Services, and Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic (WPIC) to provide an array of behavioral health training opportunities to community service providers, consumers, family members, and other stakeholders. Drexel University provides training in the Eastern region of the state, Penn State in the Central region, and WPIC in the Western region. The following is a list of some of the topics on which training is offered by one or more of these institutes: Targeted Case Management Overview of Major Mental Disorders Foundational Concepts of Recovery Psychiatric Disorders of Children and Adolescents Wellness Recovery Action Plan Trauma Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Ethics Forensic Psychiatry Assessment and Treatment Strategies Crisis Intervention Emergency Preparedness Evidence -Based Treatment for Addiction and Psychiatric Illnesses Motivation Interviewing Skills for Case Mangers Cultural Competency Psychiatric Rehabilitation The above list is not comprehensive. The trai ning institutes develop new courses on advanced topics as the needed. Direct Care Worker Initiative Beginning in 2001 -02, Pennsylvania started a long -term process to support provider efforts to recruit and retain direct care staff in Home and Community Based Programs for the elderly and persons with disabilities. This initiative is based on the belief t hat local communities can better understand the difficulties of recruiting and retaining staff, and thus be better able to develop strategies to remediate those difficulties. Funding was provided by both the Department of Aging and the Department of Publi c Welfare. Direct care worker funding has been used by the counties to support various initiatives including: increasing wages or benefits; staff recognition awards or events; media campaign for recruitment; advertising; hiring incentives including sig n-on bonuses and employee referral bonuses; longevity awards such as gift certificates; one time bonuses for attendance and performance; and voucher programs for personal expenses such as health care (not covered under health care plans), tuition, and chil d care. Cultural Competency Resources Pennsylvania's Cultural Competence Strategic Plan represents OMHSAS' approach to continue raising the level of clinical competency in the Commonwealth's Behavioral Health system and to continue creating the necessary supports needed to provide cultural competency training. OMHSAS has a long history of w orking to ensure that cultural competency is embedded into all activities within the system. State, regional and local training on cultural competency has been provided to OMHSAS employees, County Administrators, providers, consumers and families. OMHSAS has also used block grant dollars in the past to seed cultural competency pilot projects to address the major cultural groups (Asian, African -American and Pennsylvania Page 47 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 58 of 323Latino/Hispanic) experiencing service disparities. Pennsylvania also has a relationship with the Pennsylvania Association of Latino Organizations (PALO). PALO has provided training and technical assistance to Latino organizations and state mental hospitals on cultural competence. OMHSAS also sponsored a three -day Cultural Competency training for di rect service staff during 2010 in conjunction with Drexel University. More than 40 clinicians, case managers, rehabilitation staff, and peer specialists participated in the training. The training included a special emphasis on LGBTQI competencies and man y of the participants identified as part of the LGBTQI community and/or were currently serving individuals from those communities. Participants in the training indicated that there was a great need for additional cultural competency training and, in parti cular, advanced training on LGBTQI issues. LGBTQI Bulletins In January 2011, OMHSAS issued two bulletins as a follow -up to the recommendations contained in \"Issues of Access to and Inclusion in Behavioral Health Services for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans gender, Questioning and Intersex Consumers\" by the Keystone Pride Recovery Initiative (KPRI). KRPI is a project to develop and establish procedures to help LGBTQI individuals seeking behavioral health services in Pennsylvania. The goal of KPRI is to ensu re that individuals are not discriminated against based upon sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression, in the behavioral health system. KPRI partnered with OMHSAS to work towards the following: protecting ensuring cultu rally-appropriate places of care for LGBTQI consumers; and educating providers around unique issues facing LGBTQI consumers. OMHSAS Bulletin 11 -01, \" Non-Discrimination Toward Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Questioning and Intersex People ,\" and OMHSA S Bulletin 11 -02, \" Guidelines to Ensure Affirmative Environments and Clinically Appropriate Services for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Questioning and Intersex Consumers and Their Family Members ,\" are intended to move the behavioral health system fo rward in addressing discrimination and the lack of appropriate services for these populations KPRI is offering one day trainings \"Creating Welcoming and Affirming Services for Persons Who Are Lesbian, Gay, Bi -sexual, Transgender, Questioning or Intersex ( LGBTQI)\" and three day trainings \"Principles and Practice for Clinicians Working with the Lesbian, Gay, Bi-sexual, Questioning and Intersex Individuals (LGBTQI)\" throughout Pennsylvania. A 2.5 hour online training titled \"Welcoming and Affirming Practice s: LGBTQI and Cultural Competency is also available. Youth and Family Institute (Children only) OMHSAS has entered into an Intergovernmental Agreement with The University of Pittsburgh to establish the Pennsylvania Youth and Family Institute. The Youth and Family Institute will be the centerpiece of the effort to transform Pennsylvania's Children's Behavioral Health System. The vision of the transformed system is one which will engage and empower child and family teams as the primary determinants of serv ice. The Institute will be responsible for extending the practice of Youth and Family Teams across the Commonwealth. It will do this through the provision and coordination of training and technical assistance to engage and empower youth and their families in the treatment and recovery process. The Youth and Family Team concept is based on the nationally recognized Wraparound Fidelity Index Model. Pennsylvania Page 48 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 59 of 323 There are currently 11 counties involved in the High Fidelity Wraparound system, which include the 6 System of Care counties, as well as, Allegheny, Bucks, Delaware, Fayette, and Northumberland. Over 700 youth and their families have been served since the initiation of High Fidelity Wraparound in 2008. (b) Training of Emergency Health Services Providers (c) OMHSAS is the statewide coordinating agency for mental health disaster response. The Pennsylvania Mental Health Plan for Disaster/Emergency Response was first published in September 1994. The next update occurred following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Subsequent to the 9 -11 Disaster Response Plan, OMHSAS was given guidance by the SAMHSA to develop an ALL HAZARDS PLAN . The Plan, following every disaster, is continually revised and continues to provide a mechanism for state and county response to local, regional, and state level disasters and emergencies using an All Hazards Approach. The Pennsylvania Mental Health ALL HAZARDS Plan for Disaster/Emergency Response requires the development of county mental health response plans by County Mental Health and Mental Retardation departments. County mental health response plans are flexible documents, which provide a foundation for mental health disaster and emergency re sponse and service provision at the local level. The Pennsylvania Mental Health ALL HAZARDS Plan for Disaster/Emergency Response specifies the Office of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services as a supportive component in mental health response. OM HSAS provides County Mental Health and Intellectual Disability Programs assistance when the disaster/emergency situation extends beyond the available resources of the county. The Office provides technical assistance and ongoing training to counties in the development of county mental health response plans and in implementing their response program. The following is a discussion on the available training: Emergency Service Provider Training OMHSAS partners with the Pennsylvania Department of Health and with the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency to train emergency response providers to address the psychosocial consequences of disasters and emergencies. Using Department of Health funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), O MHSAS provides the following training to Emergency Service Providers. Psychological First Aid (PFA) training based on National Center for Post -Traumatic Stress Disorder (NCPTSD) Disaster Crisis Outreach and Referral Team (DCORT) Training Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM) for First Responders In addition to Emergency Service Providers, the above training opportunities are also offered to other groups listed below by funds provided directly to the counties to promote community resiliency and recovery: Leaders of faith based communities Pennsylvania Page 49 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 60 of 323 Leaders of non -English speaking communities Consumers First responders Mental health, drug and alcohol treatment staff Others Emergency Service Providers and local and state mental health DCORT have been atten ding regional task force meetings, and partnering in table top exercises, as well as full scale exercises. Collaborations and trainings continue. (d) Intended Use of Block Grant Funds Pennsylvania's plan for use of its CMHS Block Grant allotment for federal fiscal year 2014 is based on a spending authority of $14, 559,000. Based on this, final allocations to county programs will total $14, 286,000 , with $273, 000 set aside for grant administration. A total of $13,4 78,470 is allocated for non -categorical activ ities and $80 5,530 for special projects. Most of the county allocations will be allocated as non-categorical, which technically allows the counties to expend the Block Grant funds in any of the allowable service areas listed below. The counties have accounted for their block grant spending as part of the annual Income and Expenditure financial reporting. OMHSAS reviews the information to ensure that block grant expenditures are being made consistent with the federal and state intent of the funds. Administrator's Office Community Services Targeted Case Management Outpatient Day Treatment Family -Based Mental Health Resource Coordination Administrative Management Emergency Services Housing Support Services Crisis Intervention Services Adult Developmental Training Community Employment and Employment Related Services Peer Support Services Consumer -Driven Services Transitional and Community Integration Services Facility -Based Vocational Rehabilitation Social Rehabilitation Services Family Support Services Community Residential Services Children's Psychosocial Rehabilitation Services Children's Evidence -Based Practices Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) and Community Treatment Teams (CTT) Psychiatric Rehabilit ation Services Many of those services apply to both adults and children, although there are some services that are meant for adults only and some targeted towards children. A portion of the block grant money will also be used to support some special projects in some of the counties. Pennsylvania Page 50 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 61 of 323These special project areas include: Mental Health Anti -Stigma, Network of Care , Consumer Surveys, and Training. When SAMHSA issued new guidance directing that the MHBG expenditures be directed towards the four purposes delineated in the guidance, OMHSAS used that opportunity to provide more structured guidance to the counties. Meeting the \"four purposes\" was not a challenge since the historic pattern of expenditures has always matched one or more of those purposes, even before those purposes were laid out in SAMHSA guidance. We also strongly encouraged the counties to utilize the CMHSBG dollars to support the priorities identified in the state MHBG Plan. We also developed a new reporting form to be completed by counties to support the planning and reporting data needs for MHBG. The following table shows the projected Block Grant allocations to the counties for fiscal year 201 3-14: Pennsylvania Page 51 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 62 of 323Federal Community Mental Health Services Block Grant County Program Non- Categorical Special Projects Total Bucks 258,581 0 258,581 Chester 215,432 0 215,432 Washington 564,310 0 564,310 Pennsylvania Page 52 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 63 of 323 Westmoreland 453,741 0 453,741 Total 13,478,470 420,250 13,898,720 The following are the special projects to be funded with block grant funds: County Allocation Project Name Description Dauphin $310,000 Network of Care Network of Care is a dynamic interactive website designed to assist individuals involved in community services. The website is designed to provide information about each county program and all of its providers, support efforts of consumers and families toward successful recovery, link to extensive resources about mental health, track bills in the Pennsylvania legislature and Congress, and make contact with legislators. OMHSAS has provided funding to implement Network of Care in all counties in the state. Erie $105,000 Survey Project The survey is a random sample of individuals served through Medical Assistance who received a mental health survey. It went to consumers receiving services through both fee -for-service and HealthChoices. The survey is conducted annually a nd goes to more than 20000 consumers/families of children/adolescents. Allegheny $5,250 Training Funding to support the expenses associated with the training and certification for MH case managers. To be Finalized $387,280 Pennsylvania Page 53 of 53 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 64 of 323II: Planning Steps Step 2: Identify the unmet service needs and critical gaps within the current system. Page 46 of the Application Guidance Narrative Question: This step should identify the data sources used to identify the needs and gaps of the populations relevant to each Block Gran t within the State's behavioral health care system, especially for those required populations described in this document and other populat ions identified by the State as a priority. The State's priorities and goals must be supported by a data driven process. This could include data and information that are available through the State's unique data system (including community level data) as well as SAMHSA's data set including, but not limit ed to, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, the Treatment Episode Data Set, and the National Facilities Surveys on Drug Abuse and Mental Health Services. Those States that have a State Epidemiological Outcomes Workgroup (SEOW) must describe its composition and c ontribution to the process for primary prevention and treatment planning. States should also continue to use the prevalence formulas for adults with serious mental illness and children with serious emotional disturbances that have been historically reported. States should u se the prevalence estimates, epidemiological analyses and profiles to establish substance abuse prevention, mental health promotion, and substa nce abuse treatment goals at the State level. In addition, States should obtain and include in their data sources information from othe r State agencies that provide or purchase behavioral health services. This will allow States to have a more comprehensive approach to identify ing the number of individuals that are receiving behavioral health services and the services they are receiving. In addition to in -state data, SAMHSA has identified several other data sets that are available by State through various Federal agencies such a s the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services or the Agency for Health Research and Quality. States should use these data whe n developing their needs assessment. If the State needs assistance with data sources or other planning information, please contact planningdata@samhsa.hhs.gov. Footnotes: Pennsylvania Page 1 of 3 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 65 of 323UNMET NEEDS AND CRITICAL GAPS In the Commonwealth's FY 2012 -2013 Plan, eight priority service areas for adults with SMI and children with SED were identified using data obtained from the County Mental Health Plans and a document developed by the Children's Advisory Committee, \"Call for Change. \" A stakeholder workgroup was convened with representation from each of the Planning Council subcommittees (Adult, Older Adult, Children's and Persons in Recovery) to identify and develop Pennsylvania's state priorities for the FY 2014 -2015 Plan. The group chose to keep the original eight priority areas, as the unmet service needs identified remain salient, and add Olmstead planning as a new priority. The paragraphs below describe the process and data used to develop the eight priority areas identified in the FY 2012 -2013 Plan. Unmet Service Needs & Gaps For Adults Counties utilized Attachment K: Top Five New Funding Requests for Recovery - Oriented System Transformation Priorities to identify prioritized funding needs designated to cre ate, sustain or enhance services . A total of 251 funding requests were received that year , an increase from the 202 requests received in the year before that . Out of the 2 51 total requests, the highest number of requests for new state dollars identified by the counties for the fifth year in a row was Housing/Housing Supports ( 40 total requests), followed by Recovery -Based Initiatives - (32 requests - not any particular servic e request, but a variety of recovery -oriented services), Forensic Services (24 requests), Employment Services (23 services), Peer Support Services (2 0 requests), Services for Older Adults (17), Transition -Age Youth ( 15 requests), and Co-occurring Disorder Services (15 requests) . These data were used by in selecting four of the eight state planning priorities , namely : Promote independent living by increasing housing opportunities for persons with SMI Promote and support the provision of integrated treatment services To increase engagement and access to integrated services across systems for older adults. Support the workforce development of Certified Peer Specialists (CPS) . Unmet Service Needs & Gaps For Children The Children's Behavioral Health Taskforce, made up of over 400 stak eholders, released a document titled \"Reaching for the Stars: A Message for Pennsylvania\" which identified many issues concerning the children's behavioral health system in Pennsylvania . Consistent with Pennsylvania's longstandin g practice of integrating stakeholder recommendations into systems change, in 2009, representatives from counties and their behavioral health managed care organizations convened for a retreat on children's services. Staff from the Office of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, as well as youth and family representatives from the Children's Advisory Committee also participated. Representatives from Mercer Human Services Consulting, which has provided technical assistance for the HealthChoices initiative, served as retreat facilitators. Pennsylvania Page 2 of 3 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 66 of 323 The consensus of the group was that wh ile the current children's behavioral health system is quite extensive, access as well as quality c ould be improved. A number of proposed recommendations came out of the retreat, including recommendations for administrative efficiencies and programmatic i mprovements. As a direct result of this retreat, the OMHSAS Children's Bureau and the OMHSAS Children's Advisory Committee developed a \" Call for Change - Transformation of the Children's Behavioral Health System in Pennsylvania \", which w ould serve as a st rategic plan to guide the children's behavioral health system toward the goals of improving access and streamlining the process for quality, effective behavioral health services for children and their families throughout the Commonwealth. It provides the principles on which transformation of the children's behavioral health system can occur. In addition to direct input from key stakeholders, this Call for Change also relied on analys es of the many multi -stakeholder initiatives and children's services improvements that have been achieved over the past sev eral years. Moreover, this document also incorporates findings from a review of the current literature on the state of the art in children's behavioral health services. The Call for Change focuses on the following goals: 1. Develop the capacity for the system to be youth and family driven. 2. Ensure ready access to a cost -effective array of quality services including assessment, treatment and support services that help to sustain and nurture family and commun ity ties. Quality services are comprehensive, integrated, and provided in the least restrictive environment as defined by the needs of the youth. 3. Establish the infrastructure (financing, policies, training, etc) to implement a system of comprehensive, integrated, cost -effective array of services. 4. Develop a public health approach to social and emotional wellness for children, youth and families. 5. Develop increased capacity for service systems to meet the needs of transition age youth and young adults thr ough cross systems collaborative relationships and initiatives. The planning priorities pertaining to children identified in this application are derived from some of the goals outlined in the Children's Call for Change. The priorit y \"Youth and Family In volvement\" was selected based on goal 1 which calls for the development of a youth and family driven system. Similarly, the priorit ies \"Access to High Fidelity Wrap -Around\" and \"Reducing RTF Usage\" spring from goal 2 that strives to ensure that services a re comprehensive, integrated, and provided in the least restrictive environment . The priority of \"Prevention\" will support goal 4 which aims to promote the development of a public health approach to social and emotional wellness.

Coverage M/SUD Services Page 67 of the Application Guidance Narrative Question: Beginning in 2014, Block Grant dollars should be used to pay for (1) people who are uninsured and (2) services that are not c overed by insurance and Medicaid. Presumably, there will be similar concerns at the state -level that state dollars are being used for people and/or services not otherwise covered. States (or the Federal Exchange) are currently making plans to implement the benchmark plan c hosen for QHPs and their expanded Medicaid programs (if they choose to do so). States should begin to develop strategies that will moni tor the implementation of the Affordable Care Act in their states. States should begin to identify whether people have better access to mental and substance use disorder services. In particular, states will need to determine if QHPs and Medicaid are offering mental health and substance abuse services and whether services are offered consistent with the provisions of MHPAEA. Please answer the following questions: 1. Which services in Plan Table 3 of the application will be covered by Medicaid or by QHPs on January 1, 2014? 2. Do you have a plan for monitoring whether individuals and families have access to M/SUD services offered through QHPs and Medicaid? 3. Who in your state is responsible for monitoring access to M/SUD services by the QHPs? Briefly describe their monitoring pr ocess. 4. Will the SMHA and/or SSA be involved in reviewing any complaints or possible violations or MHPAEA? 5.

Page 1 Pennsylvania Page 2 of 2 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 80 of 323IV: Narrative Plan D. Affordable Insurance Exchange Page 67 of the Application Guidance Narrative Question: Affordable Insurance Exchanges (Exchanges) will be responsible for performing a variety of critical functions to ensure acces s to desperately needed behavioral health services. Outreach and education regarding enrollment in QHPs or expanded Medicaid will be critical. SMHAs and SSAs should understand their state's new eligibility determination and enrollment system, as well as how insurers (commercial , Medicaid, and Medicare plans) will be making decisions regarding their provider networks. States should consider developing benchmarks rega rding the expected number of individuals in their publicly -funded behavioral health system that should be insured by the end of FY 2015. In addition, states should set similar benchmarks for the number of providers who will be participating in insurers' networks that are cur rently not billing third party insurance. QHPs must maintain a network of providers that is sufficient in the number and types of providers, including providers that s pecialize in mental health and substance abuse, to assure that all services will be accessible without unreasonable delay. Mental health a nd substance abuse providers were specifically highlighted in the rule to encourage QHP issuers to provide sufficient access to a broad ra nge of mental health and substance abuse services, particularly in low -income and underserved communities. Please answer the following questions: 1. How will the state evaluate the impact that its outreach, eligibility determination, enrollment, and re -enrollment systems will have on eligible individuals with behavioral health conditions? 2. How will the state work with its partners to ensure that the Navigator program is responsive to the unique needs of indivi duals with behavioral health conditions and the challenges to getting and keeping the individuals enrolled? 3. How will the state ensure that providers are screening for eligibility, assisting with enrollment, and billing third party Medicaid, the CHIP, QHPs, or other insurance prior to drawing down Block Grant dollars for individuals and/or services? 4. How will the state ensure that there is adequate community behavioral health provider participation in the networks of the QHPs, and how will the state assist its providers in enrolling in the networks? 5. Please provide an estimate of the number of individuals served under the MHBG and SABG who are uninsured in CY 2013. Pleas e provide the assumptions and methodology used to develop the estimate. 6. Please provide an estimate of the number of individuals served under the MHBG and SABG who will remain uninsured in CY 201 4 and CY 2015. Please provide the assumptions and methodology used to develop the estimate. 7. For the providers identified in Table 8 -Statewide Entity Inventory of the FY 2012 MHBG and SABG Reporting Section, please provide an estimate of the number of these providers that are currently enrolled in your state's Medicaid program. Please provide the as sumptions and methodology used to develop the estimate. 8. Please provide an estimate of the number of providers estimated in Question 7 that will be enrolled in Medicaid or partici pating in a QHP.

Page 1 Pennsylvania Page 2 of 2 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 82 of 323IV: Narrative Plan E. Program Integrity Page 69 of the Application Guidance Narrative Question: The Affordable Care Act directs the Secretary of HHS to define EHBs. Non -grandfathered plans in the individual and small group markets both inside and outside of the Exchanges, Medicaid benchmark and benchmark -equivalent plans, and basic health programs must cover these EHBs beginning in 2014. On December 16, 2011, HHS released a bulletin indicating the Secretary's intent to propose that EHBs be defined by benchmarks selected by each state. The selected benchmark plan would serve as a reference plan, reflecting both the scope of services and any limits offered by a \"typical employer plan\" in that state as required by the Affordable Care Act. At this point in time, many states will know which mental health and substance abuse services are covered in their benchmark plans offered by QHPs and Medicaid programs. SMHAs and SSAs should now be focused on two main areas related to EHBs: monitoring what is cov ered and aligning Block Grant and state funds to compensate for what is not covered. There are various activities that will ensure that mental and substance use disorder services are covered. These include: (1) appropriately directing complaints and appeals requests to en sure that QHPs and Medicaid programs are including EHBs as per the state benchmark; (2) ensuring that individuals are aware of the covered m ental health and substance abuse benefits; (3) ensuring that consumers of substance abuse and mental health services have full confidence in the confidentiality of their medical information; and (4) monitoring utilization of behavioral health benefits in light of utiliz ation review, medical necessity, etc. States traditionally have employed a variety of strategies to procure and pay for behavioral health services funded by the SA BG and MHBG. State systems for procurement, contract management, financial reporting, and audit vary significantly. SAMHSA expects states to implement policies and procedures that are designed to ensure that Block Grant funds are used in accordance with the four priority cate gories identified above. Consequently, states may have to reevaluate their current management and oversight strategies to accommodate the new p riorities. They may also be required to become more proactive in ensuring that state -funded providers are enrolled in the Medicaid program and have the ability to determine if clients are enrolled or eligible to enroll in Medicaid. Additionally, compliance review and audit protocols may need to be revised to provide for increased tests of client eligibility and enrollment. States should describe their efforts to ensure that Block Grant funds are expended efficiently and effectively in accordance with program goals. In particular, states should address how the y will accomplish the following: 1. Does the state have a program integrity plan regarding the SABG and MHBG? 2. Does the state have a specific staff person that is responsible for the state agency's program integrity activities? 3. What program integrity activities does the state specifically have for monitoring the appropriate use of Block Grant funds ? Please indicate if the state utilizes any of the following monitoring and oversight practices: a. Budget review; b. Claims/payment adjudication; c. Expenditure report analysis; d. Compliance reviews; e. Encounter/utilization/performance analysis; and f. Audits. 4. How does the state ensure that the payment methodologies used to disburse funds are reasonable and appropriate for the typ e and quantity of services delivered? 5. How does the state assist providers in adopting practices that promote compliance with program requirements, including qua lity and safety standards? 6. How will the state ensure that Block Grant funds and state dollars are used to pay for individuals who are uninsured and s ervices that are not covered by private insurance and/or Medicaid? SAMHSA will review this information to assess the progress that states have made in addressing program integrity issues and d etermine if additional guidance and/or technical assistance is appropriate. Footnotes: Pennsylvania Page 1 of 15 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 83 of 323E. Progr am Integrity 1. Does the state have a program integrity plan regarding MHBG? Response: Yes, the state clearly conveys the federal and state requirements and expectations regarding MHBG to counties. We have in the past, based on the then prevailing federal guidance, allowed the counties the latitude to plan the MHBG expenditures , provided they ensured compliance with all statutory and regulatory requirements. Also, s ervices and supports for which MHBG dollars could not be expended were a lways clearly communicated to the counties. When SAMHSA issued new guidance directing that the MHBG expenditures be directed towards the four purposes delineated in the guidance, OMHSAS used that opportunity to provide more structured guidance to the co unties. Meeting the \"four purposes\" was not a challenge since the historic pattern of expenditures has always matched one or more of those purposes, even before those purposes were laid out in SAMHSA guidance. We also strongly encouraged the counties to utilize the CMHSBG dollars to support the priorities identified in the state MHBG Plan. We also developed a reporting form (see the attachment) to be completed by counties to support the planning and reporting data needs for MHBG. A statewide conference c all was also held to convey the new requirements and to provide clarifications. In October 2012, counties reported based on the new reporting requirements. 2. Do es the state have a specific st aff person th at is respons ible for the state agency's program integrity activities? Response: Yes, the state's MHBG Planner is the person responsible for program integrity activities. This individual also collaborates with the Department's Bureau of Financial Operations to ensure integrity of the programs supported with Block Grant funds. 3. What program integrity activities do es the state spe cifically have for monitoring the appropriate use of Block Grant funds? Please indicate if the state utilizes any of the following monitoring and oversight practices: a. Budget review; b. Claims/p ayment r/utilization/pe rformance analysis; and f. Audit s. Response: As indicated in E (1), OMHSAS utilizes a new reporting form (see the attachment) to capture the data elements required by SAMHSA for MHBG . The data Pennsylvania Page 2 of 15 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 84 of 323reported by counties in the form inform us how the block dollars are expended and for what purposes. For each service, the following data are collected: 1. Name of Service (cost center) 2. Category of Service 3. Relevant Purpose (from the \"four purposes\") 4. Number of Persons Served 5. Target Population 6. Number of units of Service 7. Limited English Proficiency Services, if any 8. Reimbursement Method 9. Amount Spent Additionally, the form also asks the counties to report if an y MHBG dollars were spent on the priorities identified in the State's MHBG Plan. By reviewing this form, we will know how the block dollars are used and if those expenditures are consistent with the requirements and guidance the state has provided. Our re view of last year's expenditures reported using this form did not reveal any transgressions or inconsistencies. Over and above the monitoring by the CMHSBG Planner, the Bureau of Financial Operations is available to do audits of CMHSBG -funded programs, i f and when requested by OMHSAS. 4. How does the state ensure that the payment methodolo gies used to disburse funds are reasonable and appropriate for the type and quantity of services delivered? Response: Since Pennsylvania has a county based mental health service system, most of the MHBG dollars are allocated by the state to counties, who in turn contract with local agencies to provide services (some counties may provide certain services directly). The counties, through the MHBG reporting form, reports on reimbursement method for each service. The reimbursement methods and rates used by a county would depend on the type of service (cost center) and are generally the same for any class of service within a county , regardless of the source of funding (MHBG, state funds, etc.). 5. How does the state assist provide rs in adopt ing practices that promote compliance with pr ogram requirements, in cluding quality and safety standards? Response: The state provides the counties with a list of cost centers (services or supports) on which MHBG dollars can be expended, provided those expenditures meet one or more of the \"four purposes\" specified in SAMHSA MHBG guidance. Each cost center corresponds t o a specific service or support (or like service s and supports) with clearly defined attributes (either by regulat ions or by other means) . Most of these services are also licensed by the state. The counties report on MHBG expenditures based on cost cente rs, and this allows t he state to ascertain the exact nature of service delivered. Pennsylvania Page 3 of 15 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 85 of 323 We may also start site visits by the MHBG planner to guide and support the counties to find the best utilization of MHBG dollars. 6. How will the state ensure that Block Grant funds and state dollars are used to pay for individuals who are uninsu red and services that are not co vered by private insur ance and/or Medi caid? Response: Historically Pennsylvania has not used MHBG dollars to pay for insured person s for a service that would be covered by the insurance (Medicaid or private insurance). If MHBG funds are used to pay for an individual receiving Medicaid, that would be for a service /support not covered by state in -plan or supplemental Medicaid services. If MHBG funds are used to pay for a Medicaid reimbursable service, then it would be for someone who does not have Medicaid or other insurance.

Use of Evidence in Purchasing Decisions Page 70 of the Application Guidance Narrative Question: SAMHSA is interested in whether and how states are using evidence in their purchasing decisions, educating policymakers, or s upporting providers to offer high quality services. In addition, SAMHSA is concerned with what additional information is needed by SMHA s and SSAs in their efforts to continue to shape their and other purchasers decisions regarding mental health and substance abuse services. SAMHSA is requesting that states respond to the following questions: 1) Does your state have specific staff that are responsible for tracking and disseminating information regarding evidence -based or promising practices? 2) Did you use information regarding evidence -based or promising practices in your purchasing or policy decisions? a) What information did you use? b) What information was most useful? 3) How have you used information regarding evidence -based practices? a) Educating State Medicaid agencies and other purchasers regarding this information? b) Making decisions about what you buy with funds that are under your control? Footnotes: Pennsylvania Page 1 of 3 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 98 of 323F. Use of Evidence in Purchasing Decisions 1) Does your state have specific staff that are responsible for tracking and disseminating information r egarding evidence-based or promis ing practices? Response: Yes, the Bureau of Policy, Planning and Program Development within OMHSAS created a new staff position in 2009 to serve as the lead for adult behavioral health evidence -based practices (EBPs) . This position devotes 100% of its time in the implementation or expansion of: (a) Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) ; (b) Supported Employment (SE); (c) Illness Management Recovery (IMR) ; and (d) Family Psychoeducation. This individual also coordinates with other bureaus/staff in OMHSAS on other EBPs and promising practices like Supported Housing, Supported Education , Suicide Prevention , and Peer Support Services. Additionally, this individual also coordinates with OMHSAS Children's Bureau on issues related to EBPs targeted towards children. 2) Did you use information regarding eviden ce-based or promising practices in your purchasing or policy decisions? Response: Yes, OMHSAS utilizes a variety of mechanisms to collect data on EBPs to help guide our policy directions in this area. The County Mental Health Plans that the counties used to submit annually to OMHSAS until 2011 (have since been replaced with Human Servic es Plans) contained section(s) that specifically collected information regarding EBPs that was not collected through our traditional data systems. This information, coupled with the information collected by other data sources and through targeted studies, has been used in making many policy decisions regarding EBPs. For example, a few years ago, OMHSAS commissioned a study to do the cost and outcome analyses of the ACT programs in the state. This study, done on the more than 40 ACT programs in the state u nambiguously demonstrated the programs that are closer to the fidelity cost much less and yielded better outcomes. This information prompted OMHSAS to adopt statewide standards and roll out technical assistance and monetary support to enhance the quality of the ACT programs in the state. We continue to conduct similar studies on a fairly regular basis. Supported employment is another EBP that has received focused attention in the recent years. Information on peer service s and supported employment activities collected from counties was used in drafting policy guidance for counties and in designing a training regimen specifically meant for certified peer specialists to assist in their role in supporting the employment goals of the peers they serve. It was data collected from counties as part of the County Planning process that prompted us to start focusing on the EBP of IMR. Another example is a project that is currently underway, wherein OMHSAS is collaborati ng with Templ e University to administer a one - time survey of 200 -300 recipients of peer support services to ascertain what areas they have worked with their peer support specialists and what benefits they have derived from Pennsylvania Page 2 of 3 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 99 of 323receiving peer support services. We will also be investigating whether there is a significant difference between a recipient's utilization of high -cost mental health services prior to receiving peer support services and afterward.

Trauma Page 72 of the Application Guidance Narrative Question: In order to better meet the needs of those they serve, states should take an active approach to addressing trauma. Trauma scr eening matched with trauma -specific therapies, such as exposure therapy or trauma -focused cognitive behavioral approaches, should be used to ensure that treatments meet the needs of those being served. States should also consider adopting a trauma -informed care approach consistent with SAMHSA's trauma -informed care definition and principles. This means providing care based on an understanding of the vulnerabilities or triggers of trauma survivors that traditional service delivery approaches may exacerbate so that these services and programs can be more supportive and avoid being traumatized again. Please answer the following questions: 1. Does your state have any policies directing providers to screen clients for a personal history of trauma? 2. Does the state have policies designed to connect individuals with trauma histories to trauma -focused therapy? 3. Does your state have any policies that promote the provision of trauma -informed care? 4. What types of evidence -based trauma -specific interventions does your state offer across the life -span? 5. What types of trainings do you provide to increase capacity of providers to deliver trauma -specific interventions? Footnotes: Pennsylvania Page 1 of 2 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 104 of 323H. Trauma Trauma informed care (TIC) is a major initiative in t he Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The Commonwealth has developed and published an informational bulletin that directly references TIC strategies and practices to assist providers and their staff in developing trau ma informed treatment programs. The informational bulletin encourages programs to understand each individual's past trauma history and utilize assessment tools t o assist in identifying trauma. Pennsylvania has also developed a cor e competency document for our Alternative to Coercive Techniques initiative that promotes trauma informed care principles as a part of the indi vidual planning for each youth. In addition, as part of our commitment to trauma informed care, the Commonwealth has funded two pilots that provided an opportunity for several residential providers to be trained in two na tionally recognized TIC models - the Sanctuary Model and Trauma Focused - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy . Pennsylvania Page 2 of 2 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 105 of 323IV: Narrative Plan I. Justice Page 72 of the Application Guidance Narrative Question: The SABG and MHBG may be especially valuable in supporting care coordination to promote pre -adjudication or pre -sentencing diversion, providing care during gaps in enrollment after incarceration, and supporting other efforts related to enrollment. Communities across the United States have instituted problem -solving courts, including those for defendants with mental and substance abuse disorders. These courts seek to prevent incarceration and facilitate community -based treatment for offenders, while at the same time protecting public safety. There are two types of problem -solving courts related to behavioral health: drug courts and mental health courts. In addition to these behavioral health problem -solving courts, some jurisdictions operate courts specifically for DWI/DUI, veterans, families, and reentry, as well as courts for gambling, domestic violence, truancy, and other subject -specific areas. 42,43 Rottman described the therapeutic value of problem -solving courts: Specialized courts provide a forum in which the adversarial process can be relaxed and problem solving and treatment processes emphasized. Specialized courts can be structured to retain jurisdiction over defendants, promoting the co ntinuity of supervision and accountability of defendants for their behavior in treatment programs. Youths in the juvenile justice system often display a variety of high -risk characteristics that include inadequate family support, school failure, negative peer associations, and insufficient utilization of community -based services. Most adjudicated youth released from secure detention do not have community follow -up or supervision; and therefore, risk factors remain unaddressed.44 A true diversion program takes youth who would ordinarily be processed within the juvenile justice system and places them ins tead into an alternative program. States should place an emphasis on screening, assessment, and services provided prior to adjudication an d/or sentencing to divert persons with mental and/or substance use disorders from correctional settings. States should also examine specific barriers such as lack of identification needed for enrollment; loss of eligibility resulting from incarceration; and care coordination for ind ividuals with chronic health conditions, housing instability, and employment challenges. Secure custody rates decline when community agencies are p resent to advocate for alternatives to detention Please answer the following questions: 1. Does your state have plans to enroll individuals involved in the criminal and juvenile justice systems in Medicaid as a pa rt of coverage expansions? 2. What screening and services are provided prior to adjudication and/or sentencing for individuals with mental and/or substa nce use disorders? 3. Are your SMHA and SSA coordinating with the criminal and juvenile justice systems with respect to diversion of individuals with mental and/or substance use disorders, behavioral health services provided in correctional facilities, and the reentry process for t hose individuals? 4. Do efforts around enrollment and care coordination address specific issues faced by individuals involved in the criminal a nd juvenile justice systems? 5.

D escribe your involvem ent in the various coordin ated care initiatives that your state is pursuin g? Response : Through our Medicaid programs, there are many coordination activities that have either been underway or are starting. OMHSAS has supported the coordination of services. The SMI Innovations Project is an ongoing initiative in two areas of P ennsylvania . This is a partnership to improve PH/BH coordination that has developed care homes to address engagement and care using navigators. There are wellness recovery teams and mobile services to reach individuals wher e they are in their community. The project als o focuse s on integrated care plans to facilitate exchange of information and to address emergency room over utilization and hospitalization. OMHSAS and the Office of Medical Assistance Programs ( OMAP ), in coordination with the managed care organizatio ns are working together to create a data set for the sharing of information to enhance coordination of PH/BH services. This will move the system forward with coordination of both medical and behavioral health complex cases or to assist in coordination of benefits. The Commonwealth , with the PH and BH MCOs , also holds regional quarterly PH/BH meetings to review and discuss common areas for coordination. Topics cove red during the meetings include: emergency room use, updates to program changes t hat may impact the other system, and payment metrics review. There are also ongoing regional joint initiatives that are set and reviewed annually to address joint system needs. 2. A re there other coordin ated care initiatives being d eveloped or implem ented in addition to opportunit ies afforded und er the Affordable Ca re Act? Response: Yes, the behavioral health Medicaid program , through the managed care organizations , has many initiatives to coordinate care. The goal of these initiatives is to increase coordination with physical health services in the coordination of medication. The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center for High Value Health Care in coordination with Community Care Behavioral Health was recently awarded one of the Patient -Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) grants. This is one of 25 awards across the country. This proposal was chosen out of 500 proposals. 3.

Pennsylvania Page 4 of 4 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 112 of 323IV: Narrative Plan L. Health Disparities Page 75 of the Application Guidance Narrative Question: In the Block Grant application, states are routinely asked to define the population they intend to serve (e.g., adults with S MI at risk for chronic health conditions, young adults engaged in underage drinking, populations living with or at risk for contracting HIV/AIDS). W ithin these populations of focus are subpopulations that may have disparate access to, use of, or outcomes from provided services. These disparities may be the result of differences in insurance coverage, language, beliefs, norms, values, and/or socioeconomic factors specific t o that subpopulation. For instance, Latino adults with SMI may be at heightened risk for metabolic disorder due to lack of appropria te in-language primary care services, American Indian/Alaska Native youth may have an increased incidence of underage binge drinking due to coping patterns related to historical trauma within the American Indian/Alaska Native community, and African American women may be a t greater risk for contracting HIV/AIDS due to lack of access to education on risky sexual behaviors in urban low -income communities. While these factors might not be pervasive among the general population served by the Block Grant, they may be predominant am ong subpopulations or groups vulnerable to disparities. To address and ultimately reduce disparities, it is important for states to have a detailed understanding of who is being served or not being served within the community, including in what languages, in order to imple ment appropriate outreach and engagement strategies for diverse populations. The types of services provided, retention in services , and outcomes are critical measures of quality and outcomes of care for diverse groups. In order for states to address the potentially disp arate impact of their Block Grant funded efforts, they will be asked to address access, use, and outcomes for subpopulations, which can be defined by the following factors: race, ethnicity, language, gender (including transgender), tribal connection, and sexual orientation (i.e. , lesbian, gay, bisexual). In the space below please answer the following questions: 1. How will you track access or enrollment in services, types of services (including language services) received and outcomes by race, ethnicity, gender, LGBTQ, and age? 2. How will you identify, address and track the language needs of disparity -vulnerable subpopulations? 3. How will you develop plans to address and eventually reduce disparities in access, service use, and outcomes for the above disparity - vulnerable subpopulations? 4. How will you use Block Grant funds to measure, track and respond to these disparities? Footnotes: Pennsylvania Page 1 of 2 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 113 of 323L. Health Dispar ities 1. How will you track access or enrollment in s ervices, types of services (including language services) received and outcom es by race, ethnicity, gender, LGBTQ, and age? Response: We are able to track consumers by race, ethnicity, age and gender only. There is no designation for sexual orientation or tribal connection in our Client Information System or in the Home and Community Services Information System. Neither system allows for transgender designation. 2. How will you identi fy, address and t rack the state's Client Information System contains a language preference code by which Medicaid consumers can request documents in their preferred language. In addition, managed care companies are required to have documents in any language that accounts for at least 5% of the population. Pennsylvania's Office of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services (OMHSAS ) has a contract with a translator company that can be used to interpret on the spot by telephone; this agency can also translate documents as requested . 3. How will you develop p lans to address and eventually reduce disparities in access, se rvice use, and outcom es for the above disparity-vulnerable subpopul ations? Response: If disparities were identified, plans to address the disparities would be accomplished thru workgroups involving OMHSAS policy staff and interested stakeholders (e.g., county governments, Behavioral Health Managed Care Organizations and providers). There would also have to be a financial component of these discussions to accommodate the system changes that would have to occur to be able to capture and track these subpopulations with more detail. 4. How will you use Block Grant funds to me asure, track and respond to these dispa rities? Response: We do not have plans at this time to use Block Grant funds to measure and track any disparities, as we are currently using state employees and Data Infrastructure Grant funds for those activities.

Recovery Page 76 of the Application Guidance Narrative Question: SAMHSA encourages states to take proactive steps to implement recovery support services. SAMHSA is in a unique position to pr ovide content expertise to assist states, and is asking for input from states to address this position. To accomplish this goal and support the wide - scale adoption of recovery supports, SAMHSA has launched Bringing Recovery Supports to Scale Technical Assistance Center Stra tegy (BRSS TACS). BRSS TACS assists states and others to promote adoption of recovery -oriented supports, services, and systems for people in recovery from substance use and/or mental disorders.

Examples include: efforts to conduct empirical research on recovery supports/services, identification and dissemination of best practices in recovery supp orts/services, other innovative and exemplary activities that support the implementation of recovery -oriented approaches, and services within the state's behavioral health system. Involvement of Individuals and Families Recovery is based on the involvement of consumers/peers and their family members. States must work to support and help streng then existing consumer, family, and youth networks; recovery organizations; and community peer support and advocacy organizations in expanding self -advocacy, self -help programs, support networks, and recovery support services. There are many activities that SMHAs and SSAs can undertake to engage these individuals and families. In the space below, states should describe their efforts to acti vely engage individuals and families in developing, implementing and monitoring the state mental health and substance abuse treatment sys tem. In completing this response, state should consider the following questions: 1. How are individuals in recovery and family members utilized in the planning, delivery, and evaluation of behavioral health services? 2. Does the state sponsor meetings or other opportunities that specifically identify individuals' and family members' issues and needs regarding the behavioral health service system and develop a process for addressing these concerns? 3.

Response: Through the Transformation Transfer Initiative (TTI) Federal grant, Pennsylvania, in consortium with the University of Pennsylvania, h as developed and implemented a two -day advanced training for Certified Peer Specialists (CPS) in older adult services. In addition, under TTI Pennsylvania collaborated with New Jersey to train CPS in New Jersey's Wellness Coaching curriculum. Pennsylvania, in collaboration with the Temple University Collaborative on Community Inc lusion, is administering a survey of 200 -300 recipients of peer support services at targeted peer support providers. Pennsylvania intends to use the survey data to refine the delivery of peer support services in the Commonwealth. Pennsylvania has develope d a one -day, five -hour documentation training course for CPS to enhance their Medicaid documentation skills. The course will be rolled out in 2013. Pennsylvania has developed two curricula \u2014a one -day, face -to-face training course and an online training cou rse\u2014for CPS in supporting individuals with employment goals. In addition, Pennsylvania has produced a policy guidance paper for CPS that identifies Medicaid -reimbursable employment services. Pennsylvania's Department of Corrections (DOC) is instituting Pennsylvania's 75 -hour, 10 -day CPS training course within DOC facilities and has trained roughly 100 CPS so far, 10 percent of whom are serving life sentences. Pennsylvania will promulgate regulations for Psychiatric Rehabilitation Services (PRS) in 2013. The regulations require that PRS providers adhere to evidence -based practices and best practices for PRS. Pennsylvania continues to expand Fairweather Lodge services. Over the past decade, the number of Lodges in Pennsylvania has expanded from one to 35 with 20 Lodg es currently under development. In addition, Pennsylvania's Office of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services is conducti ng preliminary discussions with Pennsylvania's Department of Corrections and Bureau of Probation and Parole about dedicating a Lodge or series of Lodges to individuals with mental illness and criminal history.

To maximize the caliber of consumer and family participation in the behavioral health system, OMHSAS continues to promote opportunities for education and training. In May of 2012, OMHSAS staff attended the Community Support Program (CSP) Network Day to educate representatives from Pennsylvania's regional CSPs on their role in the county planning process. OMHSAS also provides information on available services, ongoin g initiatives, opportunities to participate in trainings, and professional resources on www.parecovery.org; www.pa -co- occurring.org; and http://networkofcare.org. Consumers and family members also have the opportunity to attend bi -monthly Advisory Committee meetings as \"sunshine members,\" meaning they cannot vote on committee issues but do have the opportunity to provide comments and feedback. The Deputy Secretary of OMHSAS attends Advisory Committee meetings to present information on pertinent issues and initiatives related to the behavioral health system. The Commonwealth seeks to support and expand consumer involvement in, and access to; recovery resources and services, self -help programs, and support networks. OMHSAS continues to allocate a portion of Community Mental Health Block Grant funds for special projects, such as \"Open Minds, Open Doors,\" an anti -stigma project in Berks County, that promote access to recovery -oriented resources, services, and support networks. The Pennsylvania Peer Support Coalition is a statewide network of individuals who use their own recovery journey to help support others. Housing The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's Department of Public Welfare Office of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services (OMHSAS) has implemented an OMHSAS Permanent Supportive Housing Initiative utilizing local, state and federal resources to expand affordable, supportive housing and residenti al programs for adults. Over the past five years, this initiative has been instrumental in County MH/IDD/SA (Counties) and Health Choices programs adopting County Program Housing Plans that in turn have led to the creation of exemplary housing programs acr oss the state with participation from qualified housing organizations, consumers, providers and stakeholders This commitment is based on the principle that where people live matters; it is essential to recovery. It is also a practical commitment. Perman ent Supportive Housing (PSH), an evidence based practice, enables each consumer to make informed choices about their own housing and to retain more of their income than if residing in congregate facilities or their own residence Pennsylvania Page 5 of 10 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 119 of 323without rental support. It provides the opportunity for consumers to live in more integrated settings which are essential to their quality of life and community sustainability. Based on repeated cost comparisons, it enables Counties to reduce costs of associated with legacy housin g programs including CRRS and LTSRs, acute and institutional care. The OMHSAS Initiative was critical to the state's ability to make a competitive application for 811 PRA resources and is essential for OMHSAS and Counties to meet their Olmstead integrati on obligation. Fifty three counties have made Reinvestment resources (capitation savings) available as part of the OMHSAS PSH Initiative. OMHSAS has focused this initiative on the development of integrated housing which is typically either: scattered, clustered or single site housing such as shared housing, with three or less consumers living in a single family setting or rental unit. PSH is typically created by utilizing and combining fund sources to assure housing is affordable, sustainable and meets a person's individual housing needs and choices. OMHSAS provided Counties an opportunity to invest in seven interconnected housing strategies: capital or equity investment in development projects, project -based operating assistance (PBOA) in tax credit developments in collaboration with the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency (PHFA), short term bridge rental assistance , master leasing for consumers with criminal or poor tenancy histories, a housing clearinghouse to manage outreach and ref erral to PSH options, housing support services and contingency funds such as security deposit or payment of back rent. OMHSAS provides limited technical assistance and training for this program. A significant benefit of the PSH program is the operating principle that no one should pay more than 30% of their income in rent. While OMHSAS and Counties take many steps to assure housing meets this standard, it is difficult to find affordable housing i n most Pennsylvania communities. In 2010, the average cost of a one bedroom market rate rental in Pennsylvania was 05101520253035December 2012 Reinvestment Report Represented in Millions Pennsylvania Page 6 of 10 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 120 of 32399% of an individual's monthly SSI check. In four metropolitan areas, fair-market rents are above 100% with southeast Pennsylvania being at 129%. With counties in Marcellus Shale impacted areas, rents are going up faster along with a notable decrease in the availability of any housing regardless of its cost or suitability. The goals of the OMHSAS PSH Initiative are: (1) to create affordable supportive housing for people with disabilities, specifically OMHSAS/DPW target populations, and (2) to use Health Choices Reinvestment, CHIPPS or base funding to access and leverage mainstream housing resources and create partnerships with state and loc al housing and community development entities. The data collected in April 2012, mid -implementation, indicate Counties are having remarkable success achieving these goals and meeting the vast majority of their own local housing targets. There are some i ndicators the program when fully implemented may exceed expectations. The following table shows details of the state's investments in supportiv e housing as of December 2012: Pennsylvania Page 7 of 10 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 121 of 323 Summary data for the Fifty three counties reveals: Counties have invested approximately $102 million in the OMHSAS approved housing strategies including $33.4 million in capital funds, $32 million in Bridge and Master Leasing subsidies and $9.7 million in PBOA between 2006 and 2012.

Health Choices investments have leveraged between three and four times the Reinvestment amount in other housing resources including other capital such as HOME funds, ACT 137 and Low Income Housing Tax Credits as well as fede rally funded tenant - and project -based vouchers. Initially, counties expected to serve over 3,300 consumers when funds were fully expended. As of April 2012, fully or partially reinvestment -funded housing programs had served an estimated 3031 households1. Since programs will be expanding and some units are set aside for 20 -30 years, it is likely Counties will serve significantly more households than expected. This is due in large part to Counties utilizing beneficial leveraging strategies and some coun ties using funds for helping consumers get into housing including paying deposits and move in expenses even as funds for rental subsidies were already committed or not available. Ten (10) county programs and the 23 County program have committed funds to c apital projects. Eight (8) county programs have expended all or a portion of their available funds, and through the end of FY 2012, 126 units were filled. One county recently awarded funds for its first project and another five projects will be leasing u p this year. Two counties have not been able to secure any partners yet to award funds. Of the funds awarded to 26 projects2, the average number of years funds will be set aside is 25.3 years3. Individuals who got these set aside units either had thei r rent reduced to 30% of their income or received tenant based or project based rental subsidies. The costs for capital projects may appear high but given the requirement developers set aside units for 15 to 30 years, the overall cost per unit over time is lower than the cost for rental subsidies alone. Four county programs have committed funds for PBOA (project based operating subsidies) scattered in multi -family rental projects with tax credit support or available on the rental market prior to this I nitiative. One hundred and fifty six (156) people have been placed in 76 different multi -family rental projects and there has only been a 7% turnover of tenants retaining those units. PHFA manages this program on behalf of OMHSAS for a 1% fee. The benef it of this program is that when available these units are rented well below market rate rent extending the funds available for rental. These properties also tend to be well maintained and managed. Counties have committed funds for 686 bridge rental subs idies. Of that number 223 have just been funded and are being placed in service this fiscal year. Of the 463 placed in service before FY 2012, 1655 persons have been served and 796 or 48% of those persons have already been awarded Section 8 certificates, earned enough to pay for their own 1 approximately 66% of consumers got some type of rental assistance and contingency support and approximately 33% got only contingency support. These numbers do not include capital projects funded but not placed in service in FY 2012 or new rental arrangements funded bu t still in process of being established. 2 3 projects were single site and 23 were set aside units in a larger multi - family project. 3 One project has only a 10 year commitment of funds bringing this overall average down by nearly 2 percentage points. Pennsylvania Page 9 of 10 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 123 of 323housing or moved to other locations. This positive trend toward securing permanent rental assistance points to the potential for utilizing mainstream resources. Likewise another 11 County Programs have arranged for 3 31 people to get rental units through master leasing programs. Master leasing is beneficial for people who cannot get a lease on their own on the other hand it is not a pathway to getting federal or other funds for rental assistance over the long term. Thus sustainability of master leasing units is more challenging. Several counties do not use mater leasing because they report they can find ways to help get their own units without this step or they are leery of assuring sustainability. Approximately 2 ,340 individuals have received contingency funds to enable them to move into affordable housing and cover their moving expenses, pay security and utility deposits, cover rent arrearages and acquire needed household items. Eleven (11) County Programs hav e developed Clearinghouses to manage housing access across multiple rental programs and to match people with the housing of their choice and the optimal housing available. Clearinghouses employ staff who know their local housing market, housing regulations and fair housing requirements and have relationships with landlords and property managers. Staff manage the Master Leasing, PBOA and Bridge an leasing in Capital Project set asides. In some counties they manage other programs as well such as HAP and McKi nney Vento Shelter Plus Care. Several clearinghouses are managed by Public Housing Authorities (PHAs). The North West 9 Counties are entering into an arrangement this fiscal year with Clarion County PHA to manage rental arrangements for all the counties in this geographic area. PHFA is also contributing HOME funds to this arrangement. This model is ideally suited to assist Counties to meet their Olmstead obligations and will be utilized by DPW and PHFA if awarded 811 PRA funds. Counties vary significan tly in the percentages of those served who come from their targeted populations, i.e. people in institutions and CRRs, people who are homeless, youth aging out and forensic population. Pennsylvania has made significant strides to address the unnecessary institutionalization of Pennsylvanians who have a mental illness in state -operated psychiatric hospitals. As elsewhere in the nation, the census of Pennsylvania's state hospitals has declined dramatically in the last 40 years -- from 35,100 in 1966 to less than 1,600 in 2010. Our progress mirrors the national trend which recognizes that many individuals, who have a disability, including individuals who have a serious and persistent mental illness, can live successfully in the community if they have appropri ate supports and services. We are continuing our progress to develop a viable integration plan for Pennsylvanians with mental illness and the need to have community alternatives in place for those who reside in the state hospitals, are at risk for institut ionalization including the homeless, criminal justice, and veterans, and other who live in congregate settings. We have been successful in our endeavor for the past 20 years and will continue that success throughout the state.

Prevention Page 78 of the Application Guidance Narrative Question: As specified in 45 C.F.R. \u00a796.125(b), states shall use a variety of evidence -based programs, policies, and practices to develop prevention, including primary prevention strategies (45 CFR \u00a796.125). Strategies should be consistent with the IOM Report on Preventing M ental Emotional and Behavioral Disorders, the Surgeon General's Call to Action to Prevent and Reduce Underage Drinking, the NREPP or other ma terials documenting their effectiveness. While primary prevention set -aside funds must be used to fund strategies that have a positive impact on the prevention of substance use, it is important to note that many evidence -based substance abuse prevention strategies also have a positive impact on other health and social outcomes such as education, juvenile justice involvement, violence prevention, and mental h ealth. The SABG statute directs states to implement strategies including : (1) information dissemination: providing awareness and kn owledge of the nature, extent, and effects of alcohol, tobacco, and drug use, abuse, and addiction on individuals families and communities; (2) education aimed at affecting critical life and social skills, such as decision making, refusal skills, critical analysis, and systemati c judgment abilities; (3) alternative programs that provide for the participation of target populations in activities that exclude alcohol, tobacco, an d other drug use; (4) problem identification and referral that aims at identification of those who have indulged in illegal/age inappropriate use o f tobacco or alcohol, and those individuals who have indulged in first use of illicit drugs, in order to assess if the behavior can be rev ersed by education to prevent further use; (5) community -based processes that include organizing, planning, and enhancing effectiveness of program, policy, and practice implementation, interagency collaboration, coalition building, and networking; and (6) environmental strategies that establish or change written and unwritten community standards, codes, and attitudes, thereby influencing incidence and prevalence of the a buse of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs used in the general population. In implementing the comprehensive primary prevention program , states should use a variety of strategies that target populations with different levels of risk, including the IOM classified univer sal, selective, and indicated strategies. States should provide responses to the following questions: 1. How did the state use data on substance use consumption patterns, consequences of use, and risk and protective factors to identify the types of primary prevention services that are needed (e.g., education programs to address low perceived risk of harm from mar ijuana use, technical assistance to communities to maximize and increase enforcement of alcohol access laws to address easy access to alc ohol through retail sources)? 2. What specific primary prevention programs, practices, and strategies does the state intend to fund with SABG prevention se t-aside dollars, and why were these services selected? What methods were used to ensure that SABG dollars are used to purchase primar y substance abuse prevention services not funded through other means? 3. How does the state intend to build the capacity of its prevention system, including the capacity of its prevention workfor ce? 4. What outcome data does the state intend to collect on its funded prevention strategies and how will these data be used to evaluate the state's prevention system? 5. How is the state's budget supportive of implementing the Strategic Prevention Framework? 6. How much of the SABG prevention set -aside goes to the state, versus community organizations? (A community is a group of individuals who share common characteristics and/or interests.) 7. How much of the prevention set -aside goes to evidence -based practices and environmental strategies? List each program.

Children and Adolescents Behavioral Health Services Page 80 of the Application Guidance Narrative Question: Since 1993, SAMHSA has funded the Children's Mental Health Initiative (CMHI) to build the system of care approach in states a nd communities around the country. This has been an ongoing program with over 160 grants awarded to states and communities, and every state has received at least one CMHI grant. In 2011, SAMHSA awarded System of Care Expansion grants to 24 states to bring thi s approach to scale in states. In terms of adolescent substance abuse, in 2007, SAMHSA awarded State Substance Abuse Coordinator grants to 16 states to begin to build a state infrastructure for substance abuse treatment and recovery -oriented systems of care for youth with substance use disorders. This work has continued with a focus on financing and workforce development to support a recovery -oriented system of care that incorporates established evidence -based treatment for youth with substance use disorders. SAMHSA expects that states will build on this well -documented, effective system of care approach to serving children and youth with behavioral health needs. Given the multi -system involvement of these children and youth, the system of care approach provides the infrastructure to improve care coordination and outcomes, manage costs and better invest resources. The array of services and supports in the system of care approach includes non -residential services, like wraparound service planning, intensive care management, outpatient therapy, intensive home -based services, substance abuse intensive outpatient services, continuing care, and mobile crisis response; supportive services, like peer youth support, family peer support, respite services, mental health consultation, and supported education and employment; and residential services, like therapeutic foster care, crisis stabilization services, and inpatient medical detoxification. Please answer the following questions: 1. How will the state establish and monitor a system of care approach to support the recovery and resilience of children and youth with mental and substance use disorders? 2. What guidelines have and/or will the state establish for individualized care planning for children/youth with mental, subs tance use and co-occurring disorders? 3. How has the state established collaboration with other child - and youth -serving agencies in the state to address behavioral health needs (e.g., child welfare, juvenile justice, education, etc.)? 4. How will the state provide training in evidence -based mental and substance abuse prevention, treatment and recovery services for children/adolescents and their families? 5. How will the state monitor and track service utilization, costs and outcomes for children and youth with mental, substance use and co - occurring disorders?

Consultation with Tribes Page 81 of the Application Guidance Narrative Question: SAMHSA is required by the 2009 Memorandum on Tribal Consultation to submit plans on how it will engage in regular and meaning ful consultation and collaboration with tribal officials in the development of federal policies that have tribal implications. Consultation is an enhanced form of communication, which emphasizes trust, respect, and shared responsibility. It is an open and free exchange of information and opinions between parties, which leads to mutual understanding and comprehension. Consultation is integral to a deliberative process that results in effective collaboration and informed decision making with the ultimate goal of reachin g consensus on issues. For the context of the Block Grants awarded to tribes, SAMHSA views consultation as a government -to-government interaction and should be distinguished from input provided by individual tribal members or services provided for tribal members whether on or off trib al lands. Therefore, the interaction should be attended by elected officials of the tribe or their designees. SAMHSA is requesting that states provide a description of how they consulted with tribes in their state, which should indicate how concerns of the tribes were addressed in the State Block Grant plan(s). States shall not require any tribe to waive its sovereign immunity in order to receive funds or in order for services to be provided for tribal members on tribal lands. If a state does not have any federally -recognized tribal governments or tribal lands within its borders, the state should make a declarative statement to that effect. For states that are currently working with tribes, a d escription of these activities must be provided in the area below. States seeking technical assistance for conducting tribal consultation may con tact the SAMHSA project officer prior to or during the Block Grant planning cycle.

Please provide an update of your progress since that time. Response: Pennsylvania has made significant progress in preparing for client level reporting. We are scheduled to submit the crosswalk to NRI within the next 2 months; our first Basic Client Information (BCI) data file submission will be in December 2013. Our first State Hospital Readmission (SHR) data file submission will be in March 2014. In addition to being able to submit data for our HealthChoices Behavioral Health (Medicaid managed care) and Medicaid Fee -For-Service populations, work continues on building capacity to report on servi ces received by our county base -funded mental health consumers. By the end of 2013, we should have the majority of current consumers enrolled in our information system. The next milestone after that will be to have all counties capable of, and submitting, encounters into the system. At th at point, we will be able to have the capacity to provide unique client -level data for all populations. OMHSAS leverages several enterprise information systems. The main one is the Client Information System (CIS), which receives all authorizations, closings, and changes for the entire Medicaid population. This system also houses other Department of Public Welfare programs. The eligibility information from CIS and claims/encounters p ayment information is combined and maintained in the Provider Reimbursement Operations Management Information System in electronic format (PROMISe). The Home and Community Services Information System (HCSIS) contains incident management information, Commun ity and Hospital Integration Projects Program (CHI PP) information, state mental hospital closure consumer data, and is the vehicle by which county base consumer information is added to CIS. Pennsylvania currently pays Fee for Service claims and processes managed care encounters via the PROMISe system. This system has been in place for many years, and there are no barriers to its successful continuation. The current challenge for us is implementing the batch enrollment system so that county base c onsumers may be enrolled in CIS and their future expenditures captured by a HIPAA -compliant 837._ Pennsylvania Page 2 of 3 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 132 of 323Health Information Technology (HIT) efforts are led by the state Department of Public Welfare 's Office of Medical Assistance Programs.

Quality Improvement Plan Page 82 of the Application Guidance Narrative Question: In the FY 2012/2013 Block Grant application, SAMHSA asked states to base their administrative operations and service delivery on principles of Continuous Quality Improvement/Total Quality Management (CQI/TQM). These CQI processes should identify and track critical out comes and performance measures, based on valid and reliable data, that will describe the health of the mental health and addiction systems. The CQI processes should continuously measure the effectiveness of services and supports and ensure that services, to the extent poss ible, continue reflect this evidence of effectiveness. The state's CQI process should also track programmatic improvements and garner and us e stakeholder input, including individuals in recovery and their families. In addition, the CQI plan should include a description of the pr ocess for responding to emergencies, critical incidents, complaints and grievances. In an attachment, states must submit a CQI plan for FY 2014/20 15.

The state mental hospitals, funded throug h the Mental Health Services Appropriation, provide a wide range of inpatient services to Pennsylvanians with mental illness. The state mental hospital system is comprised of nine state mental hospitals and one restoration center. The Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act of 1966 and subsequent revisions, established the basis for a comprehensive public service delivery system under the direction of state and county government. The Community Mental Health Services program is administered by 46 single or multi - county administrative units. This system aims to deliver a comprehensive array of prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and support services to all those in need within the limits of available resources. Pennsylvania's community mental health sys tem began more than 35 years ago with a limited array of services, focused primarily on clinical treatment. Over the years, services have continued to expand and evolve based upon a combination of federal, state, county and private resources and directed b y best practice. In February 1997, OMHSAS implemented the HealthChoices Behavioral Health Services program, a mandatory MA behavioral health managed care program, which marked the beginning of unified systems for delivery of community mental health servic es. This program, through capitation -based contracts with counties or managed care organizations, established funding for behavioral health services for MA eligible clients. HealthChoices began in the southeast region of the state. HealthChoices expanded into the southwest region in January 1999. In October 2001 the program was expanded into the Lehigh/Capital region. Continued expansion into other regions is planned. OMHSAS provides significant leadership in the provision of drug and alcohol services an d coordinates its responsibilities with the Health Department's Bureau of Drug and Alcohol Programs (BDAP). With the initiation of HealthChoices in February 1997, OMHSAS is responsible for the financial review and program monitoring of substance abuse se rvices in concert with BDAP. Drug and alcohol services to both MA eligible persons (Act 152) and individuals who have lost MA eligibility due to the change in eligibility requirements are administered by 50 Single County Authorities. Pennsylvania Page 3 of 88 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 136 of 323 Revised February 17, 2003 ` OMHSAS recognizes that quality is first about people. Quality management is dedicated to ensuring that services and supports are organized and managed in a way that facilitates recovery in adults and resiliency in children . We will actively seek out and listen to the voi ces of adults, families, and individuals with substance use disorders to understand what is working and what needs to be improved. A major goal of the OMHSAS is to have unified systems of treatment and supports in each of the 67 Pennsylvania counties. The President's New Freedom Commission report: \"Achieving the Promise: Transforming Mental Health Care in America\" articulates the same challenge for the nation's mental health and drug and alcohol treatment system. Local treatment systems must be organ ized and managed to facilitate recovery for adults and resiliency for children. Planning and funding decisions are increasingly based on data analysis and outcomes achieved for person served. OMHSAS expects to see expanded implementation of evidence based practices and quality initiatives to ensure continuous improvement. As the treatment system becomes more accountable stakeholders will be able to determine how well their county is doing with available resources. Measuring progress toward a unified lo cal treatment system which facilitates recovery for adults and resiliency for children and adolescents requires an integrated approach to quality management that will examine the interface between community -based services, state mental hospitals, and cross - system linkages that are necessary to effectively serve special populations. Quality management will include the identification and use of evidence -based practices ensuring excellence in mental health and drug and alcohol treatment services and supports. This integrated approach to quality management will advance the OMHSAS goal of achieving a unified system of services and supports where financial resources are aligned to achieve this goal. To that end OMHSAS has developed standards and criteria for th e provision of quality outcome oriented behavioral health services. The year 2003 began the transition for OMHSAS. New leadership is committed to more effective operations that are responsive to the voice of our stakeholders. A re -organization of function s and duties is underway that focuses on streamlining the administration of the behavioral health and drug and alcohol delivery systems. This, coupled with new Federal requirements for managed care, has given OMHSAS a mandate to broaden our Quality Managem ent initiatives . The OM HSAS Quality Management Plan provides the framework for the expansion of our activities and evolution of our new structure. The OMHSAS Vision: \"Every person with a serious mental illness and/or substance use disorder , and every chi ld and adolescent who has a substance use disorder and/or has a serious emotional disturbance will have the Pennsylvania Page 4 of 88 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 137 of 323 Revised February 17, 2003 ` opportunity for growth, recovery and inclusion in their community, have access to the services and supports of their choice, and enjoy a quality of life that includes family and friends. Pennsylvania Page 5 of 88 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 138 of 323 Revised February 17, 2003 ` Quality Management Mission Statement The mission of the Quality Management program is to support the OMHSAS goal of public accountability by including individuals with serious mental illness and or substance use di sorders, children, adolescents, and their families in every step of the process, using proven methodologies and evidenced based practices, to positively influence health outcomes and member satisfaction in an integrated behavioral health delivery system. Goals, Objectives and Guiding Principles Goals of the Quality Management Program In support of the overall goals and objectives of the Office of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, the Quality Management (QM) program focuses on the following goals : Ensure that the program is consistent with and enhances the mission, vision and values OMHSAS has outlined for the behavioral health system, Ensure that all affected stakeholders, including Department of Public Welfare (DPW) staff, consumers, families, individuals with substance abuse disorders, counties, Behavioral Health Managed Care Organizations (BH -MCO), providers, and advocates have an opportunity for input, Promote services and programs provided to consumers, families and individuals with substan ce use disorders that are of the highest possible quality and represent best practices, through systematic monitoring and evaluating of a defined set of indicators, Maintain a comprehensive program that assesses quality across all OMHSAS funded programs an d services, monitors for compliance with regulatory and contractual requirements and identifies opportunities for improvement, Monitor satisfaction with program performance, and Ensure that OMHSAS' internal practices are monitored and opportunities for imp rovement are identified. Quality Management Objectives In support of the QM program goals, the following objectives have been established: Evaluate the quality and effectiveness of behavioral health programs by systematically monitoring and evaluating the quality of care, services and member satisfaction, Obtain input from affected stakeholders, including DPW staff, consumers, families, individuals with substance use disorders, counties, BH -MCOs, providers, and advocates, Develop and implement a QM work pl an that identifies specific activities, measures and indicators that are the focus of the QM program for that year, Identify, collect and analyze data from the counties, vendors and providers, monitor the source, and quality of the data, that identifies bo th best practices and opportunities for improvement of services, Disseminate information so that the outcomes of quality activities are reflected in program changes, Conduct follow -up activities that determine the effectiveness of improvement activities, a nd Pennsylvania Page 6 of 88 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 139 of 323 Revised February 17, 2003 ` Continuously monitor the adequacy and effectiveness of the QM program and the work plan, making revisions as required and guaranteeing that the plan reflects the highest standards. Guiding Principles In the OMHSAS behavioral health care delivery system , the following quality principles are considered: The Quality Management Plan (QMP) overview is not a static document, but rather is dynamic and a reflection of best practices in quality assessment and performance improvement, QM activities are collabora tive and involve all affected groups. The QMP reflects input from DPW staff, consumers, families individuals with substance use disorders and provider organizations, The process is consistent with the mission, vision and values of OMHSAS and reflects the importance of cultural competency in programs and services; Quality is the responsibility of each bureau of OMHSAS. High functioning organizations incorporate measurement activities into daily work processes, strive to remove barriers to quality activities and provide staff at all levels the opportunity to participate in quality management activities, The program focuses on those measures that reflect the greatest potential for positive change to the system and is a valid reflection of quality services and i s realistically linked to improved consumer functioning, All components of the system, both internal and external to OMHSAS, have a \"customer service\" focus. OMHSAS Structure Each bureau shares the common goal of supporting mental health consumers, famili es and individuals with substance use disorders in growth, development and recovery. Collaboration with each other assures that we are listening to the voices of those we serve, and those with whom we share responsibility and accountability, to meet the st andard of excellence. We recognize that we are each other's customers and must work towards ensuring quality services in support of recovery for adults and resiliency for children and adolescents. The organization structure supports collaboration across a ll bureaus. Organizational responsibilities and lines of authority are displayed on the organizational chart included as Appendix 1. Quality Management Structure The Quality Management program is committed to the goal of establishing an integrated system of service delivery. This document presents the comprehensive quality management strategy of OMHSAS. Recognizing that many activities overlap and are interconnected, this document is presented in multiple sections. The first section outlines the overarc hing QM strategy for all funding sources followed by a section related to HealthChoices, community services and state hospitals. Pennsylvania Page 7 of 88 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 140 of 323 Revised February 17, 2003 ` Organizational Responsibilities The OMHSAS Division of Quality Management is responsible for the development, oversight an d direction of the quality management program. The Quality Management Plan (QMP) serves as a foundation for OMHSAS quality management activities. The Division of Quality Management collaborates with the OMHSAS Medical Director and other bureaus in provid ing expertise, leadership and direction for clinical care in the provision of mental health services including psychiatric and nursing treatment and care in community -based service system and within the state hospitals. The QMP provides the framework for OMHSAS to assess and improve the quality of administrative services, clinical systems, clinical care and member services for the citizens of Pennsylvania. The plan includes a clear definition of the role of the program and its relationships to other OMHSAS agencies/areas, and stakeholders. It also articulates the relationship between OMHSAS and any entities to which it delegates QM/PI activities. The QMP defines and integrates the roles of the various OMHSAS bureaus as part of the QM team and describes the inter-relationships with other programs, including community -based fee for service Mental Health (MH) and Drug and Alcohol (D&A). QM strategies include Quality Assessment (QA) and Performance Improvement (PI) activities encompassing both the internal oper ations of the system and more global system responsibilities, including HealthChoices, hospital and community based programs. All of these activities are of importance and will be addressed in individual sections of the QMP. The goal of OMHSAS is to impro ve programs and services in order to facilitate positive outcomes for consumers, families, and individuals with substance use disorders. Through the oversight of the QM program, OMHSAS' leadership provides direction and resources in the effort to measure t he system's progress toward reaching its strategic goals. Quality Management Committee The QMC is responsible for providing direction to the QM process, and recommending changes in program structure or administration based on findings identified through Q M activities. The committee is charged with coordinating and communicating quality management issues internally among OMHSAS Bureaus and externally with various stakeholders. The QMC is co -chaired by the OMHSAS Medical Director and the Director of the Qu ality Management Division with a plan to transition the co -chair responsibility from the Director of the Quality Management Division to a consumer committee member . Membership in the committee includes representatives from: Bureau of Children's Services Division of Evaluation and MIS Division of Medicaid and Financial Review Division of Drug and Alcohol Services Bureau of Policy and Program Development Pennsylvania Page 8 of 88 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 141 of 323 Revised February 17, 2003 ` Bureau of Consumer and Family Affairs Key activities of the QMC include: Develop OMHSAS QM work plan, Review quality and performance information received from the program components, which include HealthChoices, Medicaid FFS, county based, and state hospital programs.

Provider Advisory Committee advises OMHSAS on issues related to service delivery and provider management. Pennsylvania Page 10 of 88 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 143 of 323 Revised February 17, 2003 ` Quali ty Management Process OMHSAS has adopted a philosophy of Total Quality Management (TQM) and Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) based upon Deming's 14 -point program for management adapted to the health care industry, and JCAHO guidelines. The OMHSAS qual ity management approach places emphasis on improving outcomes by identifying administrative and systems issues, refining the processes necessary to achieve the desired outcome and evaluating improvement over time. The overall process includes: Delineating the scope of the services to be monitored and improved. Identifying the important aspects of the services whose quality should be examined and improved. Identifying indicators that will be used to monitor the quality, accessibility and appropriateness of t he important aspects of services. Establishing thresholds for the review of indicators that become \"flags\" signaling the need for further analysis of the causes for the data reported to DPW. Collecting data pertaining to each indicator and comparing the ag gregate level of performance with the threshold for analysis. If the threshold is not reached, further analysis may not be necessary. Initiating analyses of other important aspects of services when thresholds have been reached. Taking actions to improve t he aspects of services. Reporting the findings to the organizations and stakeholders involved, including a report of findings to DPW on a regular schedule. Monitoring and analysis are continued in order to identify any future deficiencies in services and to improve quality. Pennsylvania Page 11 of 88 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 144 of 323 Revised February 17, 2003 ` OMHSAS uses and recommends the basic methodology of Plan, Do, Check, and Act as the foundation for all QA/PI activities. The four stages of the QM cycle are as follows: Plan: The first stage of the cycle identifies areas or processes for improvement. Areas for improvement will be identified with input from all stakeholders associated with the process. Do: The second stage of the cycle implements the activities identified in t he planning stage. The activities must be objective, measurable, evidenced based and outcomes oriented. Stakeholders in the QM process work closely together to ensure that the activities identified in the planning stage occur in an efficient, timely mann er. Check: The third stage of the cycle focuses on assessment of the results of implemented activities. Performance is reviewed to determine how actual performance compares to standards/benchmarks defined during the planning phase and monitored during im plementation. Pennsylvania Page 12 of 88 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 145 of 323 Revised February 17, 2003 ` Act: The final stage of the cycle focuses on the development and initiation of activities for increasing or sustaining improvement. Performance improvement projects must be timely, measurable and progressive. Information on the success o f the project, in the aggregate, is periodically summarized and communicated in sufficient time to provide operational information on quality of care. The annual review of performance reinitiates the continuous quality improvement process beginning with th e planning stage of the QM cycle. Data Sources/Information Management OMHSAS collects data necessary to measure the performance of programs and plans under its purview. The data includes financial, operational/process and clinical measures, as well as out come data. In the development of these data sources, OMHSAS has relied on internal resources, stakeholder input, provider input and recommendations of national groups and accreditation organizations. Data sources include, but are not limited to: Aggregat e Encounter Reports, Person Level Encounter Reports, Claims Data, POMS and CCR/POMS Reports, Early Warning Reports, Quarterly Monitoring Reports Focused Studies, Monitoring Team Reports, Consumer/Family Satisfaction Surveys, Readiness Reviews, Hospital Ser vice reports Drug Usage Utilization reports Seclusion and Restraint reports Risk Management reports Incident reports Financial reports Best Practice reports - PennMAPS CHIPP/SIPP reports Performance Measurement reports Licensing Reports, and Data from ot her agencies. Quality Management Developmental Activities Pennsylvania Page 13 of 88 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 146 of 323 Revised February 17, 2003 ` Purpose of the QMP and QM work plan The purpose of the QMP is to: Articulate the OMHSAS philosophy of quality and its components, Define activities which reflect system performance, Determine t he frequency and scope of measurement or oversight activities, Identify key staff or groups responsible for measurement and oversight, Outline the structure for dissemination of information and feedback to key stakeholders, and Establish the mechanisms fo r corrective action or remediation. The purpose of the QM work plan: Identify quality assessment and improvement activities, Build upon analysis of existing measures, Identify new measures which broadly reflect the performance of OMHSAS programs and services, and For the identified measures, define scope and frequency of measurement, responsible staff and feedback mechanisms. Development of Quality Management Annual Work plan On an annual basis, a QM work plan is developed that defines the: Scope of t he activities for the coming year, Specific areas to be reviewed, Type of study or activity, Relevant indicators to be measured, Goals or benchmarks for the measures, Timeframes, and Staff responsible. The work plan areas of focus may include additional m onitoring of areas already under review, refinement of existing measures or new measures based on input from QM constituencies. In the third quarter of the year, the review of current indicators as well as recommended new measures will be brought to the QMC. The QMC will review the measures to ensure that they are consistent with OMHSAS' goals for that year. The review will include an assessment of the scope, relevance, and effectiveness of indicators, interventions and recommendations. It ensures that th e work plan incorporates the principles of cultural competence, CSP, and CASSP as well as including measures relevant to the Health Department's Bureau of Drug and Alcohol Program goals. The Committee will evaluate measurement methodology to ensure consist ent, reliable results. Based on areas of interest or concern that may develop during the year, the Work plan can be modified as needed. Pennsylvania Page 14 of 88 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 147 of 323 Revised February 17, 2003 ` After indicators are identified and approved by the committee, the work plan will be developed and submitted to Executi ve Council for approval. Developing Indicators Indicator development is based on addressing the following: What do stakeholders say is important? What is our current level of performance? How stable are our current processes? What areas could be improved? How important will the changes be and how difficult will they be to achieve -\"utility\" and \"burden\"? What should our improvement priorities be? Have strategies or specifications to stabilize or improve performance been developed? Have specifications for n ew or redesigned processes been met? Have strategies to stabilize or improve performance been effective? Indicators are developed based on a review of national accreditation and regulatory groups' recommendations that delivery systems should collect data to support both improvement priorities and continuing measurements of the following: Access to, and availability of care and services, Appropriateness of care and services, Continuity and coordination of care and services, Confidentiality, Provider Networ k, Provider Profiling, Utilization Management, Evidence based -practices, Cultural competence of programs and services, Consumer, family and individuals with substance use disorders perception of and satisfaction with services, Provider perceptions of and satisfaction with programs and services, Member complaints, grievances and appeals, Outcomes related to functional, physical, and psychological status of members, Effectiveness of preventive services and health promotion programs, Medication usage practic es, Appropriateness of seclusion and restraint procedures Adverse clinical events, Adequacy and quality of provider network, Financial performance of the delivery system, Risk management activities, and Quality control activities Pennsylvania Page 15 of 88 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 148 of 323 Revised February 17, 2003 ` The measures adopted are subject to review and revision as necessary. Standards/Benchmarks Implementation of quality standards and benchmarks is an essential means of evaluating the success of the behavioral health program. Many plans and programs nationally have evaluated and/or implemented performance improvement measures, but differences in program structure, covered services, administration, financing, and enrolled populations make meaningful cross -state comparisons difficult. For that reason, it has been necessary for DPW to e valuate existing measures and customize them to the needs of OMHSAS programs. OMHSAS uses expert opinion, historic service patterns and performance, national \"best practices\" standards and where available national benchmarks as a means of program evaluatio n. Distribution of Findings An important objective of the QM process is to ensure that data is used to encourage and stimulate continuous improvement throughout the system. QM is responsible for aggregating the data from the various measurement systems a nd preparing reports summarizing the findings. Some reports will be prepared on a routine basis. Other reports will be produced as new findings or trends emerge. Information will be disseminated to all interested parties. Annual Review of QM Program On a n annual basis the Division of Quality Management will prepare a written review of the QM program for review and approval by the QMC. The evaluation will be sent to the Executive Council and the Deputy Secretary for OMHSAS for review and approval. The sum mary will address: The extent to which the QM goals have been met The impact of QM activities on improving the quality and effectiveness of care and services provided to individuals within the behavioral health system, Proposed modification, continuation or elimination of current activities, Identify opportunities for continued improvement, and Development of the QM work plan. OMHSAS Annual Report The OMHSAS prepares the Annual Report that highlights the accomplishments of various program s for the previo us year. The report, available to the public, presents summaries for all HealthChoices zones. Information is gathered from the various monitoring and reporting instruments used throughout the year. Sections of the report present summaries of: The current program status Distribution of eligibles Diagnoses by region, gender and age Person level encounter data Regional penetration rates Financial expenditures Consumer satisfaction survey results Pennsylvania Page 16 of 88 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 149 of 323 Revised February 17, 2003 ` Complaints, Grievances, Fair Hearings Reinvestment plans Quality Initiatives Performance Outcome Measurement System External Quality Reviews HealthChoices program outcomes Future Initiatives County Accomplishments The Bureau of Financial Management and Administration prepares an Annual Report of the financial impact o f the behavioral health programs including HealthChoices. Pennsylvania Page 17 of 88 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 150 of 323 Revised August 6, 2003 Section I HealthChoices Background On February 1, 1997, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's DPW introduced a new integrated and coordinated health care delivery system, known as HealthChoices. H ealthChoices is the largest Medicaid program administered by the Department and consists of three components. The OMAP administers two components - the Physical Health Program and the Independent Enrollment Assistance Program. The OMHSAS administers the t hird component - the Behavioral Health Program. The purpose of the program is to provide medical, psychiatric and substance abuse services to MA recipients. The HealthChoices mandatory managed care program is currently being phased in across the Commonwea lth. The needs of the high risk populations included in the HealthChoices managed care program requires broad -based coordination to assure appropriate access, service utilization and continuity of care for persons with serious mental illness and or addicti ve diseases. Because of the cross -cutting coordination needs of MA recipients, the unique structure of the behavioral health and human services delivery systems administered by the counties, and their over 30 years experience in administering behavioral he alth services programs, it was determined that county governments would be offered the right -of-first opportunity to enter into a capitated contract with the Commonwealth. HealthChoices is operational in the Southeast, Southwest and Lehigh/Capitol zones and provides care to over 900,000 Medicaid eligible Pennsylvanians in 25 counties. The following chart outlines the oversight structure of the HealthChoices program for each county within the three regions where the HealthChoices program has been im plemented to date: Pennsylvania Page 18 of 88 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 151 of 323 Revised February 17, 2004 HealthChoices Oversight County Oversight MCO/ASO Commen ts Bucks Bucks Co.

OMHSAS has assigned to the Bureau of Operations and Quality Management the responsibility for oversight of the HealthChoices Program. This section of the OMHSAS QM plan will articulate the specific qu ality assessment and performance improvement oversight and monitoring activities of the HealthChoices Program. Structure The overall structure for coordination, communication, and review of the QM Program is described in the \"Structure\" section of the Q M Plan. QM structure specific to the HealthChoices Program is as follows: HealthChoices Steering Committee The HealthChoices Steering Committee is responsible for the implementation and management of the HealthChoices behavioral health services under the purview of OMHSAS. The steering committee meets twice monthly. The group establishes annual priorities, reviews progress, recommends policies for approval, reviews and recommends approval of reinvestment plans, coordinates with other offices, and ensures t imely communication of behavioral health issues. Quality improvement activities include review of HealthChoices quality management reports, discussion of areas of concern or interest to OMHSAS Bureaus, suggestions for modifications and adjustments to the Q M plan, and recommendations for sanctions as necessary to address performance issues. Some members of the steering committee participate in the Joint Management Committee that includes representatives of other Offices within DPW, as well as participants fr om other programs that serve OMHSAS constituents. Members include: Office of the Medical Director Director for the Bureau of Financial Management and Administration Director of the Bureau of Children's Services Director of the Bureau of Operations and Q uality Management Director of the Division of Quality Management Director of the Division of Medicaid and Financial Review Director of the Division of Substance Abuse Services Director of the Division of Evaluation and MIS Director of the Division of Easte rn Operations Director of the Division of Western Operations Pennsylvania Page 20 of 88 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 153 of 323 Revised February 17, 2004 Reporting/Monitoring Oversight Activities Periodic and ongoing oversight activities are a required component of the HealthChoices program to ensure that the counties and BH -MCO's comply with t he standards established by the Commonwealth and CMS. Items selected for periodic and ongoing oversight reflect clinical and non -clinical services and administrative functions provided by the delivery system. The critical elements required by the Request for Proposal (RFP) , Contract and Program Standards and Requirement documents form the basis for review. The elements include: Access and service availability Coordination and continuity of care Medical necessity In-plan services Provider and member enrollment/disenrollment Credentialing and recredentialing Utilization management Member rights and services Complaints , grievances and appeals Confidentiality Quality management Information systems and Executive management The monitoring and oversight activities are the first level of performance assessment and are used to identify areas for performance improvement. Readiness Reviews Readiness reviews are conducted by OMHSAS subsequent to the award of a contract for a HealthChoices behavioral health program and when there are major changes in the program model or changes in sub -contractors. The readiness reviews focus on the critical issues necessary for the plan to provide services on the first day of operations. OMHSAS, Office of Children Youth and Families, Mental Retardation, and BDAP staff as well as consumers, families and individuals with substance use disorders conduct readiness reviews using a Readiness Assessment Instrument (RAI). The RAI outlines the critical elements required by the RFP and the evidence necessary to demonstrate compliance. OMHSAS Monitoring Team Activities Each of the four regions in the Commonwealth has Monitoring Teams located in the field office. The Monitoring Teams led by the Team Leader interface with the HealthChoic es plans (for those regions where HealthChoices has been implemented), as well as with other programs funded by DPW. Monitoring Teams produce regular reports as well as file notes regarding their activities. Information from Monitoring Teams is provided to QM in order to incorporate the findings into QM initiatives and planning. Activities of the monitoring teams include: Pennsylvania Page 21 of 88 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 154 of 323 Revised February 17, 2004 Participate in readiness reviews, Monitor the program requirements annually, Meet regularly (at least monthly) with HealthChoices pla ns, Meet on ad hoc basis with plans regarding specific issues or concerns, Review program reports and data, Collaborates with the Division of Quality Management in the monitoring of progress of corrective and performance improvement plans, Interface with l ocal advisory committees or workgroups, Review CCR/POMS data with the plans, and As requested, monitor the investigatory process and resolution for complaints. Monitoring Reports Monitoring of the HealthChoices program begins during the start -up phase of each new HealthChoices zone with the Early Warning Reports (EWP) , aggregate encounter data, transition monitoring reports and weekly monitoring meetings with each county . Data Validation Reports The Division of Evaluation and MIS performs numerous quali ty checks on the data received from the HealthChoices Counties and produces the following reports: PLE submission analysis Comparison of Category of Service and Category of Aid Aggregate to PLE comparison Analysis of Inpatient Begin and End Dates First a nd Second level edit analysis Analysis of 'unknowns' in consumer data Early Warning Care M onitoring Program Reports (EWP) The EWP is designed to detect implementation problems through the monitoring of a limited set of indicators that evaluate access to services, quality and appropriateness of services, BH - MCO functions, and stakeholder feedback. During the initial start -up phase, data is reported weekly, monthly and then quarterly. The report includes: Service authorization Residential Treatment utiliza tion Minority authorization Service denials Complaints/grievances Rate of re -hospitalization Rate of involuntary admissions Claims payment Consumer/Family satisfaction Provider satisfaction Pennsylvania Page 22 of 88 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 155 of 323 Revised February 17, 2004 Stakeholder feedback BH-MCO functions/changes Quarterly Monitor ing Report Following the first year of implementation as the program matures, ongoing monitoring of the indicators occurs quarterly. The report includes: Service utilization Minority utilization Service denials complaints/grievances Rate of re -hospitali zation Rate of involuntary admissions Claims payment Consumer/Family satisfaction Provider satisfaction Stakeholder feedback BH-MCO functions/changes Utilization Reports In the second year, person level encounter data is validated and utilization reports are produced annually. Data is provided by the counties and is aggregated, analyzed and reviewed by the Division of QM, Bureau Directors, Monitoring Teams Leaders, counties and the BH -MCOs. Areas for improvement as well as best practices are identified. C ounties and BH-MCOs initiate action to improve performance. Internal Management Reports The Internal Management Report provides a quarterly analysis of service patterns for each County and BH -MCO. The purpose of the report is to provide key information t o OMHSAS senior management regarding critical aspects of HealthChoices services. The current quarter's information is compared to the previous quarter and previous year. The included areas are: Service utilization for in -plan services Service denials Claims processing Member complaints Demographics Complaints, Grievances and Appeal Reports The Division of Evaluation and MIS develop complaint and grievance reports. The Division of Complaints and Grievances develop appeal reports based on information provi ded by the Counties and the BH -MCOs. The reports reflect the number and types of complaints, grievances and appeals, as well as the timeliness of resolution. These reports help to identify trends suggesting inadequate or inappropriate service delivery. Th e Division of Complaints Pennsylvania Page 23 of 88 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 156 of 323 Revised February 17, 2004 and Grievances coordinates with the Monitoring Team for follow -up needed to resolve individual complaints or trends requiring improvement. Consumer/Family Satisfaction Teams HealthChoices requires that each plan institute mechanis ms to evaluate the satisfaction of members with the services provided by the BH -MCOs. Counties/BH -MCOs are required to establish a Consumer/Family Satisfaction Teams (CFSTs) to assess satisfaction through face - to-face interviews with people who have receiv ed services. CFSTs are staffed by consumers, families and individuals with substance use disorders, and are considered an excellent means to obtain information that would be unavailable through written or telephonic surveys. Quarterly reports are submitted to OMHSAS. Results of the CFST reviews and surveys are incorporated into the QM planning process. Medical Record Reviews Annually a medical record review on a sample of care management charts at each county/BH -MCO across the identified levels of care i s conducted. The chart review has three (3) sections: general information, medical necessity, and quality of care. The general information section documents demographics, referral source, and provider location. The medical necessity section reviews the degree to which medical necessity was documented for the initial admission, the length of treatment, and, for selected levels of care, the intensity of treatment. The quality of care section reviews documentation on the following eight (8) clinical dimen sions: Adequacy of clinical history Adequacy of diagnostic formulation Assessment for dual diagnosis Care manager efforts to assess and enhance the quality of care Appropriateness of discharge planning Adequacy of post -discharge follow -up Appropriateness of physician review when risk factors were present Appropriateness of actions taken when care was denied (e.g., informing members of their rights to appeal) Additionally, OMHSAS staff conducts medical record reviews to validate findings from other qualit y improvement activities. Provider Profiling OMHSAS is instituting the Provider Profiling Score Card to assist with implementation and monitoring of a provider profiling requirement under performance -based contracting (PBC) and will be monitored as a com ponent of the ACES. The purpose of the Provider Profiling Score Card is to allow the County/Behavioral Health Managed Care Organization (BH -MCO) to conduct a self -assessment of their performance on the PBC provider profiling requirement. The self -assess ment will evaluate the percentage of targeted providers who were managed appropriately through quarterly provider profiling. Pennsylvania Page 24 of 88 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 157 of 323 Revised February 17, 2004 The elements included in the self assessment include: Provider Profiles are completed quarterly. Provider Profiles include at a mi nimum: Access measures (e.g., appointment availability), Utilization/efficiency measures (e.g., average length of stay (ALOS), readmission rates), Quality measures (e.g., customer satisfaction, complaints and grievances, critical incidents, outcomes), and Process measures (e.g., compliance with utilization management (UM) protocols, quality management (QM) protocols, quality of assessments, treatment plans) There is a profiling strategy that includes: o How providers will be selected for profiling (e.g., def inition of high volume or problem providers), o How the profiling data will be reported and utilized to improve access, efficiency, and the quality of care, and o How profiled data will be integrated with other existing managed care functions. There is a strat egy for benchmarking provider performance that includes: o How benchmarks will be established, o How outliers will be determined, and o What action(s) will be taken with providers identified as outliers? Performance Based Contracting OMHSAS has developed a perf ormance based contracting approach to evaluating and improving the quality of service for HealthChoices members. Under this approach, a HealthChoices Performance Report (HPR) is generated for the county/BH -MCO based upon its performance measured against OM HSAS performance targets. The first HRPs will be published in the first quarter of 2004 and will be based on calendar year 2001 and 2002 Person Level Encounter (PLE) data and will include a set of performance indicators related to access, process and qua lity outcomes. Clinical targets will be set in the future for each HealthChoices Counties. Clinical targets are developed based on: Each contractor's baseline for each performance indicator Benchmarking data from other states' experience, research -based \" gold standard\" Performance Improvement attainment and other HealthChoices contractor data. Expected impact of improving care management, network management, and quality management policies and procedure. Input from the various HealthChoices stakeholders. Utilization targets are developed based on: Benchmarking utilization rates from other states' experience, research -based \"expected\" utilization rates and other HealthChoices contractor data. Each contractor's baseline for each utilization measure Expected impact of improving care management, network management, and quality management policies and procedure. Pennsylvania Page 25 of 88 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 158 of 323 Revised February 17, 2004 Input from the various HealthChoices stakeholders. Initial utilization targets are for adults with serious mental illness (SMI) receiving inpatient care and will be incorporated in the rate setting process in the future. Future targets may be set for other clinical sub -populations, specifically children and adolescents. Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) Development Each County/BH -MCO will develop an a nnual PIP subject to OMHSAS review and approval. The PIP is directed to the attainment of Performance Improvement and utilization targets. The PIP design should describe how the County/ BH -MCO will achieve and sustain over time, significant improvement in clinical and non -clinical areas that are expected to have a favorable effect on service outcomes and member satisfaction. Counties/BH -MCO's will periodically report the status and results of the PIP to OMHSAS during the evaluation year. Focused Studies Periodically, DPW may identify issues that surface during the course of internal and external program oversight and monitoring. OMHSAS, County or BH -MCO staff may conduct studies. OMHSAS QM reviews information from focused studies in order to use the findin gs to develop QM initiatives and planning. Areas for review could include: Operations Clinical Financial Information Systems OMHSAS internal practices Annually, OMHSAS reviews the impact and effectiveness of the County/BH -MCOs Quality assessment and per formance improvement activities. External Quality Review (EQR) As required by the 1915(b) CMS Waiver, OMHSAS must conduct or arrange for an annual independent assessment of the timeliness, outcomes and accessibility of services covered under each County/B H-MCO contract within the HealthChoices program. The OMHSAS provides an independent assessment of plan components through a contract with an EQR organization. Results of the assessments are provided to the counties and may become the basis for performance improvement activities. Findings from these assessments are incorporated into QM initiatives and planning.. Previously, Pennsylvania's EQR activities consisted of the review of performance indicators to assess the quality of services delivered. With the changes brought about by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, EQR activities will consist of the required mandatory activities outlined in the External Quality Review of Medicaid Managed Care Organizations; Final Rule. Under the final rule, three mandatory ac tivities are required. Each of the mandatory activities described in \u00a7438.358 will be carried out using methods consistent with the protocols identified by CMS under the final rule. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Page 26 of 88 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 159 of 323 Revised February 17, 2004 OMHSAS strategy for completion of each of the mandat ory activities and ensuring that the EQRO has the necessary information to complete the required detailed technical report described in \u00a7438.364 include: Validation of performance improvement projects . This includes an annual review of the data collectio n process, analysis techniques, and instructions or tools used for implementing each project. The EQRO has the responsibility for validation of performance improvement projects following methods consistent with the CMS protocols. Validation of the County /BH-MCO's performance measures . This includes an annual review to ensure that appropriate populations are accounted for and that the measures are calculated in accordance with the specifications developed by OMHSAS. Again, the EQRO is responsible for vali dating MCO performance measures through methods consistent with CMS protocols. Review of the County's/ BH -MCO's compliance with OMHSAS structural and operational standards . Information included in the annual external quality review must be derived from an assessment of compliance with standards that occurred within the last three years. For this activity, the OMHSAS will furnish the EQRO with information based on compliance reviews conducted within the past three years, while recognizing that the EQRO mus t annually review the access to, timeliness of, and quality outcomes of services provided by the BH -MCOs. This will be accomplished through the provisions in \u00a7438.360 - Nonduplication of mandatory activities. Monitoring results performed by OMHSAS staff according to methods consistent with the CMS protocol will be used to provide the EQRO with the necessary information Nonduplication of mandatory external quality review activity As described in the preceding section, the OMHSAS will use the provisions of \u00a7438.360 to fulfill its obligation for the compliance with standards mandatory activity. After careful review of the OMHSAS monitoring standards, it was determined that sufficient information exists for all areas required within the structural and oper ational review. Additionally, quality reviews performed by contractors other than the EQRO may be used if needed to supplement and/or reinforce this source. The EQRO will be provided the necessary information to address the subparts included within sco pe of the MCO compliance: Enrollee Rights and Protections Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement o Access Standards (availability of services, coordination and continuity of care, coverage and authorization of services) o Structure and Operational St andards (Provider selection, Enrollee information, confidentiality, enrollment and disenrollment, grievance systems, sub contractual relationships and delegation) Pennsylvania Page 27 of 88 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 160 of 323 Revised February 17, 2004 o Measurement and Improvement Standards (Practice guidelines, Quality assessment and performanc e improvement program, Health information system) Grievance System Current EQR study topics include: Inpatient Hospitalization for Schizophrenia Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Residential Treatment Facilities Behavioral Health Rehabilitative Se rvices Antipsychotic Medication Prescribing Practices Encounter Data of the County's/ BH -MCO's compliance with OMHSAS structural and operational standards. The Quality Strategy includes monitoring of the Medicaid contract provisions that are outlined in the County/BH -MCO contracts. The provisions incorporate the established Standards for Access to Care, Structure and Operations and Quality Management and Improvement. Annual Compliance Evaluation Summary (ACES) ACES is a computer -driven, ongoing, monitoring tool used to evaluate the Counties/BH - MCOs compliance with state and federal regulations, and the requirements of the HealthChoices Program. It provides a standardized means to track the progress of county/BH -MCO HealthChoices operation s from pre -implementation through system maturity. In addition to tracking compliance with the requirements of HealthChoices, ACES provides a master file of supporting documentation. The major areas of focus are: access and service availability, coordinati on and continuity of care, medical necessity, in -plan services, provider and member enrollment/disenrollment, credentialing and recredentialing, utilization management, member rights and services, complaints, grievances and appeals, confidentiality, qualit y management, information systems, and executive management. Contract monitoring teams use various program and financial management reports to identify contract specific issues that may require more intensive review.

Pennsylvania Page 72 of 88 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 205 of 323 Revised February 17, 2004 Section II State/County Community Mental Health Program Background The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has a county -based system of mental health and substance abuse services, with county government responsible for the provision of mental health and substance abuse services to citizens within their subdivision. The Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act of 1966 requires county governments to provide community mental health services, including short -term inpatient treatment, partial hospitali zation, outpatient care, emergency services, specialized rehabilitation training, vocational rehabilitation, and residential arrangements. The state is divided into 88 service areas based on population. These service areas are grouped into 46 single or mul ti county units under the direction of county mental health administrators. All county administrators also function as the directors of the county Mental Retardation programs and in 35 counties, as Drug and Alcohol Program Administrators. Counties managed as a multi -county group are referred to as \"Joinders\". Introduction Each county mental health program is required to report data to OMHSAS that is similar to HealthChoices. Beginning in CY 2004 counties will be required to identify a quality management process as an integral part of the county mental health planning process. The County mental health planning process is designed to move counties toward using the CCR/POMS data and other data the county analyzed as part of the county planning process to def ine needs and develop the estimate of cost to meet those needs. In addition, the County Plan guidelines promote evidence -based practices as outlined in the CSP and Recovery Principles for adults and CASSP principles for children and adolescents. The pla nning process will include stakeholder and public input into the design and implementation of the County Mental Health plan. Additionally, a portion of the County Mental Health plan is a regional Service Area Plan that focuses on the needs of the SMI popu lation served in the community and state mental hospitals. The Service Area Plan is designed to develop a strategy to shift the mental health delivery system away from reliance on large institutions and toward an array of treatment services and supports i n the community. The purpose of the plan is to develop a recovery oriented community service system that is responsive to the treatment and support needs of people in state hospitals and persons who may potentially need state hospitalization. The plan determines the role of the state hospital within the service area. Pennsylvania Page 73 of 88 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 206 of 323 Revised February 17, 2004 Structure The overall structure for coordination, communication, and review of the QM Program is described in the \"Structure\" section of the QM Plan. QM structure specific to the Comm unity Mental Health Program is as follows: Counties and the state mental hospitals routinely conduct continuity of care meetings to problem solve, discuss bed use management, methods for improving community tenure, complex cases, and service delivery devel opment. The meetings provide information that will assist the Counties and state mental hospitals in the development of the County Mental Health Plan, service area plan and Community Hospital Integration Projects Program (CHIPP) requests. The Quality Man agement section of the County Mental Health Plan porvides a brief description of the county's quality management program, defines the program structure, processes, content and includes: Delineation of program responsibility. Description of the activities employed to engage consumers, families and other stakeholders in the development of the Quality Management plan. Identification of monitoring activities Process of reviewing, analyzing, identifying barriers and or gaps in the service delivery system Description of quality management activities to monitor progress toward meeting the service area plan performance goals Description of quality improvement activities planned or undertaken as a result of monitoring activities directed toward enhancing the ser vice delivery system Description of efforts to monitor individual outcomes through the Performance Outcome Measurement System Plans for development or expansion of consumer and family satisfaction activities Activities to offer assurance of contracted ser vice provider credentialing, including adherence to all applicable regulations or standards through licensure, certification and/or accreditation. Monitoring of unserved/over served/underserved/high users Plan to monitor/reduce critical incidents Plan to incorporate the findings from the use of CASSP Bulletin/CSP Indicators Rating Scale in the Quality Management Plan Monitoring of the Service Area Plan performance goals Description of future quality management/improvement activities The QM section of the County Mental Health Plan will be reviewed by QM staff in conjunction with the OMHSAS field office staff based on the established review criteria and provide comments/recommendations to the field office staff and support as necessary. Annually, the Co unty Mental Health Plan provides the opportunity for counties to present information on how they are providing the best care and treatment, in the most efficient and effective manner in the least restrictive environment to those persons who are most in nee d. Specific items to be included are: Pennsylvania Page 74 of 88 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 207 of 323 Revised February 17, 2004 A brief description of the trends and issues that were identified through the analysis of data from the county profile, other relevant sources, service area planning and stakeholder input, A summary of the issues ide ntified through the quality assurance process with a particular emphasis on any changes that if made, could improve the quality of or access to treatment programs, services and supports, A synopsis of the plan for new, revised or enhanced services, and Issues and actions needed to move the treatment, service, and supports provided to adults toward a recovery -oriented service system. QM presents a summary to the Quality Management Committee of the significant findings from the county submissions. Reporting/ Monitoring Oversight Activities CCR/POMS Consolidated Consumer Reports (CCR) and Performance Outcomes Measurement System (POMS) Reports are derived from the person level encounter reporting data, as well as from the consumer registry, quarterly status rep orts and secondary data sources. POMS (HealthChoices services) and CCR/POMS (community base funded services) measures are intended to assess the outcome of service rather than solely the cost or amount of service. In addition to measuring performance using structure and process indicators, OMHSAS will be capturing information related to outcomes using 27 specific outcome measures. These measures have been identified through a process involving OMHSAS staff as well as Advisory Board members, and include mea sures that would be relevant for both adults and children. CHIPP/SIPP The Service Area Plan will include data related to The Community Hospital Integration Projects Program (CHIPP). CHIPP is a program designed to promote the discharge of persons with a l ong-term history of hospitalization or otherwise complex service needs that have been unable to be supported successfully in the community. Once a county has been notified of a CHIPP award, monthly status reports are required until all identified CHIPP individuals have been discharged. Following discharge, the county is required to report the progress of these individuals to the OMHSAS Division of Operations Field Office, Bureau of Financial Management and Administration, the state hospital and the Bureau of Hospital Operations. A separate program called the Southeast Integration Projects Program (SIPP) was implemented in the five southeastern counties (Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery, and Philadelphia) in fiscal year 1997 -1998. This program was an ini tiative that originated as a result of the closure of Haverford State Mental Hospital and the subsequent June 1998 court order to place people in community settings. It operates in a manner similar to the CHIPP program, but provides counties the capacity t o provide more specialized services to persons with a broader range of service needs. Reports are provided every six months in the second and third year of the project and then annually. The reports monitor the quality of services delivered within the c ommunity and the managed care environment. The reports include: Pennsylvania Page 75 of 88 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 208 of 323 Revised February 17, 2004 Major Incidents within 24 hours of occurrence Name of person placed CCRS client identification number State hospital discharged from Name of assigned ICM Location of where person is living County and MA funded services received by the person Cost of services provided (CHIPP/SIPP funds) Summary of feedback from the Consumer/Family Satisfaction Team Community Mental Health Block Grant Progress Reports The OMHSAS Division of Evaluation and MIS p roduces a number of reports regarding Block Grant Initiatives.

Approved: Expires: Page 211 of 323 Revised February 17, 2004 Section III State Mental Hospitals Background The Bureau of Hospital Operations oversees and directs the nine state -owned and operated mental health hospitals and one restoration (long -term care) center, including three maximum -securi ty forensic units for persons with serious mental illness who are charged with or convicted of criminal offenses. Introduction The Bureau reviews and analyzes management reports and clinical information related to state hospital/restoration center utilizat ion, in order to anticipate and resolve emerging problems. It administers systemic risk management and performance improvement initiatives and data tracking systems to identify areas needing improvement and to identify and replicate best treatment practice s. The Bureau uses these results to establish system -wide standards and policies for treatment and clinical functions, which adhere to or exceed accepted best practice. The Bureau maintains multi -hospital Joint Commission for Accreditation of Health Care O rganizations (JCAHO) accreditation, Medicare and Medicaid certification. In order to ensure that inpatient hospital/restoration center treatment is provided in environments that foster consumer empowerment, dignity and recovery, consistent with Community S upport Program (CSP) principles, the Bureau works collegially with consumers, family members, ombudspersons and advocates to improve the quality of life for hospital patients. Each hospital has an advocate to represent the interests of the patients. The advocate at each hospital attends the executive staff meetings of the hospital. Since all patients are admitted to state hospitals through the County Mental Health system, the Bureau collaborates with county, local hospital and community provider staff, constituents and other stakeholders to establish effective community/hospital linkages and continuity of care for patients discharged back into the community. The Bureau collaborates with other OMHSAS bureaus and divisions in planning, developing and implem enting future Community/Hospital Integration Project Program (CHIPP) initiatives as a resource for expanding community -based care. Structure The overall structure for coordination, communication, and review of the QM Program is described in the \"Structure\" section of the QM Plan. Facilities must be accredited by JCAHO and in keeping with JCAHO terminology; Quality Management/Performance Improvement activities at the facility level are addressed under the title of Performance Improvement. These activities are embodied in each facility's Performance Improvement Plan and directed by hospital -based Chief Performance Improvement Officers and the local Quality Management /Performance Improvement Committees comprised of clinical and administrative leadership. Eac h facility details its program in a Performance Improvement Plan and reviews the success of its initiatives Pennsylvania Page 79 of 88 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 212 of 323 Revised February 17, 2004 annually. Based upon the results, the plan is subsequently revised. Each facility may develop and monitor local indicators to address high -volume/hi gh risk or problem -prone aspects of care or identified opportunities to improve care or services. Performance related information is exchanged through regularly scheduled meetings of the Performance Improvement officers, Chief Executive Officers and Chief s of hospital operating divisions such as Clinical Services, Nursing and Social/Rehabilitative Services. As noted in the State/County Community Mental Health Program section, Counties and the state mental hospitals routinely conduct continuity of care mee tings to problem solve, discuss bed use management, methods for improving community tenure, complex cases, and service delivery development. The meetings provide information that will assist the Counties and state mental hospitals in the development of the County Mental Health Plan, service area plan and Community Hospital Integration Projects Program (CHIPP) requests. Reporting/Monitoring Oversight Activities Pennsylvania State Mental Hospital Performance Measurement System (PaSMH -PMS) At the Bureau leve l, activities include the PaSMH -PMS which tracks individual facility and system performance on a set of key quality/risk management indicators. A subset of these indicators is reported to the JCAHO ORYX performance measurement system. To allow common -size comparison, indicators are adjusted to reflect the rate of occurrence per 1000 patients. Additionally, some indicators are risk -adjusted to reflect population characteristics. Subsets of the system relate to general psychiatric, forensic psychiatric and lo ng-term care populations. Facilities report monthly data and control/comparison charts are generated and distributed to facility and Bureau staff.

Many of the Risk Management categories are comparable to those of the PaSMH -PMS system. Monthly reports are generated and distributed to key OMHSAS staff. Additional categories include : Substance abuse Criminal acts Communications misuse Contraband possession Family concerns Missing property/thefts Treatment errors Property damage Seizures Sudden acute illnesses Suicide attempts Community Incidents (while on leave) Drug Usage Review S ystem (DURS) The Bureau's facilities participate in joint initiatives with the OMHSAS Office of the Medical Director. The OMHSAS DURS is designed to perform a variety of computerized review functions at the facility and system level. The system allows rev iew of drug use by facility, by patient, by drug class and by provider. Cost analysis within categories is available. At the OMHSAS level, DURS facilitates comparison of key factors between facilities. The Division of Quality Management supplies technical and administrative support.

This algorithm based best practice defines administration practices for the initiation and progression of drug therapy for patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. The Division of Quality Management supplies technical support. CHIPP/SIPP The Service Area Plan will include data related to The Community Hospital Integration Projects Program (CHIPP). CHIPP is a program designed to promote the discharge of persons with a long -term history of hospitalization or otherwise complex service needs th at have been unable to be supported successfully in the community. Once a county has been notified of a CHIPP award, monthly status reports are required until all identified CHIPP individuals have been discharged. Following discharge, the county is requir ed to report the progress of these individuals to the OMHSAS Bureau of Operations and Quality Management, Field Office, Bureau of Financial Management and Administration, the state hospital and the Bureau of Hospital Operations. A separate program called t he Southeast Integration Projects Program (SIPP) was implemented in the five southeastern counties (Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery, and Philadelphia) in fiscal year 1997 -1998. This program was an initiative that originated as a result of the closure of Haverford State Mental Hospital and the subsequent June 1998 court order to place people in community settings. It operates in a manner similar to the CHIPP program, but provides counties the capacity to provide more specialized services to persons with a broader range of service needs. Reports are provided every six months in the second and third year of the project and then annually. The reports monitor the quality of services delivered within the community and the managed care environment. The repo rts include: Major Incidents within 24 hours of occurrence Name of person placed CCRS client identification number State hospital discharged from Name of assigned ICM Location of where person is living County and MA funded services received by the person Cost of services provided (CHIPP/SIPP funds) Summary of feedback from the Consumer/Family Satisfaction Team Pennsylvania Page 82 of 88 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 215 of 323 Revised February 17, 2004 Pennsylvania Page 83 of 88 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 216 of 323 Revised August 6, 2003 Appendix 1 Office of Mental Health & Substance Abuse Services OMHSAS Bureau Functions Deputy Secretary for OMHSAS Leads and d irects the public policy and administration of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's public mental health and substance abuse system.

Suicide claims the lives of over 1300 Pennsylvanians each year; that is an average of 3.5 lives each day. It is estim ated that each suicide directly affects six people; therefore, over 7800 Pennsylvanians b ecome survivors of suicide each year. Former U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher presented the Call to Action to Prevent Suicide in 1999 in which he stated that the problems of suicide and suicide prevention are critical public health priorities for our nation. Th e National Strategy for Suicide Prevention debuted in 2001. The Advisory committee of the Office of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services (OMHSAS) prioritized a state suicide prevention plan as one of the major goals for OMHSAS. A workgroup was formed and began to meet in July 2005. This prevention plan is a collaborative effort be tween those dedicated individuals from both the public and private sectors of our state. The workgroup is striving to raise awareness about suicide and its prevention so that fe wer Pennsylvanians expe rience the pain and grief resulting from the su icide death of a loved one. On behalf of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania we would like to thank the many who have put time and energy into this important initiative. Estelle Richman Nora Dowd Eisenhower Calvin B.

One of the ir onies of suicide prevention is that, with very few exceptions, little suicide prevention is directed at adults, and, outside of the military, the correctional system, and the Veterans Administration, there have been few meaningful attempts to reduce the incide nce of suicide among men. This plan speaks to that need. It is a positive, long-awaite d, and necessary step towards addressing the problem of adult suicide in ev ery community in Pennsylvania. I care a lot about adult suicide prevention. I even have some data on adult suicide on a bulletin board hanging next to my desk at my office. On this singl e sheet of paper are statistics downloaded many years ago from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) web site. The data tables report US suicides for 1996 by age and gender. There's a small checkmark next to the total deaths for males ages 25-29. That year 2361 men in that age group completed suicide. I knew the guy on th e end. His name was Paul, our oldest child, and he was 28 when we lost him in November 1996. I look at those numbers every work day and I think about Paul. For a few moments the enormity of his loss and the se verity of its after effects hit me, and the pain, the sadness, and the regrets sweep over me. Most of th e time I quickly get back to the present and move on with my day. Yet I have not moved on or gotten over our loss, but somewhere in the intervening years I did re cover from it. This is not the same thing as \"healing,\" a term that, in my mind, equates a traumatic loss to a cut finger. I have rebuilt my life around my loss and I now live a \"new normal,\" though one touched every day by the heavy shadow of suicide. I often think of those grieving the other 2360 young men who completed suicide that sad year. Alone they may have left 14,000 to 19,000 people behind - parents, siblings, spouses, children, partners, and others who reflect the true scale and cost of adult suicide to society. I wonder if they too have achie ved some measure of r ecovery. I wonder how many are dealing with depression, grief reactions , and other byproducts of suicide loss. I think of those still beset by guilt and those who continuously ask \"why\" or \"what if\" and those who forever replay things said or not said. I wonder how many are aware that their loss has increased their own ri sk of suicide. I wonder how many subsequent suicides, youth, adult, and elder, are linked to those yellowing CDC statistics. As I turn away I am again reminded that ther e is nothing final about any suicide and I am reenergized to do something about it as the so urce of so much loss of life and so much enduring suffering. This plan aids that task. It defines the problem of adult suicide and outlines a broad strategy for government agencies at every level, community groups, educational institutions, the criminal ju stice system, businesses, health care and behavioral health providers, human service agen cies, and individual citi zens to play a role in reducing the incidence of suicide among th e adult residents of our state. This Pennsylvania Page 5 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 226 of 323document can increase public awareness of the risk and preventability of suicide, drive greater knowledge of the warning signs of suicide, and, hopefully, spur development of more prevention, crisis intervention, and pos tvention resources to help those beset by suicidal thoughts and behavior and those coping with the afte rmath of suicide. Let's do it! Tony Salvatore Springfield, PA March 2006 Pennsylvania Page 6 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 227 of 323Introduction Both national and State suicide statistics reinfo rce the need for suicid e prevention efforts. In 2003 PA had 1330 deaths by suicide; this is an average of over 3 deaths by suicide every day. About twice as many Pennsylvanian s died by suicide than homicide. It is estimated that each suicide directly affects 6 people; in 2003 over 7800 Pennsylvanians became survivors of suicide. Suicide is one of the most preventable deaths, yet tragically most of these deaths still occur. In recognition of the problem, PA formed an Adult/Older Adult Suicide Prevention workgr oup in July 2005 to develop a State Plan. The workgroup decided to use the \"National Strategy for Suicide Prevention: Goals and Objectives for Action\" as a template. PA has adopted the 11 National Goals and adaptations of the objectives. Benefits of a State Plan Raise awareness and help make suicide prevention a statewide priority. This can help direct resources of all kinds to the issue Provide opportunities to us e public-private partners hips and the energy of survivors to engage people who may not c onsider suicide preven tion part of their mission. A state plan supports collaboration across a broa d spectrum of agencies, institutions groups, and community l eaders as implementation partners. Link information from many preventi on programs to avoid unintentional duplication and share information a bout effective prev ention activities. Direct attention to measures that bene fit all people in PA and, by that means, reduce the likelihood of suicide, before vul nerable individuals reach the point of danger. Putting the plan to work The keystone of the plan is implementation; this is where you can make a difference. In addition to the work of state agencies, implementing the plan will require broad participation and collaboration from individuals and groups in local communities. Professionals and community volunteers must work side-by-side, and public agencies and private organizations will have to expand their partnerships to make a difference in suicide prevention. Several broad public health themes are valuable considerations as groups and individuals move forward in designing and strengthening suicide prevention activities. Draw attention to a wide range of acti ons so that specific activities can be developed to fit the resources and areas of interest of people in everyday community life as well as professionals, groups, and public agencies. Suicide prevention is everyone's business. Seek to integrate suicide prevention into existing health, mental health, substance abuse, education, and human service activities. Settings that provide related services, such as schools, workplaces, clinics, medical offices, correctional and detention centers, eldercare facilities, faith communities, and community centers are all important venues for seamless suicide prevention activities. Pennsylvania Page 7 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 228 of 323 While population-based interventions are applicable without regard to risk status, it does not mean that one size f its all. The cultural and developmental appropriateness of suicide prevention activities derived from the plan are a vital design and implementation consideration. Seek to eliminate dispari ties that erode suicide prev ention activities. Health care disparities are attributab le to such differences as race or ethnicity, gender, education or income, disability, age, stigma, sexual orientation, or geographic location. Emphasize early interventions to promot e protective factor s and reduce risk factors for suicide. Progress depends on measures that address problems early so that fewer people become suicidal. The five-step public health model is outlined here. It links defining the problem, identifying risk and protective factors, developing and testing interventions, implementing, and evaluating interventions. The steps can and often do occur at the same time and depend on one another. Step 1: Defining the problem Surveillance is the ongoing process of collecting information about the \"who, what, when, where, how, and how many\" of suicide. For example: In 2002 there were 1,326 deaths by suicide in PA In 2002 firearms accounted for 68.7% of deaths by suicide for those aged 65 and older In 2002 suicide was the second leadi ng cause of death for ages 25-34 years in PA Step 2: Identifying Causes throug h Risk and Protective Factors Research Risk factors may be thought of as leading to or being associated with suicide. Protective factors reduce the likelihood of suicide. They enhance resilience and may serve to counterbalance risk factor s. The following risk and protective factors are identified in the National Strategy Preventi on for Suicide: Goals and Objectives for Action. RISK FACTORS FOR SUICIDE Biological, Psychological and Social Risk Factors Previous suicide attempt Mental disorders-particularly moods di sorders such as depression and bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, schizophre nia, and certain pe rsonality disorder diagnoses Alcohol and substance abuse disorders Family history of suicide History of trauma or abuse Hopelessness Impulsiveness and/or aggressive tendencies Some major physical illnesses Pennsylvania Page 8 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 229 of 323Environmental Risk Factors Job or financial loss Relational or social loss Easy access to lethal means Local clusters of suicide that have a contagious influence Socio-cultural Risk Factors Lack of social support and sense of isolation Stigma associated with help-seeking behavior Barriers to accessing health care, especially mental health and substance abuse treatment Certain cultural and religious beliefs-for instance, the be lief that suicide is a noble resolution of a personal dilemma Exposure to the influence of others who have died by suicide, including media exposure PROTECTIVE FACTORS FOR SUICIDE Effective clinical care for mental, physical, and substance use disorders Easy access to a variety of clinical in terventions and support for help-seeking Restricted access to highly lethal means of suicide Strong connections to family and community support Support through ongoing medical and ment al health care relationships Learned skills in problem solving, conflict resolution, and nonviolent handling of disputes Cultural and religious beliefs that discourage suicide and suppor t self-preservation Step 3: Develop and Test Interventions Interventions are actions or programs whic h can reduce the impact of risk factors or support protective factors. Definitiv e pilot studies are fr equently missing for many types of social and mental health interventions. Therefore, program planners may incorporate \"promising\" inte rventions into community plans before the evidence base is fully developed. Step 4: Implement Interventions Principles to keep in mind: Suicide prevention programs should c oordinate with other prevention efforts, such as substance abuse. Programs must address the needs of people in each stage of life. Programs must be culturally sensitive. Prevention programs are more effective when they are long-term, with opportunities for reinforcement of attitudes, behaviors, and skills. Each community must develop a pr ogram that meets local needs and builds on local strengths Pennsylvania Page 9 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 230 of 323 Program planning should represent the community with respect to age, ethnicity, faith, occupation, sexual orie ntation, socioeconomic status, and cultural identity. Step 5: Evaluate Effectiveness A community should build in an evaluati on to determine whether any intervention selected works under local conditions. De termining the costs associated with sustaining programs and comparing those cost s to the benefits of the programs is another important as pect of evaluation. Pennsylvania Page 10 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 231 of 323 Pennsylvania Strategy for Adult Suicide Prevention: Goals and Objectives Goal 1: Promote Awareness that Suicide is a Public Health Problem that is Preventable In a democratic society, the stronger and broa der the support for a public health initiative, the greater its chance for succe ss. If the general public understands that suicide and suicidal behaviors can be prevented, and pe ople are made aware of the roles individuals and groups can play in prevention, the suicide rate can be reduced. The objectives established for this goal are focused on increasing the degree of cooperation and collaboration be tween and among public and private entities that have made a commitment to public awareness of suicide and suicide prevention. They include: Developing public education campaigns Sponsoring national/statewide conferen ces on suicide and suicide prevention Organizing special-i ssue forums, and Disseminating information through the internet. ACTION IDEAS: Develop information materials that can be distributed. Materials should describe suicide risk and protective factors, av ailable community resources, and how to join in prevention efforts. Hold regional forums to present th e Plan and provide information and encouragement. Goal 2: Develop Broad-based Support for Suicide Prevention Because there are many paths to suicide, prevention must address psychological, biological, and social factors if it is to be effective. Collaboration across a broad spectrum of agencies, institutions, and groups-from schools to faith -based organizations to health care associations is a way to ensu re that prevention efforts are comprehensive. Such collaboration can also generate greater and more effective attention to suicide prevention than these groups working alone. Pub lic/private partnerships that evolve from collaboration are able to blend resources and build upon each group's strengths. Broad- based support for suicide prevention may also lead to additional funding, through governmental programs as well as private philanthropy, and to the incorporation of suicide prevention activities into the mission of organizations that have not previously addressed it. The objectives established for this goal ar e focused on developing collective leadership and on increasing the number of groups working to prevent suicide. They will help ensure that suicide prevention is better unders tood and that organizational support exists for implementing prevention activities. The objectives include: Organizing a State interagency committee to improve coordination and to ensure implementation of the Pennsylvania Strategy Establishing public/private partners hips dedicated to implementing the Pennsylvania Strategy Pennsylvania Page 11 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 232 of 323 Increasing the number of professional, vol unteer, and other groups that integrate suicide prevention ac tivities into their ongoing activities, and Increasing the number of faith based comm unities that adopt policies designed to prevent suicide. ACTION IDEAS: Visit leaders of community groups, such as churches, United Way, senior centers, etc.. to engage their participation and support in integrating suicide prevention into ongoing programs. This should include other prevention programs, such as substance abuse, gambling addiction, child abuse, etc... Recruit and train at least one member of each community in PA to be a community organizer for suicide prevention. Goal 3: Develop and Implement Strategies to Reduce the Stigma Associated with Being a Consumer of Mental Health, Substa nce Abuse, and Suicide Prevention Services Suicide is closely linked to mental illne ss and to substance abuse, and effective treatments exist for both. However, the stigma of mental illness and substance abuse prevents many persons from seeking assistance ; they fear prejudice and discrimination. The stigma of suicide itself, the view that su icide is shameful and/ or sinful, is also a barrier to treatment for persons who have suicidal thoughts or who have attempted suicide. Family members of suicide attempte rs often hide the behavior from friends and relatives, and those who have survived the su icide of a loved one suffer not only the grief of loss but often the added pain stemming from stigma. Historically, the stigma associated with ment al illness, substance abuse, and suicide has contributed to inadequate funding for prev entive services and to low insurance reimbursements for treatments. It has also resulted in the establishment of separate systems for physical health and mental health care. One consequence is that preventive services and treatment for mental illness and substance abuse are much less available than for other health problems. Moreover, this separation has led to bureaucratic and institutional barriers between the two systems that complicate the provision of services and further impede access to care. Destigmatizing mental illness and substance use disorders could increase access to treatment by reducing financial barriers, integrating care, and increasing the willingness of individuals to seek treatment. The objectives established for th is goal are designed to creat e the conditions that enable persons in need of mental health and substa nce abuse services to receive them. They include: Increasing the number of suicidal persons with underlying mental disorders who receive appropriate mental health treatment, and Transforming public attitudes to view ment al and substance use disorders as real illnesses, equal to physical illness, that respond to specific treatments and to view persons who obtain treatment as pursuing basic health care. ACTION IDEAS: Develop a public awareness campaign in cluding, educational presentations, around mental illness. Pennsylvania Page 12 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 233 of 323 Ensure that mental health services are culturally competent. Goal 4: Develop and Implement Suicide Prevention Programs Research has shown that ma ny suicides are preventable; however, effective suicide prevention programs require commitment and resources. The public health approach provides a framework for developing preventi ve interventions. Programs may be specific to one particular organization, such as a unive rsity or a community health center, or they may encompass an entire State. A special em phasis of this goal is that of ensuring a range of interventions that in concert represent a comprehensive and coordinated program. The objectives established for this goal ar e designed to foster planning and program development work and to ensure the integrat ion of suicide prevention into organizations and agencies that have access to groups of individuals for other purposes. The objectives also address the need for systematic planning at both the State and local levels, the need for technical assistance in the development of suicide prevention programs, and the need for ongoing evaluation. Objectives include: Increasing the proportion of local co mmunities with comprehensive suicide prevention plans Increasing the number of evidence-based suicide prevention plans in schools, colleges, work sites, correctional institutions, aging programs, and family, youth and community service programs, and Developing technical support centers to build the capacity ac ross the state to implement and evaluate su icide prevention programs. ACTION IDEAS: Identify a lead organization to coordinate efforts. Assess existing plans to identify areas for improvement. Goal 5: Promote Efforts to Reduce Access to Lethal Means and Methods of Self- Harm Evidence from many countries and cultures show s that limiting access to lethal means of self-harm may be an effectiv e strategy to prevent self-des tructive behaviors. Often referred to as \"means restriction,\" this appro ach is based on the belief that a small but significant minority of suicidal acts are, in fact, impulsive and of the moment; they result from a combination of psychological pain or de spair coupled with the easy availability of the means by which to inflict self-injury. T hus, a self-destructive act may be prevented by limiting the individual's access to the means to self-harm. Evidence suggests that there may be a limited time effect for decreasi ng self-destructive behaviors in susceptible and impulsive individuals when access to the means for self-harm is restricted. Controversy exists about how to accomplish th is goal because restricting means can take many forms and signifies different things to different people. For some, means restriction may connote redesign ing or altering the existing lethal means of self-harm currently available, while to others it mean s eliminating or limiting their availability. The objectives established for this goal are designed to separate in time and space the suicidal impulse from access to lethal means of self-harm. They include: Pennsylvania Page 13 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 234 of 323 Educating health care providers and health safety officials on the assessment of lethal means in the home and actions to reduce suicide risk Implementing a public information campai gn designed to reduce accessibility of lethal means Improving firearm safety design, estab lishing safer methods for dispensing potentially lethal quantities of medications and seeking methods for reducing carbon monoxide poisoning for automobile exhaust systems, and Supporting the discovery of new t echnologies to prevent suicide. ACTION IDEAS: Encourage medical personnel to routinel y ask about the presence of lethal means of self-harm in the home. Educate family members on how to appr opriately store a nd secure lethal means of self-harm. Goal 6: Implement Training for Recognition of At-Risk Behavior and Delivery of Effective Treatment Studies indicate that many health profe ssionals are not adequately trained to provide proper assessment, treatment, and management of suicidal patients, nor do they know how to refer clients properly fo r specialized assessment and treatment. Despite the increased awareness of suicid e as a major public health problem, gaps remain in training programs for health prof essionals and others who often come into contact with patients in need of these sp ecialized assessment techniques and treatment approaches. In addition, many health profe ssionals lack training in the recognition of risk factors often found in grieving family members of loved ones who have died by suicide (suicide survivors). Key gatekeepers-people who regularly come into contact w ith individuals or families in distress- need training in order to be able to recognize factors that place individuals at risk for suicide, and to learn appropriate interventions. Key gatekeepers include teachers , clergy, police officers, pr imary health care providers, mental health care providers, correctiona l personnel, and emergency health care personnel. The objectives established for this goal are de signed to ensure that health professional and key community gatekeepers ob tain the training that will help them prevent suicide. They include: Improving education for nurses, physic ian assistants, physicians, social workers, psychologists, and other counselors Providing training for clergy, teacher s and other educational staff, correctional workers, an d attorneys on how to identify and respond to persons at risk for suicide, and Providing educational programs for family members of persons at elevated risk. ACTION IDEAS: Include workshops on suicide prevention at annual meeting of professional associations. Pennsylvania Page 14 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 235 of 323 Encourage directors of edu cation at professional schools in PA to include suicide prevention training in the curriculum. Goal 7: Develop and Promote Effective Clin ical and Professional Practices One way to prevent suicide is to identify i ndividuals at risk and to engage them in treatments that are effective in reducing th e personal and situational factors associated with suicidal behaviors (e.g., depressed m ood, hopelessness, helplessness, alcohol and other drug abuse, among others). Another way to prevent suicid e is to promote and support the presence of protective factors, such as learning skills in problem solving, conflict resolution, and nonviolen t handling of disputes. By improving clinical practices in the assessment, management, and treatment for individuals at ri sk for suicide, the chances for preventing those individuals from acting on their despair and distress in self- destructive ways are greatly improved. More over, promoting the presence of protective factors for these individuals can contribu te importantly to reducing their risk. The objectives established for this goal ar e designed to heighten awareness of the presence or absence of risk and protective c onditions associated with suicide, leading to better triage systems and better allocation of resources for t hose in need of specialized treatment. They include: Changing procedures and/or policies in certain settings, including hospital emergency departments, substance abuse treatment centers, specialty mental health treatment centers, and various inst itutional treatment settings, designed to assess suicide risk Incorporating suicide risk screening in primary care Ensuring that individuals who typically provide services to suicide survivors have been trained to understand and re spond appropriately to their unique needs ( e.g., emergency medical technicians, fi refighters, police, funeral directors) Increasing the numbers of persons w ith mood disorders who receive and maintain treatment Ensuring that persons treated for trauma, sexual assault, or physical abuse in emergency departments receive mental health services Fostering the education of family memb ers and significant others of persons receiving care for the treatment of ment al health and substance abuse disorders with risk of suicide. ACTION IDEAS: Work with hospital associations to devel op tracking procedures for mental health follow-up. Distribute suicide risk posters for emergency rooms. Provide staff in - service tr aining on suicide prevention. Sponsor depression screening days. Promote guidelines for aftercare treatment programs. Organize suicide survivors in the community to provide seminars. Goal 8: Improve Access to and Community Linkages with Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services Pennsylvania Page 15 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 236 of 323The elimination of health disparities and the improvement of the quality of life for all Americans are central goals of Healthy People 2010. Some of these health disparities are attributable to differences of gender, race or ethnicity, education, income, disability, stigma, geographic location, or sexual orie ntation. Many of these factors place individuals at increased risk for suicidal behaviors. Barriers to equal access and affo rdability of health care may be influenced by financial, structural, and personal factors. Financia l barriers include not having enough health insurance or not having the fina ncial capacity to pay for servic es outside a health plan or insurance program. Structural barriers include the lack of primary care providers, medical specialists or other health care professionals to meet special needs or the lack of health care facilities. Personal barri ers include cultural or spiritual differences, language, not knowing when or how to seek care, or concer ns about confidentiality or discrimination. Reducing disparities is a necessary step in ensuring that all Americans receive appropriate physical health, ment al health, and substance abus e services. One aspect of improving access is to better coordinate th e services of a variety of community institutions. This will help en sure that at-risk populations re ceive the services they need, and that all community members receive regular preventive health services. The objectives established for this goal ar e designed to enhanc e inter-organizational communication to facilitate the pr ovision of health services to those in need of them. They include: Exploring the benefits for health insurance plans to cover mental health and substance abuse care on par with coverage for physical health care Implementing utilization management guide lines for suicidal risk in managed care and insurance plans Integrating mental health a nd suicide prevention into health and social services outreach programs for at-risk populations Defining and implementing screening guidelines for schools and correctional institutions, along with guidelines on linkages with service providers, and Implementing support programs for persons who have survived the suicide of someone close. ACTION IDEAS: Work with county health and social serv ice agencies to address the need for all staff who make visits and/or prov ide case management services to the elderly to be trained to make appropriate referrals to mental health services. Provide training for group facilitators and community meeting spaces for suicide survivor support groups. Goal 9: Improve Reporting and Portrayals of Sui cidal Behavior, Mental Illness, and Substance Abuse in the Entertainment and News Media The media-movies, television, radio, newspape rs, and magazines-have a powerful impact on perceptions of reality a nd on behavior. Research over many years has found that media representation of suicide may increa se suicide rates, especially among youth. \"Cluster suicides\" and suicide contagion\" have been documented, and studies have shown that both news reports and ficti onal accounts of suicide in movies and on Pennsylvania Page 16 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 237 of 323television can lead to increases in suicide. It appears that imitation plays a role in certain individuals engaging in suicidal behavior. On the other hand, it is widely acknowledged th at the media can play a positive role in suicide prevention, ev en as they report on suicide or depi ct it and related issues in movies and on television. The way suicide is presen ted is particularly important. Changing media representation of suicidal behaviors is one of several strategies needed to reduce the suicide rate. Media portrayals of mental illness and substance abuse may also affect the suicide rate. Negative views of these problems may lead i ndividuals to deny they have a problem or be reluctant to seek treatment- and untre ated mental illness and substance abuse are strongly correlated with suicide. The objectives established for th is goal are designed to fo ster consideration among media leaders of the impact of different styles of describing or otherwis e depicting suicide and suicidal behavior, mental illness, and substance abuse, and to encourage media representations of suicide that can help prevent rather th an increase suicide. They include: Establishing a public/private group de signed to promote the responsible representation of suicidal behaviors and mental illness on television and in movies Increasing the number of television programs, movies and news reports that observe recommended guidelines in the de piction of suicide and mental illness, and Increasing the number of journalism school s that adequately address reporting of mental illness and suicide in their curricula. ACTION IDEAS: Identify survivors and community advocates who will be active participants in the monitoring group. Include survivors and advocates in curriculum development. Goal 10: Promote and Support Research on Suicide and Suicide Prevention All suicides are highly complex. The volume of research on suicide and its risk factors has increased considerably in the past decad e and has generated new questions about why individuals become suicidal or remain suicidal. The important contributions of underlying mental illness, substance use, and bi ological factors, as we ll as potential risk that come from certain environmental influe nces are becoming clearer. Increasing the understanding of how individual and environmental risk and protectiv e factors interact with each other to affect an individual's risk for suicidal behavior is the next challenge. This understanding can contribute to the limited but growing information about modifying risk and protective factors change outcomes pertaining to suicidal behavior. The objectives established for th is goal are designed to suppor t a wide range of research endeavors focused on the etiology, expression, and maintenance of suicidal behaviors across the lifespan. The enhanced understand ing to be derived from this research will lead to better assessment tools, treatments, and preventive interventions. The objectives include: Increasing funds for suicide prevention research Evaluating preventive interventions, and Pennsylvania Page 17 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 238 of 323 Establishing a registry of intervention s with demonstrated effectiveness for prevention of suicide or suicidal behavior. ACTION IDEAS: Develop and distribute user-friendl y toolkits on program evaluation. Increase the number of jurisdictions in PA that will collect and provide information on suicides. Goal 11: Improve and Expand Surveillance Systems Surveillance has been defined as the sy stematic and ongoing collection of data. Surveillance systems are key to health planning. They are used to track trends in rates, to identify new problems, to provide eviden ce to support ac tivities and in itiatives, to identify risk and protective f actors, to target high risk populations for interventions and to assess the impact of prevention efforts. Data on suicide and suicidal behavior are n eeded at national, stat e and local levels. National data can be used to draw attention to the magnitude of the suicide problem and to examine differences in rates among groups (e.g., ethnic groups), locales (e.g., rural vs. urban) and whether suicidal i ndividuals were cared for in certain settings (e.g., primary care, emergency departments). State and local data help establish local program priorities and are necessary for evaluating the imp act of suicide prevention strategies. The objectives established for this goal are designed to enhance the quality and quantity of data available on suicide and suicidal behavi ors and ensure that th e data are useful for prevention purposes. They include: Developing and implementing standard ized protocols for death scene investigations Increasing the number of hospitals that code for external cause of injuries Supporting pilot projects to link and an alyze information on self-destructive behavior from various, di stinct data systems. ACTION IDEAS: Implement a violent death reporting syst em that includes suicide and collects information not currently available from death certificates. Develop a set of community level indicators for progress in suicide prevention. What is Suicide Postvention? Postvention describes any form of post-trauma support. Postvention should occur after a suicide. It is the attempt to reduce the negative consequences that may affect those close to the victim after a suicide has occurred. Postvention includes all interv entions that attempt to reduc e the negative consequences that may affect those close to the victim after a suicide has occurred. Postvention should begin as soon as possible after the suicide loss. Pennsylvania Page 18 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 239 of 323A suicide is a critical incident. Suicide loss is a crisis. It is an acute response on the part of those close to the victim. It disrupts psychological and physica l well being, overrides coping mechanisms, and causes extreme stress and distress. Postvention is basically a speci al form of crisis interventi on. Its purpose is to deliver acute psychological support, lessen the distress, and help restore coping ability. Effective postvention requires some skill training and an orientation to the effects of a suicide loss. Postvention is carried out to facilitate the recovery of individuals emotionally devastated by a suicide. Recovery involves eventually re building a normal life around the loss. This may take help and that help is provided through postvention. There are four objectives to any postvention effort: Ease the trauma and related effects of the suicide loss Prevent the onset of adverse gr ief reactions and complications Minimize the risk of suicidal behavior Encourage resilience and coping Postvention involves (i) provi ding aid and support with the grieving process and (ii) assisting those who may be vulnerable to a nxiety and depressive disorders, suicidal ideation, self-medicating, and other harmfu l outcomes of severe grief reactions. Some communities have specialized postvention resources to deliver short-term on-site support and referrals to other community services. However, these resources remain an unmet need in most areas. Suicide postvention can take two forms. In proactive postvention the program is advised of a suicide (usually by the Medical examiner or Coroner) and reaches out to the family. In reactive postvention referrals and se lf-referrals are made to the program. Here are some strategies for meeting this need: Victim Services Model: This approach exte nds the mission of a vi ctim services unit to include suicide postvention. Such entitie s serve those affected by very traumatic events. They could readily assist those traumatized by suicide. Medical Examiner's Office-based Model: Postvention is offered by some Medical Examiner's Offices (e.g., Philadelphia). Th e ME staff are involved with all suicides and are often in contact with the next-of-kin or others close to the victim. Crisis Center Model: The American A ssociation of Suicidology, which accredits crisis centers, promotes their involvemen t in suicide postventi on. These services offer a natural \"fit\" with their roles in cr isis intervention, linkage s to mobile crisis services, and working relationshi ps with police and EMTs. Agency/Church Model: In some areas social service and mental health agencies and faith-based groups have developed postvention capabilities. These entities may offer support on a long- term basis. Pennsylvania Page 19 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 240 of 323 Trauma Response Model: Postvention may al so be offered by community or faith- based groups that help after sudden deaths or disasters. The Tragedy Response Unit Support Team (T.R.U.S.T.) in Blue, Bell, PA is an example. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages. However, any of these approaches could go far in meeting a critical unmet need in the community. Populations at Risk Although suicide reaches across all populati ons, certain groups experience an increased suicide risk. Tendencies, such as choice of lethal means, also vary among certain groups. Sections addressing some of the issues of these groups are included. Looking Ahead The Pennsylvania Strategy for Suicide Prev ention creates a framework for suicide prevention for Pennsylvania. It is desi gned to encourage and empower groups and individuals to work together. The str onger and broader the su pport and collaboration on suicide prevention, the greater the chan ce for the success of this public health initiative. Suicide and suicidal behaviors can be reduced as the general public gains more understanding about the extent to which suicide is a problem, about the ways in which it can be prevented, and about the roles individuals and groups can play in prevention efforts. The Pennsylvania Strategy is comprehens ive and sufficiently broad so that individuals and groups can select those obj ectives and activities that best correspond to their responsibilities and resources. The plan's objectives suggest a number of roles for different groups. Individuals from a variety of occupations need to be involved in implementing the plans, such as health care professionals, police, attorneys, educators, and clergy. Institu tions such as community groups, faith-based organizations, and schools all have a nece ssary part to play. Sites for suicide prevention work include jails, emergency de partments and the workplace. Survivors, consumers, and the media need to be pa rtners as well, and governments at the Federal, State and local levels are key in providing funding for public health and safety issues. Ideally, the Pennsylvania Strategy will motivat e and illuminate. It can serve as a model and be adopted or modified by local communities as they develop their own suicide prevention plans. The Pennsylvania Strategy articulates the framework for statewide efforts and provides legitimacy fo r local groups to make suicide prevention a high priority for action. The Pennsylvania Strategy encompasses the development, promotion and support of programs that will be implemented in communities across the state designed to achieve significant, measurable, and sustai nable reductions in suicide and suicidal behaviors. This requires a major investment in public health action. Now is the time for making great strides in suicide prevention. Implementing the Pennsylvania Strategy for Suicide Prevention provides the means to realize success in reducing the toll from this important public health problem. Sustaining action on behalf of all Pennsylvanians will depend on effective public and private collaboration because suicide prevention is truly everyone's business.

There are ce rtain populations however that are at an elevated risk for suicide. One of these populations is law enfo rcement personnel. The rate of suicide for police officers is 3 - 4 times higher than the general population and more active law enforcement officers die by suicide than homicide. It is estimated that 300 police officers end their lives each year, although data is ofte n hard to obtain. One Philadelphia police department was unwilling to share their data when requested and we can only assume many more follow suit. The stigma surrounding suicide continues to be an obstacle for preventing suicide therefore more attempts to raise awareness, particularly among law enforcement personnel, need to be made. Police are at an elevated risk for Divorce Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Alcoholism These factors greatly enhance th eir risk of suicide. Stress f actors, symptoms of PTSD and alcoholism as well as depression and suic idality all require recognition and early detection. Effective methods of helping officers with these issues need to incorporate as part of any law enforcement suicide prevention program. Not surprisingly the leading cause of suicide for police is by firearms, and most suicides are completed at home. Although law enforcem ent officers have daily access to firearms, restriction to access of them can still be included as part of a suicide prevention training. There are other components of suicide pr evention which are gaining more popularity across the country. These methods include Include (gatekeeper) suicide preventi on training to the curriculum of cadets in the police academy Create peer support groups among the departments Encourage help seeking behavior Dr. Joseph Violanti , a leading researcher and expert in police suicide, strongly advocates peers, supervisors and administ rators learn how to detect, in tervene and refer a suicidal officer (for help) as part of their training. He believes developing a program that includes psychological assessment, tracking high risk officers, access to firearms, family involvement and training would ultimately lead to a reduction of suicide among police officers.

Mental illness does not cause suicide. Rather those with mental illness are exposed to more risk factors that raise their vulnerability to suicidal behavior. Ironically, the public largely believes that suicide happens mainly to those who are mentally ill. This is one of the many myths of suicide. Much of what is known about suicide comes from studies of those with mental illness. In Night Falls Fast: Understanding Suicide (2000), Kay Redfield Jami son tells us that the gap between what we know about suicide and its use in prevention is \"lethal.\" Dr. Jamison is sadly right. Here is a summary of the incidence of su icide among those with serious mental illness (SMI) such as Major Depressive Disorder , Bipolar Disorder, and Schizophrenia: 5% of overall SMI population completes suic ide (vs. 1.5% in ge neral population) Schizophrenia is involved in up to 15% of all suicides (as many as 4000 deaths yearly) Individuals with Schizophren ia are at more than 30 tim es higher risk of suicide than the general population 9% - 15% of Major Depressive Disorder sufferers eventually die by suicide Major Depressive Disorder sufferers have 21 times more suicide deaths than the general population 10%-15% of those with Bipolar Di sorder will complete suicide 50% of those with Bipolar Disorder will attempt suicide at least once in their lifetime These are some of the suicide risk factors for those with serious mental illness: Episodes of hopelessness, anxiety, and depression Young age of onset and early stage of illness Inadequate treatment and treatment reductions Frequent exacerbations/remissions Post-relapse improvement periods Psychiatric hospitalization( s) (especially the first 30 days after discharge) Co-occurring alcohol and othe r substance use and abuse Of course, those with mental illness also ha ve risk factors relate d to race and ethnicity, gender, age, a history of abuse or suicidal behavior, access to firearms, work, school, or Pennsylvania Page 27 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 248 of 323legal problems, and others. This accumulation of risk is what accounts for the prevalence of suicide among consumers and which nece ssitates preventative measures on their behalf. These are key protective factor s that counter the onset and progression of suicidality: Treatment adequate to need A caring personal support system Means restriction/removal (i.e., no guns, controlling medications) Ability to seek/accept professional help Availability/accessibility of help Mutual support for those at-risk Given what we know about suicide and mental illness, what can we do? All behavioral health providers, both public and private, should: Know the risk factors, warning signs, and myths of suicide Be able to talk about suic ide with clients and patients As applicable, identify hazards in facilities that may be used to complete suicide Be trained in crisis intervention Educate families about suicide risk Here are some specific suggestions for count y mental health systems:Assure that all providers recognize suicide as a preventa ble community mental health problem. 1. Assure that county suicide prevention plans (i ) exist, (ii) speak to the risk of adult sufferers of serious mental illness, and (iii) are being implemented. 2. Assure that county mental health plan s recognize the need for aftercare and supports for suicide attempters to deter future suicidal behavior. 3. Assure that all mental health providers screen for suicidality at admission, after serious life events or losses, and after changes affecting treatment. 4. Assure that modalities such as cognitiv e behavioral therapy, which have been found to reduce suicidal be havior, are available. 5. Assure the availability of groups that offer mutual support and \"safe places\" for chronically suicidal individuals (e.g., \"Suicide Anonymous\"). There is much that needs to be done, but th ese steps would make a real difference. In closing, bear in mind that nothing is more detrimental to recovery from mental illness than suicidality and nothing shatters ment al health wellness like losing someone to suicide. Mental health c onsumers are far more likely to have experience the loss of someone they know to suicide because of the high incidence of suicide among those with serious mental illness. For this reason providers should see that consumers who Pennsylvania Page 28 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 249 of 323experience the suicide of a loved one or close friend have access to grief support resources. Pennsylvania Page 29 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 250 of 323Recommendations for a VA Strategy for Suicide Prevention The VA's strategy for suicide prevention should include universal components designed to activate the system as a whole for the prev ention of suicide and to ensure that mental health and substance use disorders in pr imary and medical specialty patients are identified and treated effectively; targeted components designed to prevent suicide and identify periods of increased risk in veterans known to have mental health or substance use disorders; and indicated components designed to address the needs of veterans acutely or chronically at increased risk fo r suicide. The program addresses five basic principles: Universal Components: 1. The system as a whole must act to ensu re that all providers, consumers, and families understand the personal suffering and public health impact of mental health and substance use disorders, and th at they recognize that suicide is usually a potentially preventable complication of psychiatric illness. The system must also ensure that access to behavioral health care is readily available to all Veterans who need it in a manner that is destigmatized. In the universal component emphasis will be placed in promoting awareness of demographic factors to suicide risk. These include: Presence of psychiatric illness Presence of and communication of a plan Comorbid substance use disorders Age 65 and older or younger for chr onic substance use, bipolar or schizophrenia Lack of social supports (marital status) Family history History of abuse Presence of hopelessness 2. For Veterans in primary care, medical spec ialty services, and long term care, there must be systematic screening to identify those with mental health and substance use disorders, followed by strategies to ensure that diagnostic evaluations are completed, and that effective treatment is made available that address the patient's safety. Adequate assessment for suicide risk must be performed and clinician actions must be documented. Targeted Components: 3. For Veterans with diagnosed mental disord ers, treatment strategies must include evidence-based elements designed to prevent suicide. These should include specific pharmacologic strategies, reducti on of access to means for self-harm, decrease patient isolation, involve family and other supports when clinically Pennsylvania Page 30 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 251 of 323indicated, provide ongoing monitoring for peri ods of increased suicide risk, and adjustment of treatment when they are present. Indicated Components : 4. During periods when Veterans are at increas ed acute or subacute risk for suicide, systems must have the capacity to ensu re that care of increased frequency, intensity, and comprehensiveness can be provided, including inpatient services when appropriate. 5. For veterans at high chronic or persistent risk for suicide including those with previous suicide attempts, treatment should di rectly target suicidal risk as well as the underlying disorders. More specifically, the VA Strategy for Suicide Prevention should include: 1. Educating all providers about suicide pr evention from the perspective of their roles within the Veterans Health Admi nistration, specifically addressing the associations of suicide with mental h ealth and substance us e disorders, aging, pain, chronic medical illness, social is olation, and other risk factors, and the possibilities for prevention. 2. Activating and engaging the entire community, including families, Veterans Support Organizations, Veterans Benefits Administration staff, and Veterans themselves as well as the public in destigmatizing mental health and substance use disorders, in recognizing these cond itions and other risk factors, and in facilitating behavioral health treatment for those who need it. 3. Screening of Veterans in primary care and medical specialty settings, and long term care for mental health and substance use disorders, followed by diagnostic evaluations and implementation of treatment, either through collaborative/integrated care models or by referral to behavioral health services. This strategy is likely to be of specific value for those who have recently entered the VHA system, for older Veterans, thos e with serious medical illnesses or disability, and those with chronic pain. 4. Implementing and evaluating strategies for the evaluation of Veterans with mental health and substance use disorders to id entify those predisposing factors that increase the risk of suicide (e.g, social isolation, impulsivity) as well as ongoing monitoring to identify periods when they are acutely (or subacutely) at increased risk for suicide. 5. Ensuring access to care that is more fr equent, intensive, or comprehensive, including inpatient servi ces when necessary, for Veterans during periods of increased risk for suicide. Pennsylvania Page 31 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 252 of 3236. Promoting of evidence-based strategies fo r suicide prevention into the care of all Veterans with mental health and subs tance use disorders including use of pharmacological treatment strategies shown to reduce the risk of suicide such as opiate maintenance treatment (e.g., buprenorphine or methadone), lithium for bipolar disorder, and clozapine for treat ment of schizophrenia especially in veterans within the first 5-10 years after diagnosis. 7. Developing and implementing strategies fo r reducing access to lethal means and methods of self-harm for Veterans with me ntal health or substance use disorders, especially for those at increased risk for suicide. These should focus on issues including firearm hygiene and attention to the manner in which medications are packaged. 8. Developing and validating comprehensive st rategies for identifying veterans with histories of suicidal behaviors that pl ace them at high chronic risk. These should include strategies for linki ng with community agencies and providers to allow for identifying episodes that do not directly l ead to care within the VHA, as well as for integrating information from diverse sources within the VA system. Activities should include evaluating the clinical and preventive benefits versus the privacy risks of flagging charts to facilitate the identification and close monitoring of those at chronically elevated risk of suicide. 9. Evaluating the feasibility of establishing re gistries of suicide attempts to guide care planning, resource allocation, an d quality management activities. 10. Providing treatment that addresses suic idality as well as treatment of the underlying disorder for those who have at tempted suicide. For those who receive acute care within VA facilities for suicide attempts or accidental overdoses, the risk of suicide should be evaluated and in terventions to decrease risk should be initiated before discharge. For those who have attempted suicide in the past, as well as for others at high risk, psyc hotherapy that specifically addresses suicidality should be provided as well as comprehensive treatment related to the underlying disorder. 11. Ensuing that the VA accesses comprehens ive data on suicide in the population it serves obtaining the causes of death for a ll veterans from the states or the National Death Index on an ongoing basis, and that it utilizes these data together with that from within the VHA in quality improvement initiatives and th e evaluation of the outcomes of specific programs. 12. Prioritizing the develop of research infr astructures as well as MERIT , HSR&D, and Cooperative Studies projects devoted to expanding the evidence-base on strategies for suicide prevention. Pennsylvania Page 32 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 253 of 323Suicide and Alcohol Use, Misuse, and Abuse When it comes to suicide, alcohol brings about many of things that heighten the danger. It increases impulsivity and decrea ses inhibition. It increases negative self- image and decreases self-esteem. It also deepens depression a nd social isolation. Suicide risk increases with the intake and length of time alcohol is consumed. However, suicide risk can ri se even without ch ronic drinking or de pendence. It is probably not an overstatement to say that su icide risk increases with the first drink. Nationally, an average of 25% of all suicid es (about 7500 deaths yearly) are alcohol- related. Studies have found that 20%-35% of suicide victims used alcohol just prior to death. One study in Erie, NY determined that 33% of victims used alcohol. Alcohol use is common among suicide attemp ters. Research shows that 65% used alcohol; 50% used alcohol just prior to the attempt. Many attempts occur during binge drinking episodes. Alcohol-induced impulsivity may be a factor in this behavior. Among those who are alcohol dependent, 18% complete suicide. Suicide is 120 times more prevalent among adult alcoholics than in the general population. Alcohol also plays a major role in suicides among youths and elders. The gender differential applies to suicides associated with alcohol misuse: men make up 80% of the victims, women 20%. Accord ing to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), in 2001 alone, alcohol-related su icides accounted for 236,873 years of potential life lost. The principal risk factors for suic ide linked to alcohol use include: Interpersonal loss Employment/financial loss Family history of suicide Family history of alcoholism in primary relatives Current/past treatment for alcoholism Early onset of drinking Relapse High alcohol intake Alcohol dependence Alcohol misusing victims typically have f our or more of following factors: major depressive disorder, prior thoughts of su icide, continued drinking, poor social supports, unemployment, and living alone. Co-occurring alcohol abuse and mental illness significantly increases risk Those who misuse alcohol and prescription drugs misusers have a 40 times greater risk of suicide. Such co-morbidities le ssen the likelihood of help and intervention. Pennsylvania Page 33 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 254 of 323Department of Corrections Suicide Prevention Suicide is the third leading cause of death in prisons throughout the country, following natural causes and AIDS (Metzner, et. al ., 1998). Since 1995, when there was a sharp increase in the rate of suicides among inmates in Pennsylvania, the Department of Corrections has enhanced its suicide preventions efforts. There are videotapes and brochures provided for inmates and staff trainings. Depart ment officials also have developed a risk indicato rs checklist that is administered to all offenders upon entering the system. Since these initiatives were impl emented, the suicide rate has declined even though the inmate population has increased. Th e Department compared the suicide rate with a U.S. population of similar size, adjust ed for age, gender and race distribution in the community, and found that th at inmates fare relatively well by this measure compared to a comparable unincarcerated U.S. population. In fact, the suicide rate in the PA DOC is actually lower. Risk Factors Among Inmates Mental illness: although inmates on the mental health/mental retardation roster comprises approximately 17% of the PA prison population, they comprise approximately 60% of the suicides Substance abusers: approximately 70% of inmates who completed/attempted suicide had histories of substance abuse Male: males account for approximately 95% of the PA prison population , and they comprised approximately 98% of the suicides. Caucasian: although Caucasians compri se only 34% of the PA prison population, they comprise over 50% of the suicides Elderly: due to mandatory sentencing a nd a reduction in parole, the PA prison population has been getting older. Depression is underdiagnosed among the elderly, and we are carefully monitoring our older offenders. Sex offenders: this populati on is a growing risk, probabl y related to the increased difficulty in obtaining parole Lifers/long term offenders: although lif ers comprise 17% of the PA prison population, they comprise 40% of the suicides Parole violators: these are offenders who are returned to prisons after failing to adjust in the community. In some case, they may still be und er the influence of alcohol or other drugs. Our speculation is that these individuals panic when they realize that their likelihood of be ing re-paroled might be remote Administrative segregation: although this population had a high rate in the past, it has decreased since new policies have been implemented Strategies to Reduce DOC Suicides Training: required that all staff receive at least 2 hours of initial training followed by 1 hour of annual refresher training Updating policies and procedures Expand mental health treatment for inmates Pennsylvania Page 34 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 255 of 323 When possible, divert inmates with mental illnesses from placement in administrative segregation Disseminate suicide prevention and mental health information to the inmate population Increase the comprehensiveness of cl inical reviews conducted following all suicides and frequency of reviews following serious gestures Enhance services for non-mentally ill inmates: programs on substance abuse (AA, NA, etc...) sex offender treatment, children's vis itation centers, etc. ____________________________________________________________________ Information for this section is taken from articles written by Lance Couturier, Ph.D., Pennsylvania Department of Corrections.

Pennsylvania Page 35 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 256 of 323Murder-Suicide An often overlooked yet disturbing trend is the prevalence of murder-suicides, not only in the United States, but particularl y in Pennsylvania. A new study by the Violence Prevention Center has determined there are at least 10 murder-suicides each week in the U.S. and approximately 1,000 to 1,500 deaths per year. The study was conducted from January 1, 2005 to July 1, 2005 and the results are disturbing.1 Pennsylvania is one of six states with more than 10 murder-suicides in the six-month per iod of the study: Pennsylvania 18 Florida 15 Texas 18 North Carolina 14 California 17 Tennessee 11 If you plot the number of murder-suicides vs. the popu lation of these states, one can see Pennsylvania has a disproportionate amount of murder-suicides. PATXCAFLNCTN0510152025303540 StatesMurder-Suicides Population (in millions) PA TX CA FL NC TN Murder-Suicides 36 36 34 30 28 22 Population (in millions) 12 22 36 17 8 6 Also, in the previous report for the fi rst six months of 2004 Pennsylvania had 17 murder-suicides per month. Whether th is increase will continue has yet to be determined, but clearly this is becoming a major health problem for Pennsylvania. There is no database and tracking system to fu lly report this information therefore it is likely these numbers are underesti mated and there is no way to determine the number of people affected by murder-sui cide. This traumatic event has the potential to severely impact not only fam ily members, friends, and acquaintances but even the entire community, especially if a mass murder occurred. Pennsylvania Page 36 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 257 of 323Several trends have been identified with murde r-suicide in this report. The most common method of death was by firearms , approximately 92%, and the majority of the offenders (over 90%) are male. T he most common form of murder-suicide (74%) involved an intimate partner, such as a spouse, girlfriend/boyfriend, common-law spouse or ex-spouse. Because the offender is often male, approximately 94% of the deaths were fema les killed by their intimate partner. On average, the offenders are several years older than their partners; the average difference in age is 6 years. Mo st murder-suicides occur in the home (77%) with the majority taking place in the bedroom. These murder-suicides can be charac terized by the following traits and circumstances: the offender is typically male between the ages of 18 and 60, usually depressed, in a long-term re lationship marked with discord and often domestic violence, with feelings of jealousy and the belief their sexual partner has been unfaithful sexually (real or im agined). When a triggering event such as a separation or threate ned separation occurs, he becomes enraged, murders the partner then kills himself. There is also a sub-category of intimate partner murder-suicides involving a male \"family annihilator,\" where the perpetrators not only kill their partner, but also their children and other family members before killing themselves. These offenders are also often depressed, have financial or other problems and feel the family is better off dead than to remain living and having to deal with his problems. Another theory is that these individuals view the family as an extension of themselves; they are depressed, paranoid, and suicidal, and the only way to kill themselves is to kill their families as well.2 While the majority of the murder-suicides are perpetrated by males, there are female offenders. These women usually kill their children, then themselves, and rarely, if ever, kill their intimate partner as well. The most common choice of a weapon is a firearm used approx imately 63% of the time. Unfortunately, there are no st udies specific to law enforcement officers involved in murder-suicides. However, because t he rate of suicide is higher in law enforcement officers than the general publ ic, and there were several incidences involving police during the duration of t he report, the conclusi on was drawn that police officers also have a higher rate of murder-suicide. A ccess to firearms and the nature of the officers (control over and responsibility for others) contribute to this belief. Finally, there may be a correlation bet ween the death penalty and the murder- suicide rate. States with the death penal ty tend to have more homicides and murder-suicides than states without the death penalty. Looking at the number of people on death row, and the num ber of murder-suicides per month, there may be a trend: Pennsylvania Page 37 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 258 of 323 Murder-suicides # of Inmates on State per month Death Row PA 18 231 TX 18 409 CA 17 649 FL 15 388 NC 14 190 TN 11 108 Interviews with inmates and details of the cr imes seem to indicate that many of the homicides were meant to be murde r-suicides but the offender \"chickened out.\" Also, in a paper presented at t he World Conference on Violence and the Future of Society, Katherine van Wormer and Chuk Odiah from the University of Northern Iowa have proposed there be another category of suicide, or suicide by execution where the offender s purposely and knowingly commit their crimes in states that have the death penalty, or commit another homicide while in prison to bring about the death penalty.3 Again, there is insufficient data to confirm these beliefs. In conclusion, the number of murder-s uicides occurring in Pennsylvania is disproportionately high per our population and merits further attention. The number of people and communiti es affected by this traumatic event is also significant. Support for these individuals is necessary. One can only speculate at the traumatic impact on children or lov ed ones by witnessing, being in the proximity of, or finding the bodies after a murder-suicide. A database or method of tracking murder-suicides would help us to better understand these deaths and lead to prevention strategies. Finally, re stricted access to firearms, especially when a history of depression, suicidal gestures and/or domestic violence has been reported, has the potentia l to greatly reduce the num ber of murder-suicides in Pennsylvania. 1 American Roulette: Murder-Suicide in the United States by the Violence Policy Center, 2005 2 Palermo, G.

Suicidal behavior in late life is intentional and lethal, especi ally among older white males. The risk of dying is greater in suicide attempts made by the elderly. Risk factors can be identified; interventions and prevention can be successful. However, increasing awareness of the similarities with and the differences from adult suicide is essential for an effective plan. As the elderly population increases over the next several decades, the number of late life suicides will dramatically sky-rocket; \"Baby Boomers\" already have substantially higher suicide rates than the World War II and other generations before them. The five-step public health model of prevention has been utilized here to identify the proble m of suicide in older adults, identifying risk and protective factors, developing and testing interventions, implementing an d evaluating interventions. It should be noted that detection of potential suicide in late life is complicated by the assumption that many of the symptoms, feelings, and circumstances in older persons are not genuine problems but the mistaken belief that these are part of the normal aging process or confused with a physical problem. Step 1: Defining the Problem o According to the CDC suicide rates increase with age and are among t he highest in those 65 Pennsylvania Page 41 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 262 of 323and older. In 2001, 539 3 Americans over age 65-committed suicide, 85% were men. o Substance Abuse and M ental Health Services Administration, (SAMHSA) older adults represent 13% of the population, however account for over 18% of all suicidal deaths. o Older adults have more suicide completions than any other age group. The ratio of attempts to completions drops with age (4:1 in late life). o For all women, and for men of other races, suicide rates reach their peak earlier in life. o In Pennsylvania the highest rate of suicide is in older white men: for ages 75 - 79 there are, 32.1 suicides per 100,00 0, ages 80 - 84 there are 35.5 suicides per 100,000 and for ages 85 plus there are 33.2 su icides per 100,000. (Pennsylvania Department of Health, Suicide: Total number of Deaths and average annual age-specific death rates by sex and race, 1999- 2003). o Many older adults who commit suicide have recently visited a primary care physician: 20 % on the same day, 40% within one week and 70% within one month of the suicide. (National Suicide Prevention Statistics) o Older adults who commit suicide are more likely to have suffered from a depressive illness than individuals who kill themselves at a younger age. o Older adults suffer from a more \"chronic\" form of depression compared to those who suffer from depression early in life. o The older adult population is the fastest growing population in Pennsylva nia and our nation.

These three programs have been evaluated na tionally, work in a variety of community-based settings and coordinate with other services including primary care mental health and substance abuse. PRISMe (SAMHSA) - Primary Care Research in Substance Abuse and Mental Health for the Elderly PROSPECT (NIMH)- Prevention of Suicide in Primary Care: Elderly Collaborative Trial IMPACT (Hartford Foundation)- Improving Mood Promoting Access to Collaborative Treatment Step 5: Concurrent Review - Evaluate Effectiveness- A community should build in an evaluation to determine whether the select ed intervention will work under local conditions. Determining the costs associated with sustaining programs and comparing those costs to the benefits of the programs is another important aspect of evaluations. Pennsylvania Page 46 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 267 of 323Pennsylvania Strategy for Older Adult Suicide Prevention: Goals and Objectives Goal 1: Promote awareness that suicide is a preventable public health problem. Increase cooperation and collaborat ion between public and private entities to encourage public education campaigns, sponsor conf erences on suicide and suicide prevention program s and organize special- issue forums to disseminate information on older adults and suicide. Action ideas: o Develop public education campaigns Educational materials for the Community at large Educational materials for families and seniors Educational materials for the \"faith- based communities\" o Sponsor statewide conferences on suicide and suicide prevention o Develop informational materials specifically directed to older adults. Ensure the materials include suicide risk and protective factors, community resources and address the specific issues of older adults. o Target organizations that serve older adults, including AARP, area agencies on aging, senior centers, retirement Pennsylvania Page 47 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 268 of 323programs, senior high rises, and primary care. o Hold regional forums to present the Older Adult Suicide Prevention Plan and provide informati on and encouragement for outreach and coor dinate planning across systems. Goal 2: Develop Broad-based support of Suicide Prevention. The Initiative must address the psychological, biological and social factors affecting older adults. Encourage collaboration acro ss the broad spectrum of aging mental health agenc ies, institution, private and faith-based organizations. Organizations that build cooperative relationships can blend resources, such as mental health suicide prevention in senior centers; preventative suicide education in retirement planning or at AARP sponsored programs. The objectives established for this goal are focused on developing collective leadership and on increasing the number of groups work ing to prevent suicide. This will ensure that suic ide prevention is better understood and that organizational support exists for implementing prevention activities. Their objectives include: Organize a Statewide interagency committee made up of the Pennsylvania Department of Aging, Pennsylvania Department of Health, Office of Mental Heal th and Substance Abuse Services, Pennsylvania Medical Society, Pennsylvania Community Providers Association, Pennsylvania Psychological Association, Pennsylvania Psychiatric Pennsylvania Page 48 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 269 of 323Society and the Pennsylvania Behavioral Health and Aging Coalition. Establish public/ private partnerships dedicated to implementing the Pennsylvania Older Adult Suicide Prevention Strategy including AARP and other retirement programs, county aging offices, mental health providers, primary care physician's offices, hospital discharge planners, emergency room staff, and representatives from the arena of long-term care, faith-based organizations and insurance companies. Increase the number of professional, volunteer, and other groups that integrate suicide prevention activiti es into their ongoing activities including area agencies on aging, AARP, senior centers, and senior high rises. Increase the number of faith communities that adopt policies designed to prevent suicide. Action ideas: o Visit leaders of community groups, such as churches, United Way organizations, senior centers, etc... to engage their participation and support in integrating suicide preventions into ongoing programs. Include other prevention program such as substance abuse, gambling, etc... o Recruit and train at least one member of each aging county system to be a Pennsylvania Page 49 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 270 of 323community organizer for suicide preventions. o Complete an annual mailing to hospital discharge planners, primary care offices that include the statistics of suicide in older adults, user-friendly assessment scales, and community resources. Goal 3: Develop and implement strategies to reduce the stigma associated with being a consumer of mental health, substance abuse, and suicide prevention services. Suicide is closely linked to mental illness and substance abuse and specifically in older adults to loss, isolation and chronic illness. However, the stigma of mental illness and substance abuse prevents many older individuals form seeking assistance. The stigma of suicide itself, the view that suicide is shameful and/ or sinful, is also a barrier to treatment of persons who have suicidal thoughts who have attempted suicide. Historically, the stigma associated with mental il lness, substance abuse, and suicide has contributed to inadequate funding for prevention services and to low insurance reimbursements for treatments. It has also resulted in the establishment of separate systems for physical health and mental health care. One consequence is that preventive services and treatment for mental illn ess and substance abuse are much less available to older adults. Moreover, this separation has led to bureaucratic and institutional barriers between the two systems that complicate the provision of services and fu rther impede access to care. Destigmatizing mental illness and substance use disorders could increase access to treatment by reducing Pennsylvania Page 50 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 271 of 323financial barriers, integrating care and increasing the willingness of individuals to seek treatment. Action ideas: o Develop a public awareness campaign including educational presentations around aging and beh avioral health issues. o Insure prevention activities are culturally and developmentally sensitive. o Seek to eliminate disparities that erode suicide prevention activities. o Emphasize early interventions to promote protective factors and reduce risk factors for suicide. o Utilize Wellness models and Peer-to- Peer programs to normalize the behavioral health aspects of aging. Goal 4: Develop and implement suicide prevention programs. Research has shown that many suicides are preventable; however effective suicide prevention programs require commitment and resources. The pubic health approach provides a framework for developing preventative inte rventions. Programs may be special to one organization, such as a senior center; county aging office or they may encompass an entire State. The goal is to ensure a range of interventions that in concert represent a comprehensive and coordinated program. Pennsylvania Page 51 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 272 of 323The objectives established for this goal are designed to foster planning and program development work and to ensure the integrat ion of suicide prevention into organizations and agencies that have access to groups of individual for other purposes. The objectives also address the need for systematic planning at the State and Local levels, the need for technical assistance in the development of suicide prevention programs, and the need for ongoing evaluation. Objectives include: o Increasing the proportion of local communities with comprehensive suicide prevention plans o Increasing the number of evidence- based suicide prevention plans in community service programs, area agencies on aging, primary care sites, senior centers, and high rises. o Develop technical support centers to build the capacity across the state to implement and evaluate suicide prevention programs. Action ideas: o Identify lead organizations to coordinate efforts o Identify any current older adult suicide prevention plans across the State. Goal 5: Promote efforts to reduce access to lethal means and methods of self-harm. Pennsylvania Page 52 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 273 of 323Evidence from many counties and cultures show that limiting access to lethal means of self-harm may be an effective strategy to preventin g self-destructive behaviors. Often referred to as \"means restriction,\" this approach is based on the belief that a small but significant minority of suicidal acts is, in fact, impulsive. They result from a combination of psychological pain or despair coupled with the easy availability of the means by which to inflict self- injury. Thus, limiting the indi vidual's access to the means of self-harm may prevent a se lf-destructive act. Evidence suggests that there may be a limited time effect for decreasing self-destructive behaviors in susceptible and impulsive individual when access to the means for self- harm is restricted. Controversy exists about how to accomplish this goal. For some, means restriction may connote redesigning or altering the existing lethal means of self-harm currently ava ilable, by educating family members or other care provider on limiting their availability. The objectives established for this goal are designed to separate the individuals from the lethal means of self-harm. They include: o Educating health care providers and safety officials on the assessment of lethal means in the home and care facilities and the actions need to reduce suicide risk in older adults. o Implement a public information campaign designed to reduce accessibility of lethal means. o Improving firearm safety design, establishing safer methods for Pennsylvania Page 53 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 274 of 323dispensing potentially lethal quantities of medications and safer methods for reducing carbon monoxide poisoning for automobile exhaust systems, and o Supporting the discovery of new technologies to prevent suicide. Action ideas: o Encourage medical-personnel, staff routinely interacting with seniors, aging care managers, community high rise social workers, staff in the arena of long-term care, to routine ask about the presence of lethal means of self-harm in the home. o Educate family members on how to appropriately store and secure lethal means of self-harm. Goal 6: Implement training for recognition of at-risk behavior and delivery of effective treatment. Studies indicate that many health professionals are not adequately trained to provide proper assessment, treatment, and management of suicidal patients, nor do they know how to refer clients properly for specialized assessment and treatment. Despite the increased awareness of suicide as a major public health problem, gaps remain in training programs for health professionals and others who often come into contact with patients in need of these specialized assessment techniques and treatment approaches. Develop interventions that are proactive as in mailing \"at risk\" individuals contact cards, Pennsylvania Page 54 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 275 of 323develop and provide individuals with \"crisis cards\" that instruct individuals in a series of action steps to prevent the action of suicide. In addition, many health professionals lack training in the recognition of risk factors often found in gr ieving family members of loved ones who have died by suicide (suicide survivors). Key gatekeepers, people who regularly come into contact with individuals or families in distress, need training in order to be able to recognize factors that place individuals at risk for suicide, and to learn appropriate interventions. Key gatekeepers include primary care physicians, health care office staff, aging caseworkers, senior center staff and high-rise staff, social workers and nursing staff working in the arena of long-term care, clergy, police officers, emergency health care personnel, and seniors themselves. The objectives established for this goal are designed to ensure that health professional and key community gatekeepers obtain the training that will help them prevent suicide. They include: o Improving education for nurses, physician assistants, physicians, social workers, emergency room staff, home health care providers, aging case workers, clergy, police officers, psychologists, and other counselors o Outreach to senior centers, high rises, retirement communities and the arena of long term care to ensure individuals Pennsylvania Page 55 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 276 of 323having contact with seniors are aware of risk factors of suicide in older adults o Providing training for seniors themselves through senior center training and educational programs with AARP and other retirement organizations on how to identify and respond to persons at risk for suicide o Providing educational programs for family members of persons at elevated risk. Action Ideas o Include workshops on suicide prevention at annual meeting of professional associations o Specifically target primary care physicians for education about risk factors, identification of depressive symptoms, and effective treatment of depression (medication and therapy). o Provide educational programs through the County Agency on Aging to outreach to Aging staff, Senior Centers and high rises. o Include workshops on suicide prevention at the annual meetings of the long-term care associations o Encourage directors of education at professional schools in PA to include suicide prevention training in the curriculum. Goal 7: Develop and promote effective clinical and professional practices. Pennsylvania Page 56 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 277 of 323One way to prevent suicide is to identify individuals at risk and to engage them in treatments that are effective in reducing the personal and situational factors associated with suicidal behaviors (e.g.: loss, physical problems, depressed mood, hopelessness, helplessness, alcohol an d other drug abuse, among others). Another way to prevent suicide is to promote and support the pr esence of protective factors, such as learning skills in problem solving, conflict resolution, and nonviolent handling of disputes. By improving c linical practices in the assessment, management, and treatment for individuals at risk for suicide, the chances for preventing those individuals from acting on their despair and distress in self-destructive ways are greatly improved. Moreov er, promoting the presence of protective factors for these individuals can contribute importantly to reducing their risk. The objectives established for this goal are designed to heighten awareness of t he presence or absence of risk and protective conditions associated with suicide, leading to better triage systems and better allocation of resources for those in need of specialized treatment. They include: Changing procedures and/or policies in certain settings, including hospital emergency departments, substance abus e treatment centers, specialty mental health treatment centers, the arena of long-term care, and various institutional treatment settings, designed to assess suicide risk Incorporating suicide risk screening in primary care Pennsylvania Page 57 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 278 of 323 Ensuring that individuals who typically provide services to suicide survivors have been trained to understand and respond appropriately to their unique needs (e.g., emergency medical technicians, firefighters, police, funeral directors) Increasing the numbers of older adults suffering from mood disorders who receive mental health treatment. Ensuring that persons treated for trauma, sexual assault, or physical abuse in emergency departments receive mental health services Fostering the education of family members and significant others of persons receiving care for the treatment of mental h ealth and substance abuse disorders with risk of suicide. Action ideas: o Work with hospital associations to develop tracking procedures for mental health follow-up. o Work with medical schools, nursing programs and allied health training programs so geriatric behavioral health issues are addressed in curriculums. o Distribute suicide risk posters for emergency rooms. o Provide staff in service training on suicide prevention. o Sponsor depression screening days. o Promote guidelines for aftercare treatment programs. o Organize suicide survivors in the community to provide seminars. Pennsylvania Page 58 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 279 of 323o Promote factors for successful aging in variety of settings and among various mental health and health care professionals including home health; such factors would include combating depression, maintaining active engagement with life, increasing social support, improving nut rition, improving sleep hygiene, increasing exercise, establishing connections and relationships). o Promote principles of mental health recovery (including resilience) o Promote education among professionals on effective clinical practices for suicide screening and identification, treatment, and prevention (i.e., use of role playing and safety plans) o Promote hopefulness about the treatment of depression in late life and possibility of successful aging even in the presence of physical and mental illness Goal 8: Improve access to and build community linkages with mental h ealth and substance abuse services. The elimination of health disparities and the improvement of the quality of life for all Americans are central goals of Healthy People 2010. Some of these health disparities are attributable to differences of gender, race or ethnicity, education, income, disability, stigma, geographic location, or sexual orientation, however age remains the largest Pennsylvania Page 59 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 280 of 323disparity in regards to behavioral health service provision. This factors in and of itself places older adults at increased risk for suicidal behaviors. Barriers to equal access and affordability of health care may be influenced by financial, structural, and personal factors. Financial barriers include not having enough health insu rance or not having the financial capacity to pay for services outside a health plan or insurance program. Structural barriers include the lack of understanding of age specific behavioral health needs across disciplines, lack of training of primary care providers in recognizing of age specific behavioral health needs, lack of willingness of mental heath providers to serve older adults, lack of medical specialists or other health care professionals to meet special needs of older adults or the lack of health care facilities. Personal barriers include ageism, cultural or spiritual differences, language, not knowing when or how to seek care, or concerns about confidentiality or discrimination. Reducing di sparities is a necessary step in ensuring that all Americans receive appropriate physical health, mental health, and substance abuse services. One aspect of improving access is to better coordinate the services of a variety of community institutions. This will help ensure that at-risk populations receive the services they need, and that all co mmunity members receive regular preventive health services. The objectives established for this goal are designed to enhance inter-organizational communication to facilitate the provision of health services to those in need of them. They include: Pennsylvania Page 60 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 281 of 323 Exploring the benefits for health insurance plans to cover mental health and substance abuse care on par with cove rage for physical health care Implementing utilization management guidelines for suicidal risk in managed care and insurance plans Integrating mental heal th and suicide prevention into health and social services outreach programs for at-risk populations Defining and implementing screening guidelines for primary care, senior centers, and the arena of long term care, along with guidelines on linkages with service providers, and Implementing support programs for persons who have survived the suicide of someone close. Action ideas: o Work with county health and social service agencies to address the need for all staff who make visits and/or provide case management services to the elderly to be trained to make appropriate referrals to mental health services. o Support the Memorandums of Understanding between the County Mental Health and Aging Systems ensuring cross system training, teamwork and case review stressing the need for outreach and education to seniors on suicide prevention. Pennsylvania Page 61 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 282 of 323o Provide training for group facilitators and community meeting spaces for suicide survivor support groups Goal 9: Improve reporting and portrayals of suicide behavior, mental illness and substance abuse in the entertainment and news media. The media-movies, television, radio, newspapers, and magazines-have a powerful impact on perceptions of reality and on behavior. Re search over many years has found that media representation of suicide may increase suicide rates, especially among youth. \"Cluster suicides\" and \"suicide contagion\" have been documented, and studies have shown that both news reports and fictional accounts of suicide in movies and on television can lead to increases in suicide. It appears that imitation plays a role in certain individuals engaging in suicidal behavior. On the other hand, it is widely acknowledged that the media can play a positive role in suicide prevention, even as they report on suicide or depict it and related issues in movies and on television. The way suicide is presented is particularly important. Changing media representation of suicidal behaviors is one of several strategies needed to reduce the suicide rate. Media portrayals of mental illness and substance abuse may also affect the suicide rate. Negative views of these problems may lead individuals to deny they have a problem or be reluctant to seek treatment- and untreated mental illness and substance abuse are strongly correlated with suicide. The objectives established fo r this goal are designed to foster consideration among media leaders of the impact Pennsylvania Page 62 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 283 of 323of different styles of describing or otherwise depicting suicide and suicidal behavior, mental illness, and substance abuse, and to encourage media representations of suicide t hat can help prevent rather than increase suicide. They include: Establishing a public/p rivate group designed to promote the responsible representation of suicidal behaviors and mental illness on television and in movies Increasing the number of television programs, movies and news reports that observe recommended guidelines in the depiction of suicide and mental illness, and Increasing the number of journalism schools that adequately address reporting of mental illness and suicide in their curriculums. Action ideas: o Identify survivors and community advocates who will be active participants in the monitoring group. o Include survivors and advocates in curriculum development Goal 10: Promote and su pport research on suicide and suicide prevention. All suicides are highly complex. The volume of research on suicide and its risk factors has increased considerably in the past decade and has generated new questions about why individuals become suicidal or remain suicidal. The important contributions of underlying mental illness, substance use, and Pennsylvania Page 63 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 284 of 323biological factors, as well as potential risk that come from certain environmental influences are becoming clearer. Increasing the understanding of how individual and environmental risk and protective factors interact with each other to affect an individual's risk for suicidal behavior is the next challenge. This understandi ng can contribute to the limited but growing information about modifying risk and protective factors change outcomes pertaining to suicidal behavior. The objectives established for this goal are designed to support a wide range of research endeavors focused on the etiology, expression, and maintenance of suicidal behaviors across the lifespan. The enhanced understanding to be derived from this research will lead to better assessment tools, treatments, and preventive interventions. The objectives include: Increasing funds for suicide prevention research Evaluating preventiv e interventions, and Establishing a registry of interventions with demonstrated effectiveness for prevention of suicide or suicidal behavior. Action ideas: o Develop and distribute user-friendly toolkits on program evaluation. o Increase the number of jurisdictions in PA that will collect and provide information on suicides. Pennsylvania Page 64 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 285 of 323 Goal 11: Improve and expand surveillance. Surveillance has been defined as the systematic and ongoing collection of data. Surveillance systems are key to health planning. T hey are used to track trends in rates, to identify new problems, to provide evidence to support activi ties and initiatives, to identify risk and protective factors, to target high risk populations for interventi ons and to assess the impact of prevention efforts. Data on suicide and suicidal behavior are needed at national, state and local levels. National data can be used to draw attention to the magnitude of the suicide problem and to examine differences in rates among groups (e.g., ethnic gr oups), locales (e.g., rural vs. urban) and whether suicidal individuals were cared for in certain settings (e.g., primary care, emergency departments). State and local data help establish local program pr iorities and are necessary for evaluating the impact of suicide prevention strategies. The objectives established for this goal are designed to enhance the quality and qu antity of data available on suicide and suicidal behaviors and ensure that the data are useful for prev ention purposes. They include: Developing and implementing standardized protocols for death scene investigations Increasing the number of hospitals that code for external cause of injuries Supporting pilot projects to link and analyze information on self-destructive behavior from various, distinct data systems. Pennsylvania Page 65 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 286 of 323 Action ideas: o Implement a violent death reporting system that includes suicide and collects information not currently available from death certificates. o Develop a set of community level indicators for progress in suicide prevention. Looking Ahead The Pennsylvania Strategy for Suicide Prevention, as it includes a plan for Older Adults, creates a framework for suicide prevention for Pennsylvania. It is designed to encourage and empower groups and individuals to work together. The stronger and broader the support and collaboration on suicide prev ention, the greater the chance for the success of this public health initiative. Suicide and suicidal behaviors can be reduced as the general public gains more understanding about the extent to which suicide is a problem, about the ways in which it can be prevented, and about the roles individuals and groups can play in prevention efforts. The Pennsylvania Strategy is comprehensive and sufficiently broad so that individuals and groups can select those objectives and activiti es that best correspond to their responsibilities and resources. The plan's objectives suggest a number of roles for different groups. Individuals from a variety of occupations need to be involved in implementing the plans, such as aging service personal, health care professionals, police, attorneys, educators, and clergy, to name a few. Institutions such as the aging community, senior groups, AARP, faith-based Pennsylvania Page 66 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 287 of 323organizations, long-term care, and the system of higher education all have a necessary part to play. Sites for suicide prevention work incl ude senior centers, nursing homes, primary care, emergency departments, and other venues seniors may frequent. Su rvivors, consumers, and the media need to be partners as well, and governments at the Federal, State and local level levels are key in providing funding for public health and safety issues. Ideally, the Pennsylvania Strategy will motivate and illuminate. It can serve as a model and be adopted or modified by local communities as they develop their own suicide prevention plans. The Pennsylvania Strategy articulates the framework for statewide efforts and provides legitimacy for local groups to make suicide prevention a high priority for action. The Pennsylvania Strategy encompasses the development, promotion and sup port of programs that will be implemented in communities across the state designed to achieve significant, measurable, and sustainable reductions in suicide and suic idal behaviors. This requires a major investment in public health action. Now is the time for making great strides in suicide prevention. Implementing t he Pennsylvania Strategy for Suicide Prevention provides the means to realize success in reducing the toll from th is important public health problem. Sustaining action on behalf of all Pennsylvanians will depend on e ffective public and private collaboration, because suicide prevention is truly everyone's business. Pennsylvania Page 67 of 75 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 288 of 323This is a working document. It is expected to change and further develop over time as new opportunities, participants, research, and conditions evolve. Whether you have been involved in the initial development of the plan or are just now joining, you can make a difference by contributing to the plan's continued development.

Support of State Partners Page 84 of the Application Guidance Narrative Question: The success of a state's MHBG and SABG will rely heavily on the strategic partnership that SMHAs and SSAs have or will develo p with other health, social services, and education providers, as well as other state, local, and tribal governmental entities. States sho uld identify these partners in the space below and describe how the partners will support them in implementing the priorities identified in the planning process. In addition, the state should provide a letter of support indicating agreement with the description of their role and collabo ration with the SSA and/or SMHA, including the state education authority(ies), the State Medicaid Agency, entity(ies) responsible for health insu rance and health information exchanges (if applicable), adult and juvenile correctional authority(ies), public health authority (including the maternal and child health agency), and child welfare agency. SAMHSA will provide technical assistance and support for SMHAs and SSAs in their ef forts to obtain this collaboration. These letters should provide specific activities that the partner will undertake to assist the SMHA or SS A with implanting its plan.45 This could include, but is not limited to: The State Medicaid Agency agreeing to consult with the SMHA or the SSA in the development and/or oversight of health homes fo r individuals with chronic health conditions or consultation on the benefits available to the expanded Medicaid population. The state justice system authorities that will work with the state, local, and tribal judicial systems to develop policies an d programs that address the needs of individuals with mental and substance use disorders who come in contact with the criminal and juvenile j ustice systems, promote strategies for appropriate diversion and alternatives to incarceration, provide screening and treatment, and implement transition services for those individuals reentering the community, including efforts focused on enrollment. The state education agency examining current regulations, policies, programs, and key data -points in local and tribal school districts to ensure that children are safe, supported in their social/emotional development, exposed to initiatives that target risk and p rotective actors for mental and substance use disorders, and, for those youth with or at -risk of emotional behavioral and substance use disorders, to ensure that they have the services and supports needed to succeed in school and improve their graduation rates and reduce out -of-district placements.

Support of State Partners Pennsylvania enjoys a large and diverse Advis ory structure. Comprised of an Adult, Children's, and Older Adult Committee, as well as \"Persons in Recovery \" and Transition -Age Youth Subcommittee s, the cumulative membership exceeds 90 individuals. The Advisory Co mmittee draws membership from consumers/survivors, family members, county officials, behavioral health providers, advocates, and other professional mental health and state agencies. The Co mmittee deliberates on issues and initiatives related to OMHSAS's mission that \" Every individual served by the Mental Health and Substance Abuse Service system will have the opportunity for growth, recovery and inclusion in their community, have access to culturally competent services and supports of their choice, and enjoy a quality of life that includes family members and friends. \" The Commonwealth recognizes the importance of bringing a multitude of stakeholders to the Committee and has partnered with The Office of Medical Assistance Programs (the State's Medicaid Authority), The Office of Children, Youth and Families (the State's child welfare agency), The Office of Vocational Rehabilitation, The Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, The Pennsylvania Department of Education, The Bureau of Drug and Alcohol Services (the State's substance abuse agency), The Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency, and the Pe nnsylvania Department of Aging. Pennsylvania Page 2 of 2 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 302 of 323IV: Narrative Plan W. State Behavioral Health Advisory Council Page 85 of the Application Guidance Narrative Question: Each state is required to establish and maintain a state Behavioral Health Advisory Council (Council) for services for indivi duals with a mental disorder. SAMHSA encourages states to expand and use the same Council to review issues and services for persons with, or at r isk of, substance abuse and substance use disorders. In addition to the duties specified under the MHBG statute, a primary duty of th is newly formed Council will be to advise, consult with, and make recommendations to SMHAs and SSAs regarding their activities. The Council m ust participate in the development of the MHBG state plan and is encouraged to participate in monitoring, reviewing, and evaluati ng the adequacy of services for individuals with substance abuse and mental disorders within the state. States are strongly encourag ed to include American Indians and/or Alaska Natives in the Council; however, their inclusion does not suffice as tribal consultation. In t he space below describe how the state's Council was actively involved in the plan. Provide supporting documentation regarding this involveme nt (e.g., meeting minutes, letters of support, etc.) Additionally, please complete the following forms regarding the membership of your state's Council. The first form is a list of the Council members for the state and second form is a description of each member of the Council. There are strict state Council membership guidelines. States must demonstrate (1) that the ratio of parents of children with SED to other Council members is sufficient to provide adequate representation of that constituency in deliberations on the Council and (2) that no less than 50 percent of the members of the Council are individuals who are not state employees or providers of mental health servi ces. States must consider the following questions: What planning mechanism does the state use to plan and implement substance abuse services? How do these efforts coordinate with the SMHA and its advisory body for substance abuse prevention and treatment services? Was the Council actively involved in developing the State BG Plan? If so, please describe how it was involved. Has the Council successfully integrated substance abuse prevention and treatment or co -occurring disorder issues, concerns, and activities into the work of the Council? Is the membership representative of the service area population (e.g., ethnic, cultural, linguistic, rural, suburban, urban, older adults, families of young children)? Please describe the duties and responsibilities of the Council. Footnotes: Pennsylvania Page 1 of 3 Pennsylvania OMB Pending Approved: Expires: Page 303 of 323W. State Behavioral Health Advisory Council 1. What planning mechanism does the state use to plan and implem ent substance abuse services? How do these efforts coordin ate with the SMHA and its adviso ry body for substance abuse prevention and treatment services? Response: Pennsylvania's Men tal Health Planning Council has a subcommittee charged with bringing the issues and needs relevant to the co -occurring population before the Adult, Older Adult , and Children's committees. Members of the Persons in Recovery subcommittee are voting members that sit on each of three aforementioned committees. The Bureau of Drug and Alcohol Programs (the State's substance abuse agency) also has representation on the Advisory Committee and is able to advise on initiatives, regulations, and licensure as it pertains to integrated treatment for individuals with co -occurring disorders. 2.
