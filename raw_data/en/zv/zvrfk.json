Artemisia vestita Wall. ex Besser (family: Asteraceae), popularly known as \"Kubsha\" or \"Russian wormwood\", is a highly enriched folklore medicine with wound- healing, antiphlogistic, antifebrile, antifeedant, anti-helminthic, antimicrobial, antiviral, antitumor, and antiproliferative potential attributed to the presence of various volatile and non-volatile secondary metabolites. A systematic and extensive review of the literature on A. vestita was carried out via the Web of Science, PubMed, INMEDPLAN, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and NCBI, as well as from several websites. The highly relevant literature contained in 109 references was selected for further inclusion in this review. A total of 202 bioactive compounds belonging to different chemical classes such as terpenoids, coumarins, flavonoids, alkaloids, acetylenes, tannins, carotenoids, and sterols have been reported in A. vestita, which are responsible for different pharmacological activities. The chemical structures obtained from the PubChem and Chem Spider databases were redrawn using the software Chem Draw\u00ae version 8.0. This review paper summarizes the distribution, botanical description, phytochemistry, pharmacological activities, and conservation of A. vestita, which will assist scientists for further investigation. Extensive studies on the active constituents, pharmaceutical standardization, mode of action, and sustainable conservation of A. vestita are needed to further explore its wound-healing and allied medicinal properties.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-03-20", "cleaned_text": "Herbal Fortune [https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28062788](https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28062788) [Antibacterial Properties of Plant Extracts: 1. [3](#B3-molecules-28-02788)]. These have been time-tested and recommended by saints, maharishis, vaidyas, and ayurvedic acharyas and have strong credence in different traditional medicinal systems such as ayurveda, unani, siddha, homeopathy, naturopathy, allopathy, and traditional Chinese medicine for treating ailments related to both humans and animals. Moreover, these medicines are safe, heal the cause of the ailment, and have less or no side effects compared to allopathic drugs [ [4](#B4-molecules-28-02788)]. For centuries, plant essential oils have played a provocative role for mankind. The people of Egypt were known to be skilled perfumers and taught the art of perfumery to Hebrews around 5000 years ago [ [5](#B5-molecules-28-02788)]. [6](#B6-molecules-28-02788)]. The volatile aromatic oils find applications and are used commercially in cosmetics, soap, perfumery, the spice industry, flavoured tea, drinks, traditional foods, pesticides, and pharmaceutical industries [ [7](#B7-molecules-28-02788)]. The use of herbal-origin essential oils has increased greatly over the last few years, which has consequently increased the international market demand and decisively switched the trade. Sharma et al. [ [8](#B8-molecules-28-02788)] reported that India produces 15 essential oils on a pilot/experimental scale and approx. 20 herbal essential oils at a commercial level that have a unique capability, and India holds an economic advantage due to its rich diversity in soil and favourable climate. The oil content and quality depend on the type of soil and the climatic conditions. [9](#B9-molecules-28-02788)]. This genus is gaining much attention due to its remarkable medicinal properties, phytochemical diversity, and scientifically proven health benefits [ [10](#B10-molecules-28-02788), [11](#B11-molecules-28-02788), [12](#B12-molecules-28-02788), [13](#B13-molecules-28-02788), [14](#B14-molecules-28-02788)]. [15](#B15-molecules-28-02788)], and specifically named after the Caria Queen Artemisia II, who was a medical researcher and botanist by profession in the 4th century BC. The genus Artemisia, commonly known as wormwood, mugwort, or sagebrush, is distributed in the temperate zones of Europe, North America, and India [ [16](#B16-molecules-28-02788)]. Species of this genus are used as folklore medicines and in pharmaceutical sectors their demand has increased because of their medicinal value and high commercial importance [ [17](#B17-molecules-28-02788)]. The genus Artemisia comprises 500 species [ [18](#B18-molecules-28-02788), [19](#B19-molecules-28-02788)]. The greatest number of species seems to occur in Asia, with 174 spp. in the ex-USSR, 150 spp. in China, 50 spp. in Japan, 35 spp. in Iran, and 35 spp. in India, mostly from the northwestern Himalayas [ [20](#B20-molecules-28-02788), [21](#B21-molecules-28-02788)]. In India, the eminently recognized species that have been used traditionally cytotoxic properties and are also used for the treatment of coughs, colds, dyspepsia, headaches, malaria, and inflammation [ [23](#B23-molecules-28-02788)]. It is quite difficult to differentiate among the Artemisia species due to their morphological similarity [ [24](#B24-molecules-28-02788)], which leads to misinterpretation and misidentification of the products that are of economic and commercial medicinal value [ [25](#B25-molecules-28-02788)]. Several Artemisia-based health care products (tablets, syrups, oils, creams) have been commercialized. [26](#B26-molecules-28-02788)] reported A. vestita Wall. ex Besser as an accepted botanical name, whereas A. vestita Wall. ex DC. and A. vestita var. vestita are synonyms of A. vestita. In India, one of the major aromatic plants, i.e., A. vestita, is under commerce, which is obtained by distillation, hydro diffusion, expression, solvent extraction, and the natural carriers-host organisms [ [7](#B7-molecules-28-02788)]. Traditionally, local farmers and tribal communities refer to A. vestita as an anti-helminthic agent because of the unavailability and high cost of synthetic drugs [ [27](#B27-molecules-28-02788), [28](#B28-molecules-28-02788)]. It is widely used by tribal people in the Kashmir Valley ('Tethe-Ven') for treating parasitic infections [ [29](#B29-molecules-28-02788)]. In Tibet, it is commonly known by the name 'Maolianhao' (alias: Wannianpeng), a folk medicine [ [30](#B30-molecules-28-02788)], whereas in Kashmir it is known as 'Roosi Tyethven' [ [31](#B31-molecules-28-02788)]. It is including hills, rocky slopes, grasslands, shrublands, and outer forest margins of various regions of Gansu, northwest Guangxi, north Hubei, Guizhou, Liaoning, west Sichuan, Qinghai, Xizang, Xinjiang, Yunnan, north India, Nepal, and north Pakistan. Due to geographical variation and seasonal factors, drastic variations have been reported in the chemical composition of the essential oil. In India, Drubsha is found in Himachal Pradesh, Kashmir, and Uttarakhand at an altitude of 2100-3000 m. The distribution of A. vestita in the Pooh region of Kinnaur district at different elevations noted a density of 1.27/ha, frequency of 10%, abundance of 12.67, ratio of abundance to frequency (A/F) of 1.27, and importance value index of 5.12 at an elevation of 2700-3200 m; a density of 2.25/ha, frequency of 15%, abundance of 15, A/F of 1, and IVI of 7.28 at an elevation of 3200-3700 m; and a density of 1.17/ha, frequency of 11.67%, abundance of 10, A/F of 0.86, and IVI of 53.53 at an elevation of 3700-4200 m [ [32](#B32-molecules-28-02788)]. Important value indexes are the sum of the frequency, density, and dominance of the individual species. 3. Botanical Description 3.1. Morphology [33](#B33-molecules-28-02788)]. The leaves are fern-like, soft, and hairy on the upper surface white and hairy towards the lower side, and pinnately cut. The flowers are small and appear creamy yellow, arranged in racemes (6-10); the heads of flowers are long, hairy, and compound, hanging gracefully on their slender nodding stalks. The fruits are shiny and smooth and the bracts are oblong and membranous ( [Figure 2](#molecules-28-02788-f002)). surface-elongated epidermal surface ridged margins; the tertiary sculpture is aggregated; stomata are depressed, surrounded by thick, flat peristomal rims, transverse striata, thick inner ledges, and a gradually concave surface of the guard cells and transverse polar folds. The lobule tips are cap-like and swollen; stomata are also present in this particular region, with cells greatly undulated (V-shaped undulations) and elongated. The abaxial surface-cell outline is similar, somehow deeply undulate, with loose 'V'-shaped undulations; it is tertiary sculptured and coarsely granular; the guard cells have oblique folds [ [34](#B34-molecules-28-02788), [35](#B35-molecules-28-02788), [36](#B36-molecules-28-02788)]. 3.2. Vegetation Details [37](#B37-molecules-28-02788)]. The A. vestita plants are hermaphrodite and pollinated by insects, and the seeds ripen in the months of August-October. [38](#B38-molecules-28-02788)]. Cytology: Gupta et al. [ [39](#B39-molecules-28-02788)] reported 2n 2x = 36 meiotic chromosome count, ploidy level (4\u00d7), pollen fertility 78-82%, and pollen grain size 22-24 m in A. vestita collected from Haripurdhar and Churdhar (HP) at an altitude of 2400 and 3650 m, respectively, above sea level. Two other cytotypes, i.e., hexaploid (2n = 54) [ [40](#B40-molecules-28-02788)] and diploid (2n = 18) [ [41](#B41-molecules-28-02788)], have also been reported. Chlorophyll content: Variations in the chlorophyll and anthocyanin content and the chlorophyll/carotenoid ratio have been reported in the temperate species of A. vestita found at an altitude of 550 and 3600 m above sea level in the Garhwal Himalayas. The total chlorophyll content observed in the lower leaves of A. vestita was 1.716 and 1.470, middle leaves 0.902 and 1.650, and top leaves 0.863 and 1.205 at two different altitudes (550 and 3600 m, respectively) [ [42](#B42-molecules-28-02788)]. The molar chlorophyll/carotenoid ratio was observed to be lower (1) in the temperate species as compared to the tropical (1.7) and subtropical species (1.3) [ [43](#B43-molecules-28-02788)]. At higher altitudes, A. vestita plants have relatively broader adaptability potential compared to lowland species, which is due to a higher osmotic concentration, greater lignification, and the tendency of osmoregulation in tissues, due to the conversion of starch into sugar content [ [44](#B44-molecules-28-02788)]. A palynological study of A. vestita stated the quantitative characteristics of the plant, such as a polar axis of 19.38 \u00b1 spinules are prominent in the plant [ [45](#B45-molecules-28-02788)]. 4. Medicinal Uses [46](#B46-molecules-28-02788)]. It is widely used for treating numerous inflammatory diseases in Tibet and China, such as contact dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and sepsis [ [47](#B47-molecules-28-02788), [48](#B48-molecules-28-02788)]. The leaves are crushed and applied externally on the skin as hemostatic [ [49](#B49-molecules-28-02788), [50](#B50-molecules-28-02788)]. The plant is also used stomach-aches [ [51](#B51-molecules-28-02788)]. 5. Phytochemistry [52](#B52-molecules-28-02788), [53](#B53-molecules-28-02788), [54](#B54-molecules-28-02788)]. A Chinese research group reported the isolation of 15 chemical compounds from A. vestita and identified them as reported as major components of Artemisia species essential oil [ [56](#B56-molecules-28-02788)]. Zhengming et al. [ [57](#B57-molecules-28-02788)] conducted preliminary research on the chemical compounds, which were identified as saponins, organic acids, oil, triterpenes, or steroids. Another study found 12 chemical constituents from essential oil including six monoterpenic derivatives, three monoterpenes, and three sesquiterpenes, among them 1, camphor, and which were scoparone, and plant [ [59](#B59-molecules-28-02788)]. A sesquiterpenoid Allohimachalol was identified in ref. [ [60](#B60-molecules-28-02788)]; -, - yomogi alcohol, (E)-2,5,5-Trimethylhepta-3,6-dien-2-ol, alpha-Atlantone, Himachalol, arvestonol, arvestolides D-J, and arvestonates A-C occurred in ref. [ [63](#B63-molecules-28-02788)]. Numerous sesquiterpenoids exhibiting biological activities were isolated from A. vestita [ [30](#B30-molecules-28-02788), [64](#B64-molecules-28-02788)] and had a great influence on the plant's defense against phytopathogenic fungi and pests, so they can be further utilized as antifungal agents and natural insecticides (scopoletin, highest in the ethanolic extract of A. vestita collected from Jammu and Kashmirregion. In total, 27 compounds were identified, out of which the main components were eucalyptol, 1,8-cineol, also been reported [ [73](#B73-molecules-28-02788)]. A total of 18 components was found in Daksum, Kokerrnag, Kashmir, out of which the principal components were (E)-citral, 1,8-cineole, limonene, camphor, -phellandrene, and (Z) were oxygenated monoterpenes, comprising 73.1% of terpenes in the plant essential oil composition, followed by monoterpene hydrocarbons (17.3%) [ [71](#B71-molecules-28-02788)]. A higher content of oxygenated monoterpenes in plants imparts a strong characteristic the aerial parts of A. vestita [ [74](#B74-molecules-28-02788)]. Sesqueterpenoids found in the plant are known for cytotoxic, antiviral, and antiphlogistic activities [ [75](#B75-molecules-28-02788), [76](#B76-molecules-28-02788), Oil [Figure 3](#molecules-28-02788-f003). The characteristic odour is determined by the constituents of fresh-smelling thujone and eucalyptol (1,8-cineole) and by the woody bark and the sweet note of atlantone and himachalol compounds. The odour of the plant's essential oil is mainly woody, herbaceous, fresh, slightly sweet, and reminiscent of the sage and balsamic odour and is reported to be effective against dermatophytes [ [79](#B79-molecules-28-02788)]. The oil can be used safely in perfumery, scented soaps, and cosmetics. Camphor, borneol, and eucalyptol are responsible for the pleasant aroma and are also known for their antifungal and antibacterial activities. The flowering tops of the plants when subjected to steam distillation yield yellow-, orange-, or brown-coloured oil with an aromatic, sweet-woody odour [ [70](#B70-molecules-28-02788)]. The essential oil was produced from A. vestita from the Nainital hills, Shimla hills, and Kashmir valley [ [80](#B80-molecules-28-02788), [81](#B81-molecules-28-02788)]. The physiochemical characteristics observed in the essential oil of A. vestita are a refractive index D of 1.4915, ester value of 55.45, acid value of 1.3, carbonyl 20.80, of 124.4 after acetylation, solubility and wound-healing, clearing away itching, ringworms, skin infections, and respiratory tract infections, ethnic therapy for colds, sinus drainage, maintaining ventilation, reducing inflammation and asthma, and many more. The anti-adipogenic activity of A. vestita requires in-depth studies [ [82](#B82-molecules-28-02788)]. 6.1. Wound-Healing [89](#B89-molecules-28-02788)]. Chinese medicines include A. vestita as an alternative and complementary medicine for the treatment of skin diseases. A. vestita has a cold nature and is capable of treating skin eruptions, heat, and itching [ [90](#B90-molecules-28-02788)]. Pastes of the leaves are applied for the treatment of skin infections, inflammation, ringworm, wounds, respiratory tract infections, ethnic therapy for colds, sinus drainage, and asthma [ [14](#B14-molecules-28-02788), [91](#B91-molecules-28-02788), [92](#B92-molecules-28-02788), [93](#B93-molecules-28-02788), [94](#B94-molecules-28-02788)]. 6.2. Antidote 6.3. Antimicrobial [83](#B83-molecules-28-02788)]. Eight components that have been reported to exhibit antibacterial activity are - and -thujone, terpinen-4-ol, linalool, nerol, geraniol, -pinene, and 1,8-cineole; their percentages in the oil were determined in ref. [ [84](#B84-molecules-28-02788)]. The plant extract and formulated gel have also shown significant results, as the plant extract exhibited MIC values between 100 and 240 \u00b5g/mL while the formulated gel (extract + natural polymer) exhibited MIC values between 30 and 85 \u00b5g/mL (unpublished work) against skin-infection-causing bacterial and fungal species. 6.4. Immunosuppressive Activity [95](#B95-molecules-28-02788)]. It has been reported that the essential oil of plants with higher amounts of - and -thujone have lesser or trace amounts of eucalyptol and camphor [ [96](#B96-molecules-28-02788)]. Jaceosidin exerts immunosuppressive effects both in vitro and in vivo through the activation and inhibition of T-cell proliferation, which is associated with the down-regulation of interferon (IFN)- gamma signal transducers and activators of the (STAT1) transcription1 and transcription factor T-box TBX-21 signaling pathway [ In addition, flavones such as apigenin, cirsilineol, and 6-methoxytricin from A. vestita shown immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects [ [14](#B14-molecules-28-02788)]. These flavones specifically inhibit PCA (passive cutaneous anaphylaxis), which induces contact hypersensitivity, whereas lymphocyte proliferation is induced by Con-A and CD-25 expression in T-cells, which shows immunosuppressive effects. 6.5. Anti-Inflammatory Activity [63](#B63-molecules-28-02788)]. The plant extracts inhibited the proliferation of mouse splenocytes and mixed lymphocytes while reducing the IL-2 interleukin level and the level of metallo-proteinase-9 in vivo and in vitro [ [14](#B14-molecules-28-02788)]. showed anti-inflammatory activity. The inhibition exhibited by a plant extract and plant extract formulated gel with a natural polymer of COX-1 (Cyclooxygenase-1) was found to be 97.962 \u00b1 0.911%, respectively, at 500 \u00b5g/mL concentration. Similarly, our group also explored a significant inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2. The inhibition percentage by the plant extract and plant extract formulated gel were 89.47 \u00b1 1.401% and 52.76 [65](#B65-molecules-28-02788), whole-plant extract containing vegetative shoot exhibited a 87.2% reduction in the faecal egg count at 100 mg/kg, which showed significant activity against adult worms and larvae after 28 days post-treatment [ [86](#B86-molecules-28-02788)]. In a study, essential oil of A. vestita showed potential fumigant activity with an LC50 value of 13.42 mg/L and LD50 value of against adult Sitophilus zeamais in the fumigant bioassay and in the respectively [ [65](#B65-molecules-28-02788)]. Several monoterpenes, sesquiterpenoids, and flavones have been isolated from A. vestita [ [20](#B20-molecules-28-02788), [72](#B72-molecules-28-02788)] and the essential oil chemical composition has been well-studied [ [69](#B69-molecules-28-02788), [70](#B70-molecules-28-02788)]. 1,8-cineol has a properties [ [98](#B98-molecules-28-02788)]. 1,8-cineol and camphor present in plant essential oil act as fumigants with a broad insecticidal activity [ [99](#B99-molecules-28-02788), [100](#B100-molecules-28-02788), [101](#B101-molecules-28-02788)] and possess the potential to expand as a novel natural fumigant for insect control in stored products [ [102](#B102-molecules-28-02788), [103](#B103-molecules-28-02788)]. They are advantageous over conventional fumigants because they are non-persistent, biodegradable, and easily procurable and exhibit low toxicity to mammals [ [104](#B104-molecules-28-02788)]. 7. Known Hazards [105](#B105-molecules-28-02788)]. 8. Cytotoxicity [106](#B106-molecules-28-02788)]. Compounds named Arvestolides H and I showed inhibitory effects in BV-2 cells on nitric oxide production, which was induced by lipopolysaccharide with an IC 50 value of 43.2 M for Arvestolides H and 39.9 M for Arvestolides I. [ [61](#B61-molecules-28-02788)], whereas cirsilineol, apigenin, and 6-methoxytricin are the active components that inhibited the proliferation of T-cells and the activation of in vitro bioassays. Immune-suppressive compounds extracted from A. vestita will be an effective remedy for T-cell-mediated inflammation [ [14](#B14-molecules-28-02788)]. Sesquiterpenes, coumarins, and flavones were alleviates by blocking the T lymphocyte activation [ [108](#B108-molecules-28-02788)]. In a study, flow cytometric and MTT assays were used for determining the CD 25 expression in T-cells and the proliferation of Con A induced lymphocytes [ [14](#B14-molecules-28-02788)]. For cytotoxic effects, both S2 (extract) and S4 (extract + polymer) showed higher cell viability. At a 1000 \u00b5g/mL concentration of S2, the cytotoxicity to HaCat cells was 18.2 \u00b1 0.35% compared to that of S4, which was 19.7 \u00b1 0.29%. The results showed promising anti-inflammatory effects along with significant anti-cancer effects on HaCat cell lines (unpublished work). The aforementioned results provide A. vestita-based folklore medicine a rationale to be used in wound-healing and anti-cancer therapy. 8.1. Biological Activity of Annphenone [71](#B71-molecules-28-02788)]. Annphenone is a promising anti-tumour agent present in the aqueous extract that reduced the contact sensitivity via down-regulating the adhesion, activation, and production of metalloproteinase T-lymphocytes in mice [ [109](#B109-molecules-28-02788)], whereas the ethanolic extract exerted anti-sepsis activity through down-regulation of the NF-kB and MAPK Activity of Cirsilineol [14](#B14-molecules-28-02788), [87](#B87-molecules-28-02788)]. Cirsilineol significantly inhibited the proliferation of multiple types of cancer cells (Skov-3, PC3, Caov-3, and Hela cells) in a concentration-dependent manner. It induced apoptosis in Caov-3 cells in a dose-dependent manner, which was determined with of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) brings a remarkable change and releases cytochrome-c to the cytosol. The induction of apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway is the mode of action for the anti-proliferative activity of cirsilineol against cancerous cells. Moreover, cirsilineol is effective in ameliorating TNBS (tri-nitrobenzene sulfonic acid) -induced experimental colitis in mice, possibly because of its novel immunoregulatory activities with selective inhibitor IFN-/STAT1/T-bet signaling in particular for Biological Activity of Jaceosidin [88](#B88-molecules-28-02788)]. The flavone jaceosidin isolated from A. vestita showed an antiproliferation effect on several human cancer cell lines. It significantly reduced SKOV-3, PC3, HeLa, and CAOV-3 cell proliferation in CAOV-3 showed time-dependent inhibition, and apoptosis cleavage of PARP (poly ADP-ribose polymerase) and caspase-3 and increased the cleaved caspase-9 levels. It also elevated the cytochrome c level in the cytosol, which shows the antitumor property of jaceosidin [ [87](#B87-molecules-28-02788)]. 9.
