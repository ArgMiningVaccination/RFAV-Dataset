Many services are available through Tufts Medical Center's Collegiate Center for Wellness, including same-day/next-day urgent care visits, and their goal is to provide the highest level of quality care for all of our student's needs. Berklee is committed to ensuring ease of access to medical care to reduce barriers to quality care.

You can request a ride when scheduling your appointment. The on-campus pick-up and drop-off location is listed below. Round-trip transportation is not for emergencies.

What should I do in a medical emergency? Students who are seriously injured or very sick, and in need of emergency medical care should go to the nearest hospital emergency room immediately. There is no direct medical care available on campus. In the case of life-threatening situations or where students are unable to transport themselves to the hospital, call [Public Safety](https://www.berklee.edu/public-safety) at 617-747-8888 (or dial extension 8888 from any campus phone) if on campus, or dial 911 from any location. Please note: Hospitals and ambulances are not appropriate for regular medical care. There is usually a long wait time at hospitals for non-urgent patients, and the expense is usually higher than if the patient is seen in a routine healthcare setting. Do I need to select a primary care physician (PCP) at Tufts Medical Center in order to be seen by urgent care? During your time in Boston, we recommend that each student establish care with a local provider. Students who select a PCP at Tufts will be able to call for a same-day/next-day urgent care appointment. Call 617-636-6006 to make an appointment.

As Berklee does not have direct health care on campus, anyone wishing to submit health care proxy documents should do so with a health care provider in Boston. Should students wish to establish care with Berklee's preferred medical provider, Tufts Medical Center, they should contact Tufts directly with their health care proxy questions.

If you are involved in an incident of sexual assault or other sexual misconduct, we encourage you to get a sexual assault medical exam and have other injuries documented, whether or not you know your assailant. You may decide later what actions, if any, you wish to take. Receiving medical services in no way obligates you to proceed further. A sexual assault medical exam is: - confidential and free; - preventive treatment for sexually transmitted infections, pregnancy, and evidence collection, if sought; and - conducted by a sexual assault nurse examiner (SANE), who is a registered nurse with advanced training and certification in conducting sexual assault exams. Berklee Public Safety can be reached at 617-747-8888 for assistance with emergency transportation to a hospital for emergency medical attention. [A list of recommended SANE-supported hospitals and information for preparing for the medical exam can be found here](/equity/medical-attention). How can I submit feedback?
