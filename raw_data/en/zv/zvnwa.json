Methemoglobinemia, a hemolytic condition, may lead to significant complications if it goes undiagnosed during the critical golden hour of an emergency department (ED) presentation. This case report presents the clinical details of a 30-month-old child with acute intravascular hemolysis evident by severe pallor and hemoglobinuria and severe hypoxia documented on pulse oximetry. During the ABCDE (Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, Exposure) of the primary survey, \"exposure\" revealed the parent's deliberate fastening of a mothball around the waist of the baby on the advice of a traditional healer, which was identified as the source of naphthalene toxicity. The swift intervention was undertaken for hypoxic respiratory compromise with 100% oxygen just after triage, and the naphthalene ball with the tied cloth was removed. Arterial blood gas and co-oximetry analysis confirmed the diagnosis of methemoglobinemia, and other laboratory tests suggested severe hemolytic anaemia as well as hemoglobinuria favouring intravascular hemolysis. With the exclusion of other common differentials for hemolytic anaemia, including sickle cell crisis, autoimmune hemolytic anaemia, hemolytic uremic syndrome, and G6PD deficiency, naphthalene exposure was considered the culprit for both hemolysis and methemoglobinemia. After obtaining the history of another similar episode of anaemia six months ago requiring blood transfusion, we retrospected on similar mothball exposure, but parents denied that, saying they were using the mothball only for the last 10 days on the advice of a local healer with intent to get rid of some evil power and sickness in their child. After analyzing the old records of prior hospitalization and getting assured of a normal report of G6PD level, intravenous methylene blue was administered. But in view of an inadequate response, a single blood volume exchange transfusion was performed during the ED stay only, which resulted in a notable reduction in subsequent methemoglobin levels and an improvement of the child's clinical condition by the second day. The child was discharged by the third day with no distress and no further episodes of hemoglobinuria, with detailed parental counselling and follow-up advice. This case underscores the imperative need for timely recognition and effective management of methemoglobinemia in the paediatric population while emphasizing the potential hazards associated with naphthalene exposure. Further comprehensive investigations are warranted to elucidate optimal treatment strategies and explore long-term outcomes in similar clinical scenarios.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2023-06-30", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
