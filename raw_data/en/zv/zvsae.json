We also accept Health Savings Accounts (HSA) and Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) as payment for services provided. [Conditions Treated] We do not treat conditions or diseases but rather work with the human condition. From the perspective of naturopathic and Chinese medicine, any human condition can be addressed because the emphasis here is focusing on the wholeness of your unique life: from genetics, family dynamics, environment, psychology, physiology, and anatomy. Two people can experience the same disease very differently-this is why one-size-fits-all approaches have their limitations. We have a passion for treating patients who are motivated to engage with us in a cooperative therapeutic relationship towards healing. [Order Supplements] Frequently Asked Questions [What is a Naturopathic Doctor?] [What kind of clinic is Whole Systems Healthcare?] [How are we different from other clinics?] [What is the difference between a naturopathic and a medical doctor?] Primarily, a medical doctor (MD) is trained through a clinical orientation toward saving lives and managing symptoms-focusing on the use of pharmaceutical medications and surgery as methods of treatment. This medical approach is best used for managing severe infectious diseases, trauma, symptom palliation, and necessary surgical procedures. A naturopathic doctor (ND) is trained as a holistic healthcare provider with a focus on restoring health. Therefore, NDs are trained in an array of modalities that may be helpful for their patients in their pursuit of health and wellness, such as botanical medicine, nutrition, counseling, homeopathy, physical medicine, and lifestyle medicine. NDs focus on treating the person rather than their disease. [Is a naturopathic doctor anti-pharmaceutical medications?] [What is a direct care practice?] Direct care medicine creates a relationship between a patient and a healthcare provider in which the patient pays a monthly membership fee for services. This is opposed to a fee-for-service model in which insurance codes determine the level of reimbursement, thereby creating a transaction instead of a relationship. Direct care resolves the issue of motivation that is part of fee-for-service, also referred to as provider-driven demand. The practitioner is not paid by the code, so there is no incentive to give a treatment that will pay more. For the patient, since they are paying regardless of whether they seek care or not, there is every incentive to come in early with any illness, thus saving themselves undue suffering and making it easier to provide less intensive and invasive care. In exchange for the monthly fee, patients have more flexible scheduling options and receive reduced costs for services. We spend about 30-120 minutes with patients depending upon the visit and the patient's needs. [Do you currently accept health insurance?] No, our Boulder Clinic does not currently accept health insurance. We can provide a form, known as a superbill, for you to submit to your insurance company. You may be able to receive reimbursement from your insurance providers for our services. You may also use a Health Savings Account (HSA) or a Flexible Spending Account (FSA) to pay for visits, labs, and medicinary items.
