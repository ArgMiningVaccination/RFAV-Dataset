The baccalaureate nursing program is organized around 60 key concepts. These concepts are categorized in five domains: - Nursing across the lifespan - Population health - Evidence-based practice/quality improvement - Leadership - Professional identity/communication Each concept is composed of attributes. A few examples of concepts include immunity, sexuality, health promotion and caring. The concepts are taught through the use of exemplars, which are sample cases of the concept that the nurse may experience in their practice. A single concept, such as immunity, may be taught as a primary or as an interrelated concept several times throughout the curriculum using a variety of exemplars such as vaccination in children, rheumatoid arthritis in middle or elder years, allergic reactions to food or medicine or in a deficient state as may be related to cancer treatment. Concepts are taught using instructional activities that are student-centered, active and focused on the application of information. The professional portion of the program consists of 58 semester credits and is designed to be completed in two academic years of full-time study. These courses are offered on the KU Medical Center campus.
