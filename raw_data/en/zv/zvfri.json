A vaccine detox is important for people who have gotten vaccines because of the inherent toxicity they contain, the volatility of heavy metals and other inorganic compounds. Some of us may have a stronger reaction to a vaccine than others depending on allergies, how high our inflammation levels are, and how heavy our toxic load is. Many people are also allergic to components of the vaccines causing even further trauma to the body. Our bodies have systems that work to eliminate toxicity around the clock, but some of us may have a harder time based on our toxic load or inflammation. Toxins build up when the body's detoxification mechanisms can't keep up with cellular waste and absorption of toxins from the intestines. This means that toxins and garbage are coming in faster than your body can process, and safely remove/detox. Toxic vaccine ingredients tend to build up in the liver and your organs, further impacting your body's capacity to function. This may lead to serious illness/disease, thus creating need for bohdi Total Body Detoxification. What Are Some of Those Toxins? Each vaccine has different ingredients to be aware of, but most contain the same baseline toxins which may harm the body in many ways. It may be hard to believe, but these ingredients are common in all children's vaccinations, flu and other viral vaccines. These ingredients, which can be found on the CDC website, include: Aluminum, Ammonium, Antibiotics, Artificial Colorings such as Yellow #6 and Phenol Red Dye Bovine Serum (Blood from Cow, Ox, or Buffalo), DNA, Egg Protein, Formaldehyde, Human Serum (Blood Plasma), Canine Kidney (MDCK), Cell Protein, Mercury, Monosodium Glutamate, MRC-5 Cellular Protein (Aborted Fetus Lung Cells), Parasite Cell Protein (Fall ArmyWorm), Preservatives, Thimerosal Sugar (Sucrose) Which Groups Are More Likely To Have Adverse Reactions? Data from past vaccination records show that the following groups are more likely to have adverse reactions from vaccines: - Immunocompromised individuals - Individuals with history of severe allergies - Individuals with higher loads of environmental toxins - Individuals with a history of gastrointestinal issues - Individuals with genetic abnormalities In the modern day, 80-90% of humans struggle with one or more of these issues. Prior to a Vaccination or Vaccine Detox, Testing is Necessary to Protect the Body Individuals should begin with testing to see what their body needs and how their body is functioning. If someone is having a reaction, it is crucial to find out where the inflammation is coming from, and the only way to know is to test. When there is a need to detox the body, the individual must be prepared properly to avoid a Herxheimer or Herx Reactions (a short-term- between a few days to a few weeks- detoxification reaction in the body. As the body detoxifies, it is not uncommon to experience flu-like symptoms including headache, joint and muscle pain, body aches, sore throat, general malaise, sweating, chills, nausea, or other symptoms.) It is important to test for inflammation, liver function and gut function prior to vaccination and detoxification. Vaccine Detoxification Protocol It is recommended to begin this protocol 2 weeks prior to vaccination, and may be started at any point after vaccination regardless of how much time has passed. 1. Begin A Detoxification Diet Plan We recommend a 60 day detox to clean up your diet, reset your system and support your body through the detoxification process, so the body can focus on cleaning the heavy metals/toxins out. We recommend removing gluten, refined sugar, red meat, dairy, eggs, corn, soy and alcohol, while introducing 7-9 cups of fruits and vegetables a day. Each day should include lots of cleansing fruits (berries, dragon fruit, lemon and ginger. Keep your protein portion to 20% of total food consumption a day, sticking to easy to digest foods such as wild fish, organic/pastured chicken and turkey, lentils and chickpeas. It is important to add healthy fats to your diet during a detoxification protocol. Because heavy metals are attracted to fat, we add a healthy source to help transport them out of the body, or else they may end up in your tissue or brain. Healthy sources of fat include avocado, coconut, ghee and olives. These are not limited to oils, but the foods themselves. We always recommend you make sure you are eating non-GMO and organic options, especially during this time. 2. The Importance of Nightly Fasting During A Detox Ideally, we recommend a 13 hour overnight fast between 6:30 PM and 7:30 AM and a weekly fast of 24 hours during detoxification. This is crucial to the body's elimination and hormonal systems. Fasting not only allows the colon to eliminate toxins, but also puts the body into a mode called Autophagy. Autophagy is a biological process that removes the body's accumulated toxins and recycles damaged cell components. When your body does not have a surplus of food coming in, it is going to look to clean house on the inside and burn any waste it finds as potential fuel. For this fuel, the body will destroy necrotic (diseased) tissue, by programming death in bacterial cells, viral cells, cancer cells, and pathogens. In turn, fasting and entering a state of Autophagy will clean fatty liver, boost innate immune TH1, work to reverse Type II Diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases, and cleanse the system of any toxic load from food, medications, vaccinations and the environment.* *If you struggle with hypoglycemia, do not partake in fasting. Daily - The 13 Hour Overnight Fast - Ideally 6:30 PM - 7:30 AM - Essentially do not eat for 13 hours after the last meal - The last meal should end around 6:30 PM - You may drink water or water with lemon during overnight fast - The overnight fast should not be broken with caffeine, rather may be broken with berries, protein, healthy fat and vegetables Once a Week - The 24 Hour Fast - Begin this once accomplishing the 13 hour overnight fast - Ideally begins Sunday night, 6:30 PM, breaking the fast at 6:30 PM on Monday night - During the fast, only drink liquids such as water, water with lemon, green juice with no fruit, or non-caffeinated herbal tea - During the winter, we recommend drinking only fresh ginger tea during your 24 hour fast to help with moving the lymph, cleansing the kidneys, and detoxing the liver by providing heat for the body 3. What to Take and When Bhdi Total Body Detoxification 2 Capsules, 1 Time Daily in the AM with 12 ounces of water. Best taken on an empty stomach 1-2 hours away from food, supplements or medicines for 1 week leading up to vaccination and 2 weeks afterward. HistaQuel Histaquel combines seven flavonoids shown to support healthy mast cell function by promoting a healthy amount of histamine release, along with herbs shown to block histamine from attaching to receptors via competitive inhibition. It is common for vaccination to create allergic reactions, and Histaquel helps to mitigate this problem. Take 2 capsules, 2 times daily with or without food, 2 weeks leading up to vaccination and 2 weeks afterward. Saccharomyces Boulardii (Gut Health) Saccharomyces boulardii is a type of yeast sourced from the skin of such plants as lychee and mangosteen. Saccharomyces boulardii is considered to be a probiotic, a class of beneficial bacteria found to stimulate the immune system and protect digestive health. Saccharomyces boulardii may improve the immune response by enhancing the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, T-cell proliferation and dendritic cell activation. Take 1 capsule 2 times daily with meals, 3 weeks leading up to vaccination and 4 weeks afterward. Trace Minerals Minerals are necessary for detoxification and a healthy immune response following vaccination. When the body receives the right balance of minerals, trace minerals and vitamins to nourish the liver enzymes, it functions well and is able to eliminate or process the toxins. Take 10-20 drops in water daily. Suggested to take with food. 4. Remove Chemical Toxins From Your Daily Life Your body can't heal if it's being bombarded with other toxins. Start by removing all the chemicals in your everyday life. Swap your personal products, cookware, household cleaners, laundry detergents and other commonly used items for cleaner versions. Pay attention to chemicals, preservatives and additives in your personal products such as shampoo, conditioner, deodorant, body wash, lotions, perfumes and hair care products. 5. Chiropractic Adjustments, Infrared Saunas, Detox Baths, Lymphatic Massages, and Exercise Don't skip your chiropractic appointments during your detox. Chiropractors keep your nervous system working and your body functioning. Your nervous system is the signaling system that tells your body what to do, including those important organs that help the detoxification process. An adjustment is another way to decrease inflammation that can inhibit the detox process. During your vaccine detox it is important to be sweating and keeping your blood moving. Techniques like infrared sauna, lymphatic massage, exercise and a detox bath can assist your body in opening detox pathways. Detox Baths work closely with Infrared Sauna benefits. Sitting in a detox bath of Epsom Salt, Bentonite Clay and Apple Cider Vinegar will draw toxins out of the body through the skin. We recommend taking a detox bath 2x per week for 2 weeks leading up to vaccination and 4 weeks afterward. It is recommended to use an infrared sauna as often as possible before and after receiving a vaccination. Infrared heat opens your detoxification pathways on one of the deepest levels possible, allowing proper elimination of toxins and heavy metals. We recommend using the sauna daily/every other day for the week leading up to vaccination and 2 weeks afterward. Lymphatic Massage helps move toxins out of your muscles and tissues into the lymphatic system. This is a technique you may perform yourself or by a professional. We recommend performing lymphatic massage before/during an infrared sauna session. Exercise is a critical aspect of any detoxification protocol. By keeping blood and lymphatic circulation steady, toxicity is more able and likely to exit the system. We recommend walking 10,000 steps a day as a baseline of exercise during detoxification. A Vaccine Detox is Important Any individual who has taken or plans to take a vaccine requires a detoxification protocol to support the body and it's best function. It takes time to undo years of toxic build-up. Every individual is different, and we recommend consulting with a proficient practitioner to guide you through a Vaccine Detox.
