Subscribe to Our Newsletter year old Monica was just like other girls of her age, very active in college and home as well as in her social circles. This suddenly changed when she was diagnosed with Non compressive dorsal myelopathy. Before 2 years, Monica had complains of low back pain and weakness in lower limbs. She also experienced tingling sensations in her legs and was unable to comfortably get up from sitting position. Her condition progressed gradually to the extent that she was unable to walk without support and would fall frequently. Monica became dependent on others to help her perform daily living activities. She then started using a walker, however, due to weakness, limitation of activity and subsequent weight gain, she was unable to move around by herself. She had to stop attending college as her condition worsened over 2 years. This took a toll on the once cheerful Monica and she started experiencing frequent spells of depression. Her parents say that Monica would often speak to herself, experienced mood swings and had disturbed sleep pattern. They consulted allopathic specialists as well as alternative treatment therapists, who prescribed medications and advised physiotherapy, but could not assure that her condition will stop progressing. Her worried parents started researching on treatments for their daughter. They consulted doctors at different hospitals and heard of cellular therapy and Dr. Pradeep Mahajan of StemRx Bioscience Solutions Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai. Despite being unaware of cellular therapy and regenerative medicine, they decided to consult Dr. Mahajan. During the initial consultation, Monica and parents were explained in detail about her condition and cellular therapy. She was advised to undergo 3 sessions of cellular therapy along with intensive rehabilitation and lifestyle modifications. Myelopathy refers to neurologic defect related to spinal cord. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have strong self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation potentials. These cells have the ability to home to the site of injury and initiate their actions. The mechanism underlying the function of stem cell transplantation in nerve repair may involve cell replacement function and neurotrophic effect. Additionally, MSCs can be induced to differentiate into neuron-like cells and glial cells. Also, MSCs have been shown to promote muscle regeneration and improve muscle function. Cellular therapy has been shown to produce healthy muscle fibers as well as reduce associated inflammation. Thus, cellular therapy holds promise in management of neuromuscular deficits that result due myelopathies.

Additionally physiotherapy exercises targeting specific muscle groups were advised, which the patient has to continue regularly. The aim of the exercises is to strengthen weakened muscles, thereby enabling her to perform her daily activities independently. Post treatment, it is being observed that Monica has increased strength in limbs and she is able to walk using a walker independently. Through a properly planned diet, she has lost 10 kilograms since initiation of treatment. Physiotherapy exercises have been advised along with neuromuscular stimulation. The holistic protocol has resulted in improvement in overall strength and positive change in her behavior is also being noticed. Monica will be followed up at regular intervals to assess her progress and plan further treatment sessions (if required).
