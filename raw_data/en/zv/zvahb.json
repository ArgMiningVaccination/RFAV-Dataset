We help those who are ready to start the detox process from: alcohol, opioids, heroin, fentany, methadone, oxycodone , benzos or any other drug you may be addicted to.", "sitename": "Addiction Treatment Center Cornerstone of Recovery", "date": "2016-01-18", "cleaned_text": "Alcohol Knoxville TN For almost every caller who inquires about our services, one of the first questions they have is, \"How bad is detox going to be?\" It's an understandable fear, especially if you've gone into withdrawals on your own without a nursing staff and counselors to take care of you. If you have no point of reference for treatment, you may be afraid that you're signing up for more of the same... that's not the case. Those fears, however, don't align with reality. We have an incredible Nursing Staff who choose to work here because they are passionate about helping folks like us. Many of our nurses have personal experience with withdrawal and we'll do our best to make sure you are as comfortable as possible. In our [Medical Detoxification Program](https://bradfordhealth.com/services/detox-rehab/), you will be safely and slowly withdrawn from the drugs that has enslaved your body and mind. Detox the first step of the treatment journey and it's critical, because only with a clear head and in comfortable skin can you begin to grasp the life-changing concepts of recovery that will lead you to long-standing, permanent sobriety. In that sense, Medical Detox is an imperative - for you, and for us. We can't provide you with the clinical and counseling services you need until you're in a shape to receive them, and until you are feeling well enough you won't be able to focus on getting better. For that reason alone, we believe that it's our imperative in Medical Detox to return you to some semblance of humanity as quickly and safely as possible. What's it going to be like? During your stay in Medical Detox, you'll be assessed every four hours by nursing staff, who will monitor vital signs like your blood pressure, temperature and pulse oximetry; if needed, you may also be prescribed certain medications to make your process more comfortable, including: - For benzodiazepine and alcohol withdrawal, we prescribe Phenobarbital; - For opiate withdrawal, we tend to use Subutex, Robaxin and/or Clonidine; - For cocaine, we utilize Bromocriptine. While in Medical Detox, you'll also be provided with three delicious and nourishing meals a day and be given an opportunity to attend an orientation group, an evening wrap-up meeting and other therapeutic sessions to ease you into the routine of community-oriented treatment. Ultimately, however, you will be given ample opportunity to relax, recharge and allow your body and mind time to heal themselves before you're integrated into a treatment community of peers. A typical detox stay is three to five days, but depending on the severity of a patient's symptoms, it may require more time. Our goal is to provide you with that time while keeping tabs on your physical well-being and ensuring that your stay is as comfortable and safe as possible. Will I be comfortable? We can't promise there won't be some degree of discomfort, but you will be cared for by people who've been there before and know what you are going through so they can anticipate and adjust well. In your room, you will have a comfortable bed, the ability to adjust the temperature in your room, plenty of pillows and blankets, and a bathtub so you can soak if you choose. In the community room a few steps down the hall you'll find a bunch of comfy couches and lounge chairs surrounding a big screen TV where you can watch movies and Netflix til your hearts content. And yes, you are allowed to smoke cigarettes outside. Let us assure you of this: On the other side of Medical Detox, a whole new world awaits. It's not one you can fully comprehend in a state of inebriation or withdrawal, but we can assure you, it's worth the journey and the hardship - minimal though it may be - you might feel in the beginning. We hope you'll give it, and us, a chance. What People Are Saying About Us Our Residential Treatment Programs Include FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS What Else Do I Get To Do In Treatment?
