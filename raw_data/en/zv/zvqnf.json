No matter what age you are, it's always been advisable to take care of your health, but winter months may not seem as conducive to nurturing your body. Staying inside more and being less active can have adverse effects on your body. You may have to make changes in the way you do things this time of year to ensure you are in top shape and strengthen your body's defenses. How can seniors strengthen their immune systems? Natural treatments are easy to find and administer that can help us feel better and stay well. Start by consulting with your physician before implementing any big changes to your daily routine. Keep reading for six simple steps to maintain an optimum immune system. 1. Let the sunshine in. Despite the social distancing and other restrictive actions suggested during the pandemic, there is still a sun outside on most days. It's free and waiting for you! You can mask up, stay six feet apart and take time to walk outdoors, or even sit in natural light. It's a pivotal way to let your body manufacture vitamin D. Even on cold days, it's recommended to bundle up and go outdoors for at least 15 minutes per day to expose yourself to the sun's UVB rays. Vitamin D helps our immune system produce much-needed antibodies. 2. Step it up. Practice some form of exercise - it keeps your body healthier and ensures your immune system functions smoothly. There is no one best exercise for immune systems, but try walking briskly through your house, stretching. or perform yoga alongside a video. Thirty minutes of physical activity a day is recommended. Vigorous cardio exercising is not necessary for seniors when it comes to immune systems. [The American Journal of Medicine](https://urgentmednetwork.com/seven-quick-easy-ways-boost-immune-system/) reports even the simple act of walking three times a week can increase the number of white blood cells in the body and be sufficient. 3. Be calm. You're probably well aware of the negative aspects of stress. [The American Psychological Association reports](https://www.apa.org/research/action/immune) show that chronic stress can ravage the immune system. Managing stress can help people fight germs. Find ways to calm yourself such as listening to meditative podcasts or videos, getting a massage or connecting with friends. Social ties indirectly strengthen immune systems because friends can encourage behaviors such as healthy eating, getting plenty of sleep and exercising. 4. Veg out. Fill your plate with vegetables. They're loaded with nutrients that can keep immune systems in top shape. Cruciferous vegetables such as kale, broccoli and cabbage are a helpful immune-boosting food for seniors. Eating a well-rounded diet year-round that is teeming with fruits and vegetables is always recommended to strengthen seniors' immune systems. 5. A,B,C and D. An easy way to improve your immune system is through vitamins. You can boost your overall health by taking vitamins A, B2, B6, C, D and E along with eating a healthy diet rich in natural sources of nutrients. 6. Hydrate. Drinking water is a no-brainer when it comes to staying healthy. H2O helps build muscle because it carries more oxygen to your cells. It also flushes toxins away from vital organs.
