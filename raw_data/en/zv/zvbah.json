He spoke of this ability as a precondition for all forms of healthy childhood education\u2014including special education\u2014and suggested that teachers should develop such a capacity within themselves. This process involves the recreation of the child within oneself, based on what we are able to observe in the child's physical appearance, temperament, ways of moving, and environment. In The Therapeutic Eye, Dr. Peter Selg discusses Steiner's views on childhood development, how teachers can look at children, and ways that these approaches can be used to develop lessons and classroom activities to deal with behavioral extremes and learning challenges. The Therapeutic Eye is a valuable resource for teachers and parents. The Therapeutic Eye is a translation from German of Der therapeutische Blick: Rudolf Steiner sieht Kinder.
