We take a unique pan-antigenic approach for our cancer vaccine \u2014 targeting all neoantigens, rather than a select few \u2014 allowing our treatment to overcome cancer's tendency to mutate over time. Utilizing our autologous cell therapy platform, which has generated multiple therapeutic vaccine programs shown to be safe and effective in early clinical trials, we are developing a personalized vaccine with adaptive immunity against COVID-19. Our novel vaccine-enabling kit ensures pathogen readiness against emerging and evolving threats. Our unique expertise in stem cell growth and directed, high-purity differentiation enables us to develop safe, efficient and economical manufacturing processes for therapeutic development. "}
