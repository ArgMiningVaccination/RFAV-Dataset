In the light of practical experience in the application of those two Regulations, it is appropriate to proceed to their review in order to establish a simpler, clearer and more flexible legal framework, while guaranteeing the same level of public and animal health protection. (2) The procedures laid down in Regulations (EC) No 1084/2003 and (EC) No 1085/2003 should therefore be adjusted, without departing from the general principles on which those procedures are based. For reasons of proportionality, homeopathic and tradi \u00ad tional herbal medicinal products which have not been granted a marketing authorisation but are subject to a simplified registration procedure should remain excluded from the scope of the Regu \u00ad lation. B 2008R1234 \u2014 EN \u2014 04.08.2013 \u2014 \u2014 2 ( 1 ) OJ L 311, 28.11.2001, p. 1. ( 2 ) OJ L 311, 28.11.2001, p. 67. ( 3 ) OJ L 136, 30.4.2004, p. 1. ( 4 ) OJ L 159, 27.6.2003, p. 1. ( 5 ) OJ L 159, 27.6.2003, p. 24. (3) Variations to medicinal products can be classified in different categories, depending on the level of risk to public or animal health and the impact on the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal product concerned. Definitions for each of those categories should therefore be laid down. In order to bring further predictability, guidelines on the details of the various categories of variations should be established and regularly updated in the light of scientific and technical progress, taking in particular account of developments regarding international harmonisation. The European Medicines Agency (hereinafter the Agency) and the Member States should also be empowered to give recommendations on the classification of unforeseen vari \u00ad ations. (4) It should be clarified that certain changes which have the highest potential impact on the quality, safety or efficacy of medicinal products require a complete scientific assessment, in the same way as for the evaluation of new marketing authorisation appli \u00ad cations. (5) In order to further reduce the overall number of variations procedures and to enable competent authorities to focus on those variations that have a genuine impact on quality, safety or efficacy, an annual reporting system should be introduced for certain minor variations. Such variations should not require any prior approval and should be notified within 12 months following implementation. However, other types of minor vari \u00ad ations whose immediate reporting is necessary for the continuous supervision of the medicinal product concerned should not be subject to the annual reporting system. (6) Each variation should require a separate submission. Grouping of variations should nevertheless be allowed in certain cases, in order to facilitate the review of the variations and reduce the administrative burden. Grouping of variations to the terms of several marketing authorisations from the same marketing auth \u00ad orisation holder should be allowed only insofar as all concerned marketing authorisations are affected by the exact same group of variations. (7) In order to avoid duplication of work in the evaluation of vari \u00ad ations to the terms of several marketing authorisations, a work \u00ad sharing procedure should be established under which one auth \u00ad ority, chosen amongst the competent authorities of the Member States and the Agency, should examine the variation on behalf of the other concerned authorities. (8) Provisions should be established reflecting those laid down in Directive 2001/82/EC and Directive 2001/83/EC as regards the role of the coordination groups established under Article 31 of Directive 2001/82/EC and Article 27 of Directive 2001/83/EC, to increase cooperation between Member States and allow for the settlement of disagreements in the evaluation of certain vari \u00ad ations. (9) This Regulation should clarify when the holder of a marketing authorisation is allowed to implement a given variation as such clarification is essential for economic operators. B 2008R1234 \u2014 EN \u2014 04.08.2013 \u2014 002.001 \u2014 3 (10) A transitional period should be established in order to give all interested parties, in particular Member States authorities and the industry, time to adapt to the new legal framework.

Variations covered under (a), (b) or (c) may be subject to the same worksharing procedure. The reference authority or, in the case of purely national marketing authorisations, the competent authority may refuse to process a submission under the worksharing procedure where the same change(s) to different marketing authorisations require the submission of individual supportive data for each medicinal product concerned or a separate product-specific assessment. 2. For the purposes of this Article, 'reference authority' shall mean one of the following: (a) the Agency where at least one of the marketing authorisations referred to paragraph 1 is a centralised marketing authorisation; (b) the competent authority of a Member State concerned chosen by the coordination group, taking into account a recommendation of the holder, in the other cases. 3. The holder shall submit to all relevant authorities an application containing the elements listed in Annex IV, with an indication of the preferred reference authority. The coordination group shall choose a reference authority. If the appli \u00ad cation fulfils the requirements laid down in the first subparagraph, that reference authority shall acknowledge receipt of a valid application. B Where the chosen reference authority is the competent authority of a Member State which has not granted a marketing authorisation for all the medicinal products affected by the application, the coordination group may request another relevant authority to assist the reference authority in the evaluation of that application.
