That in itself tells you nothing about the effectiveness of U.S. health care. Might be a good thing, might be a bad thing. But you often hear that the United States spends more and actually gets less for its money than other systems. That U.S. health care outcomes are terrible relative to the rest of the world. So, ignoring the expenditure side, at least for the moment, is it true that U.S. health care outcomes are mediocre relative to the rest of the world? Guest: I think this is really one of the biggest problems about misinformation that the public has been hearing. The quality of U.S. health care compared to the rest of the world is actually far superior in almost all chronic diseases, almost all treatments, almost all cancers, screening, access to tests, access to new treatments. All medical outcomes, if you really look at the facts and the scientific or medical peer-reviewed literature, most of the reports don't do that. They take generally very coarse endpoints--life expectancy or infant mortality--things that have contributions from many things outside of health care itself; come up with a ranking, and then publish that as if that is the statement on the quality of care. So, the short answer is: Absolutely not. The quality of U.S. health care is far better than whatever everyone has been talking about; and the facts show it. Russ: Well, let's start with life expectancy. That would, on the surface, seem to be what you want to look at. What would you care about more than how long you live? And of course one answer would be the quality of life. But certainly life expectancy is an important measure of health care outcomes. When you take the United States and put it in world perspective, where does the United States rank as a measure of outcomes? Are we near the top? Middle? Guest: Well, if you go by the rankings that most people cite, which is the Year 2000 World Health Organization Report, I think the United States was something like 37th. Something like that. Russ: Which is disappointing. Guest: Which is disappointing and actually bad, even if you don't consider the expenditures. Because we are a very modern, advanced nation. There is no question about that. Russ: Correct. Guest: But then when you look at the statistic, this is the problem. Life expectancy is not really solely a measure of health care. Russ: No doubt. Guest: There are many, many factors that go into it. And the United States has a lot of--there are many significant differences between the U.S. population and the way we measure things than other countries. Even countries in Western Europe who are just as sophisticated and just as modern. So, the statistic itself is very misleading. Russ: What would be an example? You wouldn't think so. You are either alive or not. It depends how it's gathered--that would seem to be relatively straightforward in a developed country, at least. I understand that in an undeveloped country maybe they are not as careful with the records. In the United States, I think we are pretty good with birth dates and deaths. So, we have a pretty good idea of how long people actually live, who at least were born here in the United States. What else would matter besides that, if we are, say, comparing U.S. life expectancy to Western Europe? Guest: Well, one example that has been published by people at the U. of Iowa is the cause of death. Because, if you are talking about health care, you would think you'd want to talk about the things that are related to health care. And one ranking in this was done to the rankings for all the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, all the most developed countries in the world, ranked the United States toward the bottom for life expectancy. Russ: Consistent with the numbers you said. Guest: Consistent with the numbers I said. Yet when they compensated for differences in suicide and immediate death from high speed motor accidents-- Russ: Things where the health care system is probably not going to able to save you. Guest: Yeah. The health care system has nothing to do with your surviving a gunshot wound to the head, basically. Russ: Or an accident at 60 miles per hour without a seat belt. Guest: Exactly. High speed accidents. And when they compensated for that by giving everyone the same number of suicides and instant deaths like that and then redoing the ranking, the United States elevated to Number One in life expectancy. Russ: Sounds like a cheap statistical trick. But it could be true, the right thing to do. Because, and correctly, suicides and high speed deaths should not indict your health care system. But of course there's some vagueness about how we measure high speed automobile death, I suppose. Some uncertainty about that. Guest: But when you really look at the numbers on suicides, there's an extraordinarily high number of difference in the United States versus these other countries where they are doing the rankings. Russ: Much higher. Guest: Much higher in the United States. Russ: As is automobile accidents per capita. You are saying, I assume. Guest: Yeah. I haven't looked at the exact number of automobile accidents. But another example of that would be just looking at what is the cause of death. And when you look at adults, children, and young adults, through I think the age of 40, something like 25%, 30% of deaths only, were due to an illness. Russ: Right. Guest: Okay, so health care quality is talking really about, generally speaking, about illnesses and diagnosing and treating. So, it's a very, very coarse statistic. Russ: Of course, the other factor, which you mention and talk about extensively in the book is lifestyle differences. So, even with health care outcomes that are related to the health care system, such as diagnosis and treatment of illness, lifestyles, genetics are the two biggest things that are going to affect your health care outcomes, your life expectancy, outside of the health care system itself. So, those are going to matter. Guest: Absolutely. Lifestyle is very different. As the rest of the world is learning with globalization. When you look at the one that probably has the most impact on illness and survival is obesity. And we've heard a lot about this. And when you look at the data, the United States has a far higher frequency of obesity, defined scientifically, as a proportion of body mass, has a far higher proportion of the population that is obese compared to other countries. And with that goes a significant decrease in life expectancy. For instance, it is estimated that from people who survive to age 40--just take people who are 40 and over--obesity decreases the life expectancy beyond age 40 of about 6 years. Compared to non-obese. So, when there is this striking difference, two times or triple, up to triple sometimes depending on the country, the frequency of obesity in the population of the United States compared to others, you are going to have a significant impact on the overall life expectancy.| |8:18||Russ: Now, of course, you mentioned in the raw data the United States is 37th in the world in life expectancy. The difference between 1st and 37th was 81.2 to 79.6. You might say it's very important. You are suggesting that these obesity numbers actually have a significant impact on both the ranking and that you'd care about it. Guest: Absolutely. You bring up another point here, which is the differences. In the ranking that people use generally as the kind of fundamental indictment of U.S. quality of care was the World Health Report from 2000. And when you really look at their data, you see that the differences between number 3 and number 30 were not even what we call statistically significant. When you look at their own data. And yet they still went on to rank it. Now, what do I mean by statistically significant? Statistically significant, for those who don't understand that, is a difference that cannot be accounted for by simply random variations in the data, that have nothing to do with the question being asked. So, when you say, you are ranked number 30 but your answer is essentially your data point is the same as the ranking of number 3, then why do you report it as ranked number 30? Three equals thirty. Russ: Because it sells the reports, obviously; it is exciting. But what you have in the chart in your book is, basically you have confidence intervals around these overall, weighted measures of health care; and they are quite large. The top of the confidence interval and the bottom encompass large ranges of the entire data set. Which is not encouraging. One thing you don't talk about, I don't think, in the book, which I've always been fascinated by is the trend in life expectancy over time. Which, to some extent, obviously imperfectly, within a country controls for genetics--outside of immigration; at least over short periods of time, gene pools in the United States are roughly constant. The differences are small and can be ignored. To the extent that lifestyle is similar at the beginning and end of a time period; obviously it can go through a time of exercise intensity or obsession with obesity or not worrying about obesity--you can get trends like that. And of course obesity has been increasing in the United States, as officially measured. So that works to shorten life expectancy. The obesity changes over time. The genes, probably the same. And yet life expectancy in the United States climbs steadily every single year. I haven't looked in the last few years, but every year, there is an annual report, news item: U.S. life expectancy increased again. Which, given the challenge of obesity which does suggest that it's getting worse, does suggest that the health care system is getting better. Correct? Guest: Absolutely. And to be fair, life expectancy has been increasing in many of these countries, if not all. Russ: For reasons other than health care. Guest: For reasons other than health care. But also benefiting from the medical advances that often originate in the United States. Which is a separate discussion.| |11:42||Russ: We'll talk about that in a little bit. But one of the problems with life expectancy data is that--I want to turn to our next topic, which you devote a lot of time to in the book, which is infant mortality. Infant mortality has a huge impact on life expectancy, because you could die--an infant that dies at six months enters into the average as a .5--half a year life. Pulling down the average. And what we often care about--it's really, life expectancy reflects a bunch of things. There's social phenomena, like suicide; but a high infant mortality rate leads to a low life expectancy. But once you survive infancy, it's been a very poor measure of your true expectation. So, we might often care more about your life expectancy conditional on reaching, like, say, age 40, as you mentioned before. But infant mortality is important in and of itself; you've got a statistical impact, and that's another measure where the United States often does very poorly in these international rankings, which is surprising. And you suggest that's very misleading. Why? Guest: Absolutely. And here you get into--there are many reasons, but one of the big ones that we kind of dispensed with regard to life expectancy, is the actual measurement. Because the measurements here are very critical. And this is very different from the United States compared to other countries, including those in Western Europe. Where, in the United States there are many differences. One important one is that we count every birth. And birth is defined as any sign of life. Actually, ironically, using the very strict criteria defined by the World Health Organization (WHO)--we count any heart rate, any respiration, no matter how premature the infant, no matter how small the infant, no matter how immediate the death is. Other countries, including many civilized countries, countries that we think of as similar to the United States, don't count births as live births if the baby does not survive for, say, 24 hours. If the baby does not measure a certain size or weight. If the baby does not survive for 48 hours, or even a week. And so when you throw away the deaths from the most fragile infants in the denominator of a fraction, your calculation is grossly distorted, compared to those who counted even the weakest babies who had on a small chance of survival like with do in the United States. Russ: Having been blessed with four children and seeing the unbelievable medical technology that's available to a newborn baby and a mother--dads don't get, we get a comfortable chair, that's the limit of technology if we're lucky; we don't deserve anything more than that. But, given that, it's hard to believe you'd rather have your baby somewhere that has a lower mortality rate, supposedly, in the data. But there are many countries that do, and you are suggesting that's misleading. Guest: And many other reasons as well, including things like: the United States has a medical culture of doing what I would call the full court press. Every baby. So, we go to great lengths to prolong and hopefully end up having a success of survival--like I said, the weakest and most vulnerable infants. We have a lot of other confounding variables. Like, we are very aggressive about in vitro fertilization, which has a secondary effect of multiple gestation pregnancy--twins, triplets. And these are higher risk--higher risk for premature birth as well as more infant death. There are a lot of reasons where we go to very different extent of trying to get survivals and trying to get births that actually in the end harm our overall statistic. Russ: Yeah. Which is not what human beings should care about. Policy wonks can use those, obviously. The number on in vitro fertilization (IVF) is rather remarkable, actually. I don't remember it off the top of my head; I don't know if you do; but the proportion of U.S. births that are, the frequency of triplets or more, I think is-- Guest: Yeah, it's been expanding dramatically. I don't remember the number either off the top of my head from the graph, but I think the point is, as has recently been in the paper, there have been millions and millions of babies now born by IVF in the United States, and we have been rather aggressive about implanting embryos with the hope of getting a baby. And with that increased risk of multiple gestations. Russ: I've found one stat[?] here that's of interest from the book. This is infant mortality rate within the United States by pregnancy; this is per thousand live births, which as you point out, very premature babies and high-risk pregnancies, but if it's a single embryo, a single baby being born, the number is 5.87 out of a thousand. Very unlikely that the infant dies. If you have quads, it's 146.48. So, it's almost thirty times; and it rises steadily with twins, triplets, quadruplets within the United States because they are more at risk. Here's the triplet birth rate--again, this doesn't compare it to other countries, but in 1980 about 40 out of 100,000 live births were triplets; by 1998, that number had reached almost 200 per 100,000. So a five-fold increase. But that would affect the numbers over time. If you are measuring at a point in time and comparing to other nations with lower multiple gestations, you are going to get a very different number.| |17:54||Russ: So, the first point, I think the first part of your book, is that a lot of these health outcomes that are used to indict the U.S. health care systems are misleading for statistical reasons. But then you go on to talk about quite a number of interesting other types of outcomes that we would just use in common sense ways of judging efficacy of health care per se. For example, cancer survival rates. So, if you have cancer, if you have lung cancer, God forbid, or some other type of cancer, there's some genetic interactions I assume, potentially with the native population; but a lot of them is going to depend on early detection and treatment. So, how does the United States do relative to the rest of the world on something as crucial as that? Guest: Yeah. Cancer is a very glaring example of the quality of the U.S. health care is superior. In all common cancers, the ones we talk about--lung, breast, prostate, etc.--the United States does better, significantly better, than all the countries of Western Europe and the countries that are held up as models for health care reform. We do better in survival in the rare cancers, as well. And there's a lot of factors that go into it. It's not just early detection--it's treatment, it's availability of cancer drugs; most of the pharmaceutical agents that have become important over the last decade are those in cancer. Interestingly these articles in the peer-reviewed literature are coming out of European authors, who say, right out, forthright, the United States has better cancer care than \"we\"--the authors say--in Western Europe. So, the facts in the medical literature I think are rather obvious that the United States, if you are going to be sick, and in this case cancer, you'd rather be in the United States than somewhere else. This doesn't just include people, by the way, with super quality health insurance or rich people. This includes everyone. This is overall data, everyone in the system. Russ: So, let's take a few different--I don't know if you know about this, so feel free to duck this question. But if we talked about, say, three different types of patients in America, under our current system. Under our current system, one type of patient might be someone who has access to world class health care. They have a first-rate health insurance program; they don't have to spend any of their own money. They get cancer, they live near a world class hospital and world class doctors; and they clearly get some of the best treatment if not the best treatment in the world, in the United States. Then we might think about someone who doesn't have access to that, maybe geographically, for family reasons, but still has access to what you would call mainstream care. And the third would be a person who doesn't have health care-- Guest: Who doesn't have health insurance. Russ: Right, doesn't have health insurance, would be this third kind of person. Guest: I want to correct--this is another kind of big misconception. Russ: I'm glad you caught me there. Guest: Making it synonymous--no health insurance in the United States means that there's no health care. And that's simply wrong. Russ: If I were a dishonest person I would edit this part out of the podcast, because that drives me nuts, too. So, I meant health care insurance; so this person does not have employer-provided insurance as you and I have; this person doesn't have very much financial wherewithal, period, and has to either presumably get Medicaid and get government aid. So, what's the difference in treatment--and outcomes--but also just technology. Rich people get--and I would add, the other issue I always think about is a heart attack; to take an extreme, a homeless person today gets better care than President Eisenhower got in the 1950s because of technological advances. A homeless person who walks into--can't walk, but gets taken into an emergency room, gets some remarkable stuff. So, am I right there? Guest: I think this opens up a very important topic that has a lot of offshoot discussions. And this is really the difference in care that someone gets in the United States between private insurance and Medicaid, and as a third comparison, people with no insurance whatsoever. No Medicaid, even. And when you look, there are studies in the literature--in fact numerous studies, study after study--that show in a variety of settings, whether it's heart disease, cancer, transplants, all kinds of things: people have better outcomes, better medical care, if you just take the people who are just as sick from each of those populations--private insurance, Medicaid, and no insurance whatsoever. Private insurance has far better outcomes than Medicaid. Even the same sickness of person. It has nothing to do with how sick somebody was when they started. And then, the even more alarming thing is it is very common in these studies--these are peer reviewed studies in the medical literature--that the people with Medicaid do worse than the patient with no insurance whatsoever. Russ: Now, I've got to stop you there, because here at EconTalk we often talk about how unreliable peer reviewed studies are. So, that's a plus, but there's always a lot of choices to be made in how you evaluate, etc.; and people have biases and axes to grind. I want to hear the underlying intuition of why somebody who is on Medicaid is going to get--first, I don't know why, I'd like to know why they'd get worse treatment than somebody who has got a luxurious, as it's often called, private insurance program. And than the person who has no insurance. What's going on in the patient level that would make that happen? Guest: What's going on at the patient level is that when the government--let's talk about Medicaid specifically. Medicaid is a type of insurance policy, just like any other insurance. And there are significant limits to what Medicaid will pay for in terms of diagnostics and treatments, therapies. And so when you restrict the options that doctors have, and in this case we assume that this is the cause because the patients are the same--we've already controlled, the studies have controlled for that. Russ: That's challenging, of course. That's hard to do. We have observable differences between them. Guest: No, not in these studies. Yeah, I mean in these studies, they've controlled for all the confounding medical risk factors. Russ: That they can measure. Guest: Yeah, all the things that can be measured. Russ: They don't have genetic code. There could be genetic differences between the two populations. Guest: You can hypothesize. But what is known in the standard way these things are done, these things are pretty rigorous. Russ: Well, the part I'm willing to concede is--that's why I asked before: x-stage lung cancer, at least a medical diagnosis that's constant across the groups. Guest: Yeah, they took medical diagnoses constant, but also other medical, what's called co-morbid conditions. Russ: Obesity, smoking. Guest: Diabetes. All these things they controlled for. Because it would be unfair to say: This person did worse after surgery, well it turned out they were diabetic. So, you have to control for all--medical, co-morbid conditions are very relevant here. Russ: No doubt. Guest: Once you've controlled for those things, you ask: Why would somebody with Medicaid do worse? It's because the treatment options are worse for the doctors and hospitals. They are restricted in what they are going to do. This is what's available. Now, why would it be better for no insurance? Because with no insurance at all, there are basically two or three things that happen for people with no insurance. They get medical care--they either get it by paying out of pocket or they get it by some other part of the system pays; or the third is it's done for free, literally for free, so-called charitable care. And in the instance of other forms of payment--actually there's something called disproportionate share payments that the Federal government gives to hospitals who treat patients who are indigent and have no insurance. There are ways that monies are shifted around to compensate. But in the end, though, the patients with no insurance have no restriction on what they are going to get once they are being taken care of. Then it simply--this is what we are going to do for this patient, whether we are going to get paid for it or not is a decision of how the person giving the care is going to have to make.| |27:33||Russ: So, we're sitting on the campus here of Stanford University. Are you saying that a Stanford professor who strolls in--not going to stroll, but who is being treated for lung cancer at Stanford hospital is going to get no better treatment than a homeless person who walks in and is diagnosed with the same condition? Guest: No. What I'm saying is that the group studies that have been published show that it's common, although not universally true, that people with Medicaid insurance do worse than people with no insurance. On any given individual, I'm not so sure that applies. And does everyone get the same care? I don't know how you would--I'm not sure that that would be a realistic statement. Russ: I'm just pressing you because I would love to know what Medicaid rules out that a private insurer supports. Guest: Well, I'll give you an example in general. Medicaid pays about 60% of things that private insurance pays for--60% of the rate. And so the fact of the matter is, money is important, as you as an economist know, a key incentive for what things get done. Health care costs money. Despite what people want to believe, health care is not free. Someone must pay. And things just don't happen for nothing. And so if Medicaid--and actually when you look at the data, which I happened to do yesterday, on the surveys on why doctors don't accept Medicaid patients, a huge percentage of doctors, more than half, do not even accept new Medicaid patients any more. When you ask of these 5 or 6 factors, why? Seventy percent of them say the number one factor is the reimbursement. They're not even going to take the patient, because they are losing money on every patient. Russ: And that's why we need to force them to take them and make the payment more generous, and that way we could all have the same great health care. Or better--or worse, depending on how ironic you want to be--we need to get rid of that private insurance, so we can all have the same quality. Which is often what you hear in defense of Canada. Guest: And this brings up something that I want to point out about the WHO ranking, to circle back, that first ranking, that big study, was that it turned out that equality was a better outcome for quality of care. Equal outcome in that country was higher as a ranking than disparate outcomes even if, even though all the outcomes were better. What I mean by that--it was poorly articulated--even if you had everybody gets A, or B, or C level care in country X, versus another country where everybody gets C level care, country X with As, Bs, and Cs was worse in the ranking than the country that got everybody a C. Russ: Because they decided to rank equality in and of itself. Guest: Equality was more important than quality.| |30:31||Russ: Let's talk about another example that I've been fascinated by because it's an example of where technology in recent years has been I think an incredible improvement in quality of life, and that's hip replacement, which you talk about in the book; and another example, not sure whether you talk about it: knee replacement, another example where older people lose, tremendous loss of mobility and an opportunity to play tennis, just walk or get around because their knees and hips give out. And now we have an explosion in the availability in the United States of those procedures. How does the United States compare to other countries in that sort of thing? Guest: In comparing the countries where more government control is exercised on access to that kind of treatment, national health service in the United Kingdom or Canada, the United States does better. The United States has far more not only access to these life-changing treatments like hip replacement, knee replacement, cataract surgery; but better outcomes. So, what happens is, it's not something that is measured in life expectancy; but it is certainly measurable in quality of life. Now, quality of life is difficult to measure. But when you look at the idea of being able to take care of day to day activities by being able to walk, or being able to see, in terms of cataract replacement--I think it's kind of obvious that you don't want to wait a year to get a cataract operation, even though you are going to live the same, it's better to get it sooner. Russ: Every day is good. Guest: There's no question. Russ: And how big are those differences? Guest: Those differences are huge. And what interesting is they are also economically related. And this is something else that people don't understand. Yes, it costs more money to get the hip replacement surgery, but on the other hand, the indirect costs of not getting it. Russ: It costs more in the United States than elsewhere, is what you are saying. Guest: No. What I'm saying is that getting the surgery versus not getting the surgery. Okay, you are adding costs by getting the surgery. Russ: Correct; it adds to our expenditure on health care. Good to save; you could have avoided it. Guest: But you are also saving money by not losing--let's just say for example that that person can't go to work for three months and needs assisted care. Or can't be productive. There are all kinds of indirect and direct economic losses and expenditures that relate to things. So, actually in many instances the use of so-called expensive technology actually saves money down the road. Indirectly. This has been neglected by a lot of the kind of low-hanging fruit economic studies of the costs of medical care. Russ: Arguing that some of these are wasteful expenditures that our system needs to get rid of, purge, and all that. One other example you give--you know, I've heard this before. You quantify it very dramatically: the time you have to wait to see a specialist for some kind of treatment. You hear horror stories sometimes about other systems; you don't know whether they are representative or not. You find dramatic--you cite dramatic differences in how long till procedures are implemented for people who need these treatments or want these treatments. And how long it takes to see a specialist. Guest: Right. Absolutely. And you look at places like--the best studied ones are Canada and the United Kingdom. But the countries all over Western Europe have these sorts of studies. Where, in the United Kingdom, for instance, they've put this law in place: they do not want anyone to wait more than 18 weeks for referral to a specialist. Okay, in the United States, that doesn't even exist. I mention something about getting a cardiovascular procedure, a minimally invasive treatment, say a balloon angioplasty, even in a non-emergency setting. It's considered unacceptable if it's more than a couple of days in the United States. We don't even consider these things in terms of weeks or months, like other countries do. And in fact these other countries have not only instituted rules to try to deal with these, what you might say are immoral waits for medical care, because of their public, so-called public systems; not only do they try to institute rules, but they also have had multiple lawsuits going to Supreme Court, and now have instituted privatization, all over the world. Countries that started out as more and more government control, what they call national single care systems, are using privatization to help compensate for their severe waiting lists. Russ: Yeah, Canada I know recently there was a court case in the last 5 years, right, that allowed people to purchase services from a doctor, which was illegal before. Correct? Guest: That's right. Russ: Hard to believe. Guest: And this is all over the world. You look at studies from Denmark, all over Western Europe, places that are really the models for our health care reform or from the people who want a single payer system here. But the reality is that the United States not only has the best outcomes, but we have by far the best access. And this has been a gross distortion not only in the press or in the media, but in movies and things like this that rely on anecdotes: the access to care is so much better in the United States. Given that it isn't perfect, given that we need to do everything we can to improve access for everyone, it's by far better in the United States than in these other countries. Russ: So, you are suggesting it's not just the rich people who don't have to wait for a specialist. Guest: Absolutely not. Russ: Do we have any data on waiting times in America? You said the average is lower than elsewhere? But what about different classes of people? We've been talking about that already--Medicaid, people without insurance? Low quality insurance? Guest: The big problem that is kind of analogous to waiting times in the United States is this idea that Medicaid patients now even have problems finding doctors who will take them. So, anywhere from 45-60% of doctors in the United States broadly will not accept new Medicaid patients. And lets just say only 5% of doctors or less than doctors do not accept new private insurance patience. So, there's a difference there. And this is a huge problem for Medicaid patients again stemming from what I said, that patients--doctors and hospitals--lose money on every patient. You can't make up for that in volume. As the old joke goes. But the other issue there is it points out the severe flaw in the logic of the increase in health care reform, which is to put 15-20 million more people into Medicaid. Not only is that a financially unsustainable system, but you are really not offering access to medical care if half of them or more are not even going to be able to get a doctor. Russ: Well, as Hayek said: The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to man how little they understand about what they imagine they can design. So, they will have to fix that; they'll figure that out, too. But maybe not.| |38:14||Russ: So let me challenge you. The book--you have other treatments of these data elsewhere that I hope we can get some of these charts up on the website. They are really quite striking in terms of painting a picture where the United States looks awfully good relative to the rest of the world. In cases where it doesn't look good, you argue, perhaps persuasively, that there are reasons, statistics or definition, that are misleading. When that isn't an issue, the United States dominates in terms of quality and often dramatically so. What did you ignore? What did you leave out? Are there other measures that critics of you paint a less cheerful picture? Guest: Well, you know, that's making me think quite a bit as I'm sitting here. I think the measures that people cite that paint the United States in a substandard or inferior quality, are really the measures that we've talked about. It's really just about life expectancy and infant mortality. And then there is a third measure, which has been cited, which I go into in the book, which we didn't talk about, is the number of uninsured. Russ: Right. Guest: Because this is really--I do a lot of international traveling, I read the newspapers and speak to people outside the United States, and it is portrayed as scandalous that we have 50 million or so Americans with no health insurance. Which I mentioned is equated with no health care. As if they're synonymous. Russ: As if they are out on the streets if something happens. Guest: But I think here, this is a measure that really has to be scrutinized. And I did in my book. This so-called 50 million uninsured--because when you look who is this population, the raw data, the documents, the U.S. Census Bureau documents, and others, you find out that it's not really 50 million people. After you say: Well, okay, about 10-15 million people are not U.S. citizens in that group--and I'm not saying they shouldn't get health care, but I'm not sure you are going to reform the U.S. health system to get non-citizens insured. Russ: Correct. That's going to be a challenge. Although not that group, but there are others who are illegal who do get health insurance. Guest: Who do have health insurance. Right. And then you take a look at who answered the U.S. Census Bureau survey and said they didn't have health insurance, and it turns out--let's just say, I don't remember the exact number, but about another 10 million or so that said they didn't have insurance that actually were using insurance. And we know that because the Census Bureau people went and looked, looked up and found medical records; these people had insurance that they were using, and mainly Medicaid. Russ: They didn't consider that insurance. Guest: They probably when they answered the question, they thought the question meant: Do you have private insurance? But, be that as it may, this is in one of the Appendices of the U.S. Census Bureau documents, Appendix C-- Russ: Good to know-- Guest: Is that they actually were aware--the U.S. Census Bureau were aware. But they didn't change the response to the question. And then there's another 13 million adults and children--of these 50 million people, 13 million who actually are already eligible for public insurance--Medicaid, a tiny bit Medicare, and the Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP or CHIP)--that simply did not sign the paperwork because they haven't accessed the system. So, they haven't used it. Common sense says you wouldn't want to redesign another system to make them eligible for that when they are already eligible for the current public health insurance system. So, you are left with a population of less than 5% of people in the United States who don't have insurance or who are not already eligible for current government insurance programs. I would not call that a crisis in the uninsured.| |42:37||Russ: So, we're going to come back to this at the end, because the fact that a big chunk of them are covered by the covered system or the current system serves them well--I'm sympathetic to the idea and I think you may be as well--we may not be happy with so-called Obamacare, but the alternative that it replaced, \"the current system right now\" if Obamacare is fully implemented, is not a great system either, on the expenditure side. So, we'll come back to that. One thing I want to mention, though. One of the criticisms you do hear of the U.S. health care system is that there are very disparate treatment outcomes depending on where you happen to be, which kind of doctor you happen to get. And there's a big push to use data and expertise to standardize health care treatment. Do you think there are lost opportunities within our decentralized, somewhat decentralized system--I love when people say: Well, we know health care markets don't work, look at the United States. Well, we don't have very free market health care right now; it's distorted in all kinds of ways. But some people criticize the result because of the somewhat disparate choices that doctors make and patients end up with. What do you think of that argument? So, we need a more standardized, top-down system? Guest: I think that there's--it makes me a little bit nervous, although intuitively I think it is true that we would like to make decisions based on data, and a lot of medicine is art rather than science, to a great extent. However, a). there are problems with the studies like the Dartmouth Atlas and different expenditures in different regions, particularly because many of these studies are just talking about the people who die. That's a distorting statistic, and you go back and look at their health care, that's a little bit different than talking about the way health care is given in general. But separating that side of things, when you start talking about standardizing care, I'm very nervous about that concept, because when you look at the countries who are standardizing, their outcomes are worse. And so, who is going to standardize this care? I personally don't think that health economists and government appointees are the people who should be standardizing my care. Guest: I don't want them involved at all. Russ: Don't you trust them? Come you. You said health economists. I know some people. I'm sure people are listening now and getting mad for a whole bunch of reasons, not only just this one. Guest: Tongue in cheek, of course. But I think everybody from politicians who push single payer to all the health economists I know, when they want medical care for themselves and their families, that they go and they seek out on their own the best specialist care, the best doctors, the best doctors that they can find. They want the freedom to choose. When you start having a top-down system, with so-called standardizing care, you have to realize that this is all in the context of medical care in the United States, particularly which is evolving very rapidly. Even today. It's not like it's mature now and so all the advances are done. No. And so when you look at what's happening with minimally invasive care, safer treatments, safer diagnoses--now we are in this era where there is a confluence of molecular biology and genetics, entering in medical care-- Russ: Potential customization of care is tremendous. Guest: Absolutely. Everything is changing very rapidly. By the time the government or any other body starts to standardize things, it's already old. If you think computers move quickly, you ought to look at the scientific literature on how medical care works. And so it's an intuitively attractive argument to say that things should be standardized. On the other hand, I haven't found a system with better outcomes that has standardized care. They are all worse. So, I'm not sure it's a direction to go. I would prefer to have a direction where the government gets out of the business of directing medical care. Where government isn't even the insurer at all. Where government helps people who can't afford insurance but doesn't dictate the care by virtue of being the insurer. And I think this is a huge problem with the way Medicaid and other outcomes are, the way things are right now. Facilitate competition, facilitate innovation, but get out of the way.| |47:24||Russ: We'll talk some more about that in a minute. But you mentioned the Dartmouth Study. Probably the most famous study that I know of on health care is the Rand Study, which purported to find that expenditure is not terribly important in outcomes. It just led to more spending. That there's enormous savings in the current system. Which I think--both left and right appear to justify their own views--but what do you think of the science of that, given that you are suggesting that the expenditure levels of the United States, which lead to earlier seeing of specialists, more access to technology for treatment of cancer, strokes, etc., knee replacements, MRIs. All these things, which are expensive--the Rand Study suggests that it is just feel-good, it doesn't matter for how your outcomes are. It just makes you feel better that you've done something. What do you think of that? Guest: Well, yeah. The Rand data to me shows something different. The Rand data to me shows that when you increase out of pocket expense, and people then make more of a value-based decision, because they are actually spending money-- Russ: They are on money. Guest: They are on money. Or certainly are aware of what things cost as opposed to the current system, where someone else is \"paying for everything\" and therefore it's free, in people's heads, even though it isn't. Russ: It's nice. It's very appealing. Guest: So, when people pay out of pocket, they make a decision to say: Okay, I'm not going to do it; I'm going to this, I'm going to make decisions; I'm going to save money. And their outcomes didn't get affected. Okay, so, you could say it indirectly shows that some of these expenses are not worth anything. It's probably true overall. There's certainly waste in the system, there's no question. But I think my view is that I would prefer to have people decide, with their doctor--of course, because they are going to need help with this--but in the end it's an individual decision for yourself and your family what you think is worth spending money on. I do not feel comfortable having the government say: Okay, this is not available because it costs too much money. That's a very different scenario, with two different ways of saying: We're not going to spend this much money. Russ: Of course, you know, the standard criticism of that view is that--let me say it a different way. I think one of the great benefits of our system, even though I don't like our current system, the current system which allows people to spend other people's money--is that most people don't have a lot of anxiety about how much money they spend. Turns out, it's an unsustainable system, I suspect. And you have a different kind of anxiety, instead of anxiety whether you can get the best treatment, you have unknown anxiety that you didn't get the best treatment because it didn't evolve and develop. You have to wait, which is an incredibly horrible thing when you are ill and your life is at risk. And of course people die. It's a terrible tragedy. So, what you are suggesting is you want people with their doctors and families made these decisions instead of the government; but not everybody is going to have that freedom. There are going to be poor people who can't afford the treatments. They choose not to, but it's a terrible choice to have to make, and they'll often make a choice that's the best for them, but they don't have good choices. Guest: Well, I think this is where, again, this is a problem with misinformation where people think that there is no alternative to reform other than the so-called Obamacare type of centralization. And in fact there is an alternative to reform. The first statement I want to make is that the real crisis in U.S. health care is the cost. Not the quality. And not the number of uninsured. And so Obamacare, the Affordability Care Act, does not address the cost. That's a fact by all estimates. Now, let's talk about how to address the cost to give people the choices. Because I agree with you: No one wants a system where people who are low income or poor people have really severe problems with access, do not have adequate choices for the quality of care that is available. Given that there is no guarantee that anything is ever equal in the real world, but the reforms to bring the costs down and to increase the choices for people--including poor people--are what we should be talking about. Russ: What would some of those be? Guest: Some of those are the following. I mean, I think there's reforms for private health care as well as government programs, as well as the tax treatment. There's three basic categories of reform. The private reforms are to get rid of the artificial barriers to competition that exist right now in the system. People say: Oh, yes, we know, like you mentioned, the free market doesn't work. Well, the free market doesn't really exist. It's never really been tried. And so these bizarre barriers that are archaic including being unable to buy health insurance outside of your own state--this is a huge and really absurd setup to protect the status quo and really special interest groups in this kind of paternalistic view that people have to be protected. People in New Jersey can't buy insurance from people in Pennsylvania even though it's right next door. And there might be a significant difference in the price. Another problem with private insurance and the cost of insurance I'm talking about-- Russ: Which ends up affecting health care prices-- Guest: Absolutely. Is that the states have put in these mandated coverages, to the tune of 2000 of them in the United States. And it's certainly true that many people are forced to buy insurance that covers things they do not have any possibility of using. For instance, in vitro fertilization. Acupuncture. Massage therapy. Wigs. There are all kinds of things that are mandated that everyone in that state must buy insurance that covers things that they don't want. And what is the effect of that? The effect of these mandates is that by some estimates at least 50% or more of the cost of insurance is due to these mandated coverages that have been built up over the years and are similar to the principle that is in the Affordability Care Act, which is defining minimal essential benefits packages. Instead, people should be able to buy insurance, like catastrophic insurance, that is much cheaper and have these Health Savings Accounts, for instance, to use for small expenses. And then some of the other reforms include reforming the public system. Let people have choices, including poor people. Let people take money that was going to go for Medicaid insurance and use that money to shop around for private insurance, including deductible claims that are cheaper, with Health Savings Accounts. Let's see when insurers, as is true for every other good and service in the United States, historically--when people have a market to compete for, when companies have markets to compete for, there's competition on price and value. And you end up creating a market that is very competitive. And eventually prices come down. If people want to buy something that's cheaper, it will eventually be there. And the same thing has happened, for instance, with computers. People say: Well, I couldn't possibly shop around for medical care or insurance; I don't understand it. Russ: It's too complicated. Guest: Not many people understand literally how a computer works. I think that's a very difficult concept to explain to somebody. But we're doing a pretty good job of shopping for computers. And so, the public systems need some significant reforms: More flexibility, more choice, and more competition--prices come down.| |55:47||Guest: And then there's other things in that kind of realm, and that is to increase transparency of information. Medical care must be one of the only, if not the only, good or service we buy and use without knowing what it costs until later. Russ: Or ever. Guest: Or ever. We can never decipher what it costs. And so these are things that are kind of this veil of secrecy, I call it, around the price of medical care which allows doctors and hospitals this kind of blanket of protection of what the price is. Let's see when the University of California, Stanford, (UCSF) and neighboring medical centers must put out their prices, let's see what happens to those prices. I guarantee you they come down, just on the basis of transparency of information. And then the third category of reform, really the big category, is tax reform. Because the way the current system is, you are encouraged to spend more money on health care. And by that I mean health insurance and health care. It's endless how much you can deduct from your income on the basis of how much you, what your employer provides. Russ: It's treated as a tax-free benefit. Guest: It's treated as a tax-free benefit. Which is kind of a historical accident, for lack of a better word. And there's no reason that the value of a dollar for health care should be higher than the value of a dollar spent for something else. The system right now encourages more money, encourages health care prices, and is a massive financial burden to the system. Russ: So, it encourages compensation to be given in the tax-free reform rather than the taxable form, and so you would rather have tax-free health care than pay for it out of pocket. But once it's tax free, we want a good one, because it's relatively cheap. Guest: Right. Russ: Do we have estimates on how much that contributes to the cost of insurance? Guest: The cost of insurance per person, I don't know. But we lose hundreds of billions of dollars because of this tax exclusion. That's known. And when you decrease that--there are various ways to deal with that. But basically what I think the important point is: This idea tries to inject some kind of cost consciousness into people. Kind of a value-based decision should be made with everything that money is spent for. Because like we know, but fail to kind of admit as a public, is that health care is not free. It is not going to become free. And I'm not sure that there is any right to health care that is more important, say, than having the right to own a home or clothes or food. I'm not 100% sure why health care is so special, given all these other essential things. Russ: Well, it is a primal part of us. Robin Hanson argued on this program a long time ago that a lot of what we do in health care, a very creative argument, is window dressing. That we get benefit from because we convince each other that we care about from. I'm a skeptic about the theory, but it's a provocative theory, an interesting idea. And there's no doubt that you earlier criticized the World Health Organization rankings--I think correctly criticized them--that equality is a value in and of itself. But there is something emotionally troubling about somebody getting access to a cure, to dialysis, or to a transplant on the basis of income. I think it bothers a lot of people. Whether it should or it shouldn't, what are the long-run benefits of that because of innovation or profits would make up for it--I think psychologically and emotionally there is this tremendous bias in our political system. Guest: And I'm not opposed to that. And I think the answer is to allow people that have less money more choice, more flexibility; and increase, facilitate the competitive forces that will bring the costs down so people can get better access to care. There is no reason why people that are poor have to suffer through the outcomes that their Medicaid insurance gives them. There is no government official that would opt for Medicare. I can guarantee you that. It's inadequate. And it's really kind of an immoral thing to push people into that system when we know the system is a failure. The system of Medicaid insurance, I'm talking about. So, yes, it's true. The question is how to go about improving the system. And I don't think the answer is in the Affordability Care Act, which essentially dumbs down the specialty care and the excellence and the outcomes that we have in the United States in this so-called guise of \"fairness.\" I think that it's a flawed model that will turn back the clock on the medical innovation that has led to the United States having such superior "}
