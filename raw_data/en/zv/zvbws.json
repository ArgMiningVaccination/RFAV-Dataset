There are mantras for everything; here a few practical uses for you to try. Everything in creation is, at its most refined level, sound or vibration. Every tree, every flower, every part of your body has its own unique vibration. Even the qualities you express in your life such as happiness, joy, abundance, and love are vibrations. When you are healthy, happy, and vibrant, these vibrations are harmonizing with each other like a magnificent cosmic symphony. However, if the vibration of any area becomes distorted, the harmony breaks down, leading to a lack of wholeness and some discomfort in your life. Many forms of healing are based on knowing the correct sound or vibration and reintroducing it into that area, whereby you can restore the balance, harmony, and comfort once again. Nature itself is full of sounds\u2014birds singing, the wind blowing through the trees, waves breaking on the beach, innocent children laughing, and so many more. Unfortunately, for much of our time nowadays, we separate ourselves from nature. When you [spend time in nature](http://www.chopra.com/articles/7-reasons-to-spend-mindful-time-in-nature), listening to these sounds, your physiology becomes harmonized with the rhythms and flow of nature. All traditions of the world have used [sound for healing](https://chopra.com/articles/healing-with-sound-tune-up-to-find-inner-harmony), whether the beating of a drum, a bell, a gong, or a sacred chant. The ancient Vedic Tradition of India has taken this a step further, exploring and refining the use of sound over thousands of years to formulate it into the Vedic Science of Mantras. [Mantras](http://www.chopra.com/articles/what-is-a-mantra) are specific sounds or vibrations whose effects are known. When either chanted aloud or repeated silently, they can create a desired effect in any area of your physiology or life\u2014for healing, transformation, and inner awakening. This is, of course, a vast subject and there are mantras for everything from curing snakebites to spiritual awakening. It would take a whole lifetime to master this wisdom; however, we'll discuss a few of the more practical uses here. Japa means the repetition of a mantra so it encompasses all uses of mantras. However, Japa is most commonly associated with a fixed number of repetitions of a mantra. Usually a string of beads, [known as a Mala](http://www.chopra.com/articles/diy-malas-how-to-make-a-meditation-mala-necklace), with a set number of beads would be used to keep count\u2014one repetition per bead. Traditionally, most Malas have 108 \"counter\" beads and a \"guru\" bead used to indicate where to begin and end. Sometimes shorter malas with 54 or 27 beads can be used with longer mantras. Using the Mala will often involve making a commitment. Let's say you have a particular obstacle in your life. Knowing the mantra to help harmonize that situation, you might choose to repeat it 108 times (one Mala) for the next 30 days. There are literally thousands of deities in the Eastern traditions, each associated with a different attribute and each having its own mantra, which invokes that attribute. For a Hindu, repeating one of these mantras would be a form of worshipping that deity. However, for those not so religiously inclined, the deities and their attributes should be viewed in their subtler context, as archetypal energies. These energies are all within you, either dormant or in a state of imbalance or balance. When they are dormant, you may experience a lack in that area; when out of balance, you may experience some disruption; and when in balance, you may enjoy harmony and fulfillment. By repeating one of these mantras, you can activate and harmonize its effects in all areas of your life. A simple deity mantra is: As we've discussed, everything is sound and any discomfort or disease is a distortion of the sound in some area of the body. Reintroducing the correct sound helps to restore the harmony in that area. Healing mantras are normally repeated with the attention in the area of discomfort\u2014or, you could say, directing the vibration to where it is needed. There are some powerful healing mantras, which are best learned from a qualified teacher; however, here are some of the simpler ones: The vowels sounds can also be used for healing. These are non-local, meaning you can chant one of them and direct its vibration wherever you choose. Consciousness is transforming into matter at every point in the Universe, but is more lively in certain places. On the earth, we call these energy centers a vortex; in the body, we call them chakras. [Chakras](http://www.chopra.com/articles/what-is-a-chakra) aren't physical, but you can imagine the main seven in the body located along the spine. Each reflects different qualities in your life. For most people, their chakras are blocked or stuck, diminishing the flow of energy supporting those particular qualities or over-emphasizing them. By putting your attention in the area of each chakra and chanting the mantra associated with it, you can begin to enliven the chakra and release its qualities in your life. There are several different sets of mantras for the chakras, the following set is for general everyday use. It's important to do the whole set rather than just focusing on one or two. Starting with the lowest (first) chakra, bring your attention to that area of the body and repeat the sound 1 to 3 times aloud or silently. |Chakra||Location||Association||Mantra| following are mantras that could be used at any time to enliven the qualities contained within their vibration. Enlightenment is a state of balance, harmony, and self-awareness on all levels. Therefore, all mantras indirectly support this spiritual goal. However, the Gayatri Mantra, being the \"Mother\" of the wisdom of the entire creation, gives you the direct path to Enlightenment. Traditionally, it is chanted at times of transition during the day\u2014sunrise, noon, and sunset\u2014but it can also be chanted at any convenient time. It is best chanted a minimum of three times each session. OM BHUR BHUVAH Pra-cho-da-yaat) The mantras already mentioned are intended to create or support something on the active level of life, and as such, they have meanings and/or intentions associated with them. Meditation mantras have no particular meanings or specific intentions. Their role is simply to take the awareness from activity to the inner realm of silence and infinite possibilities. These mantras re-connect you to your most fundamental level of Being and allow you to begin to restore the memory of these qualities in all areas of your life. There is a more general mantra that can be used by anyone, somewhat for this same purpose. This mantra is SO HUM. It is usually used in conjunction with the breath. As I said, this is a vast subject but I hope this has given you glimpse into this fascinating science. *Editor's Note: The information in this article is intended for your educational use only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
