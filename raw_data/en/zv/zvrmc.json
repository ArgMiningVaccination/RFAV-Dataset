[Sleep supplements](https://www.chiroeco.com/natural-sleep-supplements-vs-prescription/) are on the rise as work demands and general anxiety are keeping many Americans awake, especially during the difficult pandemic in 2020 stretching into this year. [Brain supplements](https://www.chiroeco.com/best-brain-supplements-for-adults/) are in demand for patients who want to stay their sharpest, and heart health supplements for seniors who want to stave off heart disease, the leading cause of death for men, women, and people of most racial and ethnic groups in the United States.1 THEN THERE'S THE GUT BIOME, WHERE NEW RESEARCH SEEMINGLY EVERY MONTH CONNECTS IT TO ANOTHER CRUCIAL BODILY FUNCTION, and the ever-present diet supplements market and weight issue in the U.S., where more than two of every three people are either overweight or obese.2 Supplements chiropractors take Even if as a chiropractor you do not counsel patients on nutrition or sell supplements, supplements likely play a role in your personal life. Chiropractic Economics spoke to a number of chiropractors and nutrition/supplement industry veterans regarding what they take the first thing when they wake up, or throughout the day. We'll examine some current and projected supplement trends and look at what some DCs and nutrition/supplement industry veterans take personally, and why.

Daily Supplements: - General multivitamin - Vitamin D - Trace minerals - Fish oil - Cardiovascular support - Adrenal support - Probiotic - Endocrine and cellular support Comments: \"I take whole-food based supplements daily to support my nutritional needs. I think it is very important to eat a balanced diet, while staying away from processed foods. It's also important to detoxify and cleanse at least once per year. I try to make it a twice-a-year routine. The short time it takes to refocus our bodies and minds on how we should be eating daily is so critical. At this time, I find it crucial to make sure my immune system is supported in addition to my regular routine. It is important as well to be getting plenty of rest, exercise daily, reduce stress, drink lots of water and eat healthy organic food.\" The survey says: patients are afraid to ask Persona, a Nestl\u00e9 Health Science company that creates personalized vitamin programs, late last year released the results of a national online survey regarding multivitamin knowledge and use, finding that only 7% of respondents had asked a health professional for supplemental guidance. Out of the 1,000 surveyed, 70% of the respondents 35 years or older took a vitamin or supplement, with 47% indicating during the COVID-19 pandemic that they felt a daily multivitamin was more important to their general health than just one year ago. Some of the most common reasons provided for taking a multivitamin were: - increased energy (44%) - healthy weight maintenance (26%) - better sleep (24%) - healthier level of stress (24%) - hormone level maintenance (12%) Of those surveyed, 94% under the age of 54 had trouble identifying the myths and facts associated with multivitamins. Also, two out of three respondents didn't realize that some wellness and heart health supplements can potentially interfere with prescription medications.

Panelists noted that health care \"has been quite sterile\" while \"wellness has become the cool kid on the block,\" but that the future would be a convergence of the two. They argued that, \"new integrations will give health care the pleasurable, aspirational qualities of wellness while wellness will increasingly get the science-backed credibility of the medical industry \u2014 and the players and brands that execute on this (and it's already happening) will 'win big.'\" Strengthening the immune system Strengthening the immune system has already become a wellness trend, \"across the board, from food, to supplements, to educational classes. We will see more customized immunity hacks, using genetic testing and biohacking ... to pinpoint what immune therapies best suit your system and situation.\" Personalized medicine will include a \"much bigger focus on gut health and our microbiome as it pertains to immunity and brain function.\" Health care providers will target patients' \"immunity gaps\" to shore up their immunity defenses, according to the Global Wellness Summit's wellness trends report. Early in the pandemic last year, sales of immunity products grew more than 200%, with vitamin sales increasing 77%.4 With this insight, DCs are seeing an opportunity to provide patients with the wellness and [heart health](https://www.chiroeco.com/guard-your-heart/) supplements they are already buying elsewhere, and to jump on the shifting trend within the nutritional supplement sector as patients look with a new urgency at getting and staying healthy.
