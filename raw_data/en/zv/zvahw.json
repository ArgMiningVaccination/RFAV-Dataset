While we eat every day, it is natural for some food and waste to accumulate inside our digestive system, including the colon. However, this accumulation can turn toxic in the long run. Hence, you must be aware of the ways to cleanse your colon from time to time. This process may help detoxify your body, improve your digestive health, and boost naturally-occurring digestive enzymes, and aid in better nutrient absorption. The process of colon cleansing is also known as colon therapy or hydrotherapy. It involves flushing liquids into the colon to wash off the toxic waste deposits. However, you also can carry out this process naturally. As an alternative to hydrotherapy or the typical colon cleansing procedure, you can use certain natural ingredients to flush toxins out of your system. While most of these may seem effective, their efficacy is only based on anecdotal evidence. Hence, caution and medical supervision are advised while employing these colon cleansing methods. Read on to know more. In This Article What Is A Natural Colon Cleanse And How Does It Work? A natural colon cleanse method is an effective way to detoxify the body. It aims to naturally remove any accumulated feces from your colon and intestinal tract. Colon cleansing is also referred to as colon therapy. There are three ways you can cleanse your colon: - Take Supplements: You may take them orally or via the rectum to help your colon expel its contents. Colon cleansing supplements are easily available in supermarkets, pharmacies, and other drugstores. - Colon Irrigation: It is a process in which colon hydrotherapists pump gallons of water via a small tube inserted into the rectum. - Self-Administered Coffee Enemasi [X]Injections of fluid given through the rectum to cleanse or stimulate the emptying of the bowels and treat constipation. : This is an alternative therapy for colon cleansing. However, ensure you consult a naturopathic practitioner before implementing this method. You can also try colon cleansing herbs that you can add to your food and drinks. Or try colon cleansing pills and powder recommended by your doctor. Any of these methods can be effective in cleansing your colon. However, studies supporting these practices are limited. But a natural colon cleanse could have certain benefits. What Are The Benefits Of A Natural Colon Cleanse? A natural colon cleanse is believed to help expel undigested substances from your body. Cleansing your colon enhances your vitality by: - Helping you lose weight - Improving your overall mental and physical health - Improving the functioning of your immune system - Reducing your risk of developing colon cancer A [study](https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures-2020-2022.pdf) revealed that as of January 1, 2019, there were 776,120 men and 768,650 women in the US with a history of colorectal cancer (CRC). Among them, 35% were diagnosed within the past 5 years, with over 56% aged 65-84 years. Lifetime risk for CRC is approximately 4.4% for men (1 in 23) and 4.1% for women (1 in 25). Despite higher incidence rates in men, lifetime risk is similar due to women's longer life expectancy. Age and race/ethnicity are also influential factors in CRC risk. Medical Treatment Options Conventional colon therapy involves cleansing the colon using water or laxatives. Colon hydrotherapy uses water to remove the contents of the colon ( [1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1463-1318.2009.01837.x)). Other methods employed are barium enema, intravenous pyelographyi [X]An X-ray exam or an imaging test used to look at kidneys, ureters, and the bladder to diagnose any kidney problems. , etc., especially in the preparation for intestinal surgery ( [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2672787)). There is no scientific backing for the effectiveness of these methods. Frequent colon therapy is also suspected to have serious consequences, including dehydration and the inability to defecate naturally. Hence, exercise caution and do not overdo it. We will now explore a few natural ways to cleanse your colon. Home Remedies For Colon Cleansing 1.

This is due to the presence of a compound called hydroxycitric acid (HCA). Garcinia Cambogia not only helps flush out all the toxins from your body but may also help control body weight and treat inflammation and glucose tolerance ( [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25859449)), ( [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3010674/)).

This may aid your weight loss efforts. Additionally, apples may also prevent and inhibit the growth of colon cancer cells ( [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC442131/)), ( [7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19476292)).

The nutrient is also a natural antioxidant that protects your body from free radical damage ( [9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4768935/)). As per a study, a [lemon detox diet](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/the-lemonade-detox-diet-a-simple-recipe-for-weight-loss/) (predominantly involving lemon juice) could also reduce body fat ( [10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25912765)).

Yogurt is also a rich source of antioxidants ( [12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22032353)). Daily consumption of yogurt helps in maintaining the level of probiotics in your body, which, in turn, could help in colon cleanse (although direct research in this aspect is lacking).

The antibiotic property of apple cider vinegar is due to the presence of bacteria called acetobacter that aid digestion and the proper functioning of your gut. The acidic nature of apple cider vinegar adds to the acid in your stomach, eliminates toxins, and could help you lose weight ( [14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19661687)).

You've probably heard of it for treating the nausea of seasickness or car sickness. Ginger also promotes colon health and aids digestion. It may also play a role in cleansing your colon, though more research is needed to understand the mechanism ( [20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24615565)), ( [21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3665023/)).

Large amounts can drastically alter the pH levels and lead to fatal effects. 13. Coconut Oil Coconut oil contains medium-chain fatty acids (like lauric acid), which impart powerful antioxidant properties. These fatty acids can help improve antioxidant status and prevent lipid oxidation ( [30](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23892389)), ( [31](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4283167/)).

Frequently Asked Questions What is the fastest way to cleanse your colon? [Sarah Robbins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drsarahrobbins/?originalSubdomain=ca), MD, MSc, FRCPC, says, \"The colon naturally cleanses itself through a series of contractions influenced by the nervous system of the gut and a variety of hormones.\" How long does it take to completely clean out your colon? Sarah says, \"The colon normally clears itself out completely every 30-40 hours, although it may be normal for this to take up to 72 hours for some individuals. A wide variety of factors influence how quickly the colon empties (colon transit) including diet and dietary fiber, fluid intake, medications, exercise, and even hormonal imbalances.\" How many pounds of feces can the colon hold? Sarah says, \"The amount of stool in the colon will be influenced significantly by the amount of dietary fiber that you consume. More fiber will increase the bulk and form of the stools, and there are a lot of health benefits to dietary fiber, including supporting a healthy gut microbiome.\" Is colon cleansing really necessary? Colon cleansing isn't actually necessary for healthy individuals. That is because your body is already designed to expel waste and toxins naturally without any external intervention. However, if your diet and lifestyle have caused you to have limited bowel movements or you know you need detoxification, you can try cleansing your colon. How is a laxative different from a natural colon cleanse? A laxative is used to gain quick relief from constipation and mainly to restore an individual's bowel movements. Colon cleansing powders, pills, and ingredients act similar to natural laxatives, but over a long period, say 10 days. Also, colon cleansing flushes the entire digestive system while laxativesi [X]A class of drugs with chemicals that help treat constipation by increasing stool mobility, bulk, and frequency. cleanse only the colon. How much weight can I lose following a colon cleanse? On an average, colon cleansing has helped individuals lose weight up to 1.2 kg. However, the results may vary for different individuals. Also, there is no research stating that this type of weight loss attempt is healthy. So we do not recommend it. How frequently should we clean our colon? Colon cleanses can be done once every month for 6 months, and then once every four months. However, instead of doing a colon cleanse, you can follow a healthy diet rich in fiber and fluids to enhance your overall health. What happens if you don't clean your colon? You may experience persistent digestive issues such as bloating, excessive gas, diarrhea and constipation if your colon is not clean or there is a buildup of bad bacteria in your colon. However, the body is sufficiently equipped to clean out the colon regularly on its own, so a colon cleanse may not be necessary for every individual. Does a colon cleanse hurt? No, a colon cleanse done properly should not hurt. You may experience mild cramps or pressure in your abdominal region, similar to how you feel before/during pooping. Is coffee good for your colon? Yes. According to research, consuming moderate amounts of coffee each day can significantly lower your chances of developing colon cancer ( [38](https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article/25/4/634/70984/Coffee-Consumption-and-the-Risk-of-Colorectal)). However, coffee enemas for a colon cleanse may be dangerous and are not recommended by healthcare professionals. What fruits cleanse your colon? Pineapples, papaya, apples, berries, and lemons are fruits that provide plenty of fiber and antioxidants, which can keep the colon clean and healthy ( [39](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5394516/)).
