Please click here for our next healthcare practitioner retreat, August 4 - 11, 2019.**](https://soltara.co/healthcare-practitioner-retreat/) ... An Educational Workshop for Healthcare Practitioners with Dr. Joe Tafur, MD, & Bia Labate, Ph.D. ... As psychedelic medicines make their way through clinical trials and into our modern healthcare system, there is a growing need for medical professionals to understand these medicines in order to best serve their patients. While most allopathic medicine does not require the doctor to have direct experience with the medicines they are prescribing, traditionally this has not been the case for psychedelic and plant medicines. From a cultural and traditional perspective, it is extremely valuable - if not imperative - that those who guide others through a psychedelic or plant medicine journey have an experiential understanding of the way in which these medicines work. At Soltara, we believe it is important for medical professionals interested in the field of psychedelic psychotherapy to experience these medicines in a shamanic setting, one with deep ancestral roots that allows for each individual to undergo their own personal process. At the same time, we aim to create a space for informed discussion with like-minded professionals about the future of psychedelic psychotherapy, and the development of the practitioner to work within and around altered states of consciousness. For this reason, Dr. Joe Tafur and Bia Labate, Ph.D., long-time luminaries in the field of plant medicines (read more below), are pleased to offer an opportunity for healthcare professionals to train, learn, and connect in an experiential, community-oriented, and ceremonial way with ayahuasca plant medicine. The goal of this workshop is to help inform and advance their practice, both now and in the future when these medicines become more widely available to their patients. . Some questions we will address include... . - Does the psychedelic therapist have to drink/ingest or not the substance s/he is giving? (Noting that this is a fundamental epistemological difference between ayahuasca shamanism and psychedelic therapy, as no shaman or guide would ever be considered legitimate without consuming the substance himself) - What is the role of set and setting? (Noting that current practice defines set as things like \"incense\", \"flowers\", \"nice music,\" without necessarily addressing the general broader cultural context, which includes certain cosmology/views on what these substances are, etc.) - What is the difference between spiritual emergency and pathological mental health breaks? - As psychedelics are medicalized, how do we incorporate/dialogue with tradition and the sacred? - What can ayahuasca shamanism teach to psychedelic therapists? ... Who is this workshop for? We invite all healthcare practitioners interested in the field of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy to apply for this unique opportunity. Come and experience what it's like to undergo an immersive healing process in the context of the deeply rooted traditions of the Shipibo people on the jungle-laden shores of Costa Rica. Throughout the week, Bia and Joe will facilitate group discussions centered around topics of interest as the field develops, with the aim of promoting dialogue and advancing discourse around critical and relevant issues to current and/or future psychedelic therapists. ...
