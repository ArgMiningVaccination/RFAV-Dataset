Current lifetime medical costs for HIV-infected patients exceed $100,000, and increasing as new drugs are added to treatment regimens extending life. After the discovery in the mid-1980s of HIV and methods to grow it in the laboratory, a vaccine was expected within a few years. Yet now a decade later, the first generation of candidate AIDS vaccines are in limbo while arguments rage whether or not to test them for efficacy in field trials in the population. To understand the debate, it helps to recall the struggle to conquer polio, and its heroes who were two of the greatest rivals in the history of medicine: Jonas Salk and Albert B. Sabin. Their competing vaccine designs and distinct personal and professional styles explain the clash of egos they sustained until their recent deaths. But on another level, their rivalry illustrated the differing approach between empirical public health practice and theoretical science which remains today an impediment in developing a vaccine for AIDS. In the early 1950s, epidemics of polio were sweeping the U.S. and each year killing two to five thousand victims and crippling 20 to 50 thousand more. Virtually all polio research at that time, including Salk's and Sabin's work, was funded by the remarkable March of Dimes 11i 11 IIIIIIIIIIII II IllIll II IIIII 5571095.0492.017 [Page 2](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0492.017/2) p. 2 campaign of the independent, private National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis. Created by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the foundation was driven by the goal to stop the epidemic as soon as possible, led by its accept-no-noes-for-answers director and FDR's former law partner, Basil O'Connor. By 1949, virologists supported by the March of Dimes had cultivated the polio virus in test tubes without using allergy-producing nervous system cells, a critical step necessary to make a vaccine. Acting on the discovery, and outside of the formal task assigned him by the March of Dimes, Jonas Salk began quietly to develop a \"killed\" polio vaccine by applying existing techniques of virus inactivation used in influenza vaccine. But Albert B. Sabin -- one of the most brilliant scientists of his generation -- and many establishment [ Dlete BSTALISiM NT word? S ubstie aioter ajecie? virologists at the time were absolutely certain that successful vaccines for viral diseases required living but weakened virus strains, and Sabin's would not be ready for years. They opposed Salk's vaccine strategy for lacking sufficient basis in science, and were upset by O'Connor's adoption of it and his encouragement of Salk to use the press to promote and defend it before the public. Sabin argued publically and maneuvered to try to stop field trials of the Salk vaccine. Fortunately, O'Connor was not dissuaded by the skepticism, and accepted alternative advice to proceed. His March of Dimes organization put the Salk vaccine to the test among more than half a million children just in time for the summer polio \"season\" of 1954. An independent [Page 3](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0492.017/3) p. 3 evaluation team carefully compared the subsequent incidence of paralysis among the children who had received the vaccine with those who had received placebo shots. In the meantime, the Foundation committed to widespread public distribution of the vaccine even if it turned out to be only 25% effective. Finally, on April 12, 1955, the results were broadcast to an expectant world: \"It Works!\" Paralysis was 70% to 90% rarer among vaccine recipients. As it turned out, Dr. Sabin's \"live\" oral polio vaccine -- remembered by the sugar cube which often contained it -- would not become available until the early 1960s. The introduction a half-decade earlier of Dr. Salk's vaccine saved tens of thousands of lives and prevented hundreds of thousands of lifelong disabilities which would otherwise have occurred if the field trial had been blocked. In the face of an epidemic, risks must often be taken to protect the public health: The costs in time and money and the damage to reputation and prestige if the vaccine did not work were outweighed by the potential benefits. Despite their perseverance and courage to achieve this great success, neither Salk nor the March of Dimes were ever recognized by the theoretical \"basic\" or \"pure\" scientists who select for the Nobel award in Physiology or Medicine. They were dismissed as mere technicians who applied the discoveries of others. Yet what is the meaning of \"Medicine\", if not to apply science to prevent or relieve human suffering? The current impasse over AIDS vaccines reflects the tension between two schools of thought -- the empiricists and the theorists -- whose arguments parallel those of Salk and Sabin. The debate came to a head in [Page 4](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0492.017/4) p. 4 June 1994 when the National Institutes of Health (NIH) overruled its own vaccine advisory group and halted plans to conduct U.S. field trials of candidate HIV vaccines. These trials might have cost some $20 million over three to five years. The products had completed over eight years of required animal and human research to determine their safety and immune response, representing enormous investments of private capital and prior federal subsidies from NIH. Among the scientists assembled to ratify the NIH decision, the theorists -- AIDS researchers of whom most have no background developing vaccines for other diseases -- outnumbered the empiricists -- many of whom are experienced vaccinologists. The theorists cited ambiguous test tube and animal study evidence which could not prove that these existing vaccine products would work. They called for returning \"back to basics\" to gather more scientific knowledge on how HIV interacts with the human immune system so as to be able someday to \"rationally engineer\" a vaccine, rather than finding out whether what is now available would work. They felt newer vaccine design strategies now on the drawing boards would have greater chances of success. But insistence on scientific certainty in \"hitting a home run,\" before even stepping up to bat in trials of the first AIDS vaccines, is to ignore 200 years of vaccinology. Overcaution disguises irresponsibility in developing tools to control an epidemic. The empiricists point out that vaccine development is inherently a trial-and-error process, since for most diseases the precise mechanisms that produce artificial immunity remain unknown. Edward Jenner developed smallpox vaccine in the 18th century with no knowledge of germ theory nor immunology, just the hypothesis that the prettiness of milkmaids who were [Page 5](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0492.017/5) p. 5 unscarred by smallpox resulted from the cowpox lesions on their hands. A century later, Louis Pasteur did not understand how his rabies vaccine worked. Even field trials which show no efficacy at all are a normal part of the vaccine development process. In the early 1980s, the first generation of Hemophilus meningitis vaccines did not protect children enrolled in large trials. But the lack of success stimulated revisions to the design which ultimately proved effective. Hemophilus vaccines were finally licensed in the early 1990s and have nearly eliminated the 10 to 15 thousand cases of devastating infant meningitis which used to occur each year in the U.S. Predicting AIDS vaccine success or failure in humans is a speculative exercise: There exist no validated test-tube assays of human blood nor laboratory animal homologies which can tell us with certainty whether they will work in people. As with pioneering trials for earlier vaccines, including polio, the ultimate worth of AIDS vaccines can only be determined empirically by seeing if humans who receive them experience reduced occurrence of disease. A vaccine of only partial efficacy in preventing HIV infection, in forestalling AIDS, or in reducing contagiousness -- a \"single to first base\" -- would be a major tool in slowing an epidemic in which some 40,000 Americans and millions worldwide are becoming newly-infected with HIV each year. It also could reveal the holy grail of HIV research: the changes in blood tests following vaccination which would predict protection from HIV or AIDS or reduced transmissibility to others. Such information would [Page 6](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0492.017/6) p. 6 greatly speed up the design and improvement of later generations of vaccines. Given the years it takes to develop a product ready for field trials, there will always be newer vaccine ideas on the drawing boards which appear more likely to succeed based on the additional scientific knowledge acquired in the interim. But as we learned from the Salk-Sabin rivalry, we should not let a better AIDS vaccine of the future be the enemy of a potentially life-saving one available years earlier. Drugs and vaccines are produced by private entities, not governments, although the latter support the basic science knowledge upon which such products are based. Unlike the development of drugs to treat patients with disease, however, preventive vaccines face great economic and other disincentives. Few companies are willing to risk investment in vaccines, producing a relative \"market failure\" which requires governmental or charitable support to overcome. Many public health practitioners and vaccinologists are dismayed by the NIH moratorium on federal funding for vaccine trials, but few are willing openly to criticize the institution which funds our biomedical establishment with $1.4 billion annually for AIDS research, including $125 million designated for \"HIV vaccine\" studies. One modern-day Jonas Salk who is willing to speak out to promote his vaccine is Donald Francis, who led successful field trials of hepatitis B vaccine in the late 1970s for CDC, and was an early AIDS researcher at the federal disease control agency. [Page 7](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0492.017/7) p. 7 Francis is a folk hero in the history of AIDS: His unheeded calls for safer blood collection practices early in the epidemic would have protected many transfusion recipients from avoidable infections. He now works for Genentech, a leading biotechnology firm whose HIV vaccine has protected chimpanzees from HIV and is ready for human field trials. Francis complains the NIH moratorium reflected avoidance of political risk and was tainted by conflict of interest: Some AIDS activists and scientists worry that large vaccine trials would divert NIH resources from finding drugs to cure existing infections and from grants which support their laboratories and clinics. Politics aside, the halt in field trials sent shock-waves through the biotechnology-pharmaceutical industry, on whom we depend for vaccine development. The decision signaled government would abandon the few companies investing in HIV vaccines at the final phase of testing, just when federal involvement is critical for mobilizing community support, recruiting volunteers, and sharing the financial risk of an uncertain product. Some firms like Repligen/Merck and Biogen soon abandoned their HIV vaccine projects; others like Genentech, Biocine, and Therion Biologics have scaled back their pace of investment and research. NIH is the world's premier biomedical research agency and a great national asset. But its principal mission, institutional culture, and administrative procedures are to foster scientific knowledge, not to develop products like vaccines. It has no high official whose only job responsibility is to produce an AIDS vaccine as soon as possible and who has the contracting authority and budgetary resources to do so. [Page 8](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0492.017/8) p. 8 When HIV became cultivable a decade ago the systematic thing to try first would have been to apply established technology for a killed wholevirus vaccine for AIDS -- as used in the modern version of Salk's vaccine and current vaccines for rabies, influenza, and veterinary retrovirus diseases. But this has never been done. Why? Off the record, \"We don't do product development.\" NIH insiders point out that such a proposal to apply old-fashioned methods would not be intellectually exciting. It would rank poorly compared to grant applications more likely to discover state-of-the-art scientific truths. Public health emergencies do not fare well in the researcher-initiated, peer-reviewed funding mechanisms of basic science. What is needed to resolve this impasse? NIH should continue to support the basic science and clinical research which it does so well, and from which the resulting knowledge improves new vaccine designs. But we should learn from organizational structures with proven track records in producing successful products: The March of Dimes gave us Dr. Salk's polio vaccine. Our military medical research system fostered vaccines for anthrax, encephalitis, hepatitis, meningitis, plague, pneumonia, typhoid, and yellow fever, among others. NASA met President Kennedy's target date for the Apollo program. Responsibility for developing an AIDS vaccine needs to be placed in a goal-driven, public-health-oriented, semi-independent entity with scientific oversight by experienced vaccinologists. Such an entity must be free of other competing missions and political constituencies in order to weigh carefully the risks and benefits in making difficult decisions. Ongoing private-sector initiatives by the Rockefeller and Albert B. Sabin [Page 9](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0492.017/9) p. 9 foundations to create such structures are on the right track, and would be strengthened by government participation and support. Shepherding vaccines through the R & D process will be a long and challenging charge. The AIDS vaccine development entity must encourage private investment and charitable contributions. It must contract to fill gaps in products or knowledge not covered by private or NIH research. It must mobilize essential public support and involvement in sponsoring large field trials. It must avoid a one-step-at-a-time serial approach, and instead put various HIV vaccine designs into concurrently overlapping field trials, each of which will take years to complete. And it must overcome liability and regulatory obstacles before the first product can become available. At the White House Conference on HIV and AIDS on December 6, President Clinton said that a vaccine was among the nation's first and top priorities. He~reported ask the Vice President to convene a meeting of scientists and leaders of the pharmaceutical industry to identify all the ways to accelerate development. President Kennedy mobilized the government bureaucracy and the nation px a time of disillusionment44our technological capability after Sputnik by setting a date certain for putting an American on the moon. There can be no greater tribute to the memory of Jonas Salk -- who spent the final years of his life working on a vaccine for AIDS -- than for the President to declare a national goal to develop an effective vaccine for AIDS by the 50th anniversary of the success of Dr. Salk's vaccine, which would be the year 2005. \"Reinventing\" the federal role in HIV vaccine [Page 10](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0492.017/10) A p. 10 development and reaching out in partnership with the private sector and other affected nations would be essential steps towards such an inspiring and urgent goal. -- 30 -- "}
