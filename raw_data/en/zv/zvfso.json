She is visionary for the future of healthcare and left her position as a board-certified, internal medicine hospitalist to pursue Functional Medicine in order to better serve her patients.

Her philosophy embraces that health encompasses the whole patient mind, body, and spirit and Dr. Jess has become one of the most-sought after Functional Medicine Leaders. She is known for her ability to help identify the root cause of illness, most often traced back to hidden, stealth infections like Lyme, parasites and mold, Dr. Jess's area of expertise. After graduating Magna Cum Lade with a BA in Biology, a minor in Psychology, and earning her medical degree from University of Louisville, Dr. Jess worked as a hospitalist for 6 years before beginning to experience what many of her patients experienced, deep anxiety, hormonal imbalances, and mitochondrial dysfunction. In the process of trying to heal herself, she sought answers to uncover the root cause of disease, something she thought she had learned in medical school but realized she had not. She began to investigate alternatives to today's modern medical industry that treats every ill with a pill.

The body has all the answers to heal and reverse chronic disease.
