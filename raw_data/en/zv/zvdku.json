However, little data is currently available regarding its use, safety, and efficacy in children with ASD. Thus, the purpose of this study is to describe the use of supplement-based CAM therapies in children between the ages of 4 to 17 years with ASD. This population-based, cross-sectional study evaluated children with ASD regarding supplement use. A total of 210 participants were recruited from a variety of sources including educational and physical activity programs, and social media to complete a questionnaire. Primary caregivers provided information on current supplement based CAM use. Data evaluated the proportion of children that used supplement therapies, the types of supplements used, reasons for use, perceived safety, and demographic factors associated with use (e.g., income, parental education, severity of disorder). Seventy-five percent of children with ASD consumed supplements with multivitamins (77.8%), vitamin D (44.9%), omega 3 (42.5%), probiotics (36.5%), and magnesium (28.1%) as the most prevalent. Several supplements, such as adrenal cortex extract, where product safety has not yet been demonstrated, were also reported. A gluten free diet was the most common specialty diet followed amongst those with restrictions (14.8%). Health care professionals were the most frequent information source regarding supplements; however, 33% of parents reported not disclosing all their child's supplements to their physician. In conclusion, the use of supplement therapies in children with ASD is endemic and highlights the need for further research concerning public health education surrounding safety and efficacy.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2019-08-01", "cleaned_text": "Dietary and Supplement-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use in Pediatric Autism Spectrum Disorder [https://doi.org/10.3390/nu11081783](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu11081783) [Nutraceutical, Nutrition Supplements and Human Health]( /journal/nutrients/special_issues/Nutraceutica_Nutrition )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-nutrients-11-01783)]. The etiology of these conditions is thought to be multifactorial, involving genetic, prenatal, and postnatal factors [ [2](#B2-nutrients-11-01783)]. The Centre for Disease Control (CDC) reports that 1 in 59 children are diagnosed with ASD, with boys 4 times more likely to be diagnosed than girls. As such, ASD is the fastest growing developmental disorder in the United States [ [3](#B3-nutrients-11-01783)]. [4](#B4-nutrients-11-01783)]. Psychotropic drugs are commonly prescribed to treat core behavioral symptoms, decrease maladaptive behavior, and support learning and development [ [5](#B5-nutrients-11-01783)]. In addition to conventional treatment options, some parents of children with ASD seek out complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to treat symptoms. The National Centre for Complementary and Integrative Health defines CAM as \"a diverse group of medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not generally considered part of conventional Western medicine\" [ [6](#B6-nutrients-11-01783)]. Complementary approaches fall broadly into 3 categories: Natural products such as dietary supplements and special diets, mind and body practices, and other complementary health approaches [ [7](#B7-nutrients-11-01783)]. [8](#B8-nutrients-11-01783)]. However, these studies are limited in several ways. First, while many employ sound methodologies, they often provide differing definitions of what constitutes a CAM therapy. For example, in their review of 136 studies on alternative medicines, Surette et al. [ [9](#B9-nutrients-11-01783)] found 39 studies that included vitamins, 13 studies that excluded vitamins, and 41 studies that made no mention of their inclusion or exclusion criteria. Further, many of the pediatric CAM studies are characterized by wide variation in study populations and size, prevalence measurements, and research methodologies, all of which hinder the formulation of evidence-based recommendations. [10](#B10-nutrients-11-01783)] found that greater than 9% of children with ASD used potentially harmful CAM, such as chelation, antibiotics, or excessive amounts of vitamins. These findings are consistent with anecdotal evidence of dangerous products used to \"cure\" ASD. For example, in 2014, the supplementation market saw an explosion of Miracle Mineral Solution, a solution of sodium chlorite and hydrochloric acid (i.e., bleach) as a treatment option for ASD. The US Food and Drug Administration has issued several warnings about the product and the treatment has been linked to 1 death and several serious injuries; however, Miracle Mineral Solution is still widely available, with 1000 + followers on social media promoting its use [ [11](#B11-nutrients-11-01783)]. [2](#B2-nutrients-11-01783), [12](#B12-nutrients-11-01783), [13](#B13-nutrients-11-01783)]. Research estimates that up to 74% of children with ASD have been provided with CAM and that supplement-based therapies make up approximately 50% of CAM therapies used by this population [ [14](#B14-nutrients-11-01783)]. [15](#B15-nutrients-11-01783)]. Concurrent use of CAM and prescription medications is widespread and poses a possible risk to patients who may be unaware of the potential for interactions [ [16](#B16-nutrients-11-01783)]. Further, research has documented that knowledge of CAM use is important for health care professionals, as it provides insight into patient values and health beliefs. Importantly, considering patient values may assist in providing optimum care, especially in the context of supplements that pose a safety risk to patients [ [15](#B15-nutrients-11-01783)]. Given the rates of concurrent use, in conjunction with lack of disclosure, there is a pressing need to assess pediatric CAM use and parental perceptions of these therapies. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Participants [17](#B17-nutrients-11-01783)]. Many of the children were cognitively and/or developmentally delayed; therefore, the parents/legal guardians served as a proxy for describing their child's use of supplements, in order to maintain consistency between responses. The parents/legal guardians of children with ASD provided written informed consent and completed the questionnaire on their behalf. 2.2. Dietary Supplement Questionnaire [18](#B18-nutrients-11-01783), [19](#B19-nutrients-11-01783)] was modified for children with ASD. Supplements were defined as a product that contains a vitamin, mineral, herb or botanical, amino acid, concentrate, metabolite, or other dietary ingredients intended to add further nutritional value to the diet. Supplements may be found in many forms such as tablets, capsules, soft gels, liquids, or powders. Examples include multivitamins, supplementary minerals, protein powders, energy drinks, meal replacements, etc. This definition was based on the definition provided by the National Centre for Complementary and Integrative Health [ [6](#B6-nutrients-11-01783)]. Specialty diets such as the ketogenic diet, low-carb diet, and gluten free diet were also evaluated. The response format for the survey contained several closed-ended questions, short answer, and 5 item Likert scale questions. Several questions provided participants with answers to select from as well as short answer boxes to provide their answers. A pilot-test was conducted on a small sample of parents (n = 34) to ensure clarity of content. A sample of the questionnaire can be found in [Supplementary Data File S1, Table S1](#app1-nutrients-11-01783). 2.3. Measures 2.4. Procedures 2.5. Statistical Analysis [20](#B20-nutrients-11-01783)]. Ability groups were based on 4 ability categories (verbal, intellectual, social, and physical) in which parents ranked their child as \"very weak/weak,\" \"neutral,\" or \"strong/very strong. Differences between sex, age, and ability groups were determined by a Fisher's exact test. All analyses were performed using SPSS statistics version 25 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NW, USA). 3. Results 3.1. Participant Characteristics 3.2. Dietary Supplement Use [Figure 1](#nutrients-11-01783-f001). A more extensive list of the supplements listed by the questionnaire can be found in [Supplementary Data, Table S2](#app1-nutrients-11-01783). The 5 most common supplements were multivitamins (77.8%), vitamin (44.9%), omega 3 (42.5%), probiotics magnesium (28.1%). melatonin were also mentioned. Differences between sexes were found in calcium (male = 9.1%, female = 21.7%, p = 0.037) and vitamin K (male = 1.7%, female = 10.9%, p = 0.018). When analyzed by age group, significant differences were found in calcium (p = 0.049), vitamin B (p = 0.010), and energy drinks (p = 0.027). The percentage of children who have/are taking more than 1 supplement was 88.6%. In addition, a Pearson's correlation determined that there was no relationship between number of supplements used and years since diagnosis (p = 240). The average number of supplements per child was 4.49 and the mean year of diagnosis was 2013. 3.3. Dietary Supplement Reasons for Use [Table 3](#nutrients-11-01783-t003). The top 3 reasons for consuming supplements were to enhance the child's diet, promote immune system function, and increase quality/duration of sleep. Improvement in gut health was listed 7 times under the \"other\" section. Parents also indicated several reasons for omitting supplements including: Inadequate knowledge/information (n = 14), too expensive (n = 8), and may be considered harmful (n = 5). Six parents indicated that supplements were not necessary, as their child eats a balanced diet. 3.4. Special Diets and Information Sources [Table 4](#nutrients-11-01783-t004). The top 4 diets followed in our sample included no restrictions, gluten free, high carbohydrate, and lactose free, with a significant difference between sex in diets with no restrictions (male = 72.0%, female = 54.7%, p = 0.027), gluten free (male = 5.1%, female = 24.5%, p < 0.001), and lactose free (male = 4.5%, female = 17.0%, p = 0.006). Other diets such as the paleo diet, nut-free, dye-free, and low sugar diets were also mentioned. In addition, 6 parents also stated that their children were picky eaters and had \"very limited diets.\" [Figure 2](#nutrients-11-01783-f002). Sixty-five percent (65%) of parents indicated that health care professionals (e.g., physician, nurse, nutritionist) were their primary source of information regarding dietary supplements. Published literature and media (e.g., news, magazines, journals) were listed as the second and third most popular sources of information. Social media was the least utilized source, with only 5.8% of parents indicating use. Two participants did not indicate a primary information source and two other participants indicated \"knowledge over the years,\" and \"myself (pharmacist)\" in the \"other\" section. 3.5. Physician Communication [Table 5](#nutrients-11-01783-t005). Results revealed that 33.5% of parents did not disclose all supplements to their physician. Several reasons were reported for omitting disclosure of supplementation use to primary care physicians including perceived \"physician lack of knowledge\", \"no benefit\", of judgment\". 4. Discussion [13](#B13-nutrients-11-01783)]. Critically, however, a complete profile of dietary supplement use in children with ASD is lacking; making it difficult to develop educational strategies. The present study is impactful, as it provides a fully powered assessment of supplement-based CAM therapies in children with ASD. 4.1. Dietary Supplement Patterns and Special Diet Use [14](#B14-nutrients-11-01783)]. As the most recent studies evaluating supplement use in children with ASD were conducted several years ago, it is possible that the high prevalence reported here reflects a continued increase in supplement use. Additionally, this study utilized a broad definition of supplements when compared to other studies, therefore, it is likely we captured a wider variety of supplements used by children with autism. Nevertheless, the reported high rates of dietary and supplement use in this study would indicate these products continue to be of interest as a complementary approach to standard treatment of care. [21](#B21-nutrients-11-01783)]. Multivitamins, for example, are considered a popular CAM therapy in ASD [ [22](#B22-nutrients-11-01783)]. The rationale for this treatment is based on the frequently observed dietary deficiency of vitamins and micronutrients in children with ASD. Children with ASD are often deficient in calcium, vitamin D, vitamin K, vitamin A, vitamin E, zinc, vitamin B6, and tetrahydrobiopterin [ [21](#B21-nutrients-11-01783)]. These deficiencies could be the result of food selectivity or altered gastrointestinal absorption. Adams et al. [ [23](#B23-nutrients-11-01783)] conducted a double-blind randomized control trial to examine the effect of a common commercial vitamin supplement on observed improvements in parent-rated pre and post autism symptomatology. They found significant improvements in hyperactivity, tantrumming, overall, and receptive language, suggesting it as a reasonable adjunct therapy for children with ASD. However, no other study has evaluated or been able to replicate the effectiveness or safety of this biological therapy. Similarly, preliminary studies on probiotics have shown improvement in core symptomatology in ASD [ [21](#B21-nutrients-11-01783)], but they have been minimally replicated and several other studies have denounced their effects. It is also possible that there are responders and non-responders to individual treatments, further complicating interpretation. [24](#B24-nutrients-11-01783)]. In 2015, an open trial demonstrated significant improvements in autism rating scales following 3 month vitamin D3 supplementation [ [25](#B25-nutrients-11-01783)]. However, this small sample study has been the only experimental study to demonstrate the potential efficacy of vitamin D in children with ASD, highlighting the need for more wide-scale studies to critically validate the efficacy of vitamin D before drawing any definite conclusions. [26](#B26-nutrients-11-01783)]. Furthermore, some of the other supplements reported in this study confirm anecdotal reports regarding the consumption of dangerous biological therapies. The Food and Drug Administration has issued several health warnings about adrenal cortex extract, for example, and has deemed it \"unsafe and ineffective for labeled indications for human use\" [ [27](#B27-nutrients-11-01783), [28](#B28-nutrients-11-01783), [29](#B29-nutrients-11-01783)]. Evidently, there are gaps in the transmission of scholarly literature to quality educational materials for families, as many children continue to consume dietary supplements that are unsupported by research. In addition, several parents indicated that they were undecided about the safety of supplements and listed inadequate knowledge about supplements as the number one factor barring use. [30](#B30-nutrients-11-01783)]. Many are small in size and lack strict dietary controls, both common problems in conducting dietary research in children, which limits the ability of researchers to drawn firm conclusions. Consequently, many studies regarding specialty diets point to the need for further research and illustrate how clinicians often find themselves unable to offer the most up-to-date and scientifically credible information to their patients. Of note, the ketogenic diet has emerged as a leader in specialty diets for ASD in the past several years and has offered promising, though preliminary, results in both animal and human studies [ [31](#B31-nutrients-11-01783), [32](#B32-nutrients-11-01783), [33](#B33-nutrients-11-01783)]. Seven participants reported utilizing this diet. 4.2. Physician-Patient Communication [34](#B34-nutrients-11-01783)]. This study highlights that patients would like to receive information about CAM from their conventional health care team, underscoring the importance of clinician knowledge about CAM and emerging research findings. 4.3.
