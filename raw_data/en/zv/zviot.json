The creation of this document was a pinnacle event in the profession and medical practice of EMS as it fulfilled a recommendation in The Future of Emergency Care: Emergency Medical Services at the Crossroads published by the Institute of Medicin e (now the National Academies of Sciences) in 2007. Specifically, this report states \"NHTSA, in partnership with professional organizations, should convene a panel of individuals with multidisciplinary expertise to develop evidence -based model prehospital care protocols for the treatment, triage, and transport of patients.\" The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Office of EMS (NHTSA OEMS) has embraced this recommendation with the development of the Evidence -Based Guideline Project and continue d support of the NASEMSO National EMS Model Clinical Guidelines. The National Asso ciation of State EMS Officials recognizes the need for national EMS clinical guidelines to help state EMS systems ensure a more standardized approach to the current practic e of patient care and, as experience dictates, adoption of future practices. Model EMS clinical guidelines promote uniformity in prehospital care which, in turn, promotes more consistent practice as EMS providers move across healthcare systems. They also p rovide a standard to EMS medical directors upon which to base practice. Supported by initial and subsequent grant funding from NHTSA OEMS and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) , Maternal and Child Health Bureau's EMS for Children Progr am, NASEMSO authorized its Medical Directors Council to partner with national stakeholder organizations with expertise in EM S direct medical oversight and subject -matter experts to create a unified set of patient care guidelines. For the aspects of clinica l care where evidence -based guidelines derived in accordance with the national evidence -based guideline model process were not available, consensus -based clinical guidelines were developed utilizing currently available research. The NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines are not mandatory nor are they meant to be all - inclusive or to determine local scope of practice. The focus of these guidelines is solely patient -centric. As such, they are designed to provide a resource to clinical practice and to maximize patient care, safety, and outcomes regardless of the existing resources and capabilities within an EMS system. They are a set of clinical guidelines that can be used as is or adapted for use on a state, regional or local level to enhance patient care and benchmark performance of EMS practice. NASEMSO's ongoing support of this project underlines the critical evolution of the practice of EMS medicine as new EMS research and evidence -based patient care measures emerge in the future. We are grateful t o be able to continue the work on this initiative considering the group of talented, committed individuals we have been fortunate to call our partners in the endeavor. Carol Cunningham, M.D. Richard Kamin, M.D. Co-Princ ipal Investigator Co-Principal Inves tigator Upda ted January 5, 201 9 6 Purpose and Notes These guidelines are intended to help state EMS systems ensure a more standardized approach to the practice of patient care and to encompass evidence -based guidelines as they are developed. The long -term goal is to develop a fu ll range of evidence -based prehospital care clinical guidelines. However, until there is a sufficient body of evidence to fully support this goal, there is a need for this interim expert, consensus -based step. The National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines can fill a significant gap in uniform clinical guidance for EMS patient care, while also providing input to the evidence -based guideline (EBG) development process. These guidelines will be maintained by the Medical Directors Council of the National Associatio n of State EMS Officials (NASEMSO) and will be reviewed and updated periodically. As EBG material is developed, it will be substituted for the consensus -based guidelines now comprising the majority of the content of this document. In the interim, additiona l consensus -based guidelines will also be added as the need is identified. For guidelines to be considered for inclusion, they must be presented in the format followed by all guidelines in the document. Universal Care and Poisoning/Overdose Universal Care guidelines are included to reduce the need for extensive reiteration of basic assessment and other considerations in every guideline. The appendices contain material such as neurologic status assessment and burn assessment tools to which many guidelines r efer to increase consistency in internal standardization and to reduce duplication. While some specific guidelines have been included for pediatric patients, considerations of patient age and size (pediatric, geriatric and bariatric) have been interwoven i n the guidelines throughout the document. Where IV access and drug routing is specified, it is intended to include IO access and drug routing when IV access and drug routing is not possible. Generic medication names are utilized throughout the guidelines. A complete list of these, along with respective brand names, may be found in Appendix IV - Medications . Accurate and quality data collection is crucial to the advancement of EMS and a critical element of EMS research. The National EMS Information System (NEMSIS) has the unique ability to unify EMS data on a national scope to fulfill this need. Each guideline, therefore, is also listed by the closest NEMSIS Version 3 Label and Code corresponding to it, listed in parenthese s below the guideline name. Quality assurance (QA) and/or continued performance improvement (CPI) pr ograms are indispensable element s of direct medical oversight as they facilitate the identification of gaps and potential avenues of their resolution within an EMS system. Since the release of the inaugural document, the EMS Compass\u00ae project, which was led by NASEMSO, was tasked with the mission of improving systems of care through meaningful measures. This edition of the NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical G uidelines has incorporated the existing EMS Compass\u00ae performance measures into the key performance measures associated with each clinical guideline. Upda ted January 5, 201 9 7 Target Audience While this material is intended to be integrated into an EMS system's operational guidance materials by its medical director and other leaders, it is written with the intention that it will be consumed by field EMS practitioners. To the degree possible, it has been assembled in a format useful for guidance and quick reference so that leaders m ay adopt it in whole or in part, harvesting and integrating as they deem appropriate to the format of their guideline, protocol, or procedure materials. New in the 2017 Edition All of the 2014 guidelines have been reviewed and updated, and additional guidelines and new evidence -based guidelines have been added to this edition. While some of the new material has been added as guidelines in the appropriate chapter, other topics have been incorporated into a previously existing guideline. New content has been added to the 2017 edition for the following clinical conditions or scenarios (as stand -alone guidelines or content in related guidelines) : Abdominal Pain Active Shooter Incidents Airway/Respiratory Irritants Amputation Back Pain Cardiac Devices Crush Syndrome End-of-Life Palliative CareHuman Trafficking Hypertension Impaled Objects Riot Control Agents Sickle Cell Pain Crisis Termination of Resuscitative Efforts Tracheostomy/Laryngectomy Acknowledgements The authors of this document are NASEMSO Medical Director s Council members partnered with representatives of seven EMS medical director stakehold er organizations. The stakeholder organizations are the American Academy of Emergency Medicine (AAEM), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP), the American College of Osteopathic Emergency Physicians ( ACOEP), the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACS -COT), the Air Medical Physician Association (AMPA), and the National Association of EMS Physicians (NAEMSP). In honor and gratitude, the authors of the inaugural NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines are also included. Their invaluable contributions and expertise to build the foundation of this evolutionary document will always be deeply respected and appreciated. Upda ted January 5, 201 9 8 Universal Care Universal Care Guideline Aliases Patient assessment , patient history, physical assessment, primary survey, secondary survey Patient Care Goals Facilitate appropriate initial assessment and management of any EMS patient and link to appropriate specific guidelines as dictated by the findings within the Universal Care guideline . Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria All patient encounters with and care delivery by EMS personnel Exclusion Criteria None Patient Management Assessment 1. Assess scene safety a. Evaluate for hazards to EMS personnel, patient, bystanders b. Determine number of patients c. Determine mechanism of injury d. Request additional resources if needed and w eigh the benefits of waiting for additional resources against rapid transport to definitive ca re e. Consider declaration of mass casualty incident if needed 2. Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) 3. Wear high -visibility, retro -reflective apparel when deemed appropriate (e.g. operations at night or in darkness, on or near roadways) 4. Consider c ervical spine stabilization and/or spinal care if trauma 5. Primary survey (Airway , Breathing, Circulation is cited below ; although t here are specific circumstances where Circulation, Airway, Breathing may be indicated such as cardiac arrest or major arteria l bleeding ) a. Airway (assess for patency and open the airway as indicated ) i. Patient is unable to maintain airway patency \u2014open airway 1. Head tilt chin lift 2. Jaw thrust 3. Suction 4. Consider use of the appropriate airway management adjuncts and devices: oral airway, nasal airway, blind insertion , or supraglottic airway device, laryngeal mask airway, endotracheal tube 5. For patients with laryngectomies or tracheostomies, remove all objects or clothing that may obstruct the opening of these devices, maintain the flow of p rescribed oxygen, and reposition the head and/or neck Upda ted January 5, 201 9 9 ii. Obstructed airway , laryngectomy, or tracheostomy - go to Airway Management guideline b. Breathing i. Evaluate rate, breath sounds, accessory muscle use, retractions, patient positioning ii. Administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 94 -98% saturation for most acutely ill patients iii. Apnea (not breathing) - go to Airway Management guideline c. Circulation i. Control any major external bleeding [see Extremity Trauma/ External Hemorrhage Management guideline ] ii. Assess pulse 1. If none - go to Cardiac Arrest guideline 2. Assess rate and quality of carotid and radial pulses iii. Evaluate perfusion by assessing skin color and temperature 1. Evaluate capillary refill d. Disability i. Evaluate patient responsiveness: AVPU scale (Alert, Verbal, Pain, Unresponsive) ii. Evaluate gross motor and sensory function in all extremities iii. Check blood glucose in patients with altered mental status iv. If acute stroke suspected - go to Suspected Stroke/Transient Ischemic Attack guideline e. Expose patient as approp riate to complaint i. Be considerate of patient modesty ii. Keep patient warm 6. Secondary s urvey The performance of the secondary survey should not delay transport in critical patients. See also secondary survey specific to individual complaints in other protocol s. Secondary surveys should be tailored to patient presentation and chief complaint. The following are suggested considerations for secondary survey assessment: a. Head i. Pupils ii. Naso -oropharynx iii. Skull and scalp b. Neck i. Jugular venous distension ii. Tracheal position iii. Spinal tenderness c. Chest i. Retractions ii. Breath sounds iii. Chest wall deformity d. Abdomen/Back i. Flank/abdominal tenderness or bruising ii. Abdominal distension e. Extremities i. Edema ii. Pulses Upda ted January 5, 201 9 10 iii. Deformity e. Neurologic i. Mental status/orientation ii. Motor/sensory 7. Obtain Baseline Vital Signs (An initial full set of vital signs is required: pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, neurologic status assessment ) a. Neurologic status assessment [see Appendix VII ] involves establishing a baseline and then trending any change in patient neurologic status i. Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) is frequently used, but there are often errors in applying and calculating this score. With this in consideration, a simpler field approach may be as valid as GCS. Either AVPU ( Alert, Verbal, Painful, Unresponsive) or only the motor component of the GCS may more effectively serve in this capacity b. Patients with cardiac or respiratory complaints i. Pulse oximetry ii. 12-lead EKG should be obtained early in patients with cardiac or suspected cardiac complaints iii. Continuous cardiac monitoring, if available iv. Consider waveform capnography (essential for patients who require invasive airway management) or digital capnometry c. Patient with altered mental status i. Check blood glucose ii. Consider waveform capnography (essential for patients who require invasive airway management) or digital capnometry d. Stable patients should have at least two sets of pertinent vital signs. Ideally, one set should be taken shortly before arrival at receiving facility e. Critical patients should have pertinent vital signs frequently monitored 8. Obtain OPQRST history: a. Onset of symptoms b. Provocation - location; any exacerbating or alleviating factors c. Quality of pain d. Radiation of pain e. Severity of symptoms - pain scale f. Time of onset and circumstances around onset 9. Obtain SAMPLE history: a. Symptoms b. Allergies - medication, environmental, and foods c. Medications - prescription and over -the-counter; bring containers to ED if possible d. Past medical history i. look for medical alert tags, portable medical records, advance directives ii. look for medical devices/implants (some common ones may be dialysis shunt, insulin pump, pacemaker, central venous access port, gastric tubes, urinary catheter ) e. Last oral intake f. Events leading up to the 911 call In patient s with syncope, seizure, altered mental status, or acute stroke, consider bringing the witness to the hospital or obtain their contact phone number to provide to ED care team Upda ted January 5, 201 9 11 Treatment and Interventions 1. Administer oxygen as appropriate with a targ et of achieving 94 -98% saturation 2. Place appropriate monitoring equipment as dictated by assessment - these may include : a. Continuous pulse oximetry b. Cardiac rhythm monitoring c. Waveform capnography or digital capnometry d. Carbon monoxide assessment 3. Establish vasc ular access if indicated or in patients who are at risk for clinical deterioration . a. If IO is to be used for a conscious patient, consider the use of .5 mg/kg of lidocaine 0.1mg/mL with slow push through IO needle to a maximum of 40 mg to mitigate pain from IO medication administration 4. Monitor pain scale if appropriate 5. Reassess patient Patient Safety Considerations 1. Routine use of lights and sirens is not warranted 2. Even when lights and sirens are in use, always limit speeds to level that is safe for the emergency vehicle being driven and road conditions on which it is being operated 3. Be aware of legal issues and patient rights as they pertain to and impact patient care (e.g. patients with functional needs or children with special healthcare needs ) 4. Be aware of potential need to adjust management based on patient age and comorbidities, including medication dosages 5. The maximum weight -based dose of medication administered to a pediatric patient should not exceed the maximum adult dose except where specifically stated in a patient care guideline 6. Direct medical oversight should be contacted when mandated or as needed 7. Consider air medical transport, if available, for patients with time -critical conditions where ground transport time exceeds 45 minutes Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Pediatrics : use a weight -based assessment tool (length -based tape or other system) to estimate patient weight and guide medication therapy and adjunct choice a. Although the defined age varies by state, the pediatric population is generally defined by those patients who weigh up to 40 kg or up to 1 4-years of age, whichever comes first b. Consider using the pediatric assessment triangle (appearance, work of breathing, circulation) when first approaching a child t o help with assessment . 2. Geriatrics : although the defined age varies by state, the geriatric population is generally defined as those patients who are 65 years old or more a. In these patients, as well as all adult patients, reduced medication dosages may appl y to patients with renal disease (i.e. on dialysis or a diagnosis of chronic renal insufficiency) or hepatic disease (i.e. severe cirrhosis or end -stage liver disease) 3. Co-morbidities : reduced medication dosages may apply to patients with renal disease (i.e . on dialysis or a diagnosis of chronic renal insufficiency) or hepatic disease (i.e. severe cirrhosis or end -stage liver disease) Upda ted January 5, 201 9 12 4. Vital Signs: a. Oxygen i. Administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 94 -98% saturation ii. Supplemental oxygen admin istration is warranted to patients with oxygen saturations below this level and titrated based upon clinical condition, clinical response, and geographic location and altitude b. Normal vital signs (see chart below) i. Hypotension is considered a systolic blood pressure less than the lower limit on the chart ii. Tachycardia is considered a pulse above the upper limit on the chart iii. Bradycardia is considered a pulse below the lower limit on the chart iv. Tachypnea is considered a respiratory rate above the upper limit on th e chart v. Bradypnea is considered a respiratory rate below the lower limit on the chart c. Hypertension. A lthough abnormal, may be an expected finding in many patients i. Unless an intervention is specifically suggested based on the patient's complaint or presenta tion, the hypertension should be documented, but otherwise, no intervention should be taken ii. The occurrence of symptoms ( e.g. chest pain, dyspnea, vision change, headache, focal weakness or change in sensation, altered mental status) in patients with hypert ension should be considered concerning, and care should be provided appropriate with the patient's complaint or presentation 5. Secondary Survey : may not be completed if patient has critical primary survey problems 6. Critical P atients : proactive patient management should occur simultaneously with assessment a. Ideally, one provider should be assigned to exclusively monitor and facilitate patient - focused care b. Treatment and Interventions should be initiated as soon as practical , but should not impede extricat ion or delay transport to definitive care 7. Air Medical Transport : air transport of trauma patients should be reserved for higher acuity trauma patients where there is a significant times savings over ground transport, where the appropriate destination is no t accessible by ground due to systemic or logistical issues, and for patients who meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) anatomic, physiologic, and situational high -acuity triage criteria Pertinent Assessment Findings This guidelin e is too broad to list all possible findings Quality Improvement Associated NEMSIS Protocol(s) (eProtocol.01) 9914075 - General -Universal Patient Care/Initial Patient Contact Key Documentation Elements At least two full sets of vital signs should be documented for every patient All patient interventions should be documented Upda ted January 5, 201 9 13 Performance Measures Abnormal vital signs should be addressed and reassessed Response to therapy provided should be documented including pain scale reassessment if appropriate Limit scene time for patients with time -critical illness or injury unless clinically indicated Appropriate utilization of air medical services Blood glucose level obtained when indicated EMS Compass\u00ae Measures (for additional information, see www.emscompass.org ) o PEDS -03: Documentation of estimated weight in kilograms. Frequency that weight or length -based estimate are documented in kilograms o PEDS -01: Respiratory assessment. Documented evidence that a respiratory asse ssment was performed on pediatric patients o Hypoglycemia -01: Treatment administered for hypoglycemia. Measure of patients who received treatment to correct their hypoglycemia o Stroke -01: Suspected stroke receiving prehospital stroke assessment.

Revision Date September 8, 2017 Upda ted January 5, 201 9 16 Functional Needs Aliases Developmental delay, disabled, handicapped, impaired, mental Illness, mental retardation, special needs Patient Care Goals To meet and maintain the additional support required for patients with functional needs during the delivery of prehospital care Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria Patients who are identified by the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health that have experienced a d ecrement in health resulting in some degree of di sability. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, this includes, but is not limited to, individuals with physical, sensory, mental health, and cognitive and/or intellectual disabilitie s affecting their ability to function independently without assistance Exclusion Criteria None Patient Management Assessment 1. Identify the functional need by means of information from the patient, the patient's family, bystanders, medic alert bracelets or documents, or the patient's adjunct assistance devices 2. The physical examination should not be intentionally abbreviated, although the manner in which the exam is performed may need to be modified to accommodate the specific needs of the patient Trea tment and Interventions Medical care should not intentionally be reduced or abbreviated during the triage, treatment, and transport of patients with functional needs, although the manner in which the care is provided may need to be modified to accommodate the specific needs of the patient . Patient Safety Considerations For patients with communication barriers (language or sensory), it may be desirable to obtain secondary confirmation of pertinent data ( e.g. allergies) from the patient's family, interpreters, or written or electronic medical records . The family members can be an excellent source of information and the presence of a family member can have a calming influence on some of these patients . Notes/Ed ucational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Communication Barriers a. Language Barriers : i. Expressive and/or receptive aphasia Upda ted January 5, 201 9 17 ii. Nonverbal iii. Fluency in a different language than that of the EMS professional iv. Examples of tools to overcome language barriers include: 1. Transport of an individual who is fluent in the patient's language along with the patient to the hospital 2. Medical translation cards 3. Telephone -accessible services with live language interpreters 4. Methods through which the patient augments his/her communicat ion skills ( e.g. eye blinking, nodding) should be noted, utilized as able, and communicated to the receiving facility 5. Electronic applications for translation b. Sensory Barriers : i. Visual impairment ii. Auditory impairment iii. Examples of tools to overcome sensory ba rriers include: 1. Braille communication card 2. Sign language 3. Lip reading 4. Hearing aids 5. Written communication 2. Physical Barriers: i. Ambulatory impairment ( e.g. limb amputation, bariatric) ii. Neuromuscular impairment 3. Cognitive Barriers: i. Mental illness ii. Developmental c hallenge or delay Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Assistance Adjuncts . Examples of devices that f acilitate the activities of daily living for the patient with functional needs include, but are not limited to: a. Extremity prostheses b. Hearing aids c. Magnifiers d. Tracheostomy speaking valves e. White or sensory canes f. Wheelchairs or motorized scooters 2. Service Animals As defined by the American Disabilities Act, \"any guide dog, signal dog, or other animal individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including, but not limited to guiding individuals with impaired vision, alerting individuals with impaired hearing to intruders or sounds, providing minimal protection or rescue work, pulling a wheelchair, or fetching dr opped items .\" a. Services animals are not classified as a pet and should, by law, always be permitted to accompany the patient with the following exceptions: i. A public entity may ask an individual with a disability to remove a service animal from the premises if: 1. The animal is out of control and the animal's handler does not take effective action to control it; or Upda ted January 5, 201 9 18 2. The animal is not housebroken b. Service animals are not required to wear a vest or a leash. It is illegal to make a request for special identificatio n or documentation from the service animal's partner. EMS providers may only ask the patient if the service animal is required because of a disability and the form of assistance the animal has been trained to perform . c. EMS providers are not responsible for the care of the service animal. If the patient is incapacitated and cannot personally care for the service animal, a decision can be made whether or not to transport the animal in this situation . d. Animals that solely pr ovide emotional support, comfort, or companionship do not qualify as service animals Quality Improvement Associated NEMSIS Protocol(s) (eProtocol.01) 9914165 - Other (no specific NEMSIS protocol matching this guideline) 9914063 - General -Individualized Patient Protocol Key Documentation Elements Document all barriers in the NEMSIS element \"eHistory.01 - Barriers to Patient Care\" (NEMSIS Required National Element) Document specific physical barriers in the appropriate exam elements (e.g. \"blind\" under Eye Assessment; or paralysis, weakness, or speech problems under Neurological Assessment) Document any of the following, as appropriate in the narrative: o Language barriers: The patient's primary language of fluency The identification of the person assisting with the communication The methods through which the patient augments his/her commu nication skills o Sensory barriers: The methods through which the patient augments his/her communica tion skills Written communication between the patient and the EMS profes sional is part of the medical record, even if it is on a scrap sheet of paper, and it should be retained with the same collation, storage, and confidentiality policies and procedures that are applicable to the written or electronic patient care report o Assistance adjuncts (devices that facilitate the activities of life for the patient) Performance Measure Accuracy of key data elements (chief complaint, past medical history, medication, allergies) Utilization of the appropriate adjuncts to overcome communic ation barriers Documentation of the patient's functional need and avenue exercised to support the patient Documentation of complete and accurate transfer of information regarding the functional need to the receiving facility Barriers documented under \"eHistory.01 - Barriers to Patient Care\" Upda ted January 5, 201 9 19 References 1.

Revision Date September 8, 2017 Upda ted January 5, 201 9 20 Patient Refusals Aliases Against medical advice, refusal of treatment, refusal of tran sport Patient Care Goals/Patient Presentation (Overview) If an individual (or the parent or legal guardian of the individual) refuses secondary care and/or ambulance transport to a hospital after prehospital providers have been called to the scene, providers should determine the patient's capacity to make decisions. Competency is generally a legal status of a person's ability to make decisions. However, state laws vary in the definition of competency and its impact upon authority. Therefore, one shou ld consult with the respective state EMS office for clarification on legal definitions and patient rights . Patient Management Assessment 1. Decision -Making Capacity a. An individual who is alert , oriented, and has the ability to understand the circumstances surrounding his/her illness or impairment, as well as the possible risks associated with refusing treatment and/or transport, typically is considered to have decision -making capacity b. The individual's judgment must also not be significantly impaired by illness, injury or drugs/alcohol intoxication. Individuals who have attempted suicide, verbalized suicidal intent, or have other factors that lead EMS providers to suspect suicidal intent, should not be regarded as having decision -making capacity and may not decline transport to a medical facility Treatment and Interventions 1. Obtain a complete set of vital signs and complete an initial assessment , paying particular attention to the individual's neurologic and mental status 2. Determin e the individual's capacity to make a valid judgment concerning the extent of his/her illness or injury ; if the EMS provider has doubts about whether the individual has the mental capacity to refuse or if the patient lacks capacity, the EMS provider should contact direct medical oversight 3. If patient has capacity, clearly explain to the individual and all responsible parties the possible risks and overall concerns with regards to refusing care 4. Perform appropriate medical care with the consent of the individu al 5. Complete the patient care report clearly documenting the initial assessment findings and the discussions with all involved individuals regarding the possible consequences of refusing additional prehospital care and/or transportation Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. An adult or emancipated minor who has demonstrated possessing sufficient mental capacity for making decisions has the right to determine the course of his/her medical care, including the refusal of care . These individuals must be advised of the risks and consequences resulting from refusal of medical care Upda ted January 5, 201 9 21 2. An individual determined to lack decision -making capacity by EMS providers should not be allowed to refuse care against medical advice or to be released at the scene . Mental illne ss, drugs, alcohol intoxication, or physical/mental impairment may significantly impair an individual's decision -making capacity . Individuals who have attempted suicide, verbalized suicidal intent, or have other factors that lead EMS providers to suspect s uicidal intent, should not be regarded as having demonstrated suff icient decision -making capacity 3. The determination of decision -making capacity may be challenged by communication barriers or cultural differences 4. EMS providers should not put themselves in danger by attempting to treat and/or transport an individual who refuses care 5. Always act in the best interest of the patient - EMS providers, with the support of direct medical oversight, must strike a balance between abandoning the patient and forcing car e 6. Special Considerations - Minors It is preferable for minors to have a parent or legal guardian who can provide consent for treatment on behalf of the child a. All states allow healthcare providers to provide emergency treatment when a parent is not availabl e to provide consent . This is known as the emergency exception rule or the doctrine of implied consen t. For minors, this doctrine means that the prehospital professional can presume consent and proceed with appropriate treatment and transport if the follow ing four conditions are met: i. The child is suffering from an emergent condition that places his or her life or health in danger ii. The child's legal guardian is unavailable or unable to provide consent for treatment or transport iii. Treatment or transport cannot b e safely delayed until consent can be obtained iv. The prehospital professional administers only treatment for emergency conditions that pose an immediate threat to the child v. As a general rule, when the prehospital professional's authority to act is in doubt, EMS providers should always do what they believe to be in the best interest of the minor vi. If a minor is injured or ill and no parent contact is possible, the provider may cont act direct medical oversight for additional instructions Quality Improvement Asso ciated NEMSIS Protocol(s) (eProtocol.01) 9914189 - General -Refusal of Care Key Documentation Elements Document patient capacity with: o Any and all barriers to patient care in the NEMSIS element \"eHistory.01 - Barriers to Patient Care\" (a Required National Element of NEMSIS) o Exam fields for \"eExam.19 - Mental Status \" and \"eExam.20 - Neurological Assessment \" o Vitals for level of r esponsiveness and Glasgow Coma Scale o Alcohol and drug use indicators o Blood glucose l evel (as appropriate to situation and patient h istory) Patient Age Upda ted January 5, 201 9 22 Minors who are not emancipated and adults with a legal guardian: guardian name, contact, and r elationship Any efforts made to contact guardians if contact could not be made What the patient's plan is after refusal of care and/or transp ort Who will be with the patient after EMS departs Patient was advised that they can change their mind and EMS can be contacted again at any time Patient was advised of possible risks to their health resulting from refusing care and/or transport Patient vo ices understanding of risks.

Revision Date September 8 , 2017 Upda ted January 5, 201 9 23 Cardiovascular Adult and Pediatric Syncope and Presyncope Aliases Loss of consciousness, p assed out, fainted Patient Care Goals 1. Stabiliz e and resuscitate when necessary 2. Initiate monitoring and diagnostic procedures 3. Transfer for further evaluation Patient Presentation Syncope is heralded by both the loss of consciousness and the loss of postural tone and resolves spontaneously without medical interventions . Syncope typically is abrupt in onset and resolves equally quickly. EMS providers may find the patient awake and alert on initial evaluation. Presyncope is defined as the prodromal symptoms of syncope. It usually lasts for seconds to minutes and may be described by the patient as \"nearly blacking out\" or \"nearly fainting.\" Inclusion C riteria 1. Abrupt loss of consciousness with loss of postural t one 2. Prodromal symptoms of syncope Exclusion Criteria Conditions other than the above, i ncluding patients: 1. Patients with alternate and obvious cause of loss of consciousness (e.g. trauma - go to Head Injury guideline ) 2. Patients with ongoing mental status changes or coma should be treated per the Altered Mental Status guideline Patient Management Assessment 1. Pertinent History a. Review the patient's past medical h istory, including a history of : i. Cardiovascular disease ( e.g. cardiac disease/stroke ) ii. Seizure iii. Recent trauma iv. Anticoagulation v. Dysrhythmia vi. Congestive heart failure (CHF) vii. Syncope b. History of Present Illness, including: i. Conditions leading to the event ii. Patient complaints before or after the event including prodromal symptoms iii. Syncope that occurs during exercise often indicates an ominous cardiac cause. Patients should be evaluated in the emergency department Upda ted January 5, 201 9 24 iv. History from others on scene , including seizures or shaking, presence of pulse/breathing (if noted), duration of the event, events that lead to the resolution of the event c. Review of Systems: i. Occult blood loss (GI/GU) ii. Fluid losses (nausea/vomiting/diarrhea) and fluid intake iii. Current Med ications 2. Pertinent Physical Exam Including: a. Attention to vital s igns a s well as evaluation for trauma b. Detailed neurologic exam (including stro ke screening and mental status) c. Heart, lun g, abdominal and extremity exam d. Additional Evaluation: i. Cardiac monitor ing ii. Ongoing vital signs iii. 12-lead EKG Treatment and Interventions : 1. Should be directed at abnormalities discovered in the physical exam or on additional examination and may include management of cardiac dysrhyth mias, cardiac ischemia/infarct, hemorrhage, sh ock, and the like a. Manage airway as indicated b. Oxygen as appropriate c. Evaluate for hemorrhage and treat for shock if indicated d. Establish IV access e. Fluid bolus if appropriate f. Cardiac monitor g. 12-lead EKG h. Monitor for and treat arrhythmias (if present refer to appropriate guideline) Patient Safety Considerations : 1. Patients suffering syncope due to arrhythmia may suffer recurrent arrhythmia and should therefore be placed on a cardiac monitor 2. Geriatric patients suffering falls from standing may sustain significan t injury and should be diligently screened for trauma - go to General Trauma Management guideline Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. By being most proximate to the scene and to the patient's presentat ion, EMS providers are commonly in a unique position to identify the cause of syncope. Consideration of potential causes, ongoing monitoring of vitals and cardiac rhythm as well as detailed exam and history are essential pieces of information to pass onto hospital providers. 2. All patients suffering from syncope deserve hospital level evaluation, even if they appear normal with few complaints on scene 3. High risk causes of syncope include the following: a. Cardiovascular i. Myocardial infarction ii. Aortic stenosis Upda ted January 5, 201 iii. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy iv. Pulmonary embolus v. Thoracic hemorrhage ii. Transient ischemic attack or st roke 4. Consider high risk 12 -lead EKG f eatures including , but not limited to : a. Evidence of QT prolongation (generally over 500ms) b. Delta waves c. Brugada syndrome (i ncomplete RBBB pattern in V1/V2 with ST segment elevation) d. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Evidence of trauma 2.

Revision Date September 8, 2017 Upda ted January 5, 201 9 27 Chest Pain/ Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) /ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) Aliases Heart attack, myocardial infarction (MI) Patient Care Goals 1. Identify STEMI quickly 2. Deter mine the time of symptom onset 3. Activate hospital -based STEMI system of care 4. Monitor vital signs and cardiac rhythm and be prepared to provide CPR and defibrillation if needed 5. Administer appropriate medications 6. Transport to appropriate facility Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria 1. Chest pain or discomfort in other areas of the body (e.g. arm, jaw, epigastrium) of suspected cardiac origin, shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Atypical or unusual s ymptoms are more common in women, the elderly and diabetic patients. May also present with CHF, syncope and/or shock. 2. Some patients will present with likely non -cardiac chest pain and otherwise have a low likelihood of ACS (e.g. blunt trauma to the chest o f a child). For these patients, defer the administration of aspirin and nitrates per the Pain Management guideline . Exclusion Criteria None recommended Patient Management Assessment, Treatment, and Interventions 1. Signs and symptoms include chest p ain, congestive heart failure, syncope, shock, symptoms similar to a patient's previous MI 2. Assess the patient's cardiac rhythm - treat pulseless rhythms, tachycardia, or symptomatic bradycardia [see Cardiovascular and Resuscitation guidelines] 3. If the patient is dyspneic, hypoxemic, or has obvious signs of heart failure, EMS providers should administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 94 -98% satur ation [see Universal Care guideline ] 4. The 12 -lead EKG is the primary diagnostic tool that identifies a STEMI ; It is imperative that EMS providers routinely acquire a 12 -lead EKG within 10 minutes for all patients exhibiting signs and symptoms of ACS a. The EKG may be transmitted for remote interpretation by a physician or screened for STEMI by properly trained EMS providers with or without the assistance of computer - interpretation b. Advance notification should be provided to the receiving hospital for patients identified as having STEMI c. Performance of serial EKGs is suggested Upda ted January 5, 201 9 28 d. All EKGs should be made available to treating personnel at the receiving hospital, whether brought in or transmitted from the field 5. Administe r aspirin; chewable, non -enteric -coated aspirin preferred (162 to 325 mg) 6. Establish IV access 7. Nitro glycerin 0.4 mg SL, can repeat q 3-5 min utes as long as SBP greater than 100 mmHg (if range not desired use q 3 minutes) a. The use of nitrates should be avoided in any patient who has used a phosphodiesterase inhibitor within the past 48 dysfunction and pulmonary hyp ertension. Also avoid use in patients receiving intravenous epoprostenol (Flolan\u00ae) or treporstenil (Remodulin\u00ae) which is used for pulmonary hypertension c. Administer nitrates with extreme caution, if at all, to patients with inferior -wall STEMI or suspected right ventricular (RV) involvement because these patients require adequate RV preload 8. Analgesia is indicated in STEMI when chest discomfort is unresponsive to nitrates ; Morphine should be used with caution in unstable angina (UA)/ non-STEMI due to an associ ation with increased mortality 9. Transport and destination decisions should be based on local resources and system of care Patient Safety Considerations 1. Observe for signs of clinical deterioration: dysrhythmias, CP, SOB, decreased LOC/syncope, or other sign s of shock/hypotension 2. Perform serial 12 -lead EKGs (especially any time clinical changes noted) Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations Acute coronary syndrome may present with atypical pain, vague or only generalized complaints . Pertinent Assessment Findings A complete medication list should be obtained from each patient. It is especially important for the treating physician to be informed if the patient is taking beta -blockers, calcium channel blockers, clonidine, digoxin, blood thinners (anticoagul ants), and medications for the treatment of erectile dysfunction or pulmonary hypertension.

The major EKG rhythms classified as bradycardia include: a. Sinus bradycardia b. Second -degree AV block i. Type I \u2014Wenckenbach/Mobitz I ii. Type II \u2014Mobitz II c. Third -degree AV block complete block d. Ventricular escape rhythms 3. See additional inclusion c riteria, below, for pediatric patients Exclusion Criteria No recommendations Patie nt Management Assessment, Treatment, and Interventions 1. Adult Management a. Manage airway as necessary b. Administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 94 -98% saturation c. Initiate monitoring and perform 12 -lead EKG d. Establish IV access e. Check blood glucose and treat hypoglycemia per the Hypoglycemia and Hyperglycemia guidelines f. Consider the following additional therapies if bradycardia and symptoms or hemodynamic instability co ntinue: i. Atropine 0.5 mg IV q 3 -5 minute ( maximum total dose of 3 mg) ii. Vasopressor medications (i n order of preference) Upda ted January 5, 201 9 31 1. Epinephrine IV drip 0.02 -0.2 mcg/kg/min titrated to a MAP greater than 65 mmHg OR 2. Epinephrine by push dose (dilute boluses) a. Prepare 10 m cg/mL by adding 1 mL 0.1mg/mL Epinephrine to 9 mL normal s aline, then administer 10 -20 mcg boluses (1 -2mL) every 2 minutes titrated MAP greater 65mmHg OR 3. Norepinephrine 0.02 -0.4 mcg/kg/minute IV titrated to a MAP greater than 65 mmHg iii. Transcutaneous Pacing - If pacing is performed, con sider sedation or pain control 2. Pediatric Management Treatment is only indicated for patients who are symptomatic (pale/cyanotic, diaphoretic , altered mental status, hypoxic ) a. Initiate chest compressions for heart less than 60 and signs of poor perfusion (altered mental status, hypoxia, hypotension, weak pulse, delayed capillary refill, cyanosis) b. Manage airway and assist ventilations as necessary with minimally interrupted chest compressions using a compression to ventil ation ratio 15:2 (30:2 if single provider is present) c. Administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 94 -98% saturation d. Initiate monitoring and perform 12 -lead EKG e. Establish IV access f. Check blood glucose and treat hypoglycemia per the Hypoglycemia guideline g. Consider the following additional therapies if bradycardia and symptoms or hem odynamic instability continue: i. Epinephrine by push dose (dilute boluses). Prepare 10 mcg/mL by adding 1 mL 0.1mg/mL Epinephrine to 9 mL Normal Saline, then administer 0.01mg/kg (0.1ml/kg) maximum single dose 10mcg (1ml) every 3 -5 minutes titrated to MAP greater than 65mmHg ii. Also consider atropine 0.01 -0.02 mg/kg IV with minimum dose of 0.1 mg if increased vagal tone or c holinergic drug toxicity to maximum initial dose of 0.5mg (maximum total dose of 3 mg) iii. Transcutaneous pacing - If pacing is performed, consider sedation or pain control iv. Epinephrine may be used for bradycardia and poor perfusion unresponsive to ventilation and oxygenation 1. It is reasonable to administer atropine for bradyc ardia caused by increased vagal tone or cholinergic drug toxicity Patient Safety Considerations If pacing is performed, consider sedation or pain control Upda ted January 5, 201 9 32 Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Observe for signs of decreased end -organ perfusion: chest pain ( CP), shortness of breath (SOB), decreased level of consciousness, syncope or other signs of shock/hypotension 2. Patients who have undergone cardiac transplant will not respond to atropine 3. Consider potential culprit medications including beta -blockers, calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers/anti cl onidine a. If medication overdose is considered, refer to appropriate guideline in the Toxins and Environmental section 4. The differential diagnosis includes the following: MI, hypoxia, pacemaker failure, hypothermia, sinus bradycardia, athletes, head injury with inc reased ICP, stroke, spinal cord lesion, sick sinus syndrome, AV blocks, overdose , cholinergic nerve agents 5. Consider hyperkalemia in the patien t with wide complex bradycardia 6. Bradycardia should be managed via the least invasive manner poss ible, escalating care as needed a. Third -degree heart block or the denervated heart (as in cardiac transplant) may not respond to atropine and in these cases, proceed quickly to chronotropic agents (such as epinephrine or dopamine) , or transcutaneous pacing b. Dopamine is not indicated for pediatric patients c. In cases of impe nding hemodynamic collapse, proceed directly to transcutaneous pacing 7. Be aware of acute coronary syndrome as a cause of bradycardia in adult patients 8. When dosing medications for pediatric patients, dose should be weight -based for non -obese patients and ba sed on ideal body weight for obese patients 9. Although dopamine is often recommended for the treatment of symptomatic bradycardia, recent research suggests that patients in cardiogenic or septic shock treated with norepinephrine have a lower mortality rate c ompared to those treated with dopamine 10.

Rapid identification of, and interventions for, cardiovascular compromise in patients with VADs 2. Rapid identification of, and interventions for VAD -related malfunctions or complications Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria 1. Adult patients that have had an implantable ventricular assist device (VA D), including a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), right ventricular biventricular -assist device (BiVAD) , and have symptoms of cardiovascular compromise 2. Patients with VADs that are in cardiac arrest 3. Patients with VADs that are experiencing a medical or injury -related event not involving the cardiovascular system or VAD malfunction Exclusion Criteria Adult patients who do not have a VAD in place Patient Management Assessment 1. Assess for possible pump malfunction a. Assess for alarms b. Auscultate for pump sound \"hum\" c. Signs of hypoperfusion including pallor, diaphoresis, altered mental status 2. If the VAD pump has malfunctioned: a. Utilize available resources to troubleshoot potential VAD malfunctions and to determine appropriate corrective actions to restore normal VAD function: i. Contact the patient's VAD -trained companion, if available ii. Contact the patient's VAD coordinator, using the phone number on the device iii. Check all the connections to system controller iv. Change VAD batteries, and/or change system controller if indicated v. Have patient stop all activity and assess for patient tolerance vi. Follow appropriate cardiovascular condition -specific protocol(s) as indicated Treatment and Interventions 1. Manage airway as indicated 2. Cardiac monitoring 3. IV acces s 4. Acquire 12 -lead EKG 5. If patient is experiencing VAD -related complications or cardiovascular problems, expedite transport to the medical facility where VAD was placed if patient's clinical condition and time allows Upda ted January 5, 201 9 35 6. If patient has a functioning VAD and is experiencing a non -cardiovascular -related problem, transport to a facility that is appropriate for the patient's main presenting problem without manipulating the device 7. If patient has a functioning VAD and is hypoperfusing: a. Administer IV fluids (30 mL/kg isotonic fluid; maximum of 1 liter) over less than 15 minutes, using a push -pull method of drawing up the fluid in a syring e and pushing it through the IV b. May repeat up to 3 times based on patient's condition and clinical impression for a total cumulat ive dose not exceed 3 L 8. If pa tient is in full cardiac arrest: a. CPR should not be performed if there is any evidence the pump is still functioning , the decision whether to perform CPR should be made based upon best clinical judgment in consultation with the patient's VAD -trained companion and the VAD coordinator (or direct medical oversight if VAD coordinator unavailable) b. CPR may be initiated only where: i. You have confirmed the pump has stopped and troubleshooting efforts to restart it have failed, and ii. The patient is unresponsive and has no detectable signs of life Notes/Educational Pearls 1. You do not need to disconnect the controller or batteries in order to : a. Defibrillate or cardiovert b. Acquire a 12 -lead EKG 2. Automatic non -invasive cuff blood pressures may be difficult to obtain due to the narrow pulse pressure created by the continuous flow pump 3. Flow though many VAD devices is not pulsatile and patients may not have a palpable pulse or accurate pul se oximetry 4. The blood pressure, if measurable, may not be an a ccurate measure of perfusion. 5. Ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, or asystole/PEA may be the patient's \"normal\" underlying rhythm. Evaluate clinical condition and provide care in consultation with VAD coordinator 6. The patient's travel bag should accompany them at all times with back -up controller and spare batteries 7. If feasible, bring the patient's power module, cable , and display module to the hospital 8. All patients should carry a spare pump controller with them 9. The most common cause for VA D alarms are low batteries or battery failures 10. Although automatic non -invasive blood pressure cuffs are often ineffective in measuring systolic and diastolic pressure, if they do obtain a measurement, the MAP is usually accurate 11. Other VAD complications : a. Infection b. Stroke/TIA c. Bleeding d. Arrhythmias e. Cardiac tamponade f. CHF g.

Avoid if prolonged QT or CHF 2. If torsades, give magnesium 1-2 g IV over 10 minutes 3. Amioda rone 150 mg IV over 10 minutes a. May repeat if needed Upda ted January 5, 201 9 39 b. Administration of amiodarone, if needed, should follow procainamide in patients with Wolff -Parkinson -White syndrome viii. Irregular Wide Complex Tachycardia - Unstable 1. Deliver a synchronized shock based on manufacturer's recommendation 2. For responsive patients, consider sedation 2. Pediatric Management a. Manage airway as necessary b. Administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 94 -98% saturation c. Initiate monitoring and pe rform 12 -lead EKG d. Establish IV access e. Check blood glucose and treat hypoglycemia per the Hypoglycemia guideline f. Consider the following additional therapies if tachycardia and symptoms or hemodynamic instability continu e: i. Regular Narrow Complex Tachycardia - Stable (SVT) 1. Perform vagal maneuvers 2. Adenosine 0.1 mg/kg (maximum of 6 mg) a. If unsuccessful, may repeat with 0.2 mg/kg (maximum of 12 mg) ii. Regular Narrow Complex Tachycardia - Unstable 1. Deliver a synchronized shock: 0.5-1 J/kg for the first dose 2. Repeat doses should be 2 J/kg iii. Regular, Wide Complex Tachycardia - Stable 1. Consider adenosine 0.1 mg/kg (maximum of 6 mg) for SVT with aberrancy 2. Otherwise give amiodarone 5 mg/kg IV (maximum of 150 mg) over 10 minutes iv. Regular, Wide Complex Tachycardia - Unstable 1. Synchronized cardioversion 0.5 -1.0 J/kg Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. c. Hydrogen (acidosis) d. f. g. Toxins/Overdose i. Tamponade j. Tension pneumothorax k. Thrombus - central or peripheral l. Trauma m. Hyperthyroidism 2. Atrial fibrillation rarely requires cardioversion in the field. As it is difficult to ascertain onset of rhythm, risk of stroke needs to be con sidered pr ior to cardioversion Upda ted January 5, 201 9 40 3. A wide -complex irregular rhythm should be considered pre -excited atrial fibrillation; extreme care must be taken in these patients a. Characteristic EKG findings include a short PR interval and, in some cases, a delta wave b. Avoid AV nodal blocking agents such as adenosine, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, and possibly beta -blockers in patients with pre -excitation atrial fibrillation (e.g. Wolff - Parkinson -White Syndrome, Lown -Ganong -Levine Syndrome) because these drugs may cause a paradoxi cal increase in the ventricular response c. Blocking the AV node in some of these patients may lead to impulses that are transmitted exclusively down the accessory pathway, which can result in ventricular fibrillation d. Amiodarone or procainamide may be used as an alternative 4. Amiodarone or procainamide can be used as a rate -controlling agent for patients who are intolerant of or unresponsive to other agents, such as patients with CHF who may not otherwise tolerate diltiazem or metoprolol a. Caution should be exerci sed in those who are not receiving anticoagulation, as amiodarone can promote cardioversion 5. Administer metoprolol to patients with SBP greater than 120 mmHg a. Worsening CHF, COPD, asthma, as well as hypotension and bradycardia can occur with use of metoprolo l 6. Biphasic waveforms have been proven to convert atrial fibrillation at lower energies and higher rates of success than monophasic waveforms a. Strategies include dose escalation (70, 120, 150, 170 J for biphasic or 100, 200, 300, 360 J for monophasic) versus beginning with single high energy/highest success rate for single shock delivered 7. Studies in infants and children have demonstrated the effectiveness of adenosine for the treatment of hemodynamically stable or unstable SVT 8. Adenosine should be considered t he preferred medication for stable SVT a. Verapamil may be considered as alternative therapy in older children but should not be routinely used in infants b. Procainamide or amiodarone given by a slow IV infusion with careful hemodynamic monitoring may be considered for refractory SVT Pertinent Assessment Findings No recommendations Patient Safety Considerations 1. Only use one antidysrhythmic at a time 2. Patients who receive metoprolol and diltiazem are at significant risk for hypotension and bradycardia 3. If us ing cardioversion, consider sedation and pain control 4. With irregular wide complex tachycardia (atrial fibrillation with aberrancy such as Wolff - Parkinson -White and Lown -Ganong Levine), avoid use of AV nodal blocking agents (e.g. adenosine, calcium channel blockers, beta blockers) 5. Patients with Wolff -Parkinson -White should be given procainamide prior to amiodarone Upda ted January 5, 201 9 41 Quality Improvement Associated NEMSIS Protocol(s) (eProtocol.01) 9914199 - Medical -Tachycardia 9914151 (With Pulse) 9914147 - Medical -Supraventricular Tachycardia (Including Atrial Fibrillation) Key Documentation Elements Initial rhythm and all rhythm changes Time, dose and response to medications given Cardioversion times, synchronization, attempts, joules and response Obtain monitor strips after each intervention Patient weight Pediatric length -based tape color (for pediatrics who fit on tape) History of event supporting treatment of underlying cause s Performance Measures Time to clinical improvement from patient contact Blood sugar obtained Correct medication(s) and dose given for patient condition, age and weight Correct cardioversion joules delivered given patient weight and/or condition Use of sed ation for responsive patient EMS Compass \u00ae Measures (for additional information, see www.emscompass.org ) o PEDS -03: Documentation of estimated weight in kilograms.

Revision Date September 8, 2017 Upda ted January 5, 201 9 49 Abuse and Maltreatment Aliases Maltreatment of vulnerable populations Definitions 1. Abuse/ Maltreatment : Any act or series of acts of commission or omission by a caregiver or person in a position of power over the patient that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to a patient 2. Child Maltreatment/Abuse : Child maltreatment includes any act or series of acts of commission or omission by a parent or other caregiver that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to a child. An act of commission (child abuse) is the physical, s exual or emotional maltreatment or neglect of a child or children. An act of omission (child neglect) includes, but is not limited to, failure to provide for the child's needs ( e.g. physical, emotional, medical/dental, and educational neglect) and failure to supervise ( e.g. inadequate supervision or safety precautions, lack of appropriate car seat use , and exposure to violent or dangerous environments) 3. Human Trafficking : when people are abducted or coerced into service and often transported across international borders. Signs may include, but are not limited to: patient with branding/tattoos and environmental clues such as padlocks and/or doorknobs removed on interior doors, and intac t windows that are boarded up Patient Care Goals 1. Recognize a ny act or series of acts of commission or omission by a caregiver or person in a position of power over the patient that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to a patient 2. Take ap propriate steps to protect the safety of the responders as well as bystanders 3. Get the patient out of immediate danger 4. Assess any patient injuries that may be the result of acute or chronic events 5. Attempt to preserve evidence whenever possible; however, the overriding concern should be providing appropriate emergency care to the patient Patient Presentation 1. Clues to abuse or maltreatment can vary with age group of the patient and type of abuse 2. Not all abuse or maltreatment is physical 3. EMS role is to: a. Docume nt concerns b. Assess potentially serious injuries c. Disclose concerns to appropriate authorities d. Initiate help to get the patient into a safe situation e. Not to investigate or intervene beyond the steps above f. Leave further intervention to law enforcement personnel Upda ted January 5, 201 9 50 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Absolute inclusion/exclusion criteria are not possible in this area. Rather, clues consistent with different types of abuse/maltreatment should be sought: 1. Potent ial clues to abuse/ maltreatment from caregivers or general environment: a. Caregiver apathy about patient's current situation b. Caregiver overreaction to questions about situation c. Inconsistent histories from caregivers or bystanders regarding what happened d. Information provided by caregivers or patient that is not consistent with injury patterns e. Injuries not appropriate for patient's age or physical abilities (e.g. infants with injuries usually associated with ambulatory children, elders who have limited mobility with injury mechanisms inconsistent with their capab ilities) f. Caregiver not allowing adult patient to speak for themself , or who appears controlling - pay special attention to patients who cannot communicate due to young age or language and/or cultural barriers g. Inadequate safety precautions or facilities where the patient lives and/or evidence of security measures that appear to confine the patient inappropriately 2. Potential clues to abuse or maltreatment that can be obtained from the patient: a. Multiple bruises in various stages of healing b. Age-inappropriate behavior (e.g. adults who are submissive or fearful, children who act in a sexually inappropriate way) c. Pattern burns, bruises, or scars suggestive of specific weaponry used d. Evidence of medical neglect for injuries or infections e. Unexplained trauma to genitourinary systems or frequent infections to this system f. Evidence of malnourishment and/or serious dental problems 3. Have a high index of suspicion for abuse in children presenting with a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) [see BRUE guideline ] Patient Management Assessment 1. Start with a primary survey and identify any potentially life -threatening issues 2. Document thorough secondary survey to identify clues of for potential abuse/maltreatment: a. Inability to c ommunicate due to developmental age, language and/or cultural barrier b. Multiple bruises in various stages of healing c. Age- inappropriate behavior (e.g. adults who are submissive or fearful, children who act in a sexually inappropriate way) d. Pattern burns, bru ises, or scars suggestive of specific weaponry used e. Evidence of medical neglect for injuries or infections f. Unexplained trauma to genitourinary systems or frequent infections to this system g. Evidence of malnourishment and/or serious dental problems 3. Assess ph ysical issues and avoid extensive investigation of the specifics of abuse or maltreatment, but document any statements made spontaneously by patient a. Avoid asking directed questions of a child Upda ted January 5, 201 9 51 Treatment and Interventions 1. Address life -threatening issues 2. Remove the patient to a safe place even if no medical indication for transport 3. Report concerns about potential abuse/maltreatment to law enforcement immediately, in accordance with state law, about: a. Caregivers impeding your ability to assess/transport pati ent b. Caregivers refusing care for the patient 4. For patients transported, report concerns to hospital and/or law enforcement personnel per mandatory reporting laws Patient Safety Considerations 1. If no medical emergency exists , the next priority is safe patient disposition/removal from the potentially abusive situation 2. Do not confront suspected perpetrators of abuse/maltreatment. This can create an unsafe situation for EMS and for the patient Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. All states have sp ecific mandatory reporting laws that dictate which specific crimes such as suspected abuse or maltreatment must be reported and to whom they must be reported. It is important to be familiar with the specific laws in your state including specifically who must make disclosures, what the thresholds are for disclosures, and to whom the disclosures must be made . 2. Clues to abuse or maltreatment can vary depending on the age group of the patient and on the nature of the abuse. Remember that not all abuse or maltrea tment involves physical harm. It is important to realize that the job of EMS is to document their concerns, assess the patient for potentially serious injuries, make sure that their concerns are disclosed to the appropriate legal authorities, and work towa rds getting the patient into a safe situation. EMS personnel should not take it upon themselves to investigate, interview, or intervene above and beyond those concepts and should leave further intervention to the appropriate law enforcement personnel. 3. It is very important to have a high index of suspicion for abuse in children presenting with a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE). Of the very serious causes of BRUE , child abuse has been found in as many as 11% of cases. One retrospective review noted th at a c all to 911 for BRUE was associated with an almost 5 times greater odds of abusive head trauma being diag nosed as the cause of the BRUE, clearly emphasizing the high index of suspicion EMS providers must have when responding to these calls. 4. Abuse and maltreatment can happen to patients of all ages 5. Patients may be unwilling or unable to disclose abuse or maltreatment so the responsibility falls on EMS personnel to assess the situation, document appropriately, and take appropriate action to secure a saf e place for the patient . 6. Document findings by describing what you see and not ascribing possible causes ( e.g. \"0.5- inch round burn to back\" as opposed to \"burn consistent with cigarette burn\") . 7. Providers should be knowledgeable about mandatory reporting st atutes in their area, especially regarding adults (domestic violence, elder abuse) .

Pediatrics : 1 mg/kg IM/IV/PO (maximum dose of 25 mg) 2. Physical Management Devices a. Body i. Stretcher straps should be applied as the standard procedure for all patients during transport ii. Physical management devices , including stretcher straps, should never restrict the patient's chest wall motion iii. If necessary, sheets may be used as improvised supplemental stretcher straps. Other forms o f improvised physical management devices should be discouraged iv. Supplemental straps or sheets may be necessary to prevent flexion/extension of torso, hips, legs by b eing placed around the lower lumbar region, below the buttocks, and ov er the t highs, knees, and legs b. Extremities i. Soft or leather devices should not require a key to release them ii. Secure all four extremities to maximize safety for patient, staff, and others iii. Secure all extremities to the stationary frame of the stretcher iv. Multiple knot s should not be used to secure a device Upda ted January 5, 201 9 56 Patient Safety Considerations The management of violent patients requires a constant reevaluation of the risk/benefit balance for the patient and bystanders in order to provide the safest care for all involved. Thes e are com plex and high -risk encounters. There is no one size fits all solution for addressing these patients. 1. Don PPE 2. Do not attempt to enter or control a scene where physical violence or weapons are present 3. Dispatch law enforcement immediately to secure and maintain scene safety 4. Urgent de -escalation of patient agitation is imperative in the interest of patient safety as well as for EMS personnel and others on scene 5. Uncontrolled or poorly controlled patient agitation and physical violence can place the patient at risk for sudden cardiopulmonary arrest due to the following etiologies: a. Excited delirium/exhaustive mania : A postmortem diagnosis of exclusion for sudden death thought to result from metabolic acidos is (most likely from lactate) stemming from physical agitation or physical control measures and potentially exacerbated by stimulant drugs ( e.g. cocaine) or alcohol withdrawal b. Positional asphyxia : Sudden death from restriction of chest wall movement and/o r obstruction of the airway secondary to restricted head or neck positioning resulting in hypercarbia and/or hypoxia 6. Apply a cardiac monitor as soon as possible, parti cularly when pharmacologic management medications have been administered 7. All patients who have received pharmacologic management medications must be monitored closely for the development of hypoventilation and oversedation a. Utilize capnography if available 8. Patients who have received antipsychotic me dication for pharmacologic management must be monitored closely for the potential development of: a. Dystonic reactions (this can easily be treated with diphenhydramine/benzodiazepines) b. Mydriasis (dilated pupils) c. Ataxia d. Cessation of e. mucous membranes f. Cardiac arrhythmias (particularly QT p rolongation) 9. Placement of stretcher in sitting position prevents aspiration and reduces the patient's physical strength by placing the abdominal muscles in the flexed position 10. Patients who are more physically uncooperative should be physically secured with one arm above the head and the other arm below the waist, and both lower extrem ities individually secured 11. The following techniques should be expressly prohibited by EMS providers: a. Secure or transport in a prone position with or without hands and feet behind the back (hobbling or \"hog -tying\") b. \"Sandwiching\" patients between backboards c. Techniques that constrict the neck or compromise the airway d. EMS provider use of weapons as adjunct s in mana ging a patient 12. Concurrent use of IM/IV benzodiazepines and olanzapine IM is not recommended as fatalities have been reported Upda ted January 5, 201 9 57 Notes/Educational Pearls Key considerations 1. Direct medical oversight should be contacted at any time for advice, especially when patient's level of agitation is such that transport may place all parties at risk 2. Transport by air is not advised 3. Stretchers with adequate foam padding, particularly around the head, facilitates patient's ability to self -position the head and neck to main tain airway patency 4. For pat ients with key -locking devices, applied by another agency, consider the following options: a. Remove device and replace it wit h a device that does not require a key b. Administer pharmacologic management medication then remove and repl ace device with another non -key-locking device after patient has become more cooperative c. Transport patient, accompanied in patient compartment by person who has device key d. Transport patient in vehicle of person with device key if medical condition of pati ent is deemed stable, direct medical oversight so authorizes, and law allows Pertinent assessment findings 1. Continuous monitoring of: a. Airway patency b. Respiratory status with pulse oximetry and/or capnography c. Circulatory status with frequent blood pressure m easurements d. Mental status and trends in level of patient cooperation e. Cardiac status, especially if the pati ent has received pharmacologic management medication f.

Provide timely therapy for potentially life -threatening reactions to known or suspected allergens to prevent cardiorespir atory collapse and shock 2. Provide symptomatic relief for symptoms due to known or suspected allergens Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria Patien ts of all ages with suspected allergic reaction and/or anaphylaxis Exclusion Criteria No recommendations Patient Management Assessment 1. Evaluate for patent airway and presence of oropharyngeal edema 2. Auscultate for wheezing and assess level of respiratory effort 3. Assess for adequacy of perfusion 4. Assess for presence of signs of anaphylaxis a. Anaphylaxis - More severe and is characterized by an acute onset involving: i. The skin (urticaria) and/or mucosa with either respiratory compromise or decreased BP or signs of end -organ dysfunction OR ii. Hypotension for that patient after exposure to a known allergen 1. Adults : Systolic BP 90 2. Pediatrics : see Appendix VIII - Abnormal Vital Signs OR iii. Two or more of the following occur ring rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen: 1. Skin and/or mucosal involvement (urticaria, itchy, swollen tongue/lips) a. Skin involvement may be ABSENT in up to 40% of cases of anaphylaxis 2. Respiratory compromise (dysp nea, wheeze, stridor, hypoxemia) 3. gastrointestinal al ) 4. or associated symptoms (syncope, hypotonia, incontinence) b. Non -anaphylactic Allergic Reaction i. Signs involving only one organ system ( e.g. localized angioedema that does not compromise the airway, or not associated with vomitin g; hives alone) Upda ted January 5, 201 9 60 Treatment and Interventions 1. If signs of allergic reaction with out signs of anaphylaxis, go to Step 4 2. If signs of anaphylaxis, a dminister epinephrine 1mg/mL at the following dose and route: a. Adult (25kg or more) 0.3 mg IM in the anterolateral thigh b. Pediatric (less than 25kg) 0.15 mg in the anterolateral thigh c. Epinephrine 1mg/mL may be administered from a vial or via auto-injector, if available 3. For urticaria or pruritus, administer a diphenhydramine 1 mg/kg, up to maximum dose of 50 mg IM, IV, or PO) a. The IV route is preferred for the patient in severe shock b. As a supplement to d iphenhydramine given for urticaria, any H2 -blocking antihistamine ( e.g. famotidine, cimetidine) can be give n IV or PO in conjunction with diphenhydramine 4. If respiratory distress with wheezing is present , consider administering a. Albuterol 2.5 -5 mg Epinephrine 1mg/mL, 5mL nebulized 5. administering e pinephrine 1mg/mL, 5mL 6. If signs of anaphylaxis a hypoperfusion persi st following the first dose of epinephrine, additional IM epinephrine can be repeated every 5 -15 minutes at above noted doses 7. For signs of hypoperfusion, also administer 20 mL/kg isotonic fluid ( normal sal ine or lactated Ringer's) rapidly (over 15 minutes) via IV or IO, and repeat as needed for ongoing hypoperfusion 8. Consider an e pinephrine IV drip (0.5 mcg/kg/minute) when cardiovascular collapse (hypotension with altered mental status, pallor, diaphoresis and/or delayed c apillary refill) is present despite repeated IM doses of epinephrine in conjunction with at least 60 mL/kg isotonic fluid boluses 9. Transport as soon as possible, and perform ongoing assessment as indicated. Cardiac monitoring is not required, but should be considered for those with known heart problems or who received multiple doses of epinephrine Patient Safety Considerations 1. Time to epinephrine delivery 2. Concentration of epinephrine in relation to route 3. Weight -based dosing of medications Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Allergic reactions and anaphylaxis are serious and potentially life -threatening medical emergencies. It is the body's adverse reaction to a foreign protein ( e.g. food, medicine, pollen, insect sting or any ingested, inhaled, or injected substance). A localized allergic reaction (e. g. urticaria or angioedema that does not compromise the airway) may be treated with antihistamine therapy. When anaphylaxis is suspecte d, EMS personnel should always consider epinephrine as first -line treatment. Cardiovascular collapse may occur abruptly, without the prior development of skin or respiratory symptoms. Constant monitoring of the patient's airway and breathing is essential . 2. Contrary to common belief that all cases of anaphylaxis present with cutaneous manifestations, such as urticaria or mucocutaneous swelling, a significant portion of Upda ted January 5, 201 9 61 anaphylactic episodes may not involve these signs and symptoms on initial presentation . Mor eover, most fatal reactions to food -induced anaphylaxis in children were not associated with cutaneous manifestations . 3. A thorough assessment and a high index of suspicion are required for all poten tial allergic reaction patients - consider: a. History of Pres ent Illness i. Onset and location ii. Insect sting or bite iii. Food allergy/exposure iv. New clothing, soap, detergent v. Past history of reactions vi. Medication history b. Signs and Symptoms i. Itching or urticaria ii. Coughing, wheezing, or respiratory distress iii. Chest tightness or thro at constriction iv. Hypotension or shock v. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) vi. Altered mental status c. Other Considerations i. Angioedema (drug -induced) ii. Aspiration/airway obstruction iii. Vasovagal event iv. Asthma or COPD v. Heart failure 4. Gastrointestinal symptoms occur most commonly in food -induced anaphylaxis, but can occur with other causes a. Oral pruritus is often the first symptom observed in patients experiencing food -induced anaphylaxis b. Abdominal cramping is also common, but nausea, vo miting, and diarrhea are frequently observed as well 5. Patients with asthma are at high risk for a severe allergic reaction 6. There is no proven benefit to using steroids in the management of allergic reactions and/or anaphylaxis 7. There is controversy among ex perts with very low quality evidence to guide management for the use of empiric IM epinephrine after exposure to a known allergen in asymptomatic patients with a history of prior anaphylaxis Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Presence or absence of angioedema 2. Presence or absence of respiratory compromise 3. Presence or absence of circulatory compromise 4. Localized or generalized urticaria 5.

Asymptomatic hyperglycemia poses no risk to the patient while inappropriately aggressive interventions to manage blood sugar can harm patients Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. New onset diabetic ketoacidosis in pediatric patients commonly presents with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and/or urinary frequency 2. Consider causes for hyperglycemia by thinking about the 3 I's: a. Insulin - this refers to any medication changes for insulin or oral medicati ons including poor compliance or malfunctioning insulin pump b. Ischemia - this refers to hyperglycemia sometimes being an indication of physiologic stress in a patient and can be a clue to myocardial ischemia in particular c. Infection - underlying infection ca n cause derangements in glucose control Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Concomitant trauma 2.

Constitutional: assess for tachycardia and hypot ension c. Eyes: assess for sunken eyes from dehydration d. Nose /mouth/ ears: assess for dry mucus membranes or tongue bite from seizure e. Neurologic: i. Assess GCS and mental status ii. Assess for focal neurologic deficit: motor and sensory Treatment and Interventions 1. If altered level of consciousness or stroke, treat per Altered Mental Status or Suspected Stroke/Transient Ischemic Attack guidelines accord ingly 2. If blood glucose is 60 mg/dL or less administer one of the following: a. Conscious patient with a patent airway: i. Glucose, oral (in form of glucose tablets, glucose gel, tube of cake icing, etc.) 1. Adult Dosing: 25 g 2. Pediatric Dosing: 0.5 -1 g/kg Upda ted January 5, 201 9 77 b. Unconsciou s patient, or patients who are unable to protect their own airway: i. Dextrose IV - administer in incremental doses until mental status improves or maximum field dosing is reached 1. Maximum field adult dosing : 25 g of 10 -50% dextrose IV a. 50 mL of 50% dextrose b. 100 mL of 25% dextrose c. 250 mL of 10% dextrose 2. Maximum field pediatric dosing : 0.5 -1 g/kg of 10 -25% dextrose IV a. 2 - 4 mL /kg of 25% dextrose b. 4 - 8 mL /kg of 12.5% dextrose c. 5 - 10 mL 10% ii. Glucagon IM/IN 1. Adult dosing: mg IM/IN 2. Pediatric dosing: a. 1 mg IM/IN if 20 kg (or 5 yo) b. 0.5 mg IM/IN if less than 20 kg (or less than 5 y o) iii. Remove or disable insulin pump if above treatments cannot be completed c. For patients with an insulin pump who are hypoglycemic with associated altered mental status (GCS <15): i. Stop the pump, disconnect or remove at insertion site if patient cannot ingest oral glucose or ALS is not available ii. Leave the pump connected and running if able to ingest oral glucose or receive ALS interventions 3. Reassess patient a. Reassess vital signs and mental status b. Repeat check of blood glucose level if previous hypoglycemia and mental status has not returned to normal i. It is not necessary to repeat blood sugar if mental status has returned to normal c. If maximal field dosage of dextrose solution does not achieve euglycemia and normalization of mental status: i. Initiate transport to closest appropriate receiving facility for further treatment of refractory hypoglycemia ii. Evaluate for alternative causes of altered mental status iii. Continue treatment of hy poglycemia using dextrose solutions as noted above 4. Disposition a. If hypoglycemia with continued symptoms, transport to closest appropriate receiving facility b. Hypoglycemic patients who have had a seizure should be transported to the hospital regardless of the ir mental status and response to therapy c. If symptoms of hypoglycemia resolve after treatment, release without transport should only be considered if all of the following are true: i. Repeat glucose is greater than 80 mg/ dL ii. Patient takes insulin or metformin t o control diabetes iii. Patient returns to normal mental status, with no focal neurologic signs/symptoms after receiving glucose/dextrose iv. Patient can promptly obtain and will eat a carbohydrate meal v. Patient or legal guardian refuses transport and EMS providers agree transport not indicated Upda ted January 5, 201 9 78 vi. A reliable adult will be staying with patient vii. No major co -morbid symptoms exist, like chest pain, shortness of breath, seizures, intoxication viii. A clear cause of the hypoglycemia is identified (e.g. missed meal) Patient Safety Considerations 1. Dextrose 10% can be safely used in all ages of patient 2. Dextrose 50% can cause local tissue damage if it extravasates from vein , and may cause hyperglycemia . Dextrose 50% carries risk for little clinical gain. EMS systems may consider carry ing no more than 25% concentration of dextrose for treating hypoglycemia in adults 3. For children 8 yo, dextrose concentration of no more than 25% should be used 4. For neonates and infants 1 month of age, d extrose concentrati on of no more than 10-12.5% s hould be used 5. Sulfonylureas (e.g. glyburide, glipizide) have long half -lives ranging from 12 -60 hours. Patients with corrected hypoglycemia who are taking these agents are at particular risk for recurrent symptoms and freque ntly require hospital admission Notes/Educational Pearls A formula for calculating a 0.5 g/kg dose of IV dextrose: [50] [____ % concentration of glucose] = ____ mL/kg For example: Desired Dose Fluid Consider contribution of oral diabetic medications to hypoglycemi a 2. If possible, have family/patient turn off insulin pumps 3. Consider potential for intentional overdose of hypoglycemic agents 4. Avoid overshoot hyperglycemia when correcting hypoglycemia. Administer dextrose - containing IV fluids in small doses until either mental status improves or a maximum field dose is achieved Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Concomitant trauma 2.

Routine patient care (vital signs) 2. History and physical examination focused on potential causes of nausea and vomiting (e.g. gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, gynecologic, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia) Treatment and Interventions 1. Anti-emetic medication administration (optional, if available; any that can be gi ven IV can be given IO): a. Ondansetron (contraindicated for suspected or known diagnosis of prolonged QT syndrome) 1. Adult : 1. 4mg IV /PO/SL OR 2. 4 mg SL of the ODT formulation ii. Pediatric (6 months old -14 yo): 0.15 mg/kg IV/PO (maximum dose of 4 mg) b. Metocloprami de i. Adult : 10 mg IV/IM ii. Pediatric (over 2 yo only and greater than 12kg): 1. 0.1 mg/kg IM OR 2. IV (maximum 10 mg) a. May repeat x 1 in 20 -30 minutes if no relief c. Prochlorperazine i. Adult : 5 mg IV/IM ii. Pediatric (over 2 yo only and greater than 12kg): 1. 0.1 mg/kg sl ow IV OR 2. Deep IM (maximum 10 mg) d. Diphenhydramine i. Adult : 12.5 -25mg IV/IM/PO ii. Pediatric (over 2 yo on ly and greater than 12kg): 0.1 mg/kg IV (maximum 25 mg) Upda ted January 5, 201 9 81 e. Isopropyl alcohol - Allow patient to inhale vapor from isopropyl alcohol wipe 3 times every 15 minutes as tolerated 2. If signs of hypovolemia, administer Normal Saline a. Adult : 500 mL IV/IO unless contraindicated (e.g. h/o CHF, renal failure) b. Pediatric : Consider 10-20 mL/kg IV f luid unless contraindicated (e.g. by potential fluid overload) c. May repeat as indicated Patient Safety Considerations 1. For very young pediatric patients, Ondansetron can be sedating 2. Dystonic a nd extrapyramidal symptoms are possible side effects of antiemetics - If encountered, consider diphenhydramine: a. Adult : 25-50mg IV/IM/PO b. Pediatric : 1 mg/kg IV/IM/PO (maximum ) Notes/Educational Pearls Key C onsiderations 1. Ondansetron is preferred in children for the treatme nt of nausea and vomiting; 2. Metoclopramide has fewer adverse effects than prochlorperazine in children 3. Prochlorperazine and metoclopramide (phenothiazines) have an increased risk of dystonic reactions a. Some phenothiazines also have an increased risk of respi ratory depression when used with other medications that cause respiratory depression, and some phenothiazines can cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome b. Prochlorpera zine carries a black box warning for children under 2 yo 4. IV form of ondansetron may be given PO in same dose 5. Nausea and vomiting are symptoms of illness - in addition to treating the patient's nausea and vomiting a thorough history and physical are key to identifying what may be a disease in need of emergent treatment (e.g. bowel obstruction, myoc ardial infarction, pregnancy) 6. While ondansetron has not been adequately studied in pregnancy to determine safety, it remains a treatment option for hyperemesis gravidum in pregnant patient Pertinent Assessment Fi ndings 1.

Approaches to pain relief must be designed to be safe and effe ctive in the dynamic prehospital environment. The degree of pain and the hemodynamic status of th e patient will determ ine the urgency and extent of analgesic interventions. Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria Patients who are experiencing pain Exclusion Criteria 1. Pregnancy with active labor 2. Dental pain 3. Patients with care -plans that prohibit use of parenteral analgesics by EMS 4. Patients with chronic p ain who aren't part of a hospice/palliative care plan Patient Management Assessment, Treatment , and Interventions 1.

Greater than 12 yo: Self -report scale (Numeric Rating Scale [NRS]) 2. Place patient on cardiac monitor per patient assessment 3. If available, consider use of non -pharmaceutical pain management techniques a. Placement of the patient in a position of comfort b. Application of ice packs and/or splints for pain secondary to trauma c. Verbal reassurance to control anxiety 4. If not improved and patient is experiencing moderate discomfort consider use of analgesics as available and as permitted by direct medical oversight a. Acetaminophen 15 mg /kg PO (maximum dose 1 g) b. Ibuprofen 10 mg/kg PO for patients greater than 6 months of age (maximum dose 800 mg) c. Fentanyl 1 mcg/kg IN or IM (maximum initial dose of 100 mcg) d. Ketorolac (one -time dose only): i. Adult : 30 mg IM in adults who are not pregnant Upda ted January 5, 201 9 84 ii.

This face [point to face on far left] shows no pain. The faces show more and more pain [point to each from left to right] up to this one [point to face on far right] - it shows very much pain. Point to the face that shows how much you hurt [right now].\" Score the chosen face 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10, count ing left to right, so \"0\" = \"no pain\" and \"10\" = \"very much pain\".

Patient Safety Considerations 1. All patients should have drug allergies identified prior to administration of pain medication 2. Administer opioids with c aution to patients with GCS less than 15, hypotension, identified medication allergy, hypoxia (oxygen saturation less than 90%) after maximal supplemental oxygen therapy, or signs of hypoventilation 3. Opioids are contraindicated for patients who have taken m onoamine ) the previous 14 days 4. Avoid non-steroidal anti -inflammatory medications such as k etorolac in patients with NSAID allergy, aspirin -sensitive asthma, renal insu fficiency, pregnancy, or known peptic ulcer disease 5. Ketorolac should not be used in patients with hypotension (due to renal toxicity) 6. Use of splinting techniques and application of ice should be done to reduce the total amount of medication used to keep th e patient comfortable Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Pain severity (0 - 10) should be recorded before and after analgesic medication administration and upon arrival at destination 2. Patients with acute abdominal pain should receive analgesic interventions - Use of analgesics for acute abdominal pain does not mask clinical findings or delay diagnosis 3. Opiates may cause a rise in intracranial pressure Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Mental status (GCS and pain level) 2. Respiratory system (tidal vol ume, chest rigidity) 3.

Revision Date September 8, 2017 Upda ted January 5, 201 9 91 Seizures (Adapted from an evidence -based guideline created using the National Prehospital Evidence -Based Guideline Model Process) Aliases Status e pilepticu s, febrile seizure, c onvulsions, eclampsia Patient Care Goals 1. Prompt c essation of seizures in the prehospital setting 2. Minimizing adverse events in the treatment of seizures in the prehospital setting 3. Minimizing seizure recurrence during transport Patient Presentation Seizures due to trauma, pregnancy, hyperthermia, or toxic exposure should be managed according to those condition -specific guidelines Inclusion Crite ria Seizure activity upon arrival of prehospital personnel or new/recurrent seizure activity lasting greater than 5 minutes Exclusion Criteria None Patient Management Assessment 1. History a. Duration of current seizure b. Prior history of seizures, diabetes, or hypoglycemia c. Typical appearance of seizures d. Baseline seizure frequency and duration e. Focality of onset, direction of eye deviation f. Concurrent symptoms of apnea, cyanosis, vomiting, bowel/bladder incontinence, or fever g. Bystander administration of medications to stop the seizure h. Current medications, including anticonvulsants i. Recent dose changes or non -compliance with anticonvulsants j. History of trauma, pregnancy, heat exposure, or toxin exposure 2. Exam a. Air entry/airway patency b. Breath sounds, respira tory rate and effectiveness of ventilation c. Signs of perfusion (pulses, capillary refill, color) , focal neurologic deficit or signs of stroke ) Treatment and Interventions 1. If signs of airway obstruction are pre sent and a chin-lift, jaw thrust, positioning, and/or sucti oning does not alleviate it, pl ace oropharyngeal ai rway (if gag reflex is absen t) or Upda ted January 5, 201 9 92 nasopharyn geal air way 2. Place pulse oximeter and/or waveform capnography to monitor oxygenat ion/ventilati on 3. Administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 94 -98% saturation . Use bag-valve -mask ventilation if 4. Assess perfusion 5. Assess neu rologic status 6. Routes for treatment a. IN/IM routes are preferred over rectal (PR), IV, or IO routes, if within the provider's scope of practice i. If none of these routes (IN/IM/IV/IO) of medication administration are in provider's scope of practice, diazepam 0.2 mg/kg PR ( maximum dose 10 mg) is an acceptable route of administration b. IV placement is not necessary for treatment of seizures, but could be obtained if needed for other reasons 7. Anticonvulsant Treatment a. If vascular access is absent: midazolam 0.2 mg/kg (maximum dose 10 mg), IM preferred, or IN b. If vascular access (IV or IO) is present: i. Diazepam 0.1mg/kg IV or IO, maximum 4mg ii. Lorazepam 0.1mg/kg IV or IO, maximum 4mg iii. Midazolam 0.1mg/kg IV or IO, maximum 4mg 7. Glucometry a. If still ac tively seizing, check blood glucose level b. If less than 60 mg/dL, treat per the Hypoglycemia guideline 8. Consider magnesium sulfate in the presence of seizure in the third trimester of pregnancy or post -partum [see the Eclampsia/Pre -eclampsia guideline ] 9. For febrile seizures, consider the following interventions after stopping the seizure, since the following interventions provide symptomatic relief for fevers but do not stop the seizure: a. Acetaminophen 15 mg/kg, maximum dose 650 mg, PR/IV/IO (if unable to swallow) or PO (if able to swallow) AND /OR b. Ketorolac 1 mg/kg, maximum dose 15 mg, IV (if unable to swallow) OR Ibuprofen 10 mg/kg, maximum dose 600 mg, PO (if able to swallow) AND /OR c. Removing excessive layers of clothing AND /OR d. Applying cool compresses to the body 10. Consider acquiring a 12 -lead EKG following cessation of seizure in patients without a history of seizure to determine possible cardiac cause Patient Safety C onsiderations 1. Trained personnel should be able to give medication without contacting direct medical oversight , however, more than two doses of benzodiazepines are associated with high risk of airway compromise a. Use caution, weigh risks/benefits of deferring treatment until hospital, and/or consider consultation with direct medical oversigh t if patient has received two doses of benzodiazepines by bystanders and/or prehospital providers Upda ted January 5, 201 9 93 2. Hypoglycemic patients who are treated in the field for seizure should be transported to hospital, regardless of whether or not they return to baseline mental status after treatment Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Many airway/breathing issues in seizing patients can be managed without intubation or placement of an advanced airway . Reserve these measures for patients that fail less invasive maneuve rs as noted above 2. For children with convulsive status epilepticus requiring medication management in the prehospital setting, trained EMS personnel should be allowed to administer medication without direct medical oversight 3. For new onset seizures or seizures that are refractory to treatment, consider other potential causes including , but not limited to, trauma, stroke, electrolyte abnormality, toxic ingestion, pregnancy with eclampsia , hyperthermia 4. A variety of safe and efficacious doses for benzodiaz epines have been noted in the literature for seizures a. The doses for anticonvulsant treatment noted above are those that are common to the forms and routes of benzodiazepines noted in this guideline b. One dose, rather than a range, has been suggested in order to standardize a common dose in situations when an EMS agency may need to switch from one type of benzodiazepine to another due to cost or resource limitations 5. Recent evidence supports the use of midazolam IM as an intervention that is at least as safe and effective as intravenous lorazepam for prehospital seizure cessation Pertinent Assessment F indings The presence of fever with seizure in children less than 6 months old and greater than 6 yo is not consistent with a simple febrile seizure, and shoul d prompt evaluation for meningitis, encephalitis or other cause Quality Improvement Associated NEMSIS Protocol(s) (eProtocol.01) 9914141 - Medical - Seizure Key Documentation Elements Actively seizing during transport and time of seizure onset/cessation Focality of onset, direction of eye deviation Concurrent symptoms of apnea, cyanosis, vomiting, bowel/bladder incontinence, or fever Medication amounts/routes bystanders or prehospital providers Neurologic status (GCS, nystagmus, pupil size , focal neurologic deficit or signs of stroke ) Blood glucose level Perfo rmance Measures Frequency of performing glucometry Time to administration of anticonvulsant medication Rate of respiratory failure Rate of seizure recurrence Upda ted January 5, 201 9 94 References 1.

Tachycardia for age, out of proportion to temperature [see Appendix VIII - Abnormal Vital Signs ] h. Weak, decreas ed or bounding pulses i. Cool/mottled or flushed/ruddy skin 2. Potential etiologies of shock: a. Hypovolemia (poor fluid intake, excessive fluid loss ( e.g. bleeding, SIADH, hyperglycemia excessive diuretics, vomiting, diarrhea) b. Sepsis i. Temperature instability: 1. Less than 36\u00b0C or 96.8 \u00b0F 2. Greater than 38.5 \u00b0C or 101.3 \u00b0F 3. Tachycardia, warm skin, tachypnea c. Anaphylaxis (urticaria, nausea/vomiting, facial edema, wheezing) d. Signs (hepatomegaly, rales on pulmonary exam, extremity edema, JVD) Exclusion Criteria Shock due to suspected trauma [see Trauma section guidelines ] Upda ted January 5, 201 9 97 Patient Management Assessment 1. History a. History of GI bleeding b. Cardiac problems c. Stroke d. Fever e. Nausea/vomiting, diarrhea f. Frequent or no urination g. Syncopa l episode h. Allergic reaction i. Immunocompromise (malignancy, transplant, asplenia) j. Adrenal insufficiency k. Presence of a central line or port l. Other risk of infection (spina bifida or other genitourinary anatomic abnormality) 2. Exam a. Airway/breathing (airway edema, rales, wheezing, pulse oximetry, respiratory rate) b. Circulation (heart rate, blood pressure, capillary refill) c. Abdomen (hepatomegaly) d. Mucous (turgor, rash) f. Neurologic (GCS, sensorimotor deficits) 3. Determination of type of shock a. Cardiogenic b. Distributive (neurogenic, septic, anaphylactic) c. Hypovolemic e.g. pulmonary embolism, cardiac tamponade, tension pneumothorax) Treatment and Interventions 1. Check vital signs 2. Administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achie ving 94 -98% saturation 3. Cardiac monitor 4. Pulse oximetry and ETCO 2 (reading of less than 25 mmHg may be sign of poor perfusion) 5. Check blood sugar, and correct if less than 60 mg/dl 6. EKG 7. Check lactate, if available ( greater than 2.0 mmol/L is abnormal) 8. Establish IV access - if unable to obtain within 2 attempts or less than 90 seconds, place an IO needle 9. IV fluids (3 0 mL/kg isotonic fluid; maximum of 1 liter) over less than 15 minutes, using a push -pull method of drawing up the fluid in a syringe and pus hing it through the IV (preferred for pediatric patients) - may repeat up to 3 times based on patient's condition and clinical impression 10. If there is a history of adrenal insufficiency or long -term steroid dependence , give: a. Hydrocortisone succinate, 2 mg/k g (maximum 100 IV/IM (preferred) OR b. Methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg IV ( maximum 125 mg) Upda ted January 5, 201 9 98 11. Vasopressors (shock unresponsive to IV fluids) a. Cardiogenic shock, hypovolemic shock, obstructive shock: i. Norepinephrine - there is recent evidence that supports the us e of norepinephrine as the preferred intervention . Although dopamine is often recommended for the treatment of symptomatic bradycardia, recent research indicates that patients in cardiogenic or septic shock treated with norepinephrine have a lower mortalit y rate compared to those treated with dopamine (initial norepinephrine dose: 0. 05 - 0.5 mcg /kg/ effect) ii. Give epinephrine, 0.05 -0.3 mcg/kg/minute iii. Give dopamine, 2 -20 mcg/kg/minute b. Distributive shock (with the exception of norepinephrine, is the first -line drug of choice for neurogenic shock 14. For anaphylactic shock , treat per the Anaphylaxis and Allergic Reaction guideline 15. Provide advanced notification to the hospital 16. Consider empiric antibiotics for suspected septic shock if transport time is anticipated to be greater than 1 hour, if blood cultures can be obtained in advance, and/or EMS has coordinated with regional receiving hospitals about choice of antibiotic therapy 17. Antipyretics for fever a. Acetaminophen (15 mg/kg; maximum dose of 1000 mg) b. Ibuprofen (10 mg/kg; maximum dose of 800 mg) Patient Safety Considerations 1. Recognition of cardiogenic shock - if patient condition deteriorates after fluid administration, rales or hepatomegaly develop, then consider cardiogenic shock and holding further fluid administration Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Early, aggressive IV fluid administration is essential in the tr eatment of suspected shock 2. Patients predisposed to shock: a. Immunocompromised (patients undergoing chemotherapy or with a primary or acquired b. Adrenal insufficiency or recent steroi d use) c. History of a solid organ or bone marrow transplant d. Infants e. Elderly 3. In most adults, t achycardia is the first sign of compensated shock, and may persist for hours . Tachycardia can be a late sign of shock in children and a tachycardic child may be clo se to cardiovascular collapse 4. Hypotension indicates uncompensated shock, which may progress to cardiopulmonary failure within minutes 5. Hydrocortisone succinate, if available, is preferred over methylprednisolone and dexamethasone for the patient with adrena l insufficiency, because of its dual glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid effects Upda ted January 5, 201 9 99 a. Patients with no reported history of adrenal axis dysfunction may have adrenal suppression due to their acute illness, and hydrocortisone should be considered for any patient showing signs of treatment -resistant shock b. Patients with adrenal insufficiency may have an emergency dose of hydrocortisone available that can be administered IV or IM Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Decreased perfusion manifested by altered mental status, or abnormalities in capillary refill or pulses , decreased urine output Cardiogenic, hypovolemic, obstructive shock : capillary refil l greater than 2 seconds, diminished peripheral pulses, mottled cool extremities b. Distr ibutive shock : flash capillary refill, 9914127 - Medical -Hypotension/Shock (Non -Trauma) Key Documentation Elements Medications administered Full vital signs with reassessment every 15 minutes or as appropriate Lactate level (if available) Neurologic status assessment [see Appendix VII ] Amount of fluids given Performance Measures Percentage of patients who have full vital signs (HR, RR, BP, T, O2) documented Presence of a decision support tool (laminated card, a protocol, or electronic alert) to identify patients in shock Percentage of patients with suspected shock for whom advanced notification to the hospital was pr ovided Mean time from abnormal vitals to initiation of a fluid bolus Percentage of patients who receive pressors for ongoi ng hypotension after receiving 3 0 mL/kg isotonic fluid in the setting of shock Reference s 1.

Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) 2. Preservation of neurologic function 3. High-quality chest compressions/ CPR with minimal interruption from recognition of cardiac arrest until confirmation of ROSC or field termination of care Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria Patients with cardiac arrest Exclusion Criteria 1. Patients suffering cardiac arrest due to severe hypothermia [see Hypothermia/Cold Exposure guideline ] 2. Patients with identifiable Do Not Resuscitate (or equivalent such as POLST) order [see Do Not Resuscitate Status/Advance Directive/Hea lthcare Power of Attorney (POA) Status guideline ] 3. Patients in arrest due to traumatic etiology [see General Trauma Management guideline ] Patient Management Assessment 1. The patient in cardiac arrest requires a prompt balance of treatment and assessment 2. In cases of cardiac arrest, assessments should be focused and limited to obtaining enough information to reveal the patient is pulseless 3. Once pulselessness is discovered, treatment should be initiated immediately and any further history must be obtained by bystanders while treatment is ongoing Treatment and Interventions The most important therapies for patients suffering from cardiac arrest are prompt cardiac defibrillation and minimally interrupted effective chest compressions 1. Initiate chest compressions in cases with no bystander chest compressions or take over compressions from bystanders while a second rescuer is setting up the AED or defibrillator a. If adequate, uninterrupted bystander CPR has been performe d or if the patient arrests in front of the EMS providers, immediately proceed with rhythm analysis and defibrillation, if appropriate b. It is realistic for EMS providers to tailor the sequence of rescue actions to the most likely cause of arrest c. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against delaying defibrillation to provide a period of CPR for patients in VF/pulseless VT out -of-hospital cardiac arrest Upda ted January 5, 201 9 106 d. For adults and children with unmonitored cardiac arrest or for whom an AED is not immediatel y available, it is reasonable that CPR be initiated while the defibrillator equipment is being retrieved and applied and that defibrillation, if indicated, be attempted as soon as the device is ready for use 2. The maximum setting on the defibrillator should be used for initial and subsequent defibrillation attempts. Defibrillation dosing should follow manufacturer's recommendation in the case of biphasic defibrillators . If the manufacturer's recommendation is unknown, use highest setting possible . In the case of monophasic devices, the setting should be 360 J (or 4 J/kg for children) 3. Chest compressions should resume immediately after defibrillation attempts with no pauses for pulse checks for 2 minutes regardless of the rhythm displayed on the cardiac monitor 4. All attempts should be made to prevent avoidable interruptions in chest compressions, such as pre -charging the defibrillator and hovering over the chest, rather than stepping away during defibrillations 5. If feasible, IV or IO access should be obtained. Admi nister epinephrine during the first or second round of compressions 6. Continue the cycle of chest compressions for 2 minutes, followed by rhythm analysis and defibrillation of shockable rhythms ; dur ing this period of time, the proper strategy of airway manag ement is currently not defined and many options for airway management exist - Regardless of the airway management and ventilation strategy, consider the following principles: a. The airway management strategy should not interrupt compressions b. Successful resu scitation from cardiac arrest depends primarily on effective, minimally - interrupted chest compressions and prompt defibrillation ; airway management is of secondary importance and should not interfere with compressions and defibrillation - Options for airwa y management include: i. Passive ventilation: 1. High flow oxygen is applied via a non -rebreather mask with an oropharyngeal airway 2. Some oxygen will be entrained with each decompression of the chest 3. This may be applied for the first 3 -4 compression cycles (6 -8 minutes), after which one may consider BVM ventilation or placement of an advanced airway (as below). ii. BVM ventilation at 10 breaths per minute (1 breath every 10 compressions), applied during the upstroke between compressions, without interrupting the comp ressions iii. BVM ventilation with 30:2 ventilation to compression ratio: Each 30 compressions, the compressions are paused briefly to allow 2 BVM ventilations, then compressions immediately resumed 1. Pediatric Consideration: For multiple rescuer CPR in children, 15:2 is the recommended compression to ventilation ratio. (30:2 for single rescuer). 2. Pediatric Consideration: For neonates, 3:1 is the recommended compression to ventilation ratio. iv. Advanced airway placement: 1. Either a supraglottic airway or an en dotracheal tube may be placed without interruption of compressions 2. Ventilations are provided at 10 breaths/minute for adults Upda ted January 5, 201 9 107 3. Pediatric Consideration: for children, 1 breath every 3 -5 seconds is recommended ( 12-20 breaths/minute) c. Pediatric Consideration: deliver volume needed to achieve chest rise 7. Consider use of antiarrhythmic for recurrent VF/Pulseless VT a. The principal objective of antiarrhythmic drug therapy in shock -refractory VF and pulseless VT is to facilitate the restoration and maintenance of a spon taneous perfusing rhythm in concert with the shock termination of VF/VT ; some antiarrhythmic drugs have been associated with increased rates of ROSC and hospital admission, but none have yet been proven to increase long -term survival or survival with good neurologic outcome i. Amiodarone (5 mg/kg IV, max of 300 mg) may be considered for VF/pulseless VT that is unresponsive to CPR, defibrillation, and a vasopressor therapy ii. Lidocaine (1 mg/kg IV) may be considered as an alternative to amiodarone for VF/pulseles s VT that is unresponsive to CPR, defibrillation, and vasopressor therapy iii. The routine use of magnesium for VF/pulseless VT is not recommended in adult patients b. There is inadequate evidence to support the routine use of lidocaine and beta blockers after cardiac arrest by EMS - There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the routine initiation or continuation of other antiarrhythmic medications after ROSC from cardiac arrest c. For torsades de pointes, give magnesium sulfate 2 g IV (or 25 -50 m g/kg for pediatrics ). There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the routine administration during cardiac arrest 8. Consider reversible causes of cardiac arrest which include the following: a. Hypothermia - additions to care include attempts at active rewarming [see Hypothermia/Cold Exposure guideline ] b. The dialysis patient/known hyperkalemic patient - Additions to care include the following: i. Calcium gluconate 10% 1 g IV (for pediatrics the dose is 100 mg/kg) OR ii. Calcium chloride 10% 10ml IV (for pediatrics , the dose is 20 mg/kg which is 0.2 mL/kg) iii. Sodium bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg IV c. Tricyclic antidepressant overdose - Additions to care include s odium bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg IV d. Hypovolemia - Additions to ca re include n ormal saline 2 L IV (or 20 mL/kg, repeated up to 3 times for pediatrics ) e. If the patient is intubated at the time of arrest, assess for tension pneumothorax and misplaced ETT f. If tension pneumothorax suspected, perform needle decompression . Asse ss ETT, if misplaced, replace ETT 9. If at any time during this period of resuscitation the patient regains return of spontaneous circulation, treat per Adult Post -ROSC Care guideline 10. If resuscitation remains ineff ective, consider termination of resuscitation [see Termination of Resuscitative Efforts guideline ] Upda ted January 5, 201 9 108 Patient Safety Considerations 1. Performing manual chest compressions in a moving vehicle may pose a provider safety concern 2. In addition, manual chest compressions during patient movement are less effective in regards to hands on time, depth, recoil and rate 3. Ideally, patients should be resuscitated as close to the scene as operationally possible 4. Risks and benefits should be considered before patient movement in cardiac arrest situations. Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Effective chest compressions and defibrillation are the most important therapies to the patient in cardiac arrest. Effective chest compressions are defined as: a. A rate of greater than 100 and less than 120 compressions/minute b. Depth of at least 2 inches ( 5 cm) and less than 2.4 inches (6cm) for adults and children or 1.5 inches (4 cm) for infants ; adolescents who have entered puberty should receive the same depth of chest compressions as an adult c. Allow for complete chest recoil (avoid leaning) d. Minimize int erruptions in compressions e. Avoid rescuer fatigue by rotating re scuers at least every 2 minutes. Some EMS pit crew approaches use a provider on either side of the chest, alternating compressions every minute or every 100 compressions to avoid fatigue 2. Avoid excessive ventilation and c onsider delayed airway management - If no advanced airway, consider : a. Passive ventilation using an NRB with 3 -4 cycles of uninterrupted chest compressions (for arrests of suspected cardiac etiology). Consider BVM ventilation or ad vanced airway after 3 -4 cycles b. BVM ventilation every 10 -15 compressions with cycles of uninterrupted chest compressions . Upstroke ventilation between compressions.30:2 ventilation to compression ratio for adults, and 15:2 for childr en when 2 rescuers are present c. If an advanced airway is placed, ventilations should not exceed 10 breaths/minute (1 breath every 6 seconds or 1 breath every 10 compressions) in adults . Pediatric Consideration: For children with an advanced airway, 1 breath every 3 -5 seconds is recommended (equivalent to 12-20 breaths/minute) 3. Quantitative end -tidal CO 2 should be used to monitor effectiveness of chest compressions a. If ETCO 2 less than 10 mmHg during the initial phases of resuscitation, attempt to improve chest compression quality b. Consider additional monitoring with biometric feedback which may imp rove compliance with suggested Resuscitation section guidelines 4. Chest compressions are usually the most rapidly applied therapy for the patient in cardiac arrest and should be applied as soon as the patient is noted to be pulseless . If the patient is being monitored with pads in place at the time of arrest, immediate defibrillation should take precedence over all other therapies, however, if there is any del ay in defibrillation (for instance, in order to place pads), chest compressions should be initiated while the defibrillator is being applied . There is no guidance on how long these initial compressions should be applied ; however, it is reasonable to either complete between 30 seconds and 2 minutes of chest compressions in cases of no bystander chest compressions or to perform Upda ted January 5, 201 9 109 defibrillation as soon as possible after chest compressions initiated in cases of witnessed arrest . 5. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of extracorporeal CPR (ECPR) for patients with cardiac arrest - In settings where it can be rapidly implemented, ECPR may be considered for select cardiac arrest patients for whom the suspected etiology of the cardiac arrest is p otentially reversible during a limited period of mechanical cardiorespiratory support 6. Chest compressions should be reinitiated immediately after defibrillation as pulses, if present, are often difficult to detect and rhythm and pulse checks interrupt compressions 7. Continue chest compressions between completion of AED analysis and AED charging 8. Effectiveness of chest compressions decreases with any movements a. Patients should therefore be resuscitated as close to the point at which they are first encountere d and should only be moved if the conditions on scene are unsafe or do not operationally allow for resuscitation b. Chest compressions are also less effective in a moving vehicle c. It is also dangerous to EMS providers, patients, pedestrians , and other motorist s to perform chest compressions in a moving ambulance d. For these reasons and because in most cases the care provided by EMS providers is equivalent to that provided in emergency departments, resuscitation should occur on scene 9. The maximum setting on the def ibrillator should be used for initial and subsequent defibrillation attempts. Defibrillation dosing should follow manufacturer's recommendation in the case of biphasic defibrillators . If the manufacturer's recommendation is unknown, use highest setting pos sible . In the case of monophasic devices, the setting should be 360 J (or 4 J/kg for children) 10. IV or IO access without interrupting chest compressions 11. Administer epinephrine (0.1 mg/kg, maximum dose 1 mg) IV/IO during the first or second round of compress ions 12. At present, the most effective mechanism of airway management is uncertain due to some systems managing the airway aggressively and others managing the airway with basic measures and both types of systems finding excellent outcomes . Regardless of the airway management style, consider the following principles: a. Airway management should not interrupt chest compressions b. Carefully follow ventilation rate and prevent hyperventilation c. Consider limited tidal volumes d. There is uncertainty regarding the proper go als for oxygenation during resuscitation i. Current recommendations suggest using the highest flow rate possible through NRB or BVM ii. This should not be continued into the post -resuscitation phase in which the goal should be an oxygen saturation of 94 -98% e. Pedia tric Considerations : Special attention should be applied to the pediatric population and airway management/respiratory support . Given that the most likely cause of cardiac arrest is respiratory, airway management may be considered early in the patient's ca re i. However, the order of Circulation -Airway -Breathing is still recommended as the order of priority by the American Heart Association for pediatric resuscitation in order to ensure timely initiation of chest compressions to maintain perfusion, regardless of the underlying cause of the arrest Upda ted January 5, 201 9 110 ii. In addition, conventional CPR is preferred in children, since it is associated with better outcomes when compared to compression -only CPR 13. Special Circumstances in Cardiac Arrest a. Trauma , treat per the General Trauma Management guideline b. Pregnancy i. The best hope for fetal survival is maternal survival ii. Position the patient in the supine position with a second rescuer performing manual uterine displacement to t he left in an effort to displace the gravid uterus and increase venous return by avoiding aorto -caval compression iii. If manual displacement is unsuccessful, the patient may be placed in the left lateral tilt position at 30\u00b0. This position is less desirable th an the manual uterine displacement as chest compressions are more difficult to perform in this position iv. Chest compressions should be performed slightly higher on the sternum than in the non -pregnant patient to account for elevation of the diaphragm and abdominal contents in the obviously gravid patient v. Defibrillation should be performed as in non -pregnant patients c. Arrests of respiratory etiology (including drowning) - In addition to the above, consider early management of the pa tient's airway . Passive ven tilation with a NRB is not indicated for these patients. 14. Application of the \"pit crew\" model of resuscitation a. Ideally, providers in each EMS agency will use a \"pit crew\" approach when using this protocol to ensure the most effective and efficient cardiac arrest care. Training should include teamwork simulations integrating first responders, BLS, and ALS crewmembers who regularly work together. High -performance systems should practice teamwork using \"pit crew\" techniques with predefined roles and crew resou rce management principles. For example (the Pennsylvania State EMS Model for Pit Crew): i. Rescuer 1 and 2 set up on opposite sides of patient's chest and perform continuous chest compressions, alternating after every 100 compressions to avoid fatigue ii. Use a metronome or CPR feedback device to ensure that compression rate is 100-120/minute iii. Chest compressions are only interrupted during rhythm check (AED analysis or manual) and defibrillation shocks - Continue compressions when AED/ defibrillator is charging iv. Additional rescuer obtains IO (or IV) access and gives epinephrine - For IO access: 1. The proximal humerus is the preferred site for adults 2. The tibial site is preferred for infants and children v. During the first four cycles of compressions/defibrillation (approximately 10 minutes) avoid advanced airway placement vi. One responding provider assumes code leader position overseeing the entire response vii. Use a CPR checklist to ensure that all best practices are followed during CPR b. For efficient \"pit crew\" style care , the EMS agency medical director should establish the options that will be used by providers functioning within the EMS agency . Options include establishing: i. The airway/ventilation management, if any, that will be used ii. The initial route of vascular access Upda ted January 5, 201 9 111 15. The EMS agency must perform a QI review of care and outcome , overseen by the agency medical director, for every patient that receives CPR a. The QI should be coordinated with local receiving hospitals to include hospital admission, discharge, and condition information. This EMS agency QI can be accomplished by participation an organized cardiac arrest registry b. The QI should be coordinated with local PSAP/dispatch centers to review opportunities to assure optimal recognition of possible cardiac arrest cases a nd provision of dispatch - assisted CPR (including hands -only CPR when appropriate) Quality Improvement Protocol(s) (eProtocol.01) -Therapeutic 9914015 - Cardiac Electrical Arrest -Ventricular Fibrillation/Pulseless Ventricular 9914055 - General -Cardiac Arrest 9914087 - Injury -Cardiac Arrest Key Documentation Elements Should be tailored to any locally utilized data registry but may include as a minimum the following elements: o Resuscitation attempted and all interventions performed o Arrest witnessed o Location of arrest o First monitored rhythm o CPR before EMS arrival o Outcome o Any ROSC o Presumed etiology Presumed cardiac Trauma Submersion Respiratory Other non -cardiac Unknown Performance Measures Time to scene Time to patient Time to first CPR Time to first shock Time of ROSC Review of CPR Quality o Compression Fraction o Average and longest peri -shock pause o Rate and depth of compressions Upda ted January 5, 201 9 112 References 1.

Many of those who do survive suffer significant neurologic morbidity. Current research has demonstrated that care of patients with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) at specialized centers is associated w ith both decreased mortality and improved neurologic outcomes . The goal is therefore to optimize neurologic and other function following a return of spontaneous circulation following resuscitated cardiac arrest . Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria Patient returned to spontaneous circulation following cardiac arrest resuscitation Exclusion Criteria None recommended Patient Management Assessment, Treatment, and Interventions 1. Perform general patient management 2. Support life -threatening problems assoc iated with airway, breathing, and circulation. Monitor closely for reoccurrence of cardiac arrest 3. Administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 94 -98% saturation . Do not hyperoxygenate 4. Do not hyperventilate.

Prehospital initiation of therapeutic hypothermia is not routinely recommended Upda ted January 5, 201 9 115 Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Hyperventilation is a significant cause of hypotension and recurrence of cardiac arrest in the post resuscitation phase and must be avoided 2. Most patients immediately post resuscitation will require ventilatory assistance 3. The condition of post -resuscitation patients fluctuates rapidly and continuously, and they require close monitoring . A significant percentage of post-OSC patients will re -arrest 4. A moderate number of post -ROSC patients may have evidence of ST elevation MI on EKG 5.

Patient Presentation Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria 1. Patients must have one of the following documents or a valid alternative (such as identification bracelet indicating wishes) immediately available . Note that some specifics can vary widely from state to state: a. Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (POLST) or Medical Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (MOLST) - explicitly describes acceptable interventions for the patient in the form of medical orders, must be signed by a physician or other empowered medical provider to be valid b. Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order - identifies that CPR and intubation are not to be initiated if the patient is in arrest or peri -arrest. The int erventions covered by this order and the details around when to implement them can vary widely c. Advance directives - document that describes acceptable treatments under a variable number of clinical situations including some or all of the following: what to do for cardiac arrest, whether artificial nutrition is acceptable, organ donation wishes, dialysis, and other parameters . The directives f requently do not apply to emergent or potentially transient medical conditions d. As specified from state to state, in t he absence of formal written directions (MOLST, POLST, DNR, advanced directives), and in the presence of a person with power of attorney for healthcare or healthcare proxy, that person may prescribe limits of treatment 2. One of the documents above is valid w hen it meets all of the following criteria: a. Conforms to the state specifications for color and construction b. Is intact: it has not been cut, broken or shows signs of being repaired c. Displays the patient's name and the physician's name 3. If there is question ab out the validity of the form/instrument, the best course of action is to proceed with the resuscitation until additional information can be obtained to clarify the best course of action 4. If a patient has a valid version of one of the above documents, it wil l be referred to as a \"valid exclusion to resuscitation\" for the purposes of this protocol Upda ted January 5, 201 9 121 Patient Management Assessment 1. If the patient has a valid exclusion to resuscitation then no CPR or airway management should be attempted, however this does not exclude comfort measures including medications for pain as appropriate 2. If CPR has been initiated and a valid exclusion to resuscitation has been subsequently verified, CPR may be discontinued and direct medical oversight contacted as needed Treatment and Interventions 1. If there is a valid exclusion to resuscitation and there are signs of life (pulse and respirations), EMS providers should provide standard appropriate treatment under existing protocols according to the patient's condition a. If the patient has a MOLST or POLST, it may provide specific guidance on how to proceed in this situation b. Directives should be followed as closely as possible and direct medical oversight contacted as needed 2. The patient should receive full treatment per protocols with the ex ception of any intervention specifically prohibited in the patient's valid exclusion to resuscitation 3. If for any reason an intervention that is prohibited by an advanced directive is being considered, direct medical oversight should be obtained Patient Sa fety Considerations In cases where the patient's status is unclear and the appropriateness of withholding resuscitation efforts is questioned, EMS personnel should initiate CPR immediately and contact direct medical oversight . Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. If there is a personal physician present at the scene who has an ongoing relationship with the patient, that physician may decide if resuscitation is to be initiated 2. If there is a registered nurse from a home healthcare or hospice agency present at the scene who has an ongoing relationship with the patient, and who is operating under orders from the patient's private physician, that nurse (authorized nurse) may decide if resuscitation is to be initiated 3. If the physician or nurse decides r esuscitation is to be initiated, usual direct medical oversight procedures will be followed 4.

Prehos Disaster Med. 1994;9(2):1 97-9 Revision Date September 8, 2017 Upda ted January 5, 201 9 123 Termination of Resuscitative Efforts Aliases Call the code Patient Care Goals 1. When there is no response to prehospital cardiac arrest treatment, it is acceptable and often preferable to cease futile resuscitation efforts in the field. 2. In patients with cardiac arrest, prehospital resuscitation is initiated with the goal of returning spontaneous circulation before permanent neurologic damage occurs. In most situations, ALS providers are capable of performing an initial resuscitation that is equivalent to an in -hospital resuscitation attempt, and there is usually no additional benefit to emergency department resuscitation in most cases . 3. CPR that is performed during patient packaging and transport is much less effective than CPR done at the scene. Additionally, EMS providers risk physical injury while attempting to perform CPR in a moving ambulance while unrestrained. In addition, continuing resuscitation in futile cases places other motorists and pedestrians at risk, increases the time that EMS crews are not available for another call, impedes emergency department care of other patients, and incurs unnecessary hospital charges. Lastly, return of spontaneous circulation is dependent on a focused, timely resuscita tion. The patient in arrest should be treated as expeditiously as possible, including quality, uninterrupted CPR and timely defibrillation as indicated . 4. When cardiac arrest resuscitation becomes futile, the patient's family should become the focus of the E MS providers. Families need to be informed of what is being done, and transporting all cardiac arrest patients to the hospital is not supported by evidence and inconveniences the family by requiring a trip to the hospital where they must begin grieving in an unfamiliar setting. Most families understand the futility of the situation and are accepting of ceasing resuscitation efforts in the field . Patient Presentation Patient in cardiac arrest . Inclusion Criteria 1. Any cardiac arrest patient that has received resuscitation in the field but has not responded to treatment 2. When resuscitation has begun and it is found that the patient has a DNR order or other actionable medical order ( e.g. POLST/MOLST form) Exclusion Criteria Consider continuing resuscitation for patients in cardiac arrest associated with medical conditions that may have a better outcome despite prolonged resuscitation, including hypothermia (although under certain circumstances, direct medical oversight may order termination of resuscitation in th ese conditions) Upda ted January 5, 201 9 124 Patient Management Resuscitation may be terminated under the following circumstance s: 1. Non -traumatic arrest a. Patient is at least 18 years of age b. Patient is in cardiac arrest at the time of arrival of advanced life support i. No pulse ii. No respirations iii. No evidence of meaningful cardiac activity ( e.g. asystole or wide complex PEA less than 60 BPM, no heart sounds ) c. Advanced life support resuscitation is administered appropriate to the presenting and persistent cardiac rhythm. i. Resuscitation ma y be terminated in a systole and slow wide complex PEA if there is no return of spontaneous circulation after 20 minutes in the absence of hypothermia and the ETCO 2 is less than 20mmHg ii. Narrow complex PEA with a rate above 40 or refractory and recur rent vent ricular fibrillation/ ventricular tachycardia : 1. Consider resuscitation for up to 60 minutes from the time of dispatch. 2. Termination efforts may be ceased before 60 minutes based on factors including but not limited to ETCO 2 less than 20mmHg, age, co - morbidit ies, distance from, and resources available at the closest hospital. Termination before this timeframe should be done in consultat ion with direct medical oversight d. There is no return of spontaneous pulse and no evidence of neurological function (non - reacti ve pupils, no response to pain, no spontaneous movement) e. No evidence or sus picion of hypothermia f. All EMS personnel involved in the patient's care agree that discontinuation of the resuscitation is appropriate g. Consider direct medical oversight before termination of resuscitative efforts 2. Traumatic arrest a. Patient is at least 18 years of age. b. Resuscitation efforts may be terminated in any blunt trauma patient who, based on thorough primary assessment, is found apneic, pulseless, and asystolic on an EKG or cardiac monitor upon arrival of emergency medical services at the scene c. Victims of penetrating trauma found apneic and pulseless by EMS should be rapidly assessed for the presence of other signs of life, such as pupillary reflexes, spontaneous movement, r esponse to pain , and electrical activity on EKG i. Resuscitation may be terminated with direct medical oversight if these signs of life are absent ii. If resuscitation is not terminated, transport is indicated d. Cardiopulmonary arrest patients in whom mechanism of injury does not correlate with clinical condition, suggesting a non -traumatic cause of arrest, should have standard ALS resuscitation initiated e. All EMS personnel involved in the patient's care agree that discontinuation of the resuscitation is appropriate f. Consider direct medical oversight before termination of resuscitative efforts Upda ted January 5, 201 9 125 Assessment 1. Pulse 2. Respirations 3. Neurologic status assessment [see Appendix VII ; purposeful movement, pupillary response ] 4. Cardiac ac tivity (including electrocardiography, cardiac auscultation and/or ultrasonography) 5. Quantitative capnography Treatment and Interventions 1. Focus on continuous, quality CPR that is initiated as soon as possible 2. Focus attention on the family and/or bystanders . Explain the rationale for termination 3. Consider support for family members such as other family, friends, clergy, faith leaders, or chaplains 4. For patients that are less than 18 yo, consultation with direct medical oversight is recommended Patient Safety Considerations All patients who are found in ventricular fibrillation or whose rhythm changes to ventricular fibrillation should in general have full resuscitation continued on scene . Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations and Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Recent evidence has shown that, in order to capture over 99% of potential survivors from medical cardiac arrest (especially VF and pulseless VT arrests), resuscitation should be continued for approximately 40 minutes . This does not imply, however, that all resuscitations should continue this long (e.g. asystolic rhythms) 2. In remote or wilderness situations, EMS providers should make every effort to contact direct medical oversight , but resuscitation may be terminated in the field without direct medical oversight when the following have occurred : a. There has been no return of pulse despite greater than 30 minutes of CPR (this does not apply in the case of hypothermia) b. Transport to an emergency department will take greater than 30 minutes (this does not apply in the case of hypothermia) c. EMS providers are exhausted and it is physically impossible to continue the resuscitation 3. Logistical factors should be considered, such as collapse in a public place, family wishes, and safety of the crew and public 4. Survival and functional neurologic outcomes are unlikely if ROSC is not obtained by EMS. It is dangerous to crew, pedestrians, and other motorists to attempt to resuscitate a patient during ambulance transport 5. Quantitative end -tidal carbon dioxide measurements of less than 10 mmHg or falling greater than 25% despite resuscitation indicates a poor prognosis and provide additional support for termination Upda ted January 5, 201 9 126 Quality Improvement Associated NEMSIS Protocol(s) (eProtocol.01) 9914201 - Cardiac Arrest - Cardiac Cardiac -Special Resuscitation - General -Cardiac Arrest 9914087 - Injury -Cardiac Arrest Key Documentation El ements All items (a -f in Non -traumatic or Traumatic arrest) listed under patient management must be clearly documented in the EMS patient care report in addition to the assessment findings supporting this medical decision making If resuscitation is continued for special circumstance or despite satisfying the criteria in this guideline, the rationale for such decision making must be documented Performance Measures Time to CPR Time to AED application if applicable Review of CPR quality Duration of res uscitative efforts Review of biometric data/CPR quality if available Appropriateness of termination Review of every patient transport from scene with patient in arrest References 1.

History of circumstances and symptoms before, during, and after the event, including duration, interventions done, and patient color, tone, breathing, feeding, position, location, activity, level of consciousness b. Other concurrent symptom s (fever, congestion, cough, rhinorrhea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, labored breathing, fussy, less active, poor sleep, poor feeding) c. Prior history of BRUE d. Past medical history (prematurity, prenatal/birth complications, gastric reflux, congenital heart dis ease, developmental delay, airway abnormalities, breathing problems, prior hospitalizations, surgeries, or injuries) e. Family history of sudden unexplained death or cardiac arrhythmia in other children or young adults f. Social history: who lives at home, recen t household stressors, exposure to toxins/drugs, sick contacts) g.

History of prematurity (less than or equal to 32 weeks gestation or corrected gestational age less than or equal to 45 weeks) iii. More than 1 BRUE, now or in the past b. All patients should be transported to facilities with baseline readiness to care for children Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. BRUE is a group of sy mptoms, not a disease process 2. High risk BRUE patients may require ED or hospital intervention 3. All patients should be transported to an ED 4. Contact direct medical oversight if parent/guardian is refusing medical care and/or transport, especially if any high -risk criteria are present (see above) Quality Improvement Associated NEMSIS Protocol(s) (eProtocol.01) 9914197 - Medical - Apparen t Life Threatening Event (ALTE) o NOTE: BRUE is the updated term replacing ALTE and NEMSIS will not be able to change the label for this code until at least mid -2018.

Notes/Educational Pearls Key C onsiderations 1. Suctioning can be a very effective intervention to alleviate distress, since infants are obligate nose breathers 2. Heliox should not be routinely administered to chil dren with respiratory distress 3. Insufficient data exist to recommend the use of inhaled steam or nebulized saline 4. Though a lbuterol has previously been a consideration, the most recent evidence does not demonstrate a benefi t in using it for bronchiolitis 5. Ipratropium and other ant icholi nergic agents should not be given to children with bronchiolitis in the prehospital se tting 6. Though n ebulized hyper tonic sali ne has been shown to decrease hospital length of stay when used for bronchiolitis, it does not provide immediate relief of distress and should not be administered to ch ildren in respiratory distress in the prehospital setting Upda ted January 5, 201 9 135 Pertinent Assessment Findings Frequent reassessment is necessary to determine if interventions have alleviated signs of respiratory distress or not Quality Improvement Associated NEMSIS Protocol(s) (eProtocol.01) 9914221 - Medical -Respiratory Distress -Bronchiolitis o Protocol Age Category: 3602005 - Pediatric Only Key Documentation E lements Document key aspects of the exam to assess for a change after each intervention: 1.

Alleviate respiratory distress 2. Promptly identify respiratory distres s, respiratory failure, and respiratory arrest, and intervene for patients who require escalation of therapy 3. Deliver appropriate therapy by differentiating other causes of pediatric respiratory distress Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria Suspected croup (history of stridor or history of barky cough) Exclusion Criteria 1. Presumed underlying cause that includes one of the following: a. Anaphylaxis b. Asthma c. Bronchiolitis (wheezing 2 yo) d. Foreign body aspiration e. Submersion/drowning f. Epiglottitis Patient Management Assessment 1. History a. Onset of symptoms (history of choking) b. Concurrent symptoms (fever, cough, rhinorrhea, tongue/lip swelling, rash, labored breathing, foreign body aspiration) c. Sick contacts d. Treatments given e. Personal history of asthma, wheezing, or croup in past 2. Exam a. Full set of vital signs (T, BP, RR, P, O 2 sat) b. Presence of stridor at rest or when agitated c. Description of cough d. Other signs of distress (grunting, nasal flaring, retracting) e. Color (pallor, cyanosis, norma l) f. Mental status (alert, tired, lethargic, unresponsive) Upda ted January 5, 201 9 139 Treatment and Interventions 1. Monitoring a. Pulse oximetry and end -tidal CO2 (ETCO2) should be routinely used as an adjunct to other forms of respiratory monitoring b. Perform EKG only if there are no signs of clinical improvement after treating respiratory distress 2. Airway a. Give supplemental oxygen. Escalate from a nasal cannula to a simple face mask to a non-breather mask as needed, in order to maintain normal oxygenation b. Suction the nose and/or mouth (via bulb, Yankauer\u00ae, or suction catheter) if excessive secretions are present 3. Inhaled medications a. Epinephrine 5 mL of 1 mg/mL (5 mg) nebulized, should be administered to all children with croup in respiratory distress with signs of stridor at rest - this medication should be repeated at this dose with unlimited frequency for ongoing distress b. Humidified oxygen or mist therapy is not indicated 4. Medications - dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg oral, IV, or IM to maximum dose of 16 mg should be administered to patients with suspected croup 5. Utility of IV placement and fluids - IVs should only be placed in children with respiratory distress for clinical concerns of dehydration, or when administering IV medications 6. Improvement of oxygenation and/or respiratory distress wit h non-invasive airway adjuncts a. Heliox for the treatment of croup can be considered for severe distress not responsive to more than 2 doses of epinephrine b. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) should be administered for severe respiratory distress c. Bag-valve -mask ventilation should be utilized in children with respiratory failure 7. Supraglottic devices and intubation - supraglottic devices and intubation should be utilized only if bag -valve -mask ventilation fails. The airway should be managed in the lea st invasive way possible Patient Safety Considerations 1. Routine use of lights and sirens is not recommended during transport 2. Patients who receive inhaled epinephrine should be transported to definitive care Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Upper airway obstruction can have inspiratory, expiratory, or biphasic stridor 2. Foreign bodies can mimic croup, it is important to ask about a possible choking event 3. Impending respiratory failure is indicated by: a. Change in mental status such as fatigue an d listlessness b. Pallor c. Dusky appearance d. Decreased retractions e. Decreased breath sounds with decreasing stridor 4. Without stridor at rest or other evidence of respiratory distress, inhaled medications may not be necessary Upda ted January 5, 201 9 140 Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Respira tory distress (retractions, wheezing, stridor) 2. Decreased oxygen saturation 3. Skin color 4. Neurologic status assessment 5. Reduction in work of breathing after treatment 6.

Revision Date June 29, 2018 Upda ted January 5, 201 9 142 Neonatal Resuscitation Aliases None noted Patient Care Goals 1. Provide routine care to the newly born infant 2. Perform a neonatal assessment 3. Rapidly identify newly born infants requiring resuscitative efforts 4. Provide appropriate interventions to minimize distress in the newly born infant 5. Recognize the need for additional resources based on patient condition and/or environmental factors Patient Present ation Inclusion Criteria Newly born infants Exclusion Criteria Documented gestational age less than 20 weeks (usually calculated by date of last menstrual period). If any doubt about accuracy of gestational age, initiate resuscitation . Patient Management Assessment 1. History a. Date and time of birth b. Onset of symptoms c. Prenatal history (prenatal care, substance abuse, multiple gestation, maternal illness) d. Birth history (maternal fever, presence of meconium, prolapsed or nuchal cord, maternal bleedi ng) e. Estimated gestational age (may be based on last menstrual period) 2. Exam a. Respiratory rate and effort (strong, weak, or absent; regular or irregular) b. Signs of respiratory distress (grunting, nasal flaring, retractions, gasping, apnea) c. Heart rate (fast, sl ow, or absent) i. Precordium, umbilical stump or brachial pulse may be used ii. Auscultation of chest is preferred since palpation of umbilical stump is less accurate d. Muscle tone (poor or strong) e. Color/Appearance (central cyanosis, acrocyanosis, pallor, normal) f. APGAR score (appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, respiratory effort) - may be calculated for documentation, but not necessary to guide resuscitative efforts g. Estimated gestational age (term, late preterm, premature) h. Pulse oximetry should be considered if prolonged resuscitative efforts or if supplemental oxygen is administered - goal: oxygen saturation at 10 minutes is 85 -95% Upda ted January 5, 201 9 143 Treatment and Interventions 1. If immediate resuscitation is required and the newborn is still attached to the mother, clamp the co rd in two places and cut between the clamps . If no resuscitation is required, warm/dry/stimulate the newborn and then cut/clamp the cord after 60 seconds or the cord stops pulsating 2. Warm, dry, and stimulate a. Wrap infant in dry towel or thermal blanket to ke ep infant as warm as possible during resuscitation; keep head covered if possible b. If strong cry, regular respiratory effort, good tone, and term gestation, infant should be placed skin -to-skin with mother and covered with dry linen 3. If weak cry, signs of re spiratory distress, poor tone, or preterm gestation then position airway (sniffing position) and clear airway as needed - if thick meconium or secretions present and signs of respiratory distress, suction mouth then nose 4. If heart rate greater than 100 beat s per minute a. Monitor for central cyanosis - provide blow -by oxygen as needed b. Monitor for signs of respiratory distress. If apneic or in significant respiratory distress: i. Initiate bag -valve -mask ventilation with room air at 40 -60 breaths per minute ii. Consider endotracheal intubation as per local guidelines 5. If heart rate less than 100 beats per minute a. Initiate bag -valve -mask ventilation with room air at 40 -60 breaths per minute i. Primary indicator of effective ventilation is improvement in heart rate ii. Rates and vo lumes of ventilation required can be variable, only use the minimum necessary rate and volume to achieve chest rise and a change in heart rate b. If no improvement after 90 seconds, change oxygen delivery to 30% FiO 2 if blender available, otherwise 100% FiO 2 until heart rate normalizes c. Consider endotracheal intubation per local guidelines if bag -valve -mask ventilation is ineffective 6. If heart rate less than 60 beats per minute a. Ensure effective ventilations with supplementary oxygen and adequate chest rise b. If no improvement after 30 seconds, initiate chest compressions - two-thumb -encircling - hands technique is preferred c. Coordinate chest compressions with positive pressure ventilation (3:1 ratio, 90 compressions and 30 breaths per minute) d. Consider endotracheal intubation per local guidelines e. Administer epinephrine (0.1mg/mL ) 0.01 mg/kg IV/IO (preferable if access obtained) or 0.1 mg/kg via the ETT (if unable to obtain access) 7. Consider checking a blood glucose for ongoing resuscitation, maternal hist ory of diabetes, ill appearing or unable to feed 8. Administer 20 mL/kg normal saline IV/IO for signs of shock or post -resuscitative care Patient Safety Considerations 1. Hypothermia is common in newborns and worsens outcomes of nearly all post -natal complicat ions a. Ensure heat retention by drying the infant thoroughly, covering the head, and wrapping the baby in dry cloth Upda ted January 5, 201 9 144 b. When it does not encumber necessary assessment or required interventions, \"kangaroo care\" (i.e. placing the infant skin -to-skin directly again st mother's chest and wrapping them together) is an effective warming technique c. Newborn infants are prone to hypothermia which may lead to hypoglycemia, hypoxia and lethargy. Aggressive warming techniques should be initiated including drying, swaddling, an d warm blankets covering body and head. Check blood glucose and follow Hypoglycemia guideline as appropriate. 2. During transport, neonate should be appropriately secured in seat or isolette and mother should be appropriatel y secured Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Approximately 10% of newly born infants require some assistance to begin breathing 2. Deliveries complicated by maternal bleeding (placenta previa, vas previa, or placental abruption) place the infant at risk for hypovolemia secondary to blood loss 3. Low birth weight infants are at high risk for hypothermia due to heat loss 4. If pulse oximetry is used as an adjunct, the preferred placement place of the probe is the right arm, preferably wrist or medial surfac e of the palm. Normalization of blood oxygen levels (SaO 2 85-95%) will not be achieved until approximately 10 minutes following birth 5. Both hypoxia and excess oxygen administration can result in harm to the infant. If prolonged oxygen use is required, titra te to maintain an oxygen saturation of 85 -95% 6. While not ideal, a larger facemask than indicated for patient size may be used to provide bag-valve -mask ventilation if an appropriately sized mask is not available - avoid pressure over the eyes as this may result in bradycardia 7. Increase in heart rate is the most reliable indicator of effective resuscitative efforts 8. A multiple gestation delivery may require additional resources and/or providers 9. There is no evidence to support the routine practice of administe ring sodium bicarbonate for the resuscitation of newborns Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. It is difficult to determine gestational age in the field - if there is any doubt as to viability, resuscitation efforts should be initiated 2. Acrocyanosis, a blue dis coloration of the distal extremities, is a common finding in the newly born infant tra nsitioning to extrauterine life - this must be differentiated from central cyanosis Quality Improvement Associated NEMSIS Protocol(s) (eProtocol.01) 9914133 - Medical -Newborn/Neonatal Resuscitation Key Documentation Elements Historical elements o Prenatal complications o Delivery complications o Date and time of birth o Estimated gestational age Upda ted January 5, 201 9 145 Physical exam findings o Heart rate o Respiratory rate o Respiratory effort o Appearance o APGAR score at 1 and 5 minutes Performance Measures Prehospital on -scene time Call time for additional resources Arrival time of additional unit Time to initiation of interventions Use of oxygen during resuscitation Presence of advanced life support (ALS) versus basic life support (BLS) providers ROSC and/or normalization of heart rate Length of stay in neonatal intensive care unit Length of stay in newborn nursery Length of stay in hospital Knowledge retention of prehospital providers Number of advanced a irway attempts Mortality References 1.

Crowning c. Urge to push d. Urge to move bowels e. Membrane rupture f. Bloody show Treatment and Interventions 1. If patient in labor but no signs of impending delivery, transport to appropriate receiving facility 2. Delivery should be controlled so as to allow a slow controlled delivery of infant - This will prevent injury to mother a. Support the infant's head as needed 3. Check for cord around the baby's neck a. If present, slip it over the head b. If unable to free the cord from the neck, double clamp the cord and cut between the clamps 4. Do not routinely suction the infant's airway (even with a bulb syringe) during delivery Upda ted January 5, 201 9 147 5. Grasping the head with hand over the ears, gently guide head down to allow delivery of the anterior shoulder 6. Gently guide the head up to allow delivery of the posterior shoulder 7. Slowly deliver the remainder of the infant 8. After 1 -3 minutes, clamp cord about 6 inches from the abdomen with 2 clamps; cut the cord between the clamps a. If resuscitation is needed, clamp cord and cut as soon as possible 9. Record APGAR scores at 1 and 5 minutes a. After delivery of infant, suctioning (including suctioning with a bulb syringe) should be reserved for infants who have obvious obstruction to the airway or require positive pressure ventilation (follow Neonatal Resuscitation guideline for further care of the infant) 10. Dry and warm infant, wrap in towel and place on maternal chest unless resuscitation needed 11. The placenta will deliver spontaneously, often within 5 -15 minutes of t he infant a. Do not force the placenta to deliver; do not pull on umbilical cord b. Contain all tissue in plastic bag and transport 12. After delivery, massaging the uterus and allowing the infant to nurse will promote uterine contraction and help control bleedin g a. Estimate maternal blood loss b. Treat for hypovolemia as needed 13. Transport infant secured in seat or isolette unless resuscitation needed 14. Keep infant warm during transport 15. Most deliverie s proceed without complications - If complications of delivery occur, the following are recommended: a. Shoulder dystocia - if delivery fails to progress after head delivers, quickly attempt the following i. Hyperflex mother's hips to severe supine knee -chest position ii. Apply firm suprapubic pressure to attempt to dislodge shoulder iii. Apply high -flow oxygen to mother iv. Transport as soon as possible v. Contact direct medical oversight and/or closest appropriate receiving facility for direct medical oversight and to prepare team b. Prolapsed umbilical cord i. Placed gloved hand into vagina and gently lif t head/body off of cord 1. Assess for pulsations in cord 2. Maintain until relieved by hospital staff. i. Consider placing mother in prone knee -chest position or extreme Trendelenburg ii. Apply high -flow oxygen to mother iii. Transport as soon as possible iv. Contact/transport to closest appropriate receiving facility for direct medical oversight and to prepare team c. Breech birth i. Place mother supine, allow the buttocks and trunk to deliver spontaneously, then support the body while the head is delivered ii. If head fails to deliver, place gloved hand into vagina with fingers between infant's face and uterine wall to create an open airway Upda ted January 5, 201 9 148 iii. Apply high -flow oxygen to mother iv. Transport as soon as possible v. Contact direct medical oversight and/or closest appropriate receiving facility for direct medical oversight and to prepare team vi. The presen tation of an arm or leg through the vagina is an indication for immediate transport to hospital vii. Assess for presence of prolapsed cord and treat as above d. Excessive bleeding during active labor may occur with placenta previa i. Obtain history from patient ii. Placenta previa may prevent delivery of infant vaginally iii. C-Section needed - transport urgently e. Maternal cardiac arrest i. Apply manual pressure to displace uter us from right to left ii. Treat per the Cardiac Arrest guideline for resuscitation care (defibrillation and medications should be given for same indications and doses as if non -pregnant patient) iii. Transpo rt as soon as possible if in fant is estimated to be over 24 weeks gestation (perimortem Cesarean section at receiving facility is most successful if done within 5 minutes of maternal cardiac arrest) iv. Contact direct medical oversight and/or closest appropria te receiving facility for direct medical oversight and to prepare team Patient Safety Considerations 1. Supine Hypotension Syndrome: a. If mother has hypotension before delivery , place patient in left lateral recumbent position or manually displace gravid uteru s to the left is supine position necessary b. Knee -chest position may create safety issues during rapid ambulance transport 2. Do not routinely suction the infant's airway (even with a bulb syringe) during delivery 3. Newborns are very slippery, take care not to drop the infant 4. Do not pull on the umbilical cord while the placenta is delivering 5. If possible, transport between deliveries if mother is expecting twins Notes/Educational Pearls 1. OB assessment: a. Length of pregnancy b. Number of pregnancies c. Number of viable births d.

Provide effective oxygena tion and ventilation 2. Recognize and alle viate respiratory distress 3. Provide necessary interventions quickly and safely to patients with the need for respiratory support 4. Identify a potentially difficulty airway in a timely fashion Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria 1. Children and adults with signs of severe respiratory distress/respiratory failure 2. Patients with evidence of hypoxemia or hypoventilation Exclusion Criteria 1. Patients with tracheostomies 2. Chronically ventilated patients 3. Newborn patients 4. Patients in whom oxygenation and ventilation is adequate with supplemental oxygen alone, via simple nasal cannula or face mask Patient Management Assessment 1. History - Assess for : a. Time of onset of symptoms b. Associated symptoms c. History of asthma or other breathing disorders d. Choking or oth er evidence of upper airway obstruction e. History of trauma 2. Physical Examination - Assess for : a. Shortness of breath b. Abnormal respiratory rate and/or effort c. Use of accessory muscles d. Quality of air exchange , including depth and equality of breath sounds e. Wheezin g, rhonchi, rales, or stridor f. Cough g. Abnormal color (cyanosis or pallor) Upda ted January 5, 201 9 158 h. Abnormal mental status i. Evidence of hypoxemia j. Signs of a difficult airway (short jaw or limited jaw thrust, small thyromental space, upper airway obstruction, large tongue, obesity, large tonsils, large neck, craniofacial abnormalities, excessive facial hair) Treatment and Interventions 1. Non -invasive ventilation techniques a. Maintain airway and administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 94 - 98% saturation b. For severe respiratory distress or impending respiratory failure, u se continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), intermittent Use bag -valve mask (BVM) ventilation in the setting of respiratory failure or arrest . Two - person, two -thumbs -up BVM ventilation is more effective than one -person technique and should be used when additional providers are available 2. Oropharyngeal a irways (OPA) and nasopharyngeal a irways (NPA) - Consider the addition of an OPA and/or NPA to make BVM ventilation more effective, especially in patients with altered mental status 3. Supraglottic a irways (SGA) or extraglottic devices (EGD) - Consider the use of a SGA or EGD if BVM is not effective in maintaining oxygenat ion and/or ventilation. Examples include, but are not limited to the l aryngeal mask airway (LMA) or King\u00ae laryn geal tu be. This is especially important in children since endotracheal intubation is an infrequently performed skill in this age group and has not been shown to improve outcomes 4. Endotracheal intubation a. When less -invasive methods (BVM, SGA/EGD to maintain oxygenation and/or ventil ation b. Other indications may include potential airway obstructions, severe burns, multiple traumatic injuries, altered mental status or loss of normal protective airway reflexes c. Monitor clinical signs, pulse oximetry, cardiac rhythm, blood pressure, and capnogra phy for the intubated patient d. Video laryngoscopy may enhance intubation success rates, and should be used when available . Consider using a bougie, especially when video laryngoscopy is unavailable and glottic opening is difficult to visualize with direct laryngoscope 5. Post -intubation management a. Confirm placement of advanced airway (endotracheal tube, SGA, or EGD) with waveform capnography, absent gastric sounds, and bilateral breath sounds b. Continuously monitor placement with waveform capnography during treatment and transport c. Continuously secure tube manually until tube secured with tape, twill, or commercial device i. Note measurement of tube at incisors or gum line and monitor frequently for tube movement/displacement ii. Cervical collar and/or cervical immob ilization device may help reduce neck move ment and risk of tube displacement Upda ted January 5, 201 9 159 d. Inflate endotracheal tube cuff with minimum air to seal airway - an ETT cuff manometer can be used to measure and adjust the ETT cuff pressure to a recommended 20 cm H 2O pressure e. Ventilation i. Tidal volume 1. Ventilate with minimal volume to see chest rise, approximately 6 - 7 mL/kg ideal body weight 2. Over -inflation may be detrimental ii. Rate 1. Adult : 10-12 breaths/minute 2. Child : 20 breaths/minute 3. Infant : 30 breaths/minute iii. Continuously monitor ETCO 2 to maintain ETCO 2 of 35 -40 mmHg - in head injury with signs of herniation (unilateral dilated pupil or decerebrate posturing), modestly hyperventilate to ETCO 2 30 mmHg f. Consider sedation with sedative or opioid medications if agitated 6. Gastric decompression may improve oxygenation and ventilation, so it should be considered when there is obvious gastric distention 7. When patients cannot be oxygenated/ventilated effectively by previously mentioned interventions, the provider should consider cricoth ryoidotomy if the risk of death for not escalating airway management seems to outweigh the risk of a procedural complication 8. Transport to the closest appropriate hospital for airway stabilization when respiratory failure cannot be successfully managed in t he prehospital setting Patient S afety Considerations 1. Avoid excessive pressures or volumes during BVM 2. Avoid endotracheal intubation, unless less invasive methods fail, since it can be associated with aspiration, oral trauma, wo rsening of cervical spine injury , malposition of the ET tube (right mainstem intubation, esophageal intubation), or adverse effects of sedation , especially in children 3. Once a successful SGA/EGD placement or intubation has been performed, obstru ction or displacement of the tube can have further deleter ious effects on patient outcome a. Tubes should be secured with either a commercial tube holder or tape 4. Providers who do not routinely use medications for rapid sequence intubation (RSI) should not use RSI on children, since the loss of ai rway protection with the use of RSI may increase complications a. RSI should be reserved for specialized providers operating within a comprehensive program with ongoing training and quality assurance measures Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Whe n compared to the management of adults with cardiac arrest, paramedics are less likely to attempt endotracheal intubation in children with cardiac arrest. Further, paramedics are more likely to be unsuccessful when intubating children in cardiac arrest and complications such as malposition of the ET tube or aspiration can be nearly three times as common in children as compared to adult s. Upda ted January 5, 201 9 160 2. Use continuous waveform capnography to detect end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO 2). This is an important adjunct in the monit oring of patients with respiratory distress, respiratory failure, and those treated with positive pressure ventilation. It should be used as the standard to confirm SGA, EGD, and endotracheal tube placement. 3. a. Contraindications to these non -invasive ventilator techniques include intolerance of the device, severely impaired consciousness, increased secretions inhibiting a proper seal, or recent gastrointestinal and/or airway surgery 4. Bag-valve -mask : a. Appropriately -sized masks should c ompletely cover the nose and mouth and maintain an effective seal around the cheeks and chin b. Ventilation should be delivered with only sufficient volume to achieve chest rise c. Ventilation rate: i. During CPR, ventilation rate should be 10 breaths per minute, o ne breath every 10 compressions (or one breath every 6 seconds). When advanced airway is in place, ideally ventilations should be on upstroke between two chest compressions ii. In adults who are not in cardiac arrest, ventilate at rate of 12 breaths per minute iii. In children, ventilating breaths should be delivered over one second, with a two second pause between breaths (20 breaths/minute) in children 5. Orotracheal intubation a. Endotracheal tube sizes Age Size (mm) Uncuffed Size (mm) Cuffed Premature 2.5 Term to 3 months 3.0 3-7 months 3.5 3.0 7-15 months 4.0 3.5 15-24 months 4.5 3.5 2-15 years [age(yr)/4]+4 [age(yr)/4]+3.5 b. Approximate depth of insertion = (3) x (endotracheal tube size) c. In addition to preoxygenation, apneic oxygenation (high -flow oxygen by nasal cannula) may prolong the period before hypoxia during an intubation attempt d. Positive pressure ventilation after intubation can decrease preload and subsequently lead to hypotension - consider providing vasopressor support for hypotension e. Appropriate attention should be paid to adequate preoxygenation to avoid peri - intubation hypoxia and subsequent cardiac arrest f. Prompt suctioning of soiled airways before intubation attempt may improve first pass success g. Confirm successful placement with waveform capno graphy. Less optimal methods of confirmation include bilateral chest rise, bilateral breath sounds, and maintenance of adequate oxygenation . Color change on end -tidal CO 2 is less accurate than clinical Upda ted January 5, 201 9 161 assessment, and wave -form capnography is superior. Mis ting observed in the tube is not a reliable method of confirmation. Visualization with video laryngoscopy, when available, may assist in confirming placement when unclear due to capnography failure or conflicting information. h. Ongoing education and hands -on practice i s essential to maintain skills. This is especially true for children since pediatric intubation is an infrequently utilized skill for many prehospital providers . i. Video laryngoscopy may be helpful, if available, to assist with endotracheal intuba tion 6. Consideration should be made to dispatch the highest -level provider for an EMS system given the potential need for advanced airway placement for patients with severe respiratory distress or failure Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Ongoing assessm ent is critical when an airway device is in place 2. Acute worsening of respiratory sta tus or evidence of hypoxemia can be secondary to displacement or obstruction of the airway device, pn eumothorax or equipment failure Quality Improvement 9914133 - Medical -Newborn/Neonatal Resuscitation Key Documentation E lements Initial vital signs and physical exam Interventions attempted including the method of airway intervention, the size of equipment used, and the number of attempts to achieve a successful result Subsequent vital signs and physical exam to assess for change after the interventions Presence of peri -intubation hypoxia, bradycardia, hypotension or cardiac arrest Post -intubation with advanced airway, document ETCO2 value and record capnograph wave initially after intubation, with each set of vital signs, when patient is moved, and at the time of patient transfer in the ED Performance Measures Percentage of providers that have received hands -on airway training ( simulation or non - simulation -based) within the past 2 years Respiratory rate and oxygen saturation are both measured and documented Percentage of patients with advanced airway who have waveform capnography used for both initial confirmation and continuous monitoring during transport Percentag e of patients who were managed upon arrival to the emergency department (ED) with each of the patients with endotracheal tube in proper position upon ED arrival First pass intubation success without hypoxia or hypotension.

Revision Date September 2017 Upda ted January 5, 201 9 167 Bronchospasm (due to Asthma and Obstructive Lung Disease) (Adapted from an evidence -based guideline created using the National Prehospital Evidence -Based Guideline Model Process) Aliases Asthma, respiratory distress, wheezing, respiratory failure, bronchospasm, obstructive lung disease, albuterol, levalbuterol, duoneb, nebulizer, inhaler Patient Care Goals 1. Alleviate respiratory distress due to bronchospasm 2. Promptly identify and intervene for patients who require escalation of therapy 3. Deliver appropriate therapy by different iating other causes of respiratory distress Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria 1. Respiratory distress with wheezing or decreased air entry in patients 2 yo or older , presumed to be due to bronchospasm from reactive airway disease, asthma, or obstructive lung disease - These patients may have a h istory of recurre nt wheezing that improves with beta-agonist inhalers such as albuterol or levalbuterol a. Symptoms/signs may include: i. Wheezing - will have expiratory wheezing unless they are unable to move adequate air to generate wheezes ii. May have signs of respiratory infection ( e.g. fever, nasal congestion, cough, sore throat) iii. May have acute onset after inhaling irritant b. This i ncludes: i. Asthma exacerbation ii. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation iii. Wheezing from suspected pulmonary infection ( e.g. pneumonia, acute bronchitis) Exclusion Criteria 1. Respiratory distress due to a presumed underlying cause that includes one of the following: a. Anaphylaxis b. Bronchiolitis (wheezing less than 2 yo) c. Croup d. Epiglottitis e. Foreign body aspiration f. Submersion/drowning g. Congestive heart failure h. Trauma Upda ted January 5, 201 9 168 Patient Management Assessment 1. History a. Onset of symptoms b. Concurrent symptoms (fever, cough, rhinorrhea, tongue/lip swelling, rash, labored breathing, foreign body aspiration) c. Usual triggers of symptoms (cigarette smoke, change in weather, upper respiratory infections) d. Sick contacts e. Treatments given f. Previously intubated g. Number of e mergency department visits in the past year h. Number of admissions in the past year i. Number of ICU admissions j. Family history of asthma, eczema, or allergies 2. Exam a. Full set of vital signs (T, BP, RR, P, O 2 sat) - waveform capnography is a useful adjunct and wil l show a \"sharkfin\" waveform in the setting of obstructive physiology b. Air entry (normal vs. diminished, prolonged expiratory phase) c. Breath sounds (wheezes, crackles, rales, rhonchi, diminished, d. Signs of distress (grunting, nasal flaring, retracting, stridor) e. Inability to speak full sentences (sign of shortness of breath) f. Color (pallor, cyanosis, normal) g. Mental status (alert, tired, lethargic, unresponsive) h. Signs of distress include: i. Apprehension, anxiety, combativeness ii. Nasal flaring v. Cyanosis Treatment and Interventions 1. Monitoring a. Pulse oximetry and end -tidal CO2 (ETCO2) should be routinely used as an adjunct to other forms of respiratory monitoring b. Check an EKG only if there are no signs of clinical improvement after treating respiratory distress 2. Airway a. Give supplemental oxygen. Escalate from a nasal cannula to a simple face mask to a non-rebreather mask as needed, in order to maintain normal oxygena tion b. Suction the nose and/or mouth (via bulb, Yankauer, suction catheter) if excessive secretions are present 3. Inhaled Medications a. Albuterol 5 mg nebulized (or 6 puffs metered dose inhaler) should be administered to all patients in respiratory distress wit h signs of bronchospasm ( e.g. known asthmatics, quiet wheezers) either by BLS or ALS providers - this medication should be repeated at this dose with unlimited frequency for ongoing distress Upda ted January 5, 201 9 169 b. Ipratropium 0.5 mg nebulized should be given up to 3 doses, in conjunction with albuterol 4. Utility of IV Placement and Fluids - IVs should be placed when there are clinical concerns of dehydration in order to administer fluids, or when administering IV medications 5. Steroids - methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg, maximum dose 12 5 mg) IV/IM or dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg, maximum dose of 16 mg) IV/IM/PO may be administered in the prehospital setting . Other steroids at equivalent doses may be given as alternatives 6. Magnesium sulfate (40 mg/kg IV, maximum dose of 2 g) over 10 -15 minutes should be administered for severe bronchoconstriction and concern for impending respiratory failure 7. Epinephrine (0.01 mg/kg of 1 mg/ mL IM, maximum dose of 0.3 mg) should only be administered for impending respiratory failure as adjunctive therapy when the re are no clinical signs of improvement 8. Improvement of oxygenation and/or respiratory distress with non -invasive airway a djuncts a. Non -invasive positive pressure ventilation via c ontinuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bi -level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) should be administered fo r severe respiratory distress b. Bag-valve -mask ventilation should be utilized in children with respirat ory failure 9. Supraglottic devices and intubation - should be utilized only if b ag-valve -mask vent ilation fails - the airway should be managed in the least invasive way possible Patient Safety Considerations 1. Routine use of lights and sirens is no t recommended during transport 2. Giving positive pressure in the setting of bronchoconstriction, either via a supraglottic airway or intubation, increases the risk of air trapping which can lead to pneumothorax an d cardiovascular collapse. These interventions should be reserved for situations of respiratory failure Notes/Educational Pearls Key Consideratio ns 1. Inhaled magnesium sulfate should not be administered 2. Heliox should not be administered 3. COPD patients not in respiratory distress should be given oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturation above 90% 4. Nebulizer droplets can carry viral particles, so additional PPE should be considered, including placement of a surgical mask over the nebuliz er to limit droplet spread 5. In the asthmatic patient, pharmacologic intervention should take priority over CPAP/BiPAP and be given in line with CPAP/BiPAP Pertinent Assessment Findings In the setting of severe bronchoconstriction, wheezing might not be heard. Patients with known asthma who complain of chest pain or shortness of breath should be empirically treated, even if wheezing is absent.

Skin abrasions Upda ted January 5, 201 9 176 v. Conjunctivitis - minimized with proper size mask vi. Potential for barotrauma - pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum (rare) 3. Allow patient to remain in position of comfort - patients may decompensate if forced to lie down 4. CHF is a common cause of pulmonary edema - Other causes include: a. Medications b. High altitude exposure c. Kidney failure d. Lung damage caused by gases or severe infection e. Major injury 5. The use of nitrates should be avoided in any patient who has used a phosphodiesterase inhibitor within the past erectile dysfunction and pulmonary h ypertension. Also avoid use in patients receiving intravenous epoprostenol (Flolan\u00ae) or treporstenil (Remodulin\u00ae) which is used for pulmonary hypertension. Administer nitrates with extreme caution, if at all, to patients with an inferior STEMI or suspected STEMI with right ventricular involvement because these patients require adequate RV preload . 6. Nitroglycerin reduces left ventricular filling pressure primarily via veno us dilation. At higher doses the drug variably lowers systemic afterload and increases s troke volume and cardiac output. Although some have advocated early use of ACE inhibitor s in patients with acute decompensated heart failure, we do not recommend this approach. There are limited data on the safety and efficacy of initiating new ACE inhibit ors or angiotensin receptor blockers therapy in the early phase of therapy of acute decompensated heart failure (i.e. the first 12 to 24 hours) . 7. Use of furosemide (Lasix\u00ae) is not recommended in the prehospital setting. Pulmonary edema is more commonly a problem of volume distribution than overload, so administration of furosemide provides no immediate benefit for most patients. Misdiagnosis of CHF and subsequent inducement of inappropriate diuresis can lead to increased morbidity and mortality in patients . 8. Nitrates provide both subjective and objective improvement, and might decrease intubation rates, incidence of MIs, and mortality. High -dose nitrates can reduce both preload and afterload and potentially increase cardiac output. Because many CHF patients present with very elevated arterial and venous pressure, frequent doses of nitrates may be required to control blood pressure and afterload. High dose nitrate therapy, nitroglycerin SL, 0.8 -2 mg q 3-5 minutes has been used in patients in severe distress su ch as hypoxia, altered mentation, diaphoresis, or speaking in one -word sentences. An approach is to give two SL NTG (0.8 mg) for SBP greater than 160 mmHg or three SL NTG (1.2 mg) when SBP is greater than 200 mmHg every 5 minutes. A concern with high doses of nitrates is that some patients are very sensitive to even normal doses and may experience marked hypotension. It is therefore critical to monitor blood pressure during high -dose nitrate therapy.

Monitor patient for deterioration over time with serial vital signs and repeat neurologic status assessment [see Appendix VII ] a. Patients with compensated sh ock may not manifest hypotension until severe blood loss has occurred b. Patients with traumatic brain injury may deteriorate as intracranial swelling and hemorrhage increase 3. Anticipate potential for progressive airway compromise in patients with trauma to he ad and neck Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Optimal trauma care requires a structured approach to the patient emphasizing ABCDE (Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, Exposure) 2. Target scene time less than 10 minutes for unstable patient s or those likely to need surgical intervention 3. Provider training should include the CDC Guidelines for Field Triage of Injured Patients 4. Frequent reassessment of the patient is important a.

If the patient has sustained burns (thermal, chemical, or airway), consider transport to specialized burn center Notes/Education al Pearls Key Considerations 1. Scene safety is of paramount importance when responding to an explosion or blast injury 2. Patients sustaining blast injury may sustain complex, multi -system injuries including: blunt and penetrating trauma, shrapnel, barotrauma, burns, and toxic chemical exposure 3. Consideration of airway injury, particularly airway burns, should prompt early and aggressive airway management 4. Minimize IV fluid resuscitation in patients without signs of shock Upda ted January 5, 201 9 186 5. Consider injuries due to barotrauma a. Tension pneumothorax i. Hypotension or other signs of shock associated with decreased or absent breath sounds, jugular venous distension, and/or tracheal deviation b.

Revision Date September 8, 2017 Upda ted January 5, 201 9 188 Burns Aliases None noted Patient Care Goals Minimize tissue damage and patient morbidity from burns Patient Presentation 1. Patient may present with: a. Airway - stridor, hoarse voice b. Mouth and nares - redness, blisters, soot, singed hairs c. Breathing - rapid, shallow, wheezes, rales d. Skin - Estimate Total Burn Surface Area (TBSA) and depth (partial v s. full thickness) e. Associated trauma - blast, fall, assault Inclusion Criteria Patients sustaining thermal burns Exclusion Criteria Electrical, chemical, and radiation burns [ see Toxins and Environmental section ] Special Transport C onsiderations 1. Transport to most appropriate trauma center when there is airway or respiratory involvement, or when significant trauma or blast injury is suspected 2. Consider air ambulance transportation for long t ransport times or airway management needs beyond the scope of the responding ground medic 3. Consider transport directly to burn center if partial or full thickness burns (TBSA) greater than 10%, involvement of hands/feet, genitalia, face, and/or circumferential burns Scene Management 1. Assure crew safety: a. Power off b. Electrical lines secure c. Gas off d. No secondary devices e. Hazmat determinations made f. Proper protective attire including breathing apparatus may be required Patient Management Assessment 1. Circumstances of event - Consider: a. Related trauma in addition to the burns b. Inhalation exposures such as CO and cyanide (CN) c. Pediatric or elder abuse Upda ted January 5, 201 9 189 2. Follow ABCs of resuscitation per the General Trauma Managem ent guideline 3. If evidence of possible airway burn, consider aggressive airway management 4. Consider spinal precautions for those that qualify per the Spinal Care guideline 5. Estimate TBSA burned and depth of burn a. Use \"Rule of 9's\" [see burn related tables in Appendix VI ] b. First - degree burns (skin erythema only) are not included in TB SA calculations 6. Document pain scale Treatments and interventions 1. Stop the burning a. Remove wet clothing (if not stuck to the patient) b. Remove jewelry c. Leave blisters intact 2. Minimize burn wound contamination a. Cover burns with dry dressing or clean sheet b. Do not apply gels or ointments 3. Monitor SP O2, ETCO 2 and cardiac monitor - Consider SPCO monitoring, if available 4. High flow supplemental oxygen for all burn patients rescued from an enclosed space 5. Establish IV access, avoid placement through burned skin 6. Evaluate distal circulation in circumferentially burned extremities 7. Consider early management of pain and nausea/vomiting 8. Initiate fluid resuscitation - Use lactated Ringer 's or normal saline a. If patient in shock: i. Consider other cause, such as trauma or cyanide toxicity ii. Administer IV fluid per the Shock guideline b. If patient not in shock: i. Begin f luids based on estimated TBSA [see Appendix VI - Initial Fluid Rate Chart for Burns as appropriate to patient weight ] ii. Ppediatric patients weighing less than 40 kg , use length -based tape for weight estimate and follow c. For persons over 40 kg, the initial fluid rate can also be calculated using the \"Rule of 10\": i. Calculate the TBSA (round to nearest 10%) ii. Multiply TBSA x 10 = initial fluid rate ( mL/hr) {for persons between 40 - 80 kg} iii. Add 100 mL/hr for every 10 kg of body weig ht over 80 kg 9. Prevent systemic heat loss and k eep the patient warm Special Treatment Considerations 1. If blast mechanism, treat per the Blast Injury guideline 2. Airway burns can rapidly lead to upper airway obstruction and respiratory failure 3. Have a high index of suspicion for cyanide poisoning in a patient with depressed GCS, respiratory difficulty and cardiovascular collapse in the setting of an enclosed -space fire . Give the antidote ( hydroxocobalamin), if available, in th is circumstance 4. Particularly in enclosed -space fires, carbon monoxide toxicity is a consideration and pulse oximetry may not be accurate [see Carbon Monoxide/Smoke Inhalation guideline ] 5. For specific chem ical exposures (cyanide, hydrofluoric acid, other acids and alkali) [see Topical Chemical Burn guideline ] 6. Consider decontamination and notification of receiving facility of potentially contaminated patient ( e.g. meth amphetamine (meth) lab incident) Upda ted January 5, 201 9 190 Notes/Educational Pearls 1. Onset of stridor and change in voice are sentinel signs of potentially significant airway burns, which may rapidly lead to airway obstruction or respiratory failure 2. If the patient is in shock wi thin one hour of burn, it is not from the burn . Evaluate the patient carefully for associated trauma or cyanide toxicity. 3. If the patient is not in shock, the fluid rates recommended above will adequately maintain patient's fluid volume. 4. Pain management is critical in acute burns 5. ETCO 2 monitoring may be particularly useful to monitor respiratory status in patients receiving significant doses of narcotic pain medication 6. Cardiac monitor is important in electrical burns and chemical inhalations 7. TBSA is calcula ted only based on percent of second and third degree burns - First degree burns are not included in this calculation Quality Improvement Burn trauma is relatively uncommon.

Minimize systemic effects of the crush syndrome Patient Presentation Inclusion criteria Traumatic crush mechanism of injury Exclusion criteria Non -crush injuries Patient Management Assessment 1. Identify any severe hemorrhage 2. Assess airway, breathing, and circulation 3. Evaluate for possible concomitant injury (e.g. fractures, solid organ damage, or spinal injury) 4. Monitor for development of compartment syndrome Treatment and Interventions 1. The treatment of crushed casualties should begin as soon as they are discovered 2. If severe hemorrhage is present, see Extremity Trauma/External Hemorrhage Management guideline 3. Administer high -flow oxygen 4. Intravenous access should be established with normal saline initial bolus of 10 -15 ml/kg (prior to extrication if p ossible) 5. For significant crush injuries or prolonged entrapment of an extremity, consider sodium bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg (maximum dose of 50 mEq) IV bolus over 5 minutes 6. Attach cardiac monitor. Obtain/interpret 12 -lead EKG, if available. Carefully monitor for dysrhythmias or signs of hypokalemia before and immediately after release of pre ssure and during transport (e.g. peaked T waves, wide QRS, lengthening QT interval, loss of P wave) 7. For pain control, consider analgesics [see Pain Management guideline ] 8. Consider the following post extrication a. Continued resuscitation with normal saline (500 -1000 cc/hr for adults, 10 cc/kg/hr for children) b. If suggestive of hyperkalemia, If findings of hy perkalemia , administer IV flu ids and consider administration of: i. Calcium chloride - 1 gm IV/IO over 5 minutes, ensure IV patency and do not exceed 1 mL per minute OR ii. Calcium gluconate - 2 gm IV/IO over 5 minutes with constant cardiac monitoring Upda ted January 5, 201 9 193 c. If not already administered, for si gnificant crush injuries with EK G suggestive of hyperkalemia, administer sodium bicarbonate 1 mEq /kg (max dose of 50 mEq) IV bolus over 5 minutes d. If EKG suggestive of hyp erkalemia, consider albuterol 5 mg via small volume nebulizer Patient Safety Conside rations Scene safety for both rescuers and patients is of paramount importance . Notes/Educational Pearls 1. Causes of mortality in untreated crush syndrome: a. Immediate i. Severe head injury ii. Traumatic asphyxia iii. Torso injury with damage to intrathoracic or intra -abdominal organs b. Early i. Hyperkalemia (potassium is released from injured muscle cells) ii. Hypovolemia/shock c. Late i. Renal failure (from release of toxins from injured muscle cells) ii. Coagulopathy and hemorrhage iii. Sepsis Key Considerations 1. Rapid extrication a nd evacuation to a definitive care facility (trauma center preferred) 2. A patient with a crush injury may initially present wi th very few signs and symptoms Therefore, maintain a high index of suspicion for any patient with a compressive mechanism of injury 3. A fatal medical complication of crush syndrome is hyperkalemia . Suspect hyperkalemia if T - waves become peaked, QRS becomes prolonged ( greater than 0.12 seconds), absent P wave, or prolonged QTc 4. Avoid lactated Ringer's solution as it contains potassium 5. Continue f luid resuscitation through extri cation and transfer to hospital Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Mental status/GCS 2. Evaluation for fractures and potential compartment syndrome development (neurovascular status of injured extremity) 3. Examination of spine 4.

Minimize blood loss from extremity hemorrhage 2. Avoid hemorrhagic shock as a result of extremity hemorrhage 3. Minimize pain and further injury as a resu lt of potential fractures or dislocations Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria 1. Traumatic extremity hemorrhage (external hemorrhage) 2. Potential extremity fractures or dislocations Exclusion Criteria No recommendations Patient Management Assessment 1. Evaluate for obvious deformity, shortening, rotation, or instability 2. Neurologic status of extremity a. Sensation to light touch b. Distal movement of extremity 3. Vascular status of extremity a. Pallor b. Pulse c. Capillary refill d. Degree of bleeding/blood loss with assessme nt of the color of the blood (venous or arterial) and whether it is pulsatile or not Treatments and Interventions (also, see protocol diagram below) 1. Manage bleeding a. Apply direct pressure to bleeding site followed by pressure dressing. b. If direct pressure/pressure dressing is ineffective or impractical: i. If the bleeding site is amenable to tourniquet placement, apply tourniquet to extremity 1. Tourniquet should be placed 2 -3 inches proximal to wound, not over a joint, and tightened until bleeding stops and distal pulse is eliminated 2. If bleeding continues, place a second tourniquet proximal to the first 3. For thigh wounds, consider placement of two tourniquets, side -by- side, and tighten sequentially to eliminate distal pulse ii. If the bleeding site is not a menable to tourniquet placement (i.e. junctional injury), pack wound tightly with a hemostatic gauze and apply direct pressure Upda ted January 5, 201 9 196 c. Groin/axillary injury i. Apply direct pressure to wound ii. If still bleeding, pack wound tightly with hemostatic gauze and apply direct pressure iii. Consider using a junctional hemostatic device if available 2. Manage pain [see Pain Management guideline ] a. Pain management should be strongly considered for patients with suspected fractures b. If tourniquet place d, an alert patient will likely require pain medication to manage tourniquet pain 3. Stabilize suspected fractures/dislocations a. Strongly consider pain management before attempting to move a suspected fracture b. If distal vascular function is compromised, gent ly attempt to res tore normal anatomic position c. Use splints as appropriate to limit movement of suspected fracture d. Elevate extremity fractures above heart level whenever possible to limit swelling e. Apply ice/cool packs to limit swelling in suspected fracture s or soft tissue injury - do not apply ice directly to skin f. Reassess distal neurovascular status after any manipulation or splinting of fractures/dislocations Patient Safety Considerations 1. If tourniquet use: a. Ensure that it is sufficiently tight to occlude the distal pulse, in order to avoid compartment syndrome b. Ensure that it is well marked and visible and that all subsequent providers are aware of the presence of the tourniquet c. Do not cover with clothing or dressings 2. Mark t ime of tourniquet placeme nt promin ently on the patient 3. If pressure dressing or tourniquet used, frequently re -check to determine if bleeding has restarted. Check for blood soaking through the dressing or continued bleeding distal to the tourniquet. Do not remove tourniquet or dre ssing in order to assess bleeding Notes/Educational P earls Key Considerations 1. Tourniquet may be placed initially to stop obvious severe hemorrhage, then replaced later with pressure dressing after stabilization o f ABCs and packaging of patient. Tournique t should not be removed if: a. Transport time short (less than 30 minutes) b. Amputation or near -amputation c. Unstable or complex multiple -trauma patient d. Unstable clinical or tactical situation 2. If tourniquet is replaced with pressure dressing, leave loose tourniqu et in place so it may be retightened if bleeding resumes 3. Survival is markedly improved when a tourniquet is placed before shock ensues 4. Commercial/properly tested tourniquets are preferred over improvised tourniquets 5. If hemostatic gauze is not available, p lain gauze tightly packed into a wound has been shown to be effective Upda ted January 5, 201 9 197 6. Arterial pressure points are not effective in controlling hemorrhage 7. Amputated body parts should be transported with patient for possible re -implantation a. It should remain cool but dry b. Place the amputated part in a plastic bag c. Place the bag with the amputated part on ice in a second bag d.

Preservation of vision 3. Preservation of dentition Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria Isolated facial injury, including trauma to the eyes, nose, ears, midface, mandible, dentition Exclusion Criteria 1. General Trauma [see General Trauma Management guideline ] 2. Burn trauma [see Burns guideline ] Patient Management Assessment 1. Patient medications with focus on blood thinners/anti -platelet agents 2. ABCs with particular focus on ability to keep airway patent a. Stable midface b. Stable mandible c. Stable dentition (poorly anchored teeth require vigilance for possible aspiration ) 3. Bleeding (which may be severe - epistaxis, oral trauma, facial lacerations) 4. Cervical spine pain or tenderness [see Spinal Care guideline ] 5. Mental status assessment for possible traumatic brain injury [see Head Injury guideline ] 6. Gross vision assessment 7. Dental avulsi ons 8. Any tissue or teeth avulsed should to be collect ed 9. Lost teeth not recovered on scene may be in the airway 10. Overall trauma assessment 11. Specific re -examination geared toward airway and ability to ventilate adequately Treatment and Interventions 1. Administe r oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 94 -98% saturation - use ETCO 2 to help monitor for hypoventilation and apnea 2. IV access, as needed, for fluid or medication administration 3. Pain medication per the Pain Management guideline 4. Avulsed tooth: a. Avoid touching the root of the avulsed tooth . Do not wipe off tooth b. Pick up at crown end . If dirty, rinse off under cold water for 10 seconds c. Place in milk or saline as the storage medium . Alternatively , an alert and co operative patient can hold tooth in mouth using own saliva as storage medium Upda ted January 5, 201 9 201 5. Eye trauma: a. Place eye shield for any significant eye trauma b. If globe is avulsed , do not put back into socket . Cover with moist saline dressings and then place cup over it 6. Mandible unstable: a. Expect patient ca nnot spit/swallow effectively and have suction readily available b. Preferentially transport sitting up with emesis basin/suction available (in the absence of a suspected spinal injury, see Spinal Care guideline ) 7. Epistaxis - squeeze nose (or have pat ient do so) for 10 -15 minutes continuously 8. Nose/ear avulsion: a. Recover tissue if it does not waste scene time b. Transport with tissue wra pped in dry sterile gauze in a plastic bag place d on ice c. Severe ear and nose lacerations can be addressed with a protective moist sterile dressing Patient Safety Considerations 1. Frequent reassessment of airway 2. Maintenance of a patent airway is the highest priority; therefore, conduct c ervical spine assessment for field clearance (per Spinal Care guideline ) to enable transport sitting up for difficulty with bleeding, swal lowing, or handling secretions Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Airway may be compromised because of fractures or bleeding 2. After nasal fractures, epistaxis may be posterior and may not respond to direct pressure over the nares with bleeding running down posterior pharynx, potentially compromising airway 3. Protect avulsed tissue and teeth a. Avulsed teeth m ay be successfully re -implanted if done so in a very short period after injury b. Use sterile dressing for ear and nose cartilage Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Unstable facial fractures that can abruptly compromise airway 2. Loose teeth and retro -pharynx bleeding Quality Improvement Associated NEMSIS Protocol(s) -Dental -Facial Trauma 9914099 - Injury -Eye Key Documentation Elements Airway patency and reassessment Degree and location of hemorrhage Mental status (GCS or AVPU) Technique used to transport tissue or teeth Upda ted January 5, 201 9 202 Eye exam documented, when applicable Assessment and management of cervical spine Patient use of anticoagulant medications Performance Measures Appropriate airway management and satisfactory oxygenation Eye shield applied to eye trauma EMS Compass \u00ae Measure s (for additional information, see www.emscompass.org ) o PEDS -03: Documentation of estimated weight in kilograms.

Airway: a. Administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 94 -98% saturation b. If patient unable to maintain airway, consider oral airway (nasal airway should not be used with significant facial injury or possible basilar skull fracture) c. Oral endot racheal intubation or supraglottic airway insertion can be used if BVM ventilation ineffective in maintaining oxygenation or if ai rway is continually compromised d. Nasal intubation should not be used in patients with head injury 2. Breathing: a. For patients with a moderate or/severe head injury who are unable to maintain their airway: use continuous waveform capnography, and EtCO 2 measurement if available, with a target EtCO 2 of 35 -40 mmHg b. Supraglottic airway placement or/endotracheal intubation should onl y be performed if BVM ventilation is inadequate to maintain adequate oxygenation with a target EtCO 2 of 35-40 mmHg c. For patients with a severe head injury with signs of herniation: hyperventilate to a target EtCO 2 of 30 -35 mmHg as a short -term option, an d only for severe head injury with signs of herniation 3. Circulation: a. Wound care i. Control bleeding with direct pressure if no suspected open skull injury ii. Moist sterile dressing to any potential open skull wound iii. Cover an injured eye with moist saline dressing and place cup over it b. Mod erate/severe closed head injury i. Blood pressure: avoid hypotension 1.

Penetrating head trauma iii. Open or depressed skull fracture Patient Safety Considerations 1. Do no t hyperventilate patient unless signs of herniation 2. Assume concomitant cervical spine injury in patients with moderate/severe head injury 3. Geriatric Consideration: Elderly patients with ankylosing spondylitis or severe kyphosis should be padded and immobili zed in a position of comfort and may not tolerate a cervical collar Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Head injury severity guideline: a. Mild: GCS 13 -15 / AVPU = (A) b. Moderate: GCS 9 -12 / AVPU = (V) c. Severe: GCS 3 -8 / AVPU = (P) or (U) 2. Important that providers be specifically trained in accurate neurologic status assessment [see Appendix VII - Neurologic Status Assessment ] 3.

Revision Date September 8 , 2017 Upda ted January 5, 201 9 208 High Threat Considerations /Active Shooter Scenario Aliases None noted Definitions Hot Zone/Direct Threat Zone: an area within the inner perimeter where active threat and active hazards exists. Warm Zone/Indirect Threat Zone: an area within the inner perimeter where security and safety measures are in place . This zone may have potential hazards, but no active danger exists. Patient Care Goals 1. Assess scene 2. Mitigating further harm 3. Accomplish goal with minimal additional injuries Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria High threat environment - when greater than normal conditions exist that are likely to cause damage or danger to provider or patient Exclusion Criteria No significant threat exists to provider and patient allowing for the performance of routine care Patient Management Assessment, Treatment , and Interventions 1. Hot Zone/Direct T hreat care considerations : a. Defer in depth medical interventions if engaged in ongoing direct threat ( e.g. active shooter, unstable building collapse, improvised explosive device, ha zardous material threat) b. Threat mitigat ion techniques will minimize risk to patients and pr oviders c. Triage should be def erred to a later phase of care d. Prioritization for extraction is based on resour ces available and the situation e. Minim al interventions are warranted f. Encourage patients to provid e self -first aid or instruct aid from uninjured bystander g. Consider hemorrhage control : i. Tourniquet application is the primary \"medical\" intervention to be considered in Hot Zone/Direct Threat ii. Consider instructing patient to apply direct pressure to the wound if no tourniquet available (or application is not feasible) iii. Consider quickly placing or directing patient to be placed in position to protect airwa y, if not immediately moving patient 2. Warm Zone/Indirect T hreat care considerations : a. Maintain situationa l awareness Upda ted January 5, 201 9 209 b. Ensure safety of both responders and patients by rendering equipment and environment safe (firearms, vehicle ignition) c. Condu ct primary survey, per the General Trauma Management guideline , and ini tiate appropriate life-saving interventions i. Hemorrhage control 1. Tourniquet 2. Wound packing if feasible ii. Maintain airway and support ventilation [see Airway Management guideline ] d. Do not delay patient extraction and evacua tion fo r non -life-saving interventions e. Consider establishing a casualty collection point if multiple patients are encountered f. Unless in a fixed casualty collection point, triage in this phase of care should be limited to the following categories: i. Uninju red and/or capable of self -extraction ii. Deceased/expectant iii. All other s Patient Safety Considerations 1. Anticipate unique threats based on situation 2. During high threat situations, provider safety should be considered in balancing the risks and benefits of patient treatment Notes/ Educational P earls Key Considerations 1. In high threat situations, novel risk assessment should be considered. Provider and patient safety will need to be simultaneously considered 2. During high threat situations, an integrated response with other public safety entities may be warranted 3. Depending on the situation, a little risk may reap significant benefits to patient safety and outcome 4. During these situations, maintaining communications and incident management concepts may be crucial to maximizing efficiency and mitigating dangers Quality Improvement Associated NEMSIS Protocol(s) (eProtocol.01) None recommended Key Documentatio n Elements Traditional documentation may not be appropriate during Hot Zone/Direct T hreat and Warm Zone/Indirect Threat care Documentation of key intervention should be relayed : o Time of tourniquet application o GCS Upda ted January 5, 201 9 210 References 1.

Revision Date September 8, 2017 Upda ted January 5, 201 9 211 Spinal Care (Adapted from an evidence -based guideline created using the National Prehospital Evidence -Based Guideline Model Process) Aliases None noted Patient Care Goals 1. Select patients for whom spinal motion restriction (SMR) is indicated 2. Minimize secondary injury to spine in patients who have, or may have, an unstable spinal injury 3. Minimize patient morbidity from the use of immobilization devices Patient Presentation Inclusion criteria Traumati c mechanism of injury Exclusion criteria No recommendations Patient Management Assessment 1. Assess the scene to determine the mechanism of injury a. Mechanism alone should not determine if a patient requires spinal motion restriction - however, mechanisms that have been associated with a higher risk of injury are: i. Motor vehicle crashes (including automobiles, all -terrain vehicles, and snowmobiles) ii. Axial loading injuries to the spine iii. Falls greater than 10 feet 2. Assess the patient in the pos ition found for findings associated with spine injury : a. Mental status b. Neurologic deficits c. Spinal pain or tenderness d. Any evidence of intoxication e. Other severe injuries , particularly associated torso injuries Treatment and Interventions 1. Place patient in cervical collar if there are any of the following: a. Patient complains of midline neck or spine pain b. Any midline neck or spinal tenderness with palpation c. Any abnormal mental status (including extreme agitation) d. Focal or neurologic deficit e. Any evidence of alcohol or drug intoxication f. Another severe or painful distracting injury is present g. Torticollis in children h. A communication barrier that prevents accurate assessment i. If none of the above apply, patient may be managed without a cervical collar Upda ted January 5, 201 9 212 2. Patients wi th penetrating injury to the neck should not be placed in a cervical collar or other spinal precautions regardless of whether they are exhibiting neurologic symptoms or not . Doing so can lead to delayed identification of injury or airway compromise, and ha s been associated with increased mortality 3. If extrication is required : a. From a vehicle : After placing a cervical collar, if indicated, children in a booster seat and adults should be allowed to self -extricate . For infants and toddlers already strapped in a car seat with a built -in harness, extricate the child while strapped in his/her car seat b. Other situations requiring extrication : A padded long board may be used for extrication, using the lift and slide (rather than a logroll) technique 4. Helmet removal a. If a football helmet needs to be removed, it is recommended to remove the face mask followed by manual removal (rather than the use of automated devices) of the helmet while keeping the neck manually immobilized - occipital and shoulder padding should be appl ied, as needed, with the patient in a supine position, in order to maintain neutral cervical spine positioning b. Evidence is lacking to provide guidance about other types of helmet removal 5. Do not transport patients on rigid long boards, unless the clinical s ituation warrants long board use . An example of this may be facilitation of immobilization of multiple extremity injuries or an unstable patient where removal of a board will delay transport and/or other treatment priorities . In these situations, long boards should ideally be padded or have a vacuum mattress applied to minimize secondary injury to the patient 6. Patients should be transported to the nearest appropriate facility, in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control \"Guidelines for Fie ld Triag e of Injured Patients\" [ Appendix X ] 7. Patients with severe kyphosis or ankylosing spondylitis may not tolerate a cervical collar. These patients should be immobilized in a position of comfort using towel rolls or sand bags Patient Safety Considerations 1. Be aware of potential airway compromise or aspiration in immobilized patient with nausea/vomiting, or with facial/oral bleeding 2. Excessively tight immobilization straps can limit chest excursion and cause hypoventilation 3. Prolonged immobilization on spine board can lead to ischemic pressure injuries to skin 4. Prolonged immobilization on spine board can be very uncomfortable for patient 5. Children are abdominal breathers, so immobilization straps should go across chest and pelvis and not across the abdomen, when possible 6. Children have disproportionately larger heads. When securing pediatric patients to a spine board, the board should have a recess for the head, or the body should be elevated approximately 1 -2 cm t o accommodate the larger head size and avoid neck flexion when immobilized 7. In an uncooperative patient, avoid interventions that may promote increased spinal movement 8. The preferred position for all patients with spine management is flat and supine. There a re three circumstances under which raising the head of the bed to 30 degrees should be considered: a. Respiratory distress b. Suspected severe head trauma c. Promotion of patient compliance Upda ted January 5, 201 9 213 Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Evidence is lacking to suppo rt or refute the use of manual stabilization prior to spinal assessment in the setting of a possible traumatic injury, when the patient is alert with spontaneous head/neck movement Providers should not manually stabilize these alert and spontaneously movin g patients, since patients with pain will self -limit movement , and forcing immobilization in this scenario may unnecessarily increase discomfort and anxiety 2. Certain populations with musculoskeletal instability may be predisposed to cervical spine injury . However, evidence does not support or refute that these patients should be treated differently than those who do not have these conditions . These patients should be treated according to the Spinal Care guideline like other patients without these conditions 3. Age alone should not be a factor in decision -making for prehospital spine care, yet the patient's ability to reliably be assessed at the extremes of age should be considered. Communication barriers with infants/toddlers or elderly patients with dementia may prevent the provider from accurately assessing the patient 4. Spinal precautions should be considered a tre atment or preventive therapy 5. Patients who are likely to benefit from immobilization should underg o this treatment 6. Patients who are not likely to benefit from immobilization, who have a low likelihood of spinal injury, should not be immobilized 7. Ambulatory patients may be safely immobilized on gurney with cervical collar and straps and will not generall y require a spine board 8. Reserve l ong spine board use for the movement of patients whose injuries limit ambulation and who meet criteria for the use of spinal precautions. Remove from the long board as soon as is practical Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Mental status 2. Normal neurologic examination 3. Evidence of intoxication 4. Evidence of multiple tr auma with other severe injuries Quality Improvement Associated NEMSIS Protocol(s) (eProtocol.01) 9914107 - Injury -Spinal Cord 9914073 - General -Spinal Precautions /Clearance Key Documentation Elements Patient complaint of neck or spine pain Spinal tenderness Mental status/GCS Neurologic examination Evidence of intoxication Documentation of multiple trauma Documentation of mechanism of injury Upda ted January 5, 201 9 214 Document patient capacity with: o Any and all barriers to patient care in the NEMSIS element \"Barriers to Patient Care\" (eHistory.01 -required of all software systems) o Exam fields for Mental Status and Neurological Assessment o Vitals for Level of Responsiveness and Glasgow Com a Scale o Alcohol and drug use indicators Patient age Patients under age and not emancipated: Guardian name, contact, and relationship Performance Measures Percentage of patients with high risk mechanisms of injury and/or signs or symptoms of cervical spi ne injury who are placed in a cervical collar Percentage of patients without known trauma who have a cervical immobilization device placed (higher percentage creates a negative aspect of care) Percentage of trauma patients who are transported on a long bac kboard (target is a low percentage) Percentage of patients with a cervical spinal cord injury or unstable cervical fracture who did not receive cervical collar EMS Compass Measure s (for additional information, see www.emscompass.org ) o PEDS -03: Documentation of estimated weight in kilograms.

Use environmental Carbon Monoxide (CO) detecto r on \"first in\" bag if possible 2. Consider body substance i solation (BSI) or appropriate PPE 3. Assess ABCD and, if indicated, expose patient for assessment, and then re -cover t o assure retention of body heat 4. Vital signs including temperature 5. Attach cardiac monitor and examine rhythm strip for arr hythmias (consider 1 2-lead EKG) 6. Check blood glucose level 7. Monitor pulse oximetry and ETCO 2 for respiratory decompensation 8. Perform carboxyhemoglobin device assessment, if available 9. When indicated, identify specific medication taken (including immediate release vs sustained release ), time of ingestion, dose, and quantity . When appropriate, bring all medications (prescribed and not prescribed ) in the environment 10. Obtain an accurate ingestion history (as patient may become unconscious before arrival at ED): a. Time of ingestion b. Route of exposure c. Quantity of medication or toxin taken (safely collect all possible medications or agents ) d. Alcohol or other intoxicant taken 11. If bringing in exposure agent, consider the threat to yourself and the destination facility 12. Obtain pertinent cardiovascular history and other prescribed medications 13. Check for needle marks, paraphernalia, bites, bottles, or evidence of agent involved in exposure, self-inflicted injury, or trauma 14. Law enforcement should have checked for weapons and drugs, but you may decide to re- check 15. Obtain pertinent patient history 16. Perform physical examination Treatment and Interventions 1. Assure a patent airway 2. Administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 94-98% saturation and, if there is hypoventilation noted, support breathing 3. Initiate IV access for infusion treatment medication and/or lactated Ringer 's or normal saline if indicated, and obtain blood samples if EMS management might change value (e.g. glucose, lactate, cyanide ) 4. Fluid bolus (20 mL/kg) if evidence of hypoperfusion 5. Administration of appropriate antidote or mitigating medication (refer to specific agent guideline if not listed below ) a. Acetaminophen overdose : i. Consider activated charcoal without sorbitol (1 g/kg) PO only if within the first hour of ingestion and prolonged transport to definitive care ii. Based on suspected quantity and timing , consider acetylcysteine (pediatric and adult ) 1. Loading dose is acetylcysteine 150 mg/kg IV; mix in 200 mL of D5W and infuse over 1 hr Upda ted January 5, 201 9 222 2. Then dose acetylcysteine 50 mg/kg IV in 500 mL D5W over 4 hrs 3. If IV is not available, acetylcysteine 140 mg/kg PO iii. If risk of rapidly decreasing mental status, do not administer oral agents b. Aspirin overdose : i. Consider activated charcoal without sorbitol (1 gm/kg) PO 1. As aspirin is erratically absorbed, charcoal is highly recommended to be administered early 2. If altered mental status or risk of rapid decreasing mental status from polypharmacy, do not administer oral agents including activated charcoal ii. In salicylate poisonings, let th e patient breath on their own , even if tachypnea, until there is evidence of decompensation or dropping oxygen saturation. Acid/base disturbances and outcomes worsen when the patient is manually ventilated c. Benzodiazepine overdose: i. Respiratory support ii. Consider fluid challenge (20 mL/kg) for hypotension iii. Consider vasopressors after adequate fluid resuscitation (1 -2 liters of crystalloid) for the hypotensive patient d. Caustic substances ingestion (e.g. acids and alkali ): i. Evaluate for airway compromise second ary to spasm or direct injury associated with oropharyngeal burns ii. In the few minutes immediately after ingestion, consider administration of wate r or milk if available . Adults : maximum 240 mL (8 ounces); Pediatrics: maximum 120 mL (4 ounces ) to minimize risk of vomiting 1. Do not attempt dilution in patients with respiratory distress, altered mental status, severe abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, or patients who are unable to swallow or protect their airway . 2. Do not force fluids in anyone who refuses to drink . e. Dystonia (symptomatic ), extrapyramidal signs or symptoms, or mild allergic reactions i. Consider administration of diphenhydramine 1. Adult : diphenhydramine 25- 50 mg IV or IM 2. Pediatric : diphenhydramine 1- 1.25 mg/kg IVP/IO or IM (maximum single dose of 25 mg) midazolam (benzodiazepine of choice) for temperature control ii. Adult and Pediatric : Midazolam 0.1 mg/kg in 2 mg increments slow IV push over one to two minutes per increment with maximum single dose 5 mg - reduce by 50% for patients 69 years or older g. Opiate overdose , treat per the Opioid Poisoning/Overdose guideline h. Oral ingestion unknown poisoning : i. If there is a risk of rapidly decreasing mental status or for petroleum -based ingestions, do not administer oral agents ii. Consider administr ation of activated charcoal without sorbitol (1 g/kg) PO particularly if it is within the first 1 hour after ingestion (including acetaminophen ) or prolonged transport to definitive care . Upda ted January 5, 201 9 223 iii. Patients who have ingested medications with extended release or delayed absorption should also be administered activated charcoal i. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) i. Consider early airway management ii. Treat arrhythmias following ACLS guidelines iii. Aggressively control hyperthermia with cooling measures iv. Consider fluid challenge (20 mL/kg) for hypotension v. Conside r vasopressors after adequate fluid resuscitation (1 -2 liters of crystalloid) for the hypotensive patient [see Shock guideline ] vi.

Reduce by 50% for patients 69 years or older 2. Pediatric : midazolam 0.1 mg/kg in 2 mg increments slow I V push over one to two minutes per increment with maximum single dose 5 mg or midazolam 0 .2 mg/kg IN to maximum dose of 4 mg vii. For seizures, treat per Seizure s guideline j. Tricyclic Antidepressant (TCA) Overdose: i. Consider early airway management ii. If widened QRS (100 msec or greater), consider sodium bicarbonate 1 -2 meq/kg IV, this can be repeated as needed to narrow QRS and improve blood pressure iii. Consider fluid challenge (20 mL/kg) for hypotension iv. Consi der vasopressors after adequ ate fluid resuscitation (1 -2 liters of crystalloid) for the hypotensive patient [see Shock guideline ] v. For agitation , consider midazolam (benzodiazepine of choice) 1. Adult : midazolam 0.1 mg/kg in 2 mg increments slow IV push over one to two minutes per increment with maximum single dose 5 mg a. Reduce by 50% for patients 69 years or older 2. Pediatric : midazolam 0.1 mg/kg in 2 mg increments slow IV push over one to two minutes per increment with maximum single dose 5 mg or midazolam 0.2 mg/kg IN to maximum dose of 4 mg vi. For seizure, treat per Seizure s guideline Patient Safety Considerations 1. Scene /environmental safety for patient and provider a. Consider environmental carbon monoxide monitor use 2. Monitor patient airway, breathing, pulse oximetry, ETCO 2 for adequate ventilation as they may change over time 3. Repeat vital signs often 4. Monitor level of consciousness 5. Monitor EKG with special attention to rate, rhythm, QRS and QT duration 6. Maintain or normalize patient temperature 7. The regional p oison center should be engaged as early as reasonably possible to aid in appropriate therapy and to track patient outcomes to improve knowledge of toxic effects . The national 24-hour toll -free telephone number to poison control centers is (800) 222 - 1222, and it is a resource for free, confidential expert advice from anywhere in the United States Upda ted January 5, 201 9 224 Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Each toxin or overdose has unique c haracteristics which must be co nsidered in individual protocol 2. Activated charcoal (which does not bind to all medications or agents) is still a useful adjunct in the serious agent, enterohepatic, or extended release agent poisoning as long as the patient d oes not have the potential for rapid alteration of mental st atus or airway/ aspiration risk - precautions should be taken to avoid o r reduce the risk of aspiration 3. Ipecac is no longer recommended for any poisoning or toxic ingestion - the manufacturer has stoppe d production of this medication 4. Flumazenil is not indicated in a suspected benzodiazepine overdose as you can precipitate refractory/ intractable seizures if the patient is a b enzodiazepine dependent patient Pertinent Assessment Findings Frequent r eassessment is essential as patient deterioration can be rapid and catastrophic. Quality Improvement Associated NEMSIS Protocol(s) (eProtocol.01) 9914135 - General -Overdose/Poisoning/Toxic Ingestion Key Documentation Elements Repeat evaluation and documentation of signs and symptoms as patient clinical con ditions may deteriorate rapidly Identification of possible etiology of poisoning Initiating measures on scene to prevent exposure of bystanders when appropriate/indicated Time of symptoms onset and time of initiation of exposure -specific treatments Performance Measures Early airway management in the rapidly deteriorating patient. Accurate exposure history o Time of ingestion/exposure o Route of exposure o Quantity of medication or toxin taken (safely c ollect all possible mediations or agents) o Alcohol or other intoxicant taken Appropriate protocol selection and management.

Revision Date September 8, 2017 Upda ted January 5, 201 9 226 Acetylcholinesterase weapons of mass destruction, WMD Patient Care Goals 1. Rapid recognition of the signs and symptoms of confirmed or suspected acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) agents such as carbamates, nerve agents, or organophosphates exposure followed by expeditious and repeated administration of atropine, the primary antidote 2. Carbamates and organophosphates are commonly active agents in over -the-counter insecticides 3. Accidental carbamate exp osure rarely requires treatment Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria 1. DUMBELS is a mnemonic used to describe the signs and sym ptoms of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agent poisoning . All patient age groups are included where the signs and symptoms exhibited are consistent with the toxidrome of DUMBELS a. Diarrhea b. Urination c. Miosis/ Muscle weakness d. Bronchospasm/ Bronchorrhea/ Bradycardia (the killer B's) e. Emesis f. Lacrimation g. Salivation/ Sweating Exclusion Criteria No recommendations Patient Management 1. Don the appropriate PPE 2. Remove the patient's clothing and wa sh the skin with soap and water a. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agents can be ab sorbed through the skin b. Contaminated clothing can provide a source of continued exposure to the toxin 3. Rapidly assess the patient's respiratory status, ment al status, and pupillary status 4. Administer the antidote immediately for confirmed or suspected acetylcholines terase inhibitor agent exposure 5. Administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 94 -98% saturation and provide airway management 6. Establish i ntravenous access (if possible) 7. Apply a cardiac monitor (if available) 8. The heart rate may be norm al, bradycardic, or tachycardic 9. Clinical improvement should be based upon the drying of secretions and easing of respiratory effort rather than heart rate or pupillary response. Upda ted January 5, 201 9 227 10. Continuous and ongoing p atient reassessment is critical Assessment 1. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agents are highly toxic chemical a gents and can rapidly be fatal 2. Patients with low -dose chronic exposures may have a more d elayed presentation of symptoms 3. Antidotes (atropine and pralidoxime) are effective if admini stered bef ore circulation fails 4. The patient may develop: a. Miosis (pinpoint pupils) b. Bronchospasm c. Bradycardia d. Vomiting e. Excessive secretions in the form of: i. Tearing ii. Salivation iii. Rhinorrhea iv. Diarrhea v. Urination vi. Bronchorrhea 5. Penetration of an a cetylcholinesterase inhibitor a gent into the central nervous system (CNS) will cause: a. Headache b. Confusion c. Generalized muscle weakness d. Seizures e. Lethargy or unresponsiveness 6. Estimated level of exposur e based upon signs and symptoms a. Mild i. Miosis alone (while this is a primary sign in vapor exposure, it may not be present is all exposures) ii. Miosis and severe rhinorrhea b. Mild to moderate (in addition to symptoms of mild exposure) i. Localized swelling ii. Muscle fasciculations iii. Nausea and vomiting iv. Weakness v. Shortness of breath c. Severe (in addition to sym ptoms of mild to moderate exposure) i. Unconsciousness ii. Convulsions iii. Apnea or severe respiratory distress requiring assisted ventilation iv. Flaccid paralysis 7. Onset of symptoms can be immediate with an exposure to a large amount of the acetylcholinesterase inhibito r a. There is usually an asymptomatic interval of minutes after liquid expos ure before these symptoms occur b. Effects from vapor ex posure occur almost immediately Upda ted January 5, 201 9 228 8. Signs and symptoms with larg e acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agent exposures (regardless of route) a. Sudden loss of consciousness b. Seizures c. Copious secretions d. Apnea e. Death 9. Obtain an accurate ingestion history (as patient may become unconscious before arrival at ED): a. Time of ingestion or exposure b. Route of exposure c. Quantity of medication or toxin taken (saf ely collect all possible medications or agents) d. Alcohol or other intoxicant taken e. Pertinent cardiovascular history or other prescribed medications for underlying disease 10. The patient can manifest any or all of the signs and symptoms of the toxidrome based on the route of exposure, agent involved, and concentration of the agent: a. Vapor exposures will have a direct effect on the eyes and pupils causing miosis b. Patients with isolated skin exposures will have normally reactive pupils c. Certain acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agents can place the patient at risk for both a vapor and skin exposure Treatment and Interventions (see dosing tables below) 1. Medications : a. Atropine i. Atropine is the primary antidote for organophosphate, carbamate, or nerve agent exposures, and repeated doses should be administered liberally to patients who exhibit signs and s ymptoms of exposure or toxicity ii. Atropine may be provided in multi -dose vials, pre -filled syringes, or auto - injectors available atropine auto -injectors include: 1. Atro -Pen\u00ae 1 mg of atropine (dark red container) 2. Atro -Pen\u00ae 2 mg of atropine (green container) 3. Pediatric Atro -Pen\u00ae 0.25 mg of atropine (yellow container) 4. Pediatric Atro -Pen\u00ae 0.5 mg of atropine (blue container) b. Pralidoxime chloride (2 -PAM) i. Pralidoxime chlorid e is a secondary treatment and should be given concurrently in an effort to reacti vate the acetylcholinesterase ii. Pralidoxime chloride may be provided in a single dose vial, pre -filled syringes, or auto -injectors iii. Auto -injectors contain 600 mg of pralidoxime chloride iv. In order to be beneficial to the victim, a dose of pralidoxime chloride should be administered shortly after the nerve agent or organophosphate poisoning as it has minimal clinical effe ct if administration is delayed c. Benzodiazepines i. Benzodiazepine s are administered as an anticonvulsant for those patients who exhibit seizure activity [see Seizure s guideline for doses and routes of administration ] Upda ted January 5, 201 9 229 ii. Lorazepam, diazepam, and midazolam are the most frequently used benzodiaz epines in the prehospital setting iii. In the scenario of an a cetylcholinesterase inhibitor agent exposure, the administration of diazepam or midazolam is preferable due to t heir more rapid onset of action iv. Benzodiazepines may be provided in multi -dose or single -dose vials, pre -filled syringes, v. CANA \u00ae (Convulsive Antidote Nerve Agent) is a commercially available auto - injector that contains 10 mg of diazepam d. Mark I\u00ae Kits i. A commercially available kit of nerve agent/organophosphate antidote auto - injectors. These are being phased out and replaced with Duodote by the CDC ii. A Mark I\u00ae kit consists of one auto -injector containing 2 milligrams of atropine and a second auto -injector containing 600 mil ligrams of pralidoxime chloride e. Duodote\u00ae i. A commercially available auto -injector of nerve agent/organophosphate antidote ii. Duodote \u00ae is one auto -injector that contains 2.1 milligrams of atropine and 600 milligrams of pralidoxime chloride f. ATNAA\u00ae (Antidote Treatment Nerve Agent -injector) i. An auto -injector of nerv e agent/organophosphate antidote that is typically in military supplies ii. ATNAA\u00ae is one auto -injector that contains 2.1 milligrams of atropine and 600 milligrams of pralidoxime chloride iii. ATNAA\u00ae may be seen in civilian supplies assets when Duodote\u00ae is unavaila ble or in short supply g. CHEMPACK i. Federally -owned cache of nerve agent antidotes that is managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and offered to states that voluntarily agree to maintain custody and security of CHEMPACK assets ii. These ar e forward -deployed at sites determined by states that are part of the program such as hospitals and EMS centers iii. Deployment of CHEMPACKs are reserved for events where the nerve agent/organophosphate exposure will deplete the local or regional supply of antidotes iv. There are two types of CHEMPACK containers: 1. EMS Containers : CHEMPACK assets for EMS contain a large portion of auto -injectors for rapid administration of antidotes by EMS providers of all levels of licensure/certification - They contain enough antidot e to treat roughly 454 patients 2. Hospital Containers : CHEMPACK assets contain a large portion of multidose vials and powders for reconstitution - they contain enough antidote to treat roughly 1000 patients 2. Medication Administrati on: a. Atropine in extremely large, and potentially multiple , doses is the antidote for an acetylcholineste rase inhibitor agent poisoning b. Atropine should be administered immediately followed by repeated doses until the patient's secretions resol ve Upda ted January 5, 201 9 230 c. Pralidoxime chloride (2 -PAM) is a secondary treatment and, when possible, should be administ ered concurrently with atropine d. The stock of atropine and pralidoxime chloride available to EMS providers is usually not sufficient t o fully treat the victim of an a cetylchol inesterase inhibitor agent exposure; however, EMS providers should initiate the administration of atropine and, if available, pralidoxime chloride e. Seizures should be treated with benzodiazepines. There is some emerging evidence that, for midazolam, the int ranasal route of administration may be prefer able to the intramuscular route. However, intramuscular absorption may be more clinically efficacious than the intranasal route in the presence of significant rhinorrhea f. The patient should be emergently transpor ted to the closest appropriate medical facility as direc ted by direct medical oversight 3. Recommended Doses (see dosing tables below) The medication dosing tables that are provided below are based upon the severity of the clinical signs and symptoms exhibited by the patient. There are several imperative factors to note: a. For organophosphate or severe acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agent exposure, the required dose of atropine necessary to dry secretions and improve the respiratory status is likely to e xceed 20 mg. Atropine should be administered rapidly and repeatedly until the patie nt's clinical symptoms diminish . Atropine must be given until the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agent has been metabolized. It may require up to 2000 mg of atropine over several days to weeks b. Since the antidotes in the Mark I\u00ae kit are in two separate vials, the atropine auto - injector in the kit can be administered to the patient in the event that Atro -Pen\u00ae or generic atropine auto -injectors are not available and/or intravenous atro pine is not an immediate option c. Due to the fact that Duodote\u00ae auto -injectors contain pralidoxime chloride, they should not be used for additional dosing of atropine beyond the recommended administer ed dose of pralidoxime c hloride d. All of the medications below can be administered intravenously in the same doses cited for the intramuscular route. However, due to the rapidity of onset of signs, symptoms, and potential death from acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agents, intramuscu lar administration is highly recommended to eliminate the inherent delay associated with establi shing intravenous access e. The antidotes can be administered via the intraosseous route. However, due to the rapidity of onset of signs, symptoms, and potential d eath from acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agents, intramuscular administration remains the preferable due to the inherent delay associated with establishing intraosseous access and the limited use of this route of admin istration for other medications Upda ted January 5, 201 9 231 Mild Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor Agent Exposure Patient (Weight) Atropine Dose IM or via Auto -injector Infant: 0-2 yo 0.05 mg/kg IM or via auto -injector (e.g. 0.25 and/or 0.5 mg auto -injector(s) ) Child: 3-7 yo (13-25 kg) 1 mg IM or via auto -injector (e.g. one 1 mg or two 0.5 mg auto -injectors) Child: 8-14 yo (26-50 kg) 2 mg IM or via auto -injector (e.g. one 2 mg or two 1 mg auto -injectors) Adolescent/ Adult 2 mg IM or via auto -injector Pregnant Women 2 mg IM or via auto -injector Geriatric/ Frail 1 mg IM or via auto -injector Mild to Moderate Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor Agent Exposure Patient (Weight) Atropine Dose IM or via Auto -injector Pralidoxime Chloride Dose IM or via 600 mg Auto -injector Infant: 0-2 years 0.05 mg/kg IM or via auto -injector (e.g. 0.25 mg and/or 0.5 mg auto -injector ) 15 mg/kg IM Child: 3-7 yo (13-25 kg) 1 mg IM or via auto -injector (e.g. one 1 mg auto -injector or two 0.5 mg auto -injectors ) 15 mg/kg IM OR One auto -injector (600 mg) Child: 8-14 yo (26-50 kg) 2 mg IM or via auto -injector (e.g. one 2 mg auto -injector or two 1 mg auto -injectors) 15 mg/kg IM OR One auto -injector (600 mg) Adolescent/ Adult 2-4 mg IM or via auto -injector 600 mg IM OR One auto -injector (600 mg) Pregnan t Women 2-4 mg IM or via auto -injector 600 mg IM OR One auto -injector (600 mg) Geriatric/ Frail 2 mg IM or via auto -injector 10 mg/kg IM OR One auto -injector (600 mg) Upda ted January 5, 201 9 232 Severe Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor Agent Exposure Patient (Weight) Atropine Dose IM or via Auto -injector Pralidoxime Chloride Dose IM or via 600 mg Auto -injector Infant: 0-2 yo 0.1 mg/kg IM or via auto -injector (e.g. 0.25 mg and/or 0.5 mg auto -injector ) 45 mg/kg IM Child: 3-7 yo (13-25 kg) 0.1 mg/kg IM OR 2 mg via auto -injector (e.g. one 2 mg auto -injector or four 0.5 mg auto -injectors ) 45 mg/kg OR One auto -injector (600mg) Child: 8-14 yo (26-50 kg) 4 mg IM or via auto -injector (e.g. two 2 mg auto -injectors or four 1 mg auto -injectors ) 45 mg/kg IM OR Two auto -injectors (1200 mg) Adolescent: 14 yo or older 6 mg IM or via auto -injector (e.g. three 2 mg auto -injectors ) Three auto -injectors (1800 mg) Adult 6 mg IM or via auto -injector (e.g. three 2 mg auto -injectors ) Three auto -injectors (1800 mg) Pregnant Women 6 mg IM or via auto -injector (e.g. three 2 mg auto -injectors ) Three auto -injectors (1800 mg) Geriatric / Frail 2-4 mg IM or via auto -injector (e.g. one to two 2 mg auto -injectors ) 25 mg/kg IM OR two to three auto -injectors (1200 mg -1800 mg) Upda ted January 5, 201 9 233 Guidance for the Treatment of Seizures Secondary to Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor Agent Exposure Patient Diazepam Midazolam Infant mg/kg IM Repeat every 2 -5 minutes 0.2 mg/kg IM Repeat prn in 10 minutes 0.2-0.5 mg/kg IV every 15 -30 minutes May repeat twice as needed May repeat dose once Total maximum dose: 5 mg Total maximum d ose: 0.4 mg/kg Child (3-13 yo) 0.2-0.5 mg/kg IM Repeat every 2 -5 minutes 0.2 mg/kg IM Not to exceed 10 mg Repeat prn in 10 minutes 0.2-0.5 mg/kg IV every 15 -30 minutes May repeat dose twice if needed May repeat dose once Total maximum dose: 5 mg if less than 5 years Total maximum dose: 0.4 mg/kg Not to exceed 20 mg Total maximum dose: 10 mg if age 5 years or older 1 CANA \u00ae auto -injector Adolescen t (14 yo or older ) 2-3 CANA \u00ae auto -injectors 0.2 mg/kg IM Total maximum dose of 10 mg Repeat prn in 10 minutes 5-10 mg IV every 15 minutes May repeat dose once Total maximum dose: 30 mg Total maximum dose: 20 mg Adult 2-3 CANA \u00ae auto -injectors 10 mg IM Repeat prn in 10 minutes 5-10 mg IV every 15 minutes May repeat dose once Total maximum dose: 30 mg Total maximum dose: 20 mg Pregnant Women 2-3 CANA \u00ae auto -injectors 10 mg IM Repeat prn in 10 minutes 5-10 mg IV every 15 minutes May repeat dose once Total maximum dose: 30 mg Total maximum dose: 20 mg Geriatric 2-3 CANA \u00ae auto -injectors 10 mg IM Repeat prn in 10 minutes 5-10 mg IV every 15 minutes May repeat dose once Total maximum dose: 30 mg Total maximum dose: 20 mg Tables adapted from : U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, ASPR, National Library of Medicine, Chemical Hazards Emergency Medical Management: Nerve Agents - Prehospital Management , www.chemm.nlm.nih.gov Upda ted January 5, 201 9 234 Patient Safety Considerations 1. Continuous and ongoing patient reassessment is critical 2. Clinical response to treatment is demonstrated by the drying of secretion and the easing of respirato ry effort 3. Initiation of and ongoing treatment should not be based upon heart rate or pupillary response 4. Precautions for pralidoxime chloride administration: a. Although Duodote\u00ae and ATNAA\u00ae contains atropin the primary antidote for an acetylcholinesterase in hibitor agent poisoning, the inclusion of pralidoxime chloride in the auto -injector can present challenges if additional doses of atropine are warranted by the patient condition and other formulations of atropine are unavailable: i. Pediatrics : an overdose of pralidoxime chloride may cause profound neuromuscular weakness and subsequent respiratory depression ii. Adults : Especially for the geriatric victim, excessive doses of pralidoxime chloride may cause severe systolic and diastolic hypertension, neuromuscular weakness, headache, tachycardia, and visual impairment iii. Geriatrics : victim who may have underlying medical conditions, particularly impaired kidney function or hypertension, the EMS provider should consider administering the lower recommended adult dose of intravenous prali doxime chloride 5. Considerations during the use of auto -injectors a. If an auto -injector is administered, a dose calculation prior to administration is not necessary b. For atropine, additional auto -injectors should be administ ered until secretions diminish. c. Mark I\u00ae kits, Duodote\u00ae and ATNAA\u00ae h ave not been approved for pediatric use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but they can be considered for the initial treatment for children of any age with severe symptoms of an Acetylcholine sterase inhibitor agent poisoning especially if other formulations of atropine are unavailable d. Pediatric Atro -Pen\u00ae auto -injectors are commercially available in a 0.25 mg auto -injector (yellow) and a 0.5 mg auto -injector (red). Atro -Pen\u00ae auto -injectors are commercially available in a 1 mg auto -injector (blue) and a 2 mg auto -injector (green) e. A pralidoxime chloride 600 mg auto -injector may be administered to an infant that weighs greater than 12 kg Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Clinical e ffects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor a gents a. The clinical effects are caused by the inhibition of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase which allows excess acetylcholine to accumulate in the nervous system b. The excess accumulated acetylcholine causes hyperactivity in muscles, glands, and nerves 2. Organophosphates (certain Insecticides) a. Can be legally purchased by the general public b. Organophosphates (e.g. pesticides) penetrate tissues and bind to the patient's body fat producing a prolonged period of illness and ongoi ng toxicity even during aggressive treatment Upda ted January 5, 201 9 235 3. Nerve agents a. Traditionally classified as weapon s of mass destruction (WMD) b. Not readily accessible to the general public c. Extremely toxic and rapidly fatal with any route of exposure d. GA (tabun), GB (sarin), GD (soman), GF, and VX are types of nerve agents and are WMDs e.

Prioritize identification and treatment of immediately life -threatening medical conditions and traumatic injuries above any radiation -associated injury 2. Identify and appropriately treat acute r adiation Injury 3. Reduce risk for contamination of personnel while caring for patients potentially or known to be contaminated with radioactive material Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria 1. Patients who have been acutely exposed to ionizing radiation from accidental environmental release of a radioactive source 2. Patients who have been acutely exposed to ionizing radiation from a non -accidental environmental release of a radioactive source 3. Patients who have been contaminated with material emitting ionizing radiation Exclusion Criteria 1. Patients exposed to normal doses of ionizing radiation from medical imaging studies 2. Patients exposed to normal doses of ionizing radiation from therapeutic medical procedures Patient Management Assessment 1. Identification and t reatment of life -threatening injuries and medical problems takes priority over decontamination 2. Don standard PPE capable of preventing skin exposure to liquids and solids (gown and glove s), mucous membrane exposure to liquids and particles (face mask and eye protection), and inhalational exposure to particles (N95 face mask or respirator) 3. Do not eat or drink any food or beverages while caring for patients with radiation injuries until scr eening completed for contamination and appropriate decontamination if needed 4. Use caution to avoid dispersing contaminated materials 5. Provide appropriate condition -specific care for any immediately life -threatening injuries or medical problems Treatment an d Interventions 1. If patient experiences nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea: a. Provide care , per Nausea -Vomiting guideline b. Document the time gastrointestinal symptoms started 2. If seizure occurs: a. Consider a primary medical c ause or exposure to possible chemical agents unless indicators for a large whole body radiation dose (greater than 20Gy), such as rapid onset of vomiting, are present b. Treat per Seizure s guideline Upda ted January 5, 201 9 238 Patient Safety Consideration s Treat life -threatening medical problems and traumatic injuries prior to assessing for and treating radiation injuries or performing decontamination Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Irradiated patients pose no threat to medical providers 2. Contaminated patients pose very little threat to medical providers who use appropriate PPE including N95 masks or respirators, gloves, gowns, and face and eye protection 3. Sources of r adiation a. Legal i. Industrial plants ii. Healthcare facilities that provide radiol ogic services iii. Nuclear power plants iv. Mobi le engineering sources ( e.g. construction sites that are installing cement) b. Illegal i. Weapons of mass destruction ii. \"Dirty bomb\" design to contaminate widespread areas 4. Physiology of radiation poisoning a. Contamination - Poisoning from direct exposure to a radioactive source, contaminated debris, liquids, or clothing where radiation continues to be emitted from particles on surface b. Exposure - Poisoning from radioactivity, in the form of ionizing rays, penetrating through the bodily tissues of the patient 5. Common types of radioactivity that cause poisoning a. Gamma rays i. Highest frequency of ionizing rays ii. Penetrates the skin deeply iii. Caus es the most severe radiation toxicity b. Beta rays - can penetrate up to 1 cm of the skin's thickness c. Alpha rays i. Lowest frequency of ionizing rays ii. Short range of absorption iii. Dangerous only if ingested or inhaled d. Radioactive daughters i. Products of decay of the original radioactive substance ii. Can produce gamma and beta rays ( e.g. uranium decays into a series of radon daughters) 6. In general, trauma patients who have been exposed to or contaminated by radiation should be triaged and treated on the basis of the severity of their conventional injuries 7. A patient who is contaminated with radioactive material ( e.g. flecks of radioactive material embedded in their clothing and skin) generally poses a minimal exp osure risk to medical personnel 8. EMS providers may be asked to assist public health agencies in the distribution and administration of potassium iodide in a mass casualty incident involving radiation release or exposure Upda ted January 5, 201 9 239 Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Treatment of life -threatening injuries or medical conditions takes priority over assessment for contamination or initiation of decontamination 2. Time to nausea and vomi ting is a reliable indicator of the received dose of ionizing radiation. The more rapid the onset of vomiting, the higher the whole -body dose of radiation 3. Tissue burns are a late finding (weeks following exposure) of ionizing radiation injury. If burns are present acutely, they are from a thermal or chemical mechanism 4. Seizures may suggest acute radiation syndrome if accompanied by early vomiting. If other clinical indicators do not suggest a whole -body dose of greater than 20Gy, consider other causes of seizure 5. Delayed symptoms (days to weeks after exposure or contamination) a. Skin burns with direct contact with radioactive source b. Skin burns or erythema from ionizing rays c. Fever d. Bone marrow suppression presenting as: i. Immunosuppression ii. Petech iae e. Spontaneous internal and external bleeding Quality Improvement Associated NEMSIS Protocol(s) (eProtocol.01) 9914049 - Exposure -Radiologic Agents Key Documentation Elements Duration of exposure to the radioactive source or environment Distance (if able to be determined) from the radioactive source (if known) Time of onset of vomiting Performance Measures Use of appropriate PPE Use of dosimetry by EMS provider Scene measurements of radioactivity References 1.

Rapid recognition of a topical chemical burn 2. Initiation of emergent and appropriate intervention and pat ient transport Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria 1. Patients of all ages who have sustained exposure to a chemical that can cause a topical chemical burn may develop immediate or in some cases a delayed clinical presentation 2. Agents that are known to cause chemical burns include alkali, acids, mustard agent, and lewisite Exclusion criteria None recommended Patient Management 1. Don the appropriate PPE 2. Remove the p atient's clothing, if necessary 3. Contaminated clothing should prefe rably be placed in double bags 4. If deemed necessary and manpower resources permit, the patient should be transported by EMS providers who did not participate in the decontamination process, and in an emergency response vehicle that has n ot been exposed to the chemical 5. Informa tion regarding the chemical sh ould be gathered while on scene including materials safety data sheet if available 6. Communicate all data regarding the che mical to the receiving facility Assessment 1. Clinical effects and severity of a topical chemical burn is dependent upon: a. Class of agent (alkali injury or acid injury) b. Concentration of the chemical the (higher the concentration, the greater the risk of injury) c. pH of the chemical i. Alkali -increased risk with pH greater than or equal to 11 ii. Acid -increased risk with pH less than or equal to 3 d. Onset of burn i. Immediate ii. Delayed ( e.g. hydrofluoric acid) 2. Calculate the estimated total body surface area that is involved 3. Preve nt further contamination 4. Special attention to assessment of ocular or oropharyngeal exposure - evaluate for airway compromise secondary to spasm or direct injury associated with oropharyngeal burns 5. Some acid and alkali agents may manifest systemic effects Upda ted January 5, 201 9 241 Treatment and Interventions 1. If dry chemical contamination, carefully brush off solid chemical p rior to flushing the site as the irrigating solution m ay activate a chemical reaction 2. If wet chemical contamination, flush the patient's skin (and eyes, if involved) with copious amounts of water or normal saline 3. Provide adequate analgesia per the Pain Management guideline 4. Consider the use of topical anesthetic eye drops ( e.g. tetracaine ) for chemical burns of the eye 5. For eye exposure, administer continuous flushing of irrigation fluid to eye - Morgan lens may facilitate administration 6. Early airway intervention for airway compromise or spasm associated with oropharyngeal burns 7. Take m easures to minimize hypothermia 8. Initiate intravenous fluid resuscitation if necessary t o obtain hemodynamic stability Hydrofluoric Acid Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is a highly corrosive substance that is primarily used for automotive cleaning products, rust removal, porcelain cleaners, etching glass, cleaning cement or brick, or as a pickling agent to remove impurities from various forms of steel. Hydrofluoric acid readily penetrates intact skin and there may be underlying tissue injury. It is unlikely that low concentration HF will cause an imm ediate acid -like burn however there may be delayed onset of pain to the exposed area. Higher concentration HF may cause immediate pain as well as more of a burn appearance that can range from mild erythema to an obvious burn. An oral or large dermal exposu re can result in significant systemic hypocalcemia with possible QT prolongat ion and cardiovascular collapse. 1. For all patients in whom a hydrofluoric acid exposure is confirmed or suspected: a. Vigorously irrigate all affected areas with water or normal salin e for a minimum of 15 minutes b. Apply a cardiac monitor for oral or large dermal exposures significant HF exp osures c. Apply calcium preparation: i. Calcium prevents tissue damage from hydrofluoric acid ii. Topical calcium preparations: 1. Commercially manufactured calci um gluconate gel 2. If commercially manufactured calcium gluconate gel is not available, a topical calcium gluconate gel preparation can be made by combining 150 mL (5 ounces) of a sterile water -soluble gel ( e.g. Surgilube\u00ae or KY\u00ae jelly) with one of the follo wing: a. 35 mL of calcium gluconate 10% solution b. 10 g of calcium gluconate tablets ( e.g. Tums \u00ae) c. 3.5 g calcium gluconate powder or 3. If calcium gluconate is not available, 10 mL of calcium chloride 10% solution in 150 mL in sterile water soluble gel ( e.g. Surg ilube\u00ae or KY\u00ae jelly) 4. Apply generous amounts of the calcium gluconate gel to the exposed skin sites to neutralize the pain of the hydrofluoric acid a. Leave in place for at least 20 minutes then reassess b. This can be repeated as needed Upda ted January 5, 201 9 242 5. Although generally low yi eld, there may be benefit to intravenous pain medication along with the topical calcium gluconate gel for pain control 6. If fingers are involved, apply the calcium gel to the hand, squirt additional calcium gel into a surgical glove, and then insert t he affe cted hand into the glove 7. For patients who have ingested hydrofluoric acid or who have a large dermal exposure consider intravenous calcium gluconate, 1 -2 amps of 10% solution , as symptomatic hypocalcemia can precipitate rapidly as manifest by muscle spasm s, seizures, hypotension ventricular arrhythmias and QT prolongation Patient Safety C onsiderations 1. Don PPE 2. Take measures to prevent the patient from further contam ination through decontamination 3. Take measures to protect the EMS provide r and others from contamination 4. Do not attempt to neutralize an acid with an alkali or an alkali with an acid as an exothermic reaction will occur and cause seriou s thermal injury to the patient 5. Expeditious transport or transfer to a designated burn center should be conside red for burns that involve a significant percentage of total body sur face area or burns that involve the eyes, face, hands, feet or genitals Notes/Educational Pearls Key C onsiderations 1. IV fluid resuscitation should be guided by patient age, percentage of body surface area involved in burn, body habitus and calculated by the Parkland Formula [see Appendix VI ] 2. Since the severity of topical chemical burns is largely dependent upon the type, concentration, and pH of the chem ical involved as well as the body site and surface area involved , it is imperative to obtain as much information as possible while on scene about the chemical substance by which the patient was exposed . The information gathering process will often include: a. Transport of the \"sealed\" container of the chemical to the receiving facility b. Transport of the original or a copy of the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) of the substance to the receiving facility c. Contacting the reference agency to identify the chemical agent and assist in management (e.g. CHEMTREC\u00ae) 3. Inhalation of HF should be considered in any dermal exposure involving the face and neck or if clothing is soaked in the product 4. Decontamina tion is critical for both acid and alkali agents to reduce injury - removal of chemicals with a low pH (acids) is more easily accomplished than chemicals with a high pH (alkalis) because alkalis tend to penetrate and bind to deeper tissues 5. Some chemicals will also manifest local and systemic signs, symptoms, and bodily dam age Pertinent Assessment F indings 1. An estimate of the total body surface area that is involved 2.

Treat any compromise of these parameters Upda ted January 5, 201 9 245 f. Ask about chest pain and difficulty breathing 2. Vital signs including temperature for hyperthermia 3. Apply a cardiac monitor and examine rhythm strip for arrhythmias 4. Check blood glucose level 5. Monitor ETCO 2 for respiratory decompensation 6. Check a 12-lead EKG when possible 7. Check for trauma, self -inflicted injury 8. Law enforcement should have checked for weapons and drugs, but you may decide to repeat the inspection Treatment and Inte rventions 1. IV access for any fluids and meds 2. Give fluids for poor perfusion ; cool fluids for hyperthermia [ see Shock and Hyperthermia/Heat Exposure guidelines ] 3. Treat chest pain as ACS and follow STEMI protocol if there is EKG is consistent with STEMI 4. Consider treating shortness of breath as atypical ACS a. Administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 94 -98% saturation 5. Consider soft physicalmanagement devices especially if law enforcement has been involved in getting patient to cooperate [see Agitated or Violent Patient/Behavioral Emergency guideline ] 6. Consider medi cations to reduce agitation and other significant sympa thomimetic findings for the safety of the patients and providers. This may improve behavior and compliance [see Agitated or Violent Patient/Behavioral Emergency guideline ] a. If haloperidol or droperidol is used, moni tor 12 -lead for QT -interval if feasible 7. Consider prophylactic use of anti -emetic: a. Adult: administer ondansetron 8 mg SLOW IV over 2 -5 minutes or 4-8 mg IM or 8 mg orally disintegrating tablet b. Pediatric: Administer ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg SLOW IV over 2 -5 minutes . c. Do not use promethazine if haloperidol or droperidol are to be or have been given. They all increase QT prolongation but on dansetron has less seizure risk 8. If hyperthermia suspected, begin external cooling Patient Safety Considerations 1. Apply the least amount of physical management devices that are necessary to protect the patient and the providers [see Agitated or Violent Patient/Behavioral Emergency guideline ] 2. Assessment for potential weapons or additiona l drugs is very important since these items can pose a threat not just to the patient but also to the EMS cre w Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Recognition and treatment of hyperthermia (including sedatives to decrease heat production from muscular activity) is essential as many deaths are attributable to hyperthermia 2. If law enforcement has placed the patient in handcuffs, this patient needs ongo ing physical security for safe transport . Have law enforcement in back of ambulance for the handcuffed patient or make sure proper physical management devices are in place before law enforcement leaves a nd ambulance departs from scene Upda ted January 5, 201 9 246 3. If patient has signs and symptoms of ACS, strive to give nitroglycerin SL q 3 -5 minutes as long as SBP greater than 100 mmHg and until pain resolves (if range not desired, use q 3 minutes) a. Vasospasm is often the problem in this case as opposed to a fixed c oronary artery lesion b. Consider administration of benzodiazepines as if to treat anxiety. 4. Maintaining IV access, cardiac monitor, and SPO 2/ETCO 2 monitors are key to being able to catch and intervene decompensations in a timely manner a. If agitated, consider restrain ing the patient to facilitate patient assessment and lessen likelihood of vascular access or monitor displac ements 5. Cocaine has sodium channel blocking effects and can cause significant cardiac conduction abnormalities with a widened QRS. Treatment is with sodium bicarbonate similar to a tricyclic antidepressant. Check a 12-lead EKG to assess for these complications Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. History is as important as the physical examination. 2. If the patient is on psychiatric medication, but has failed to be compliant, this fact alone puts the patient at h igher risk for excited delirium 3. If the patient is found naked, this may elevate the suspicion for stimulant use or abuse and increase the risk for excited delirium . Neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome and excited delirium can present in with similar signs and symptoms 4. If polypharmacy is suspected, hypertension and tachycardia are expected hemodynamic findings secondary to increased dopamine release. Stimulus reduction from benzodiazepines, anti -psychotics, and ketamine will improve patient's vital signs and behavior 5. Be prepared for the potential of cardiovascular collapse as well as respiratory arrest 6.

Revision Date September 8, 2017 Upda ted January 5, 201 9 248 Cyanide Exposure Aliases Cyanide, hydrogen cyanide, blood agent Patient Care Goals 1. Remove patient from toxic environment 2. Assure adequate ventilation, oxygenation and correction of hypoperfusion Patient Presentation Cyanide is a colorless, \"bitter almond smell\" (genetically onl y 40% of population can smell) gas or white crystal which binds to the ferric ion in cells, blocking the enzyme cytochrome oxidase, thus preventing the use of oxygen by the cell's mitochondria, leading to cellular hypoxia. Inclusion C riteria 1. Depending on its form, cyanide can enter the body through inhalation, ingestion, or absorption through the skin. Cyanide should be suspected in occupational or other smoke exposures ( e.g. firefighting), industrial accidents, natural catastrophes, suicide and murder attempts, chemical warfare and terrorism (whenever there are multiple casualties of an unclear etiology) . Non-specific and early signs of cyanide exposure (inhalation, ingestion, or absorption) include the following signs and symptoms: anxiety, vertigo, weak ness, headache, tachypnea, nausea, dysp nea, vomiting, and tachycardia 2. High concentrations of cyanide will produce: a. Markedly altered level of consciousness , including rapid collapse b. Seizure s c. Respiratory dep ression or respiratory arrest d. Cardiac dysrhythmia s (other than sinus tachycardia) 3. The rapidity of onset is related to the severity of exposure (inhalation or ingestion) and may be dramatic with immediate effects that include early hypertension with subsequent hypotension, sudden cardiovascular collapse or seizure/coma , and rapid death Exclusion C riteria No recommendations Patient Management Assessment 1. Remove patient from toxic environment 2. Assess ABCDs and, if indicated, expose the patient, and then re -cover the patient to assure retention of body heat 3. Assess vital signs including temperature and pulse oximetry (which may not correlate with tissue oxygenation in cyanide/smoke exposure) 4. Attach a cardiac monitor and examine rhythm strip for arrhythmias a. Perform a 12 -lead EKG 5. Check blood glucose level 6. Monitor pulse oximetry and ETCO 2 Upda ted January 5, 201 9 249 7. Monitor patient for signs of hypoxia (pulse oximetry 94%) and respiratory decompensation regardless of pulse oximetry reading 8. Identify the specific agent of exposure, time of ingest ion/inhalation, and quanti ty/timing of exposure 9. Obtain patient history including cardiovascular history and prescribed medication 10. Obtain other pertinent patient history 11. Perform physical exam Treatment and Interventions There is no widely available, rapid, confirmatory cyanide blood test. Many hospitals will not be able to rapidly assess cyanide levels. Therefore, treatment decisions must be made on the basis of clinical history and signs and symptoms of cyanide intoxication. For the patient with an appropriate history and manif esting one or more significant cyanide exposure signs or symptoms, treat with: 1. 100% oxygen via non -rebreather mask or bag valve mask 2. Collect a pre -treatment blood sample in the appropriate tube for lactate and cyanide levels 3. Administer one of the following medication regimes a. Hydroxocobalamin (the preferred agent) i. Adult : Administer hydroxocobalamin 1. Initial dose is 5 g admin istered over 15 minutes slow IV 2. Each 5 g vial of hydroxocobalamin for injection is to be reconstituted with 200 mL of LR, NS or D5W (25 mg/ mL) and administered at 10 -15 mL/minute 3. An additional 5 g dose may be administered with medical consultation. ii. Pediatric : Administer hydroxocobalamin 70 mg/kg (reconstitute concentration is 25 mg/ mL) 4. Each 5 g vial of hydroxocobalam in for injection is to be reconstituted with 200 mL of LR, NS or D5W (25 mg/ mL) and administered at 10 -15 mL/minut e iii. Maximum single dose is 5 g OR b. Sodium thiosulfate i. Adult : Sodium thiosulfate12.5 g IV (50 mL of 25% solution) ii. Pediatric : Sodium thiosulfate 0. 5 g/kg IV (2 mL/kg of 25% solution) 4. If seizure, treat per Seizure s guideline Patient Safety Considerations 1. In the event of multiple casualties, be sure to wear appropriate PPE during rescue evacua tion from the toxic environment 2. If the patient ingests cyanide, it will react with the acids in the stomach generating hydrogen cyanide gas. Be sure to maximize air circulation in closed spaces (ambulance) as the patient's gastric contents may contain hydrogen cyanide gases w hen released with vomiting or belching 3. Do not use nitrites in conjunction with suspected carbon monoxide poisoning as it worsens the hemoglobin oxygen carrying capacity even more than carbon monoxide (CO) 4. Hydroxocobalamin is only agent safe for treatment of cyanid e poisoning in pregnant patient Upda ted January 5, 201 9 250 Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Pulse oximetry accurately reflects serum levels of oxygen but does not accurately reflect tissue oxygen levels therefore should not be relied upon in possible cyanide and/or carbon monoxide toxicity 2. After hydroxocobalamin has been administered, pulse oximetr y levels are no longer accurate 3. If the patient ingests cyanide, it will react with the acids in the stomach generating hydrogen cyanide gas. Be sure to maximize air circulation in closed spaces (ambulance) as the patient's gastric contents may contain hydrogen cyanide gases when rel eased with vomiting or belching 4. Amyl nitrite and s odium nitrite are no longer being used and no longer available in commercial kits Pertinent Assessment Findings Early and r epeated assessment is essential Quality Improvement Associated NEMSIS Protocol(s) (eProtocol.01) 9914043 - Exposure -Cyanide Key Documentation Elements Repeat evaluation and documentation of signs and symptoms as the patient's clinical condition may deteriorate rapidly.

Reduce GI absorption of oral agents with some form of binding agent (activated charcoal) especially for extended release 2. Early airway protection is required as patients may have rapid mental status deteriorat ion 3. Assure adequate ventilation, oxygenation and correction of hypoperfusion Patient Presentation Beta blocker or beta adrenergic antagonist medication to reduce the effe cts of epinephrine/ adrenaline Inclusion C riteria 1. Patients may present with: a. Bradycardia b. Hypotension c. Altered mental status d. Weakness e. Shortness of breath f. Possible seizures 2. Beta blocker agents examples: a. Acebutolol hydrochloride (Sectral\u00ae) riteria No recommendations Upda ted January 5, 201 9 253 Patient Management Assessment 1. Assess ABCDs and if indicated expose and then cover to assure retention of body heat 2. Vital signs which include temperature 3. Apply a cardiac monitor, examine rhythm strip for arrhythmias, and consider obtaining a 12 - lead EKG 4. Check blood glucose level 5. Monitor pulse oximetry and ETCO 2 for respiratory decompensation 6. Identify specific medication taken (noting immediate release vs. sustained release formulations), time of ingestion, and quantity 7. Pertinent cardiovascular history or other prescribed medications for underlying disease 8. Patient p ertinent history 9. Patient physical Treatment and Interventions 1. Consider activated charcoal without sorbitol (1 g/kg) PO a. If risk of rapid decreasing mental status, do not administer oral agent without adequately protecting the airway 2. Check blood glucose level on all patients but especially on pediatric patients as beta blockers can cause hypoglycemia in pediatric population 3. Consider atropine sulfate for symptomatic bradycardia a. Adult : Atropine 1 mg IV q 5 minutes to maximum of 3 mg b. Pediatric : Atropine 0 .02 mg/kg (0.5 mg maximum ) q 5 minutes, maximum total dose 1 mg 4. Consider fluid challenge (20 mL/kg) for hypotension with associated bradycardia 5. For symptomatic patients with cardiac effects (i.e. hypotension, bradycardia) consider : a. Adult : Glucagon - initial dose 5 mg IVP - this can be repeated in 5 -10 minutes for a total of 10 mg b. Pediatric: i. Glucagon 1 mg IVP (25 -40 kg) - every 5 minutes as necessary ii. Glucagon 0.5 mg IVP (less than 25 kg) - every 5 minutes as necessary 6. Consider vasopressors after adequate fluid resuscitation (1-2 liters of crystalloid) for the hypotensive patient [see Shock guideline for pediatric vs. adult dosing] 7. Consider transcutaneous pacing if refractory to initial pharm acologic interventions 8. If seizure, treat per Seizure s guideline 9. If widened QRS (100 msec or greater), consider so dium bicarbonate 1 -2meq/kg IV. T his can be repeated as needed to narrow QRS Patient Safety Considerations 1. Transcutaneous pacing may not always capture nor correct hypoten sion when capture is successful 2. Aspiration of activated charcoal can produce a patient where airway management is nearly impossible . Do not administer activated charcoal to any patients that may have a worsening mental status Upda ted January 5, 201 9 254 Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Pediatric Considerations: a. Pediatric patient may develop hypoglycemia from beta blocker overdose therefore it is important to perform glucose evaluation b. A single pill can kill a toddler . It is very important that a careful assessment of medications the toddler could have access to is done by EMS and all suspect medication s should be brought into the ED 2. Glucagon has a si de effect of increased vomiting at these doses and onda nsetron prophylaxis should be considered 3. Atropine may have little or no effect (likely to be more helpful in mild overdoses) - the hypotension and bradycardia may be mutually exclusive and the blood pressure may not respond t o correction of bradycardia 4. Propranolol crosses the blood brain barrier and can cause altered mental status, seizure, and wid ened QRS similar to TCA toxicity Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Certain beta blockers, such as acebutolol and propranolol , may increase QRS duration 2. Certain a blockers , such as acebutolol and pindolol , may produce tachycardia and hypertension 3. Sotalol can produce increase in QTc interval and ventricular dysrhythmia 4.

There is a spectrum of toxins or envenomations with very limited EMS interventions. 1. Assure adequa te ventilation, oxygenation and correction of hypoperfusion 2. Pain control which also includes limited external interventions to reduce pain Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria 1. Bites, stings, and envenomations can come from a variety of marine and terrestrial animals and insects causing local or systemic effects 2. Patients may present with toxin specific reactions which may include: a. Site pain b. Swelling c. Muscle pain (hallmark of black widow spider bites) d. Erythema e. Discoloration f. Bleeding g. Nausea h. Abdominal p ain i. Hypotension j. Tachycardia k. Tachypnea l. Muscle incoordination m. Confusion n. Anaphylaxis/allergic reactions 3. There is a spectrum of toxins or envenomations and limited EMS interventions that will have any mitigating effect on the patient in the field a. The critical intervention is to get the patient to a hospital that has access to the antivenin if applicable. Exclusion Criteria None Patient Management Assessment 1. Assess ABCDs and if indicated expose and then cover to assure retention of body heat 2. Vital signs which include temperature 3. Apply a cardiac monitor, examine rhythm strip for arrhythmias, and consider obtaining a 12- lead EKG 4. Check blood glucose Level Upda ted January 5, 201 9 257 5. Monitor pulse oximetry and ETCO 2 for respiratory decompensation 6. Patient pertinent history 7. Patient phys ical with special consideration to area of envenomation especially crotalid bite Treatment and Interventions 1. Consider an IV fluid bolus (normal saline or lactated R inger 's) 20 mL/kg up to 2 liters 2. Consider vasopressors after adequate fluid resuscitation for the hypotensive patient [for adult vs. pediatric dosing see Shock guideline ] 3. If seizure , treat per Seizure s guideline 4. Specific therapy for select bites, stings, or envenomation a. Envenomations that are known to antivenom readily available in the US A (e.g. black widow spider, bark scorpions, crotalid snakes, coral snak es) i. For these envenomations, consider transport to hospital that has access to antivenom , if feasible b. Jellyfish ( Medusozoan cnidarians ): i. As there is a significant variety and diversity of Jellyfish, it is important to be familiar with the species and the appropriate treatment for your local aquatic creatures ii. Generally, scrape off any remaining tentacles or nematocysts, then im merse affected body part in hot water (113\u00b0F/45\u00b0C) . Except for certain species of jellyfish (e.g. Physalia , a species found in Australian waters) which may have mematocysts activated by vinegar (acetic acid) , it may be used to reduce pain due to deactivati on of the nematocysts remaining in the skin. Vinegar m ay also activate the nematocysts of sea nettles and is not recommended after this type of jellyfish exposure. c. Lionfish, scorpionfish, stingray: i. Immerse affected body part in hot water to reduce the pain associated with the toxin 5. Provide adequate analgesia per the Pain Management guideline Patient Safety Considerations 1. Do no t: a. Apply t ourniquets, tight Ace \u00ae/crepe bandage, or constricting bands above or below th e site of the envenomation b. Incision and/or suction wound to remove toxin c. Appl y cold packs or immerse the effect extremity in ice water (cryotherapy) 2. EMS providers should not try to capture the offending marine or terrestrial animal or insect 3. If the offending organism has been killed, beware that many dead insect, marine , or fanged animals can continue to bite or sting with venom and should be safely placed in a hard sided and closed container for future identification 4. Patient may still have an imbed ded stinger, tooth, nematocyst , or barb which may continue to deliver toxin if left imbedded. Consider safe removal without squeezing the toxin delivery apparatus Upda ted January 5, 201 9 258 Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Vinegar has potential to increase pain assoc iated jellyfish sting as it can increase nematocysts discharge in certain species. Providers must be familiar with endemic species and how to best address exposure. Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Assess for signs and symptoms of local and systematic impact of the suspected toxin 2.

Reduce GI absorption of oral agents with some form of binding agent (activated charcoal) especially for extended release 2. Early airway protection is required as patients may have rapid mental status deterioration 3. Assure adequate ventilation, oxygenation and correction of hypoperfusion Patient Presentation Calcium channel blockers interrupt the movement of calcium across cell membranes. Calcium channel blockers are used to manage hypertension, certain rate -related arrhythmias, prevent cerebral vasospasm, and angina pectoris. Patients ma y present with: 1. Bradycardia 2.

Pertinent cardiovascular history or other prescribed medications for underlying d isease 8. Patient pertinent history 9. Physical exam Treatment and Interventions 1. Consider activated charcoal without sorbitol (1 g/kg) PO. If risk of rapid decreasing mental status, do not administer oral agent without adequately protecting the airway 2. Consider atropine sulfate for symptomatic bradycardia a. Adult : atropine 1 mg IV q 5 minutes to maximum of 3 mg b. Pediatric : atropine 0:02 mg/kg (0.5 mg maximum) q 5 minutes, maximum total dose 1 mg 3. Consider calcium gluconate or calcium chloride a. Calcium gluconate i. Adult : Calcium gluconate 2 -6 g slow IVP over 10 minutes ii. Pedi atric : Calcium gluconate 60 mg/kg IVP over 10 minutes b. Calcium chloride i. Adult : Calcium chloride 0.5 - 1 g slow IVP (50 mg/minute) ii. Pediatric : Calcium chloride 20 mg/kg (0.2 mL/kg) slow IVP/IO (50 mg/mL) Maximum dose 1 g or 10 mL (Calcium gluconate is preferred as Calcium chloride has incre ased risk of tissue damage in pediatrics) 4. Consider IV fluid bolus (normal saline or lactated Ringer 's) 20 mL /kg up to 2 liters 5. Consider vasopressors after adequa te fluid resuscitation for the hypotensive patient [see Shock guideline for adult vs. pediatric dosing ] 6. If atropine, calcium , and vasopressors have failed in the symptomatic bradycardia patient, consider a. Adult : Glucagon initial 5 mg then 1 mg every 5 minutes IVP (may require 5 -15 mg to see effect) b. Pediatric : i. Glucagon 1 mg IVP (25 -40 kg); every 5 minutes as necessary ii. Glucagon 0.5 mg IVP (less than 25 kg); every 5 minutes as necessary 7. Consider transcutaneous pacing if refractory to initial pharmacologic interventions 8. If seizure, consider midazolam (benzodiazepine of choice) a. Adult : Midazolam 0.1 mg/kg IV in 2 mg increments slow IV push over one to two minutes per increment with maximum single dose 5 mg (Reduce by 50% for patients 69 years or older) b. Pediatric : Midazolam 0.1 mg/kg IV in 2 mg increments slow IV push over one to two minutes per increment with maximum single dose 5 mg or midazolam 0.2 mg/kg IN to maximum dose of 4 mg Patient Safety Considerations Transcutaneous pacing may not always capture nor correct hypotension when capture is successful. Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. While most calcium channel blockers cause bradycardia, dihydropyridine class calcium channel blockers ( e.g. nifedipine, amlodip ine) can cause a reflex tachycardia (torsade de Upda ted January 5, 201 9 262 pointes) early in the ingestion . The patient can become bradycardic as the intoxication worsens 2. The avoidance of administering calcium chlo ride or calcium gluconate to a patient on cardiac glycosides ( e.g. digoxin) as this may precipitate toxicity and associate fatal arrhythmias is felt to be a historical belief and not supported 3. Glucagon has a side effect of increased vomiting at these doses and ondansetron prophylaxis should be considered 4. A single pill can kill a toddler . It is very important that a careful assessment of medications the toddler could have access to is done by EMS and suspect medications brought into the ED 5. Calcium channel blockers can cause many types of rhythms that can range from sinus bradycardia to complete heart block 6. Hyperglycemia is the result of the blocking of L -type calcium channels in the pancreas. This can help differentiate these ingestions from beta blockers. There may also be a relationship between the severity of the ingestion and the extent of the hyperglycemia 7. Atropine may have little or no effect (likely to be more helpful in mild overdoses) a. Hypotension and bradycardia may be mutually exclusive and the blood pressure may not respond to correction of bradycardia Pertinent A ssessment Findings 1. Close monitoring of EKG changes and dysrhythmias 2. Serial frequent assessments are essential as these patient s often have rapid deterioration with profound hypotension Quality Improvement Associated NEMSIS Protocol(s) (eProtocol.01) 9914217 - Medical -Calcium Channel Blocker Poisoning/Overdose Key Documentation Elements Repeat evaluation and documentation of signs and symptoms as patient clinical conditions may deteriorate rapidly Identification of possible etiology of poisoning Time of symptoms onset and time of initiation of exposure -specific treatments Therapy and response to therapy Performance Measures Early airway management in the rapidly deteriorating patient Accurate exposure history o Time ingestion/exposure o Route of expos ure o Quantity of medication or toxin taken (safely collect all possible mediations or agents) o Alcohol or other intoxicant taken Appropriate protocol selection and management Multiple frequent documented reassessments Upda ted January 5, 201 9 263 References 1.

Remove patient from toxic environment. 2. Assure adequate ventilation, oxygenation and correction of hypoperfusion. 3. Consider use of environmental carbon monoxide (CO) monitors on \"first in\" bags to assist in detection of occult CO toxicity. Patient Presentation Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas which has a high affinity for binding to red cell hemoglobin, thus preventing the binding of oxygen to the hemoglobin, leading to hypoxia (pulse oximetry less than 94%). A significant reduction in oxygen delivery to tissues and organs occurs with carbon monoxide poisoning. Carbon monoxide is also a cellular toxin which can result in delayed or persistent neurologic sequelae in significant e xposures. W ith any form of combustion ( fire/smoke [e.g. propane , kerosene, or charcoal stoves or heaters ], combustion engines [e.g. generators, lawn mowers, motor vehicles, home heating systems ]), carbon monoxide will be generated. People in a fire may als o be exposed to cyanide from the combustion of some synthetic materials. Cyanide toxicity may need to be considered in the hemodynamically unstab le patient removed from a fire. Inclusion C riteria 1. Patients exposed to carbon monoxide may present with a spectrum of symptoms: a. Mild intoxication: i. Nausea ii. Fatigue iii. Headache iv. Vertigo v. Lightheadedness b. Moderate to severe: i. Altered mental status ii. Tachypnea iii. Tachycardia iv. Convulsion v. Cardiopulm onary arrest Exclusion C riteria No recommendations Patient Management Assessment 1. Remove patient from toxic environment 2. Assess ABCDs and, if indicated, expose patient and re -cover to assure retention of body heat 3. Vital signs including pulse oximetry, temperature, an d ETCO 2 if available 4. Apply a cardiac monitor, examine rhythm strip for arrhythmias, and obtain a 12 -lead EKG if available Upda ted January 5, 201 9 265 5. Check blood glucose level 6. Monitor pulse oximetry and ETCO 2 for respiratory decompensation 7. Patient pertinent history 8. Patient physical examination Treatment and Interventions 1. 100% oxygen via non -rebreather mask or bag valve mask or advan ced airway as indicated 2. If seizure, treat per Seizures guideline 3. Consider transporting patients with severe carbon monoxide poisoning directly to a facility with hyperbaric oxygen capabilities if feasible and patient does not meet criteria for other specialty care ( e.g. trauma or burn) Patient Safety Considerations 1. Consider affixing a carbon monoxide detector to an equipment bag that is routinely taken into scene (if it signals alarm, don appropriate respiratory protection and exit scene) to assist with detection of occult CO toxicity 2. Remove patient and response pers onnel from potentially hazardous environment as soon as possible 3. Provide instruction to the patient, the patient's family, and other appropriate bystanders to not enter the environment (e.g. building, car) where the carbon monoxide exposure occurred until the source of the poisoning has been eliminated 4. Do not look for cherry red skin coloration as an indication of carbon monoxide poisoning , as this is an unusual finding 5. CO oximeter devices may yield inaccurate low/normal results for patients with CO poisoni ng. All patients with probable or suspected CO poisoning should be transported to the nearest appropriate hospital based on thei r presenting signs and symptoms Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Pulse oximetry is inaccurate due to the carbon m onoxide binding with hemoglobin 2. As maternal carboxyhemoglobin levels do not accurately reflect fetal carboxyhemoglobin levels, pregnant patients are more likely to be treated with hyperbaric oxygen 3. Consider cyanide toxicity if carbon monoxide poisoning is f rom a fire 4. A patient light wavelength analysis device to detect carboxyhemoglobin is useful to indicate if there is a carbon monoxide exposure in a non -arrested patient - do not anticipate an immediate change in readings with oxygen administration. Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Early and repeat assessment of patient's mental status and motor function are extremely useful in determining response to therapy and the need for hyperbaric therapy 2. Identification of possible etiology of poisoning 3. Time of s ymptom onset and time of initiation of exposure -specific treatment 4.

Prevention of respiratory and/or cardiac arrest Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria Patents exhibiting miosis (pinpoint pupils), decreased mental status, and respiratory depres sion of all age groups with known or suspected opioid use or abuse . Exclusion Criteria: Patients with altered mental status exclusively from other causes ( e.g. head injury, or hypoglycemia). Patient Management 1. Don the appropriate PPE 2. Therapeutic inte rventions to support the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation should be initiated prior to the administration of naloxone 3. If possible, identify specific medication taken (including immediate release versus sustained release) time of ingestion, and quantity 4. Obtain and document pertinent cardiovascular history or other prescribed medications for underlying disease 5. Be aware that unsecured hypodermic needles may be on scene if the intravenous route may have been used by the patient, and that there is a higher risk of needle sticks during the management of this patient population which may also have an increased incidence of blood -borne pathogens 6. Naloxone, an opioid antagonist, should be considered for administration to patients with respiratory depressi on in a confirmed or suspected opioid overdose 7. Naloxone administration via the intravenous route provides more predictable bioavailability and flexibility in dosing and titration 8. Naloxone administration via the intranasal or intramuscular routes or as a n ebulized solution provide additional options of medication delivery 9. If naloxone was administered to the patient prior to the arrival of EMS, obtain the dose and route through which it was administered and, if possible, bring the devices containing the dispensed naloxone with the patient along with all other medications on scene Assessment 1. Assess the patient's airway, breathing, circulation, and mental status 2. Support the patient's airway by positioning, oxygen administration, and ventilator assistance with a bag valve mask if necessary Upda ted January 5, 201 9 268 3. Assess the patient for other etiologies of altered mental status including hypoxia (pulse oximetry less than 94%), hypoglycemia, hypotension, and traumatic head injury 4. Legally prescribed opioids are also manufactured as an adh esive patch for transdermal absorption, and if found, should be removed from the skin Treatments and Interventions 1. Critical resuscitation (opening and/or maintaining the airway, provision of oxygen, ensuring adequate circulation) should be performed pri or to naloxone administration 2. If the patient has respiratory depression from a confirmed or suspected opioid overdose, consider naloxone administration a. The administration of the initial dose or subsequent doses can be incrementally titrated until respirat ory depression is reversed 3. Naloxone can be administered via the IV, IM, IN, or ETT routes a. Adults : The typical initial adult dose ranges between 0.4 -2 mg IV, IM, or ETT or up to a dose of 4 mg IN b. Pediatrics : The pediatric dose of naloxone is 0.1 mg/kg IV, IM, IN, or ETT i. Maximum dose of 2 mg IV, IM, or ETT ii. Maximum dose of 4 mg IN c. Naloxone provided to laypersons and non -medical first responders via public access programs or prescriptions may be provided as a pr e-measured dose in an auto -injector or nasal spray or as a pre -measured, but variable, dose and/or concentration in a needleless syringe with a mucosal atomization device (MAD) on the hub d. Naloxone auto -injectors contain 0.4 mg/0.4 mL or 2 mg/0.4 mL i. The car tons of naloxone auto -injectors prescribed to laypersons contain two naloxone auto -injectors and one trainer e. Naloxone nasal spray is manufactured in a single -use bottle that contains 4 mg/0.1 mL f. For the intranasal route when naloxone is administered via a needleless syringe (preferably with MAD on the hub), divide administration of the dose equally between the nostrils to a maximum of 1 mL per nostril g. The administration of naloxone can be titrated until adequate respiratory effort is achieved if administered with a syringe IV, IM, IN, or ETT 4. High -potency opioids [s ee Key Considerations ] may require higher and/or more frequently administered doses of naloxone to reverse respiratory depression and/or to maintain adequate respirations 5. Regardless of the doses of naloxone administered, airway management with provision of adequate oxygenation and ventilation is the primary goal in patients with confirmed or suspected opioid ov erdose Patient Safety Considerations 1. Clinical duration of naloxone a. The clinical opioid reversal effect of naloxone is limited and may end within an hour whereas opioids often have a duration of 4 hours or longer b. Monitor the patient for recurrent respira tory depression and decreased mental status 2. Opioid withdrawal a. Patients with altered mental status secondary to an opioid overdose may become agitated or violent following naloxone administration due to opioid withdrawal therefore the goal is to use the lo west dose as possible to avoid precipitating withdrawal Upda ted January 5, 201 9 269 b. Be prepared for this potential scenario and take the appropriate measures in advance to ensure and maintain scene safety 3. EMS providers should be prepared to initiate airway management before, during, and after naloxone administration and to provide appropriate airway support until the patient has adequate respiratory effort Notes /Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. The essential feature of opioid overdose requiring EMS intervention is respiratory depression or apnea 2. Some opioids have additional toxic effects ( e.g. methadone can produce QT prolongation, and tramadol can produce seizures) 3. Overuse and abuse of prescribed and illegal opioids has led to an increase in accidental and intentional opioid overdoses 4. DEA and O pioids: a. Legally prescribed opioids are controlled under the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) b. Opioids have a high potential for abuse, but have an accepted medical use in patient treatment and can be prescribed by a physician c. Frequen t legally derivatives, such as heroin, are illegal in the United States 5. Opioid combinations: a. Some opioids are manufac tured as a combination of analgesics with acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), or other substances b. In the scenario of an overdose, there is a potential for multiple drug toxicities c. Examples of opioid combination analgesics: i. Vicodin\u00ae is a combinat ion of acetaminophen and hydrocodone ii. Percocet\u00ae is a combination of acetaminophen and oxycodone iii. Percodan\u00ae is a combination of aspirin and oxycodone iv. Suboxone\u00ae is a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone 6. High -potency opioids: a. Fentanyl is 50 -100 times more potent than morphine - it is legally manufactured in an injectable and oral liquid, tablet, and tran sdermal (worn as a patch) forms however much of the fentanyl adulterating the heroin supply are illegal fentanyl analogs such as acetyl fentanyl b. Carfentani l is 10,000 times more potent than morphine i. It is legally manufactured in a liquid form - however, a powder or tablet is the most common form of this drug that is illegally produced ii. In the concentration in which it is legally manufactured (3 mg/ mL), an intramuscular dose of 2 mL of carfe ntanil will sedate an elephant c. Synthetic opioids (e.g. W-18, are 10,000 times more potent than morphine ) - many synthetic opioids are not detectable by routine toxicology screening assays 7. The IN route has the benefit of no risk of needle stick to the provider 8. Patients with opioid overdose from fentanyl or fentanyl analogs may rapidly exhibit chest wall rigidity and require positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), in addition to multiple and/or larger doses of n aloxone, to achieve adequate ventilation Upda ted January 5, 201 9 270 9. PPE that provides additional cutaneous, respiratory, or ocular protection may be considered when providing care in jurisdictions experiencing an increased incidence of overdose from high potency opioids Pertinen t Assessment Findings 1. The primary clinical indication for the use of opioid medications is analgesia 2. In the opioid overdose scenario, signs and symptoms include: a. Miosis (pinpoint pupils) b. Respiratory depression c. Decreased mental status 3. Additional assessment precautions: a. The risk of respiratory arrest with subsequent cardiac arrest from an opioid overdose as well as hypoxia (pulse oximetry 94%), hypercarbia, and aspiration may be increased when other substances such as alcohol, benzodiazepine s, or other medications have also been taken by the patient b. Pediatric Considerations: The signs and symptoms of an opioid overdose may also be seen in newborns who have been delivered from a mother with recent or chronic opioid use. Neonates who have been administered naloxone for respiratory depression due to presumed intrauterine opioid exposure may be narcotic dependent and should be monitored closely for seizures Quality Improvement Associated NEMSIS Protocol(s) (eProtocol.01) 9914219 - Medical -Opioid Poisoning/Overdose Key Documentation Elements Rapid and accurate identification of signs and symptoms of opioid poisoning Pulse oximetry (oxygen saturation) and, if available, capnometry or capnography Blood glucose assessment Naloxone dose and route of administration Clinical response to medication administration Number of doses of naloxone to achieve a clinical response Performance Measures Clinical improvement after prehospital administration of naloxone Frequency of patients who develop adverse eff ects or complications (recurrent respiratory depression or decreased mental status, aspiration pneumonia or pulmonary edema) Number of patients who refuse transport following naloxone administration References 1.

Revision Date : September 8 , 2017 Upda ted January 5, 201 9 272 Airway Respiratory Irritants Aliases Respiratory irritant, a irway injury, respiratory injury, chemical respiratory injury, toxic inhalation Patient Care Goals Rapid recognition of the signs and symptoms of confirmed or suspected airway respiratory irritants. Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria 1. Inhalation of a variety of gases, mists, fumes, aerosols, or dusts may cause irritation or injury to the airways, pharynx, lung, asphyxiation, or other systemic effects 2. Inhaled airway/respiratory irritant agents will interact with the mucus membranes, upper and lower ai rways based on solubility, concentration, particle size, and duration of exposure 3. The less soluble and smaller the particle size of the agent the deeper it will travel into the airway and respiratory systems the inhaled toxic agent will go before reacting with adjoining tissues thus causing a greater delay in symptom onset Signs and Symptoms 1. As the type, severity and rapidity of signs and symptom onset depends on agent, water solubility, concentration, particle size, and duration of exposure, the below sig ns and symptoms are often overlapping and escalating in severity 2. Many airway and respiratory irritant agents have \"warning properties\" such as identifiable or unpleasant smells or irritation to eyes or airways 3.

Remove the patient's clothing that may retain gases or decontaminate if liquid or solid contamination b. Flush irrigated eff ected /burned areas 3. Rapidly assess the patient's respiratory status, mental status, and oxygenation 4. Administer (humidified if available) oxygen 5. Establish intravenous access (if possible) 6. Apply a cardiac monitor (if available) 7. Continuous and ongoing patient reassessment is critical Assessment 1. Make sure the scene is safe as many gases are heavier than air and wi ll build up in low lying areas. This is especially true of hydrogen sulfide and it' s \"knock down\" effect of the initial unprotected responder and subsequence casualties associated with unprotected rescuers attempting to sa fe the first downed responder 2. Consider BSI or appropriate PPE 3. Remove patient from toxic environment 4. Decontaminate 5. Assess ABCD and if indicated, expose the patient and then cover the patient to assure retention of body heat 6. Vital signs which include temperature 7. Place cardiac monitor and examine rhythm strip for arrhythmia potentials (consider 12 -lead EKG) 8. Check blood glucose Level 9. Monitor pulse oximetry and ETCO 2 for respiratory decompensation 10. Perform carboxyhemoglobin and cyanide device assessment, if available 11. Identify specific suspected agent if possible 12. Pertinent cardiovascular history or other prescribed medications for underlyin g disease 13. Patient pertinent history 14. Patient physical examination Upda ted January 5, 201 9 277 Treatment and Interventions 1. Assure a patent airway 2. Administer (humidified if available) oxygen and if hypoventilation, toxic inhalation or desaturation noted, support breathing a. Maintain the airway and assess for airway burns, stridor , or airway edema and if indicated, perform intubation early (recommendation to avoid supraglottic airways - cricothryoidotomy may be required in rarer severe cases b. Non -invasive ventilation techniques. i. Use contin uous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure severe impending respiratory f ailure ii. Use bag-valve -mask (BVM) ventilation in the setting of hypoventilation, respiratory failure or arrest 3. Albuterol 5 mg nebulized (or 6 puffs metered dose inhaler) should be administered to all patients in respiratory distress with signs of bronchospasm either by basic life support BLS or ALS providers . This medication should be repeated at this dose with unl imited frequency for ongoing distress 4. Ipratropium 0.5 mg nebulized should be given up to 3 doses, in conjunction with albuterol 5. Initiate IV access for infusion of lactated Ringer 's or normal saline and obtain blood samples in effort to record pre -treatment levels associated with EMS management ( e.g. glucose, lactate, cyanide) 6. Fluid bolus (20 mL/kg) if evidence of hypoperfusion 7. If the patient is experiencing significant pain, administer IV/ IO analgesics a. Morphine sulfate 0.1 mg/kg IV or IO b. Fentanyl 1 mcg/kg I V or IO 8. Eye irrigation early 9. Treat topical chemical burns [see appropriate Toxins and Environmental section guideline (s)] 10. In severe respiratory irritation, in particular hydrogen sulfide, with altered mental status and no improvement with removal from the toxic environment, administer oxygen (humidified if available) as appropriate with a target of achieving 94 -98% saturation - consider consultation for transfer to a hyperbaric ox ygen therapy Medication Administration 1. If wheezing is present, consider administering inhaled albuterol (2.5 -5 mg) as nebulized , or four to eight puffs metered dose inhaler 2. Ipratropium 0.5 mg nebuliz ed should be given in conjunction with albuterol , up to t hree doses Patient Safety Considerations 1. Generally, speaking to patients with exp osure to highly soluble airway/ respiratory irritants you will find that they have self -extricate d due to the warning properties such as the smell, rapidity of onset of irritat ion, and other symptoms 2. The less soluble agents may generate only an odor ( e.g. mowed hay smell for Phosgene) symptom and will have delayed serious symptoms such as acute pulmonary edema, hypoxia , and shortness of breath with minimal exertion Upda ted January 5, 201 9 278 Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Airway respiratory irritants can exacerbate underlying reactive airway diseases ( e.g. a sthma, COPD) and precipitated or exacerbate bronchospasm, r espiratory distress, and hypoxia 2. As patients may be off gassing (particularly hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen cyanide) in the back of the transport vehicle, it is recommended to have adequate ventilation of the patient compartment 3. Removal from the toxic environment, oxygen (humidified if available), general supportive therapy, bronchodilators, respiratory support, and time are core elements of care as there are no specific antidotes for any of these inhaled agents with the exception of heavy metals that may be chelated by physicians after agent identification 4. Hydrogen sulfide causes the cells responsible for the sense of smell to be stunned into inaction and therefore with a very short exposure will shut down and the exposed victim will not perceive the smell yet the victim continues to absorb the gas as it is still presen t 5. Inhaled agents have become popular as a means of committing suicide . If there is some form of suicide signage, hoses, or buckets of substances visible as you arrive at the vehicle or residence, immediately retreat to well ventilated area and don SCBA bef ore opening the vehicle or making entry as these gases may be highly concentrated and potentially lethal to EMS responders 6. Household bathroom, kitchen , and oven cleaners when mixed can generate a varied of these airway respiratory irritants ( ammonia, chlor amine , and chlorine gas releases are particularly common) . A very common exposure is to chloramine , a gas liberated when bleach (hypochlorite) and ammonia are combined. Chloramine then hydrolyzes in the distal airways and alveoli to ammonia and hypochlorou s acid 7. Sudden sniffing death can result from a single use of inhalant of abuse a. Some inhalants can cause the heart to beat rapidly and erratically and cause cardiac arrest b. This syndrome most often is associated with abuse of butane, propane and effects of the chemicals in the aerosols Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Patient may describe a specific odor ( chlorine swimming pool smell, ammonia smell, fresh mowed hay smell [phosgene]) which may be helpful but should not be relied upon as the human nose i s a poor discriminator of scent 2. Respiratory distress (retractions, wheezing, stridor) 3. Decreased oxygen saturation 4. Skin color 5. Neurologic status assessment 6. Reduction in work of breathing after treatment 7.

Irrigation with water or saline may facilitate resolution of symptoms and is recommended for decontamination of dermal and ocular exposure 5. If patient is in respiratory distress, go to Respiratory section 6. If patient is wheezing, go to Bronchospasm guideline 7. For persistent pa in of the eye or skin, go to Topical Chemical Burn guideline 8. Exposed individuals who are persistently symptomatic warrant further evaluation and treatment per local standards Patient Safety Considerations 1. Toxicity is related to duration of exposure and concentration of agent used (exposure in non-ventilated space) 2. Patients with pre -existing pulmonary conditions ( e.g. asthma, COPD) may be prone to more severe respiratory effects Upda ted January 5, 201 9 282 3. Traumatic injury may result w hen exposed individuals are in proximity to the device used to disperse the riot control agent ( e.g hose/stream under pressure, riot control agent projectile, grenade) Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. CN, CS, and OC are the most commonly enco untered riot control agents 2. CN, CS and OC have a high safety ratio. All three have a high median lethal concentration (LCt50) and a low median effective concentration (ECt50). 3. Toxicity is related to time of exposure and concentration of agent used (exposur e in non - ventilated space). 4. Symptoms that may be experienced after exposure: a. Eyes: tearing, pain, conjunctivitis, blurred vision b. Nose/mouth/throat: rhinorrhea, burning/pain, trouble swallowing, drooling c. Lungs: chest tightness, coughing, choking sensation, wheezing, dyspnea d. Skin: burning, redness, dermatitis e. GI: nausea and vomiting are rare and may be posttussive 5. Symptoms begin within seconds of exposure, are self -limited and are best treated by removing patient from ongoing exposure. Symptoms frequently decrease over time (15 -45 minutes ) after exposure ends. Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Riot control agent used 2. Symptoms of exposed 3. Lung sounds 4.

Revision Date September 8 , 2017 Upda ted January 5, 201 9 284 Hyperthermia/Heat Exposure Aliases Hyperthermia, heat cramps, heat e xhaustion, heat syncope, heat edema, heat s troke Definitions 1. Heat Cramps: are minor muscle cramps usually in the legs and abdominal wall. Patient temperature is normal 2. Heat Exhaustion: has both salt and water depletion usually of a gradual onset. As it progresses tachycardia, hypotension, elevated temperature, and very painful cramps occur. Symptoms of headache, nausea and vomiting occur. Heat exhaustion can progress to heat stroke 3. Heat Stroke : occurs when the cooling mechanism of the body (sweatin g) ceases due to temperature overload a nd/or electrolyte imbalances. Patient t emperature is usually 104\u00b0F. When no thermometer is available, it is distinguished from heat exhaustion by altered level of consciousness 4. Heat Syncope: is a transient loss of consciousness with spontaneous return to normal mentation attributable to heat exposure 5. Heat Edema: is dependent extremity swelling caused by interstitial fluid pooling Patient Care Goals 1. Cooling and rehydration 2. Mitigate high risk for decompensation 3. Mitigate high risk for agitation and uncooperative behavior Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria 1. Heat cramps 2. Heat exhaustion 3. Heat stroke 4. Heat syncope 5. Heat edema 6. Stimulant drug abuse 7. Excited delirium [see Agitated or Violent Patient/Behavioral Emergency guideline ] Exclusion Criteria 1. Fever from infectious or inflammatory conditions 2. Malignant hyperthermia 3. Serotonin syndrome 4. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome Upda ted January 5, 201 9 285 Patient Management Assessment 1. Patient A ssessment: a. Age b. Oral intake c. Medications d. Alcohol e. Illicit drugs f. Overdose g. Withdrawal risk 2. Environmental A ssessment: a. Ambient temperature and humidity b. Exertion level c. Length of time at risk d. Attire (clothing worn) e. Confined spac e i. Pediatric Considerations: Children left in cars who show signs of altered mental status and elevated body temperature should be presumed to have hyperthermia 3. Associated S ymptoms: a. Cramps b. Headache c. Orthostatic symptoms d. Nausea e. Weakness f. Mental status changes, including i. Confusion ii. Coma iii. Seizures iv. Psychosis 4. Vital signs: a. Temperature - usually 104\u00b0F or greater (if thermometer available) b. Skin: i. Flushed and hot ii. Dry or sweaty iii. Signs of first or second degree burns from sun exposure c. Other signs of poor perfusion/shock Treatment and Interventions 1. Move victim to a cool area and shield from the sun or any external heat source 2. Remove as much clothing as is practical and loosen any restrictive garments 3. If alert and oriented, give small sips of cool liqu ids 4. If altered mental status, check blood glucose level 5. Manage airway as indicated. 6. Place on cardiac monitor and record ongoing vital signs and level of consciousness Upda ted January 5, 201 9 286 7. If temperature is greater than 104\u00b0F (40\u00b0C) or if altered mental status is present, b egin active cooling by: a. Ice bath immersion provides the most rapid cooling mechanism but may not be available to EMS - If shivering occurs during cooling: i. Adult : 1. Midazolam a. 2.5mg IV/IN, may repeat once in 5 minutes OR b. 5mg IM may repeat once in 10 minutes 2. Lorazepam a. 1mg IV, may repeat once in 5 minutes OR b. 2mg IM, may repeat once in 10 minutes c. Diazepam - 2mg IV , may repeat once in 5 minutes ii. Pediatric : 1. Midazolam (single maximum dose 1mg) a. 0.1mg/kg IV OR b. 0.2mg/kg IN/IM c. NOTE : a 5mg/ mL concentration is recommended for IN/IM administration 2. Lorazepam (single maximum dose 1mg) a. 0.1mg/kg IV/IM 3. Diazepam a. 0.1 mg/kg IV (maximum single dose 2.5 mg) b. May repeat once, for maximum total IV/IM dose 5 mg OR c. 0.5mg/kg PR (maximum single dose 10 mg) d. May repeat once f or maximum total PR dose 20 mg b. Continually misting the exposed skin with tepid water while fanning the victim (most effective) c. Truncal ice packs may be used, but are less effective than evaporation d. DO NOT apply wet cloths or wet clothing, as they may trap heat and pre vent evaporative cooling 8. Cooling efforts should continue until the patient's temperature is less than 102.2 \u00b0F (39\u00b0C) and the patient demonstrate s improvement in mental status 9. Establish IV access for patients suffering from heat stroke - give cool fluids at 20 mL/kg boluses and reduce to 10 mL/kg/hr boluses when vitals are stable 10. Monitor for arrhythmia and cardiovascular collapse [see Cardiovascular section guidelines ] 11. Treat seizures , per the Seizure s guideline 12. All patients suffering from life threatening heat illness (including heat stroke) should be transported to the hospital Patient Safety Considerations Consider us e of physical securing devices [ see Agitated or Violent Patient/Behavioral Emergency guideline ] to protect vascular access sites . Upda ted January 5, 201 9 287 Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Patients at risk for heat emergencies include neonates, infants, geriatr ic patients, and patients with mental illness 2. Contributory risk factors may come from: a. Prescription and over -the-counter herbal supplements b. Cold medications c. Heart medications d. Diuretics e. Psychiatric medications f. Drug abuse g. Accidental or intentional drug over dose 3. Heat exposure can occur either due to increased environmental temperatures or prolonged exercise or a combination of both a. Environments with temperature 90\u00b0F and humidity 60% present the most risk 4. Heat stro ke is associated with cardiac arrhythmias indepen dent of drug ingestion/overdose Heat stroke has also been associated with cerebral edema 5. Do not forget to look for other causes of altered mental status such as low blood glucose level, or, in the proper circumstances (e.g. endurance exercise events ), consider exercise associated hyponatremia (EAH), especially in the patient with altered mental status, normal blood glucose, and normal temperature 6. Controversy : shivering may occur while treating heat stroke a. It is uncertain how harmful shivering is to heat stroke patients b. Cooling should be continued until the above temperature and mental status goals are met c. Treat shivering as above d. Research does not demonstrate the value of one benzodiazepine over another in shivering patients 7. Hyperthermia not from environmental factors has a differential that includes the following: a. Fever and delirium b. Hyperthyroid storm c. Delirium tremens (DTs) or tumor e. Adverse drug event: neuroleptic malignant syndrome, malignant h yperthermia f. Mental status changes without hyperthermia in the correct circumstances could be exercise associated hyponatremia 8.

Revision Date September 8 , 2017 Upda January 5, 201 9 289 Hypothermia/Cold Aliases Hypothermia, f rost bite, cold induced i njuries Patient Care Goals 1. Maintain hemodynamic stability 2. Prevent further heat loss 3. Rewarm the patient in a safe manner 4. Appropriate management of hypothermia induced cardiac arrest 5. Prevent loss of limbs Patient Presentation 1. Patients may suffer from hypothermia due to exposure to a cold environment (increased heat loss) or may suffer from a primary illness or injury that, in combination with cold exposure (heat loss in combination with decreased he at pro duction), leads to hypothermia 2. Patients may suffer systemic effects from cold (hypothermia) or localized effects (e.g. frostbite) 3. Patients with mild hypothermia will have normal mental status, shivering, and may have normal vital signs while patients with moderate to severe hypothermia will manifest mental status changes, eventual loss of shivering and progressive bradycardia, hypotension, an d decreased respiratory status 4. Patients with frostbite will develop numbness involving the affected body part a long with a \"clumsy\" feeling along with areas of blanched skin - later findings include a \"woody\" sensation, decreased or loss of sensation, bruising or blister formation, or a white and waxy appearance to affected tissue Inclusion Criteria Patients suffering systemic or localized cold injuries . Exclusion Criteria 1. Patients without cold exposure OR 2. Patients with cold exposure but no symptoms referable to hypothermia or frostbite Patient Management Assessment 1. Patient assessment should begin with atte ntion to the primary survey, looking for evidence of circulatory collapse and ensuring effective respirations a. The patient suffering from moderate or severe hypothermia may have severe alterations in vital signs including weak and extremely slow pulses, profound hypotension and decreased respirations b. The rescuer may need to evaluate the hypothermic patient for longer than the normothermic patient (up to 60 seconds) Upda ted January 5, 201 9 290 2. History - Along with standard SAMPLE -type history, additional patient history should inclu de: a. Attention to any associated injury or illness b. Duration of cold exposure c. Ambient temperature d. Treatments initiated before EMS arrival 3. There are several means to categorize the severity of hypothermia based on either core body temperature readings or clin ical evaluation - If possible and reliable, EMS providers should perform core body temperature measurements and categorize patients into one of the three follow levels of hypothermia: a. Mild : normal body temperature 35 -32.1 than 24\u00b0C (75.2\u00b0F) 4. Equally important is the patient's clinical presentation and the signs or sympt oms the patient is experiencing - the above temperature based categorization should be balanced against these clinical findings a. Mild : vital signs not depressed normal mental status, shivering is preserved ; body maintains ability to control temperature b. Moderate/Severe : - progressive bradycardia, hypotension , and dec reased respirations, alterations in mental status with eventual coma, shivering will be lost in moderate hypothermia (generally between 31 -30\u00b0 C), and general slowing of bodily functions ; the body loses ability to thermo -regulate Treatment and Interventio ns 1. Main tain patient and rescuer safety - the patient has fallen victim to cold injury and rescuers have likely had to enter the same environment. Maintain rescuer safety by prev enting cold injury to rescuers 2. Manage airway per the Airway Management guideline 3. Mild hypothermia: a. Remove the patient from the environment and prevent further heat loss by removing wet clothes and drying skin, insulate from the ground, shelter the patient from wind and wet conditions , and insu late the patient with dry clothing or a hypothermia wrap/ blanket . Cover the patient with a vapor barrier and, if available, move the patient to a warm environment b. Hypothermic patients have decreased oxygen needs and may not require supplemental oxygen i. If oxygen is deemed necessary, it should be warmed, to a maximum temperature between 104 -108\u00b0F (40 -42\u00b0C) and humidified if possible c. Provide beverages or foods containing glucose if feasible and patient is awake and able to manage airway inde pendently d. Vigorous shivering can substantially increase heat production - shivering should be fueled by caloric replacement e. Consider field -rewarming methods such as placement of large heat packs or heat blankets (chemical or electric if feasible) to the anterior chest or wr apped around the patient's thorax if large enough - forced air warming blankets ( e.g. Bair Hugger\u00ae) can be an effective field rewarming method if available Upda ted January 5, 201 9 291 f. Monitor frequently - if temperature or level of consciousness decreases, refer to Severe Hypothermia , below g. Consider IV access i. Indications for IV access and IV fluids in the mildly hypothermic patient are similar to those of the non -hypothermic patient ii. IV fluids, if administered, should be warmed, ideally to 42 \u00b0C iii. Bolus therapy is preferable to continuous drip iv. The recommended fluid for volume replacement in the hypothermic patient is normal saline h. If alterations in mental status, consider measuring blood glucose and treat as indicated (treat per Hypoglycemia or Hyperglycemia guideline s) and assess for other causes of alterations of mentation i. Transport to a hospital capable of rewarming the patient 4. Moderate or severe hypothermia: a. Perform ABCs , pulse che cks for patients suffering hypothermia should be performed for 60 seconds , and o btain core temperature if possible for patients exhibiting signs or symptoms of moderate/severe hypothermia i. Core temperatures are best measured by esophageal probe, if one is a vailable, the patient's airway is secured, and the provider has been trained in its insertion and use. ii. If esophageal temperature monitoring is not available or appropriate, use an epitympanic thermometer designed for field conditions with an isolating ear cap iii. Rectal temperatures may also be used, but only once the patient is in a warm environment - rectal temperatures are not reliable or suitable for taking temperatures in the field and should only be done in a warm environment (such as a heated ambulance) b. Manage airway as needed i. Care must be taken not to hyperventilate the patient as hypocarbia may reduce the threshold for ventricular fibrillation in the cold patient ii. Indications and contraindications for advanced airway devices are similar in the hypotherm ic patient as in the normothermic patient c. Prevent further heat loss by removing the patient from the environment and removing wet clothes and drying skin, insulate from the ground, shelter the patient from wind and wet conditions , and insulate the patient with dry clothing or a hypothermia wrap/ blanket . Cover the patient with a vapor barrier and, if available, move the patient to a warm environment d. Initiate field -rewarming methods such as placement of large heat packs or heat blan kets (chemical or electric if feasible) to the anterior chest or wrapped around the patient's thorax if large enough i. Chemical or electrical heat sources should never be applied directly to the skin ii. Use a barrier between the skin and heat source to prevent burns iii. Forced air warming blankets ( e.g. Bair Hugger\u00ae) can be an effective field rewarming method if available e. Handle the patient gently i. Attempt to keep the patient in the horizontal position, especially limiting motion of the extremities to avoid increasin g return of cold blood to the heart ii. Once in a warm environment, clothing should be cut off (rather than removed by manipulating the extremities) Upda ted January 5, 201 9 292 iii. Move the patient only when necessary such as to remove the patient from the elements f. Apply cardiac monitor or A ED if available g. Establish IV and provide warmed NS bolus - Repeat as necessary h. If alterations in mental status, consider measuring blood glucose and treat as indicated (treat per Hypoglycemia or Hyperglycemia guideline s) and assess for other causes of alterations of mentation i. Transport as soon as possible to a hospital capable of resuscitation - if cardiac arrest develops consider transport to a center capable of extracorporeal circulation (ECMO) or cardiopulmonary bypass (if feasible) j. Warm the patient compartment of the ambulance to 24\u00b0C (75.2\u00b0 F) during transport 5. Frostbite: a. If the patient has evidence of frostbite, and ambulation/travel is necessary for evacuatio n or safety, avoid rewarming of extremities until definitive treatment is possible. Additive injury occurs when the area of frostbite is rewarmed then inadvertently refrozen. Only initiate rewarming if refreezing is absolutely preventable. i. If rewarming is feasible and refreezing can be prevented use circulating warm water (37 - 39\u00b0C /98.6 - 102\u00b0F) to rewarm effected body part, thaw injury completely. If warm water is not available, rewarm frostbitten parts by contact with non -affected body surfaces. Do not rub or cause physical trauma . ii. After rewarming, cover injured parts with loose sterile dressing. If blisters are causing significant pain, and the provider is so trained, these may be aspirated, however, should not be de -roofed. Do not allow injury to ref reeze. Treat per the Pain Management guideline . Patient Safety Considerations 1. Given the additive effects of additional cold stress, the patient should be removed from the cold environment as soon as operationally fea sible 2. In patients suffering from moderate to severe hypothermia, it is critical to not allow these patients to stand or exercise as this may cause circulatory collapse 3. Devices that self -generate heat (e.g. heat packs) that are being utilized during the rewarming process should be wrapped in a barrier to avoid direct contact with the skin and to prevent burns. Available evidence suggests that heat packs with peak temperatures above 45\u00b0C (113\u00b0F) are most likely to cause burns. In patients who are unrespons ive, or unable to recognize a developing injury, please check the area in which the heating pad is placed regularly to ensure no tissue damage occurs. Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations Considerations in cardiac arrest 1. The following are contraindications for initiation of resuscitation in the hypothermic patient: a. Obvious fatal injuries (such as decapitation) b. The patient exhibits signs of being frozen (such as ice formation in the airway) c. Chest wall rigidity such that compressions are impo ssible d. Danger to rescuers or rescuer exhaustion e. Avalanche victims buried for 35 minutes or longer with airway obstruction by ice or snow Upda ted January 5, 201 9 293 2. Fixed and dilated pupils, apparent rigor mortis, and dependent lividity may not be contraindication for resuscitation in th e severely hypothermic patient 3. The mainstay of therapy in severe hypothermia and cardiac arrest should be effective chest compressions and attempts at rewarming Chest compressions should be provided at the same ra te as in normothermic patients 4. The tem perature at which defibrillation should first be attempted in the severely hypothermic cardiac arrest victim and the number of defibrillation attempts is unclear. There are different approaches regarding resuscitation of the hypothermic arrest patient. a. Per the American Heart Association (AHA) , if the patient has a shockable rhythm (VF/VT), defibrillation should be attempted - It is reasonable to continue defibrillation attempts per AHA protocols concurrently w ith rewarming strategies b. The state of Alaska's 2014 guidance on management of hypothermic patients in cardiac arrest advises that defibrillation should be attempted once, followed by 2 minutes of chest compressions, then rhythm and pulse checks i. If defibrillation is unsuccessful and the patient's core t emperature is 30\u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), do not make further attempts at defibrillation until the core temperature has increased to greater than 30\u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) ii. Continue CPR and attempt to rewarm the patient c. An alternate strategy , per the Wilderness Medical Society's accidental hypothermia guideline , suggests that i f the patient's core temperature is below 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), attempt defibrillation once, then wait until the patient has been rewarmed at least 1 \u00b0 - 2\u00b0C or to 30\u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) bef ore attempting additional shocks . It is noted that the likelihood of successful defibrillation increases with every one -degree increase in temperature d. If defibrillation is unsuccessful and the patient's core temperature is greater than 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F), follow guidel ines for normothermic patients e. If available monitors reveal asystole, CPR al one is the mainstay of therapy f. If monitoring reveals an organized rhythm (other than VF or VT) and no pulses are detected, do not sta rt CPR, but continue to monitor i. While thi s may represent pulseless electrical activity (PEA), this may also represent situations in which the patient's pulses are not detectable but remain effective due to decreased metabolic needs ii. In the case of PEA, the rhythm will deteriorate rapidly to asysto le, in which case, CPR should be initiated iii. Given the potential to cause VF with chest compressions, the Alaska guidance offers that it is better to maintain effective cardiac activity t han to start CPR and cause VF 5. Manage the airway per standard care in ca rdiac arrest victims [ see Cardiac Arrest guideline ] a. In the absence of advanced airways, ventilate the patient at the same rate as a normothermic patient b. If the patient has an advanced airway, venti late at half the rate recommended for a normothermic patient to prevent hyperventilation. If ETCO 2 is available, ventilate t o maintain normal ETCO 2 levels 6. There is little evidence to guide use of medications in severe hypothermia with cardiac arrest, howev er 2010 AHA updates to advanced cardiac life support recommend use of vasopressors according to standard ACLS protocols while the 2014 Alaska guidelines and the Wilderness Medical Society's accidental hypothermia guideline for the management of hypothermic patients advises medications should be withheld until the patient's core temperature is greater than 30\u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) Upda ted January 5, 201 9 294 a. Above 30 \u00b0C (86\u00b0F), intervals between medication provision should be doubled until the patient reaches 35 \u00b0C (95\u00b0F), at which time, normal medi cation intervals may be adopted 7. Upon ROSC, treat per Adult Post -ROSC guideline 8. Patients with severe hypothermia and arrest may benefit from resuscitation even after prolonged downtime, and survival with intac t neurologic function has been observed even after prolonged resuscitation a. Patients should not be considered deceased until rewarming has been attempted 9. If a hypothermic patient clearly suffered cardiac arrest and subsequently became hypothermic afterward with prolonged down time between arrest and rescue, there is no rationale for initiating resuscitation and warming the patient Pertinent Assessment Findings 1.

Monitor vital signs including oxygen saturations Upda ted January 5, 201 9 297 6. If O 2 saturation s are less than 92%, administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 94 -98% saturation. CConsider positive pressure ventilation in patients with signs or symptoms of respiratory difficulty 7. Consider hypothermia , treat per Hypothe rmia/Cold Exposure guideline 8. If the victim was involved in underwater diving and uncertainty exists regarding the most appropriate therapy, consider contacting direct medical oversight and discussing need for hyperbaric treatment . Include discussion regar ding: a. Submersion time b. Greatest depth achieved c. Ascent rate d. Gas mix 9. Establish IV access 10. Fluid bolus as indicated 11. Advanced airway management as indicated - Consider CPAP in awake patients with respiratory distress 12. Cardiac monitor Patient Safety Consideration s 1. Avoidance of hyperoxygenation of the drowning victim 2. Rescuer safety considerations Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. The World Health Organization definition of drowning is \"the process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid\" 2. Drowning is further defined in the following categories: a. Non -fatal drowning - patients rescued from drowning b. Fatal drowning - any death, acutely or subacutely, resultant from drowning 3. Submersion refers to situations in whic h the patient's airway is underwater . Immersion refers to situations in which the patient's body is in water but the patient's airway remains out of the water 4. Pediatric Considerations: a. Drowning is a common cause of death in children b. Risk factors for drowni ng include male gender, age less than 14 yo, alcohol use, lack of supervision, and risky behavior 5. Rescue efforts should be coordinated between all responding agencies to ensure patient is rapidly accessed and removed from the water 6. Initiation of in -water v entilations may increase survival - In-water chest compressions are futile 7. The European Resuscitation Council recommends 5 initial breaths be provided to the drowning victim a. The initial ventilations may be more difficult to achieve as water in the airways may impede alveolar expansion b. After the initial 5 breaths and 30 compressions, the standard ratio of 2 breaths to 30 compressions may be resumed Upda ted January 5, 201 9 298 8. Active efforts to expel water from the airway (by abdominal thrusts or other means) should be avoided as they delay resuscitative efforts and increase the potential for vomiting and aspiration 9. Long -standing teaching has suggested that rescuers should always assume c -spine injury in victims of drowning a. The 2010 American Heart Association update on special circumst ances in cardiac arrest notes that routine c -spine precautions in all victims of drowning is likely unnecessary unless the mechanism or injury, history , or physical exam suggests a cervical spine injury b. Mechanisms of injury highly suggestive of cervical sp ine injury include diving, water skiing, surfing or watercraft accidents 10. Uncertainty exists regarding survival in cold water drowning, however, recent literature suggests the following: a. If wat er temperature is less than 43\u00b0F (6\u00b0 C) and the patient is subme rged with evidence of cardiac arrest: i. Survival is possible for submersion time less than 90 minutes and resuscitative efforts should be initiated ii. Survival is not likely for submersion time greater than 90 minutes and providers may consider not initiating resuscitation or termination of resuscitation on scene b. If water temperature is greater than 43\u00b0F (6\u00b0 C) and the patient is submerged with evidence of cardiac arrest: i. Survival is possible for submersion time less than 30 minutes and resuscitative efforts should be initiated ii. Survival is not likely for submersion time greater than 30 minutes and providers may consider not initiating resuscitation or termination of resusc itation on scene 11. Patients may develop subacute respiratory difficulty after drowning and therefore all victims of drowning should be transported for observation Quality Improvement Associated NEMSIS Protocol(s) (eProtocol.01) 9914093 - Injury -Drowning/Nea r Drowning 9914091 - Injury -Diving Emergencies Key Documentation Elements Mechanism of injury or history suggesting cervical spine injury Submersion time Water temperature Activities leading to drowning Consider a standardized data collection metrics su ch as the Utstein drowning data reporting elements Performance Measures Recognition and appropriate care of pulmonary/respiratory complaints Cervical spine management when appropriate Adherence to Cardiac Arrest guideline Upda ted January 5, 201 9 299 References 1.

Rapid assessment and management of life -threatening injuries 2. Rescue from the water -based environment 3. Transport patients suffering from self-contained underwater breathing apparatus ( SCUBA ) diving injury/illness for hospital evaluation and consideration of repressurization/hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria Patients with history of recent (within 48 hours) SCUBA diving activity who are exhibiting potential signs and/or symptoms of dive related illness/injury, regardless of dive table compliance. NOTE: SCUBA -related complications may occur anywhere, particularly when divers travel by air within 24 -hour s of diving Exclusion Criteria Patients without history of recent (within 48 hours) SCUBA diving exposure . Patient Management Assessment 1. Follow Universal Care guideline 2. History should include circumstances l eading to the complaint, details of mechanism of injury, time under water, depth of dive, compliance with dive tables/decompression stops, gas mixture used, and water temperature (if available) 3. Be alert for signs of barotrauma (pulmonary barotrauma, arteri al gas embolism, pneumothorax, ear/sinus/dental barotrauma etc.) and/or decompression sickness (joint pain, mental status change, other neurologic symptoms including paralysis) or nitrogen narcosis (confusion, intoxication). 4. Assess for other associated inj ury such as injury to the head or spine (if mechanism and symptoms suggest), marine envenomation, hypothermia, or other injury Treatment and Interventions 1. If a SCUBA accident includes associated drowning/near -drowning [see Drowning guideline ] 2. Manage airway as indicated 3. If air embolism suspected, place in left lateral recumbent position (patient lying with the left side down, knees drawn upward, and flat) a. Trendelenburg position is sometimes recommended to help trap the air i n the dependent right ventricle, and may be useful if a central venous catheter is being used to withdraw the air, but this posit ion may increase cerebral edema 4. Monitor vital signs including oxygen saturations an d cardiac rhythm (if possible) Upda ted January 5, 201 9 301 5. Administer o xygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 94 -98% saturation a. Use positive pressure ventilation ( e.g. CPAP) carefully in patients for whom pulmonary barotrauma is a consideration [see Airway Management guideline ] 6. Patients with symptoms suspicious for decompression illness, should be placed on supplemental oxygen regardless of saturations to enhance washout of inert gasses 7. Assess for hypothermia , treat per Hypothermia/Cold Exposure guideline 8. Consider contacting direct medical oversight and discussing need for hyperbaric treatment and primary transport t o facility with HBOT capability - include discussion regarding factors such as submersion time, greatest d epth ach ieved, ascent rate, and gas mix 9. Establish IV access 10. Fluid bolus as indicated Patient Safety Considerations 1. If the patient is still in the water, seek safest and most rapid means of removal safe (within your scope of training) while minimizing risk of further injury 2. Seek assistance early for special rescue/extrication and transportation needs 3. Check for multiple patients ( e.g. group dive table calculation error(s) or contaminated dive gases) Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Rescue efforts should be coordinated between all responding agencies to ensure that the patient is rapidly accessed and safely removed from the water if diver unable to do so themselves 2. If air medical transport is necessary, the patient should be transported with the ca bin pressurized to lowest possible altitude. If an unpressurized aircraft is used ( e.g. most helicopter (HEMS) services), patient should be flown at the lowest safe altitude possible 3. Decompression illness may have a variety of presentations depending on sy stem affected (e.g. skin, joint(s), pulmonary, neurologic) 4. SCUBA accidents/incidents can result in a variety of issues, including barotrauma, air embolism and decompression illness Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Vital signs findings 2.

Revision Date September 8 , 2017 Upda ted January 5, 201 9 303 Altitude Illness Aliases Altitude s ickness, High Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE), High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE), Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) Definitions 1. Acute mountain sickness: Headache plus one or more of the following: anorexia, nausea or vomi ting, fatigue or weakness, dizziness or lightheadedness or difficulty sleeping. These symptoms must occur in the setting of recent arrival to high altitude (generally considered greater than 5000 - 7000 feet) 2. High altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) : Progressi ve dyspnea, cough, hypoxia, and weakness in high altitude environments (considered greater than 8000 feet ). Patients may or may not exhibit symptoms if acute mountain sickness precedes symptoms of HAPE 3. High altitude cerebral edema (HACE): Heralded by menta l status changes in patients with symptoms of acute mountain sickness including altered mentation, ataxia, or stupor and progressing to coma . Typically seen in high altitude environments ( greater than 8000 feet) 4. Feet to meters conversion reference: Feet Meters 8000 ft Approximately 2400 m 7000 ft Approximately 2100 m 5000 ft Approximately 1500 m 1000 ft Approximately 300 m 500 ft Approximately 150 m Patient Care Goals 1. Improve oxygenation through a combination of descent and supplemental O 2 2. Safe but rapid transport from the high -altitude environment to a lower altitude environment Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria 1. Patients suffering from altitude illness, including a. Acute mountain sickness b. High altitude pulmonary edema c. High altitude cerebral e dema Exclusion Criteria Patients who have not been exposed to altitude . Patient Management Assessment Assessment should target the signs and symptoms of altitude illness but should also consider alternate causes of these symptoms . Upda ted January 5, 201 9 304 Treatment and Interven tions 1. Ensure scene safety for rescuers 2. Stop ascent a. Patients with acute mountain sickness only may remain at their current altitude and initiate symptomatic therapy b. Patients with HACE or HAPE should initiate descent 3. Perform ABCs and manage airway as necessary 4. Administer supplemental oxygen, if available, with goal to keep oxygen saturations 90% 5. Descend to lower altitude. Descent is the mainstay of therapy and is the definitive therapy for all altitude related illnesses. Descent should be initiated a s soon as scene conditions permit . a. If severe respiratory distress is present and pulmonary edema is found on exam, provider should start positive pressure ventilation b. Establish IV and perform fluid bolus with goal to maintain systolic BP 90 mm Hg c. Monitor cardiac rhythm 6. Descent should always be the primary treatment strategy for patients suffering from altitude illness, especially patients suffering from HACE and HAPE. If decent is not possible, or if direct medical oversight permits, the EMS provider may consider t he following possible therapies - portable hyperbaric chambers are effective for the management of severe altitude illness. However, they should not be used in lieu of decent, only as an alternative should descent be unfeasi ble. a. Acute mountain sickness i. Ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain ii. Ondansetron 4 mg IV, PO, or sublingual every 6 hours for vomiting iii. Acetazolamide - up to 250 PO mg twice a day 1. Pediatric dosing is 2.5 mg/kg up to a maximum of 250 mg twice a day 2. Acetazolamide speeds acclimatization and therefore helps in treating acute mountain sickness iv. Dexamethasone - 4 mg IM, IV, or PO every 6 hours until symptoms resolve 1. Pediatric dosing is 0.15 mg/kg IM, IV, or PO every 6 hours 2. Dexamethasone helps treat the symptoms of acu te mountain sickness and may be used as an adjunctive therapy in severe acute mountain sickness when the above measures alone do not ameliorate the symptoms . In these circumstances, patients should also initiate descent, as dexamethasone does not facilitat e acclimatization b. HACE - All therapies listed below should be considered as adjunctive to descent . Descent should always be the primary treatment modality i. Dexamethasone - 8 mg IM, IV, or PO once followed by 4 mg every 6 hours 1. Pediatric dosing: 0.15 mg/kg/dose every 6 hours 2. Dexamethasone helps treat the symptoms of HACE and should be initiated in HACE - In these circumstances, patients should also initiate descent ii. Consider use of acetazolamide at the above dosing Upda ted January 5, 201 9 305 d. HAPE - All therapies listed below should be considered as adjunctive to descent . Descent should always be the primary treatment modality i. Nifedipine - 30 mg ER PO twice a day - If nifedipine is not available: 1. Tadalafil - 20-40 mg PO once daily may be used OR 2. Sildenafil - 20 mg PO three times a day may be used ii. Multiple pulmonary vasodilators should not be used concurrently Patient Safety Considerations 1. The high -altitude environment is inherently dangerous. Rescuers must balance patient needs with patient safety and safety for the responders 2. Rapid descent by a minimum of 500 -1000 feet is a priority, however rapidity of descent must be balanced by current environmental conditions and other safety considerations Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Patients suffering from altitude illness have exposed themselves to a dangerous environment. By entering the same environment, providers are exposing themselves to the same altitude exposure. Be vigilant in looking for symptoms of altitude illness amongst rescuers 2. Descent of 500 -1000 feet is often enough to see improvements in patient conditions 3. Patients with HAPE are suffering from non -cardiogenic pulmonary edema and may benefit from positive pressure ventilation via either bag assisted ventilation, CPAP , or other means of positive pressure ventilation 4. Patients suffering from altitude illness are commonly dehydrated and require IV fluids - once resuscitation is complete and the patient requires no further fluid boluses, maintain IV fluids at 125 mL/hr 5. HAPE is the most lethal of all altitude illnesses 6. Consider alternate causes of symptoms of AMS - the symptoms of AMS may be caused by alternate etiologies such as carbon monoxide poisoning (in patients cooking within enclosed areas), dehydration, exhaustion, h ypoglycemia, hyponatremia Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Consider airway management needs in the patient with severe alteration in mental status 2. HAPE will present with increasing respiratory distress and rales on exam 3. HACE will present with mental status c hanges, ataxia, and progressing to coma Quality Improvement Associated NEMSIS Protocol(s) (eProtocol.01) 9914021 - Environmental -Altitude Sickness Key Documentation Elements Patient's itinerary, including starting altitude, highest altitude gained and rate of ascent Presence (or absence) of prophylaxis against altitude (including medications such as acetazolamide, sildenafil) Total altitude descended Upda ted January 5, 201 9 306 Performance Measures Mec hanism of treatment for acute mountain sickness, HACE , or HAPE Medical decision -making regarding treatment choice ( e.g. weather, inability to descend) References 1.

Revision Date September 8 , 2017 Upda ted January 5, 201 9 307 Conducted Electrical Weapon Injury (e.g. TASER\u00ae) Aliases Tased Patient Care Goals 1. Manage the condition that triggered the application of the conducted electrical weapon with special attention to patients meeting criterion for excited delirium [see Agitated or Violent Patient/Behavioral Emergency guideline ] 2. Make sure patient is appropriately secured or restrained with assistance of law enforcement to protect the patient and staff [see Agitated or Violent Patient/Behavioral Emergency guideline ] 3. Perform comp rehensive trauma and medical assessment as patients who have received conducted electrical weapon may have already been involved in physical confrontation 4. If discharged from a distance, two single barbed darts (13mm length) should be located a. Do not remove barbed dart from sensitive areas (head, neck, hands, feet or genitals) Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria 1. Patient received either the direct contact discharge or the distance two barbed dart discharge of the conducted electrical weapon 2. Patient may have sustained fall or physical confrontation trauma 3. Patient may be under the influence of toxic substances and or may have underlying medical or psychiatric disorder Exclusion Criteria No recommendations Patient Management Assessment 1. Once patient has been appropriately secured or restrained with assistance of law enforcement, perform primary and secondary assessment including 3 -lead EKG, pulse oximeter, and consider 12 -lead EKG 2. Evaluate patient for evidence of excited delirium manifested by varied combination of agitation, reduced pain sensitivity, elevated temperature, persistent struggling, or hallucinosis Treatment and Interventions 1. Make sure patient is app ropriately secured with assistance of law enforcement t o protect the patient and staff. Consider psychologic management medications if patient struggling agains t physical devices and may harm themselves or others 2. Conservative programs treat all barbed darts as a foreign body and leave them for physician removal while more progressive programs allow EMS or law enforcement to remove barbed darts except for sensitive areas (head, neck, hands, feet or genitals) 3. Treat medical and traumatic injury Upda ted January 5, 201 9 308 Patient Safety Considerations 1. Before removal of the barbed dart, make sure the cartridge has been removed from the conducted electrical weapon 2. Patient should not be restrained in the prone, face down , or hog -tied position as respiratory compromise is a significant risk 3. The p atient may have underlying pathology before being tased (refer to appropriate guidelines for managing the underlying medical/traumatic pathology) 4. Perform a comprehensive assessment with special attention looking for to signs and symptoms that may indicate agitated delirium 5. Transport the patient to the hospital if they have concerning signs or symptoms 6. EMS providers who respond for a conducted electrical weapon patient should not perform a \"medical clearance\" for law enforcement Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Conducted electrical weapon can be discharged in three fashions: a. Direct contact without the use of the darts b. A single dart with addition contact by direct contact of weapon c. From a distance up to 35 feet with two darts 2. The device delivers 19 pulses per second with an average current per pulse of 2.1 milliamps which in combination with toxins/drugs, patient's underlying diseases, excessive physical exertion, and trauma may precipitate arrhythmias, thus consider EKG monitoring and 12 - lead EKG assessment 3. Drive Stun is a direct weapon two -point contact which is designed to generate pain and not incapacitate the subject . Only local muscle groups are stimulated with the Drive Stun technique Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Thoroughly assess the tased patient for trauma as the patient may have fallen from standing or higher 2. Ascertain if more than one TASER\u00ae cartridge was used (by one or more officers, in effort to identify total number of possible darts and contacts) Quality Improvement Associated NEMSIS Pro tocol(s) (eProtocol.01) 9914203 - Injury -Conducted Electrical Weapon ( e.g. Taser) Key Documentation Elements If darts removed, document the removal location in the patient care report Physical exam trauma findings Cardiac rhythm and changes Neurologic status assessment findings Performance Measures Comprehensive patient documentation as this is a complex patient Abnormal findings or vital signs were addressed Patient received EKG or 12 -lead EKG evaluation If indicated, review for appropriate securing technique Upda ted January 5, 201 9 309 References 1.

Revision Date September 8 , 2017 Upda ted January 5, 201 9 310 Electrical Injuries Aliases Electrical burns, e lectrocution Patient Care Goals 1. Prevent additional harm to patient 2. Identify life threatening issues such as dysrhythmias and cardiac arrest 3. Identify characteristics of electrical source to communicate to receiving facility (voltage, amperage, alternating current [AC] versus direct current [DC] ) 4. Understand that deep tissue injury can be far greater than external appearance 5. Have high index of suspicion for associated trauma due to patient being thrown 6. Determine most appropriate disposition for the patient as many will require burn center care and some may require trauma center care Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria Expo sure to electrical current (AC or DC) . Exclusion Criteria None Patient Management Assessment 1. Verify scene is secure. The electrical source must be disabled prior to assessment 2. Assess primary survey with specific focus on dysrhythmias or cardiac arrest - apply a cardiac monitor 3. Identify all sites of burn injury - If the patient became part of the circuit, there will be an additional site near the contact with ground - electrical burns are often full thickness and involve significant deep tissue damage 4. Assess for potential associated trauma and note if the patient was thrown from contact point - if patient has altered mental status, assume trauma was involved and treat accordingly 5. Assess for potential compartment syndrome from significant extremity tissu e damage 6. Determine characteristics of source if possible - AC or DC, voltage, amperage , and also time of injury Treatment and Interventions 1. Identify dysrhythmias or cardiac arrest - even patients who appear dead (particularly dilated pupils) may have good outcomes with prompt intervention [see appropriate guideline for additional information and patient assessment/treatment ] 2. Immobilize if associated trauma suspected [see Trauma section guidelines ] 3. Apply dry dressing to any woun ds 4. Remove constricting clothing and jewelry since additional swelling is possible 5. Administer fluid resuscitation per burn protocol - remember that external appearance will underestimate the degree of tissue injury Upda ted January 5, 201 9 311 6. Electrical injuries may be associated with significant pain , treat per Pain Management guideline 7. Electrical injury patients should be taken to a burn center whenever possible since these injuries can involve considerable tissue damage 8. When there is significan t associated trauma this takes priority, if local trauma resources and burn resources are not in the same facility Patient Safety Considerations 1. Verify no additional threat to patient 2. Shut off electrical power 3. Move patient to shelter if electrical storm a ctivity still in area Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Electrical current causes injury through three main mechanisms: a. Direct tissue damage, altering cell membrane resting potential, and eliciting tetany in skeletal and/or cardiac muscles b. Conve rsion of electrical energy into thermal energy, causing massive tissue destruction and coagulative necrosis c. Mechanical injury with direct trauma resulting from falls or violent muscle contraction 2. Anticipate atrial and/or ventricular dysrhythmias as well as cardiac arrest 3. The mortality related to electrical injuries is impacted by several factors: a. Route current takes through the body - current traversing the heart has higher mortality b. Type of current - AC vs. DC i. AC is more likely to cause cardiac dysrhythmias while DC is more likely to cause deep tissue burns however either type of current can cause any injury ii. DC typically causes one muscle contraction while AC can cause repeated contractions iii. Both types of current can cause involuntary muscle contr actions that do not allow the victim to let go of the electrical source iv. AC is more likely to cause ventricular fibrillation while DC is more likely to cause asystole c. The amount of current impacts mortality more than the voltage Upda ted January 5, 201 9 312 Current level (Milliampere s) Probable Effect on Human Body of 120 V, 60 Hz AC for 1 second 1 mA Perception level. Slight tingling sensation. Still dangerous if wet conditions. 5mA Slight shock felt; not painful but disturbing. Average individual can let go. However, strong involuntary reactions to shocks in this range may lead to injuries. 6mA - 16mA Painful shock, begin to lose muscular control. Commonly referre d to as the freezing current or \"let -go\" range. 17mA - 99mA Extreme pain, respiratory arrest, severe muscular contractions . Individual cannot let go. Death is possible. 100mA - 2000mA Ventricular fibrillation (uneven, unc oordinated pumping of the heart ). Muscular contraction and nerve damage begins to occur. Death is likely. > 2,000mA Cardiac arrest, internal organ damage, and severe burns. Death is probable.

Fixed/dilated pupils may be a sign of neurologic insult, rather than a sign of death/impending death - Should not be used as a solitary, independent sign of death for the purpose of discontinuing resuscitation in this patient population Treatment and Interventions 1. Assure patent airway - if in respiratory arrest only, manage airway as appropriate 2. If in cardiopulmonary arrest, treat per Cardiac Arrest gu ideline 3. Consider IV initiation - Avoid initiation through burned skin 4. Monitor EKG . Be alert for potential arrhythmias . Consider 12 -lead EKG, when available 5. Consider early pain management for burns or associated traumatic injury [see Pain Management guideline ] Patient Safety Considerations 1. Recognize that repeat strike is a risk . Patient and rescuer safety is paramount 2. Victims do not carry or discharge a current, so the patient is safe to touch and treat Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Lightning strike cardiopulmonary arrest patients have a high rate of successful resuscitation, if initiated early, in contrast to general cardiac arrest statistics 2. There may be multiple victims 3. If multip le victims, cardiac arrest patients whose injury was witnessed or thought to be recent should be treated first and aggressively (reverse from traditional triage practices) a. Patients suffering cardiac arrest from lightning strike initially suffer a combined cardiac and respiratory arrest b. Return of spontaneous circulation may precede resolution of respiratory arrest c. Patients may be successfully resuscitated if provided proper cardiac and respiratory support, highlighting the value of \"reverse triage\" 4. It may n ot be immediately apparent that the patient is a lightning strike victim 5. Injury pattern and secondary physical exam findings may be key in identifying patient as a victim of lightning strike 6. Lightning strike is a result of very high voltage, very short dur ation DC current exposure Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Presence of thermal or non -thermal burns 2. Evidence of trauma 3. Evidence of focal neurologic deficits Upda ted January 5, 201 9 316 Quality Improvement Associated NEMSIS Protocol(s) (eProtocol.01) 9914209 - Injury -Lightning/Lightning Strike Key Documentation Elements Initial airway status Initial cardiac rhythm Neurologic exam (initial and repeat) Associated/secondary injuries Pain scale documentation/pain management Performance Measures Cardiopulmonary issues addressed early and do cumented appropriately Patient transported to closest appropriate facility Pain scale documented and treated per guidelines (when appropriate) EMS Compass \u00ae Measure s (for additional information, see www.emscompass.org ) o Trauma -01: Pain assessment of injured patients.

Universal Documentation Guideline Aliases NEMSIS, Documentation Patient Care Goals 1. Support continuity of patient care and continuous performance improvement (CPI) of patient care through meeting minimum documentation standards for all EMS events where a pa tient was encountered 2. This guideline defines minimum standards and inclusions used and referenced throughout this document under the \" Quality Improvement \" section of each guideline 3. The National EMS Information System (NEMSIS) submission requirements, state and local EMS systems , and EMS billing reimbursement services will have more extensive minimum requirements that exceed this guideline 4. This guideline can be used as a starting point for systems looking to more formally define documentation requirements Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria All EMS events where a patient was encountered and one or more clinical guideline was used to determine patient treatment and/or disposition. Exclusion Criteria None Toolkit for Key Categories of Data Elements Incident Demographics 1. Incident Demographics include the type of incident, location, time, dispatch information, response resources and patient/incident disposition of the EMS event a. This information will always apply and be available, even if the responding unit never arrives on scene (is cancelled) or never makes patient contact b. Incident demographics are important for filtering incident types and outcomes when doing CPI reviews, pro viding aggregate descriptive data , and billing for reimbursement 2. Minimum Incident Demographic Fields include: a. Incident Times i. eTimes.03 - Unit Notified by Dispatch Date/Time (NEMSIS mandatory) ii. eTimes.05 - Unit En Route Date/Time (Unit responding) iii. eTimes.06 - Unit Arrived on Scene Date/Time (If arrived) iv. eTimes.07 - Arrived at Patient Date/Time (If patient contact made) v. eTimes.09 - Unit Left Scene Date/Time (Unit Transporting Time, if applicable) vi. eTimes.11 - Patient Arrived at Destination Date/Time (If applicable) vii. eTimes.13 - Unit Back in Service Date/Time (NEMSIS mandatory) b. eResponse.05 - Type of Service Requested (e.g. 911 vs interfacility) c. eResponse.07 - Primary Role of the Unit (e.g. Transport or non -transport) d. eDispatch.01 - Complaint Reported by Dis patch (Dispatch reason from EMD) e.

Intended by NEMSIS to be the destination facility or the Agency transferred to, although many ePCR systems only collect this as the destination facility because of the complexity of mixing facilities and services in the sam e field Upda ted January 5, 201 9 331 Assessments and Exams 1. Exams By definition, u se of NEMSIS eExam fields is optional ; they are, however, available for both state and local EMS system use . a. Many systems do not require use of these fields as they can be time -consuming to enter, often too detailed ( e.g. there is no value for whole arm, it would need to be entered as shoulder, upper arm, elbow, forearm and wrist with separate exam findings for each component, meaning a single exam finding of paralysis for an arm would take ten step s to enter) and the same information is often reflected in the provider's narrative . b. However, there is some utility in targeted use of these fields for certain situations such as stroke, spinal exams , and trauma without needing to enter all the fields in each record . 2. Capacity Assessment Group This can be used to support documentation of patient capacity for refusal of care and/or transport, participation in advanced spinal assessments , or support for treatment decisions by EMS providers. NOTE: The Capacity Assessment Group does not provide a legal definition of capacity and should not be used as such. It is intended only to assist the EMS provider in documenting the most basic exam and history findings in order to determine capacity. Many additional factors must be considered when determining capacity including the situation, patient medical history, medical conditions , and consultation with direct medical oversight . a. Barrie rs and situational confounders [Both only single entry] i. eHistory.01 - Barriers to Patient Care ii. eHistory.17 - Alcohol/Drug Use Indicators b.

EKG Rhythm Group [see Vitals section ] d. Attach 12 -lead graphic ePCR (through direct integration linkage with EKG monitor or attachment of scanned printout as allowed /available in software) e. 12-lead -EKG Procedure -documented under Procedures Performed Group 6. Trauma/Injury The exam fields have many useful values for documenting trauma (deformity, bleeding, burns , etc.). Use of targeted documentation of injured areas can be helpful, particularly in cases of more serious trauma. Because of the endless possible variations where this could be used, specific fields will not be defined here. Not e, however that the exam fields use a specific and useful Pertinent Negative called \"Exam Finding Not Present .\" This can be used to document that the provider actually performed the assessment, but did not find any injury/abnormality.

It summarizes the incident history and care in a manner that is ea sily digested between caregivers for continuity of care and provides a place for EMS to document facts that do not fit into fixed data fields [see Narrative section under Notes/Educational Pearls (below) for more detail ] Notes/Educational Pearls Documenting Signs and Symptoms Versus Provider Impressions 1. Signs and Symptoms a. Signs and Symptoms should support the provider impressions, treatment gu idelines and overall care given. A symptom is something the patient experiences and tells the provider; i t is subjective. A sign is something the provider sees; it is objective. b. Symptoms should not be confused with provider impressions. The provider impressions are the EMS working field diagnosis of the patient's actual medical condition . 2. Provider Impressions a. There is often a great deal of confusion on the part of EMS providers about the difference between symptoms and provider impressions. Provider impressions should be supported by symptoms but not be the symptoms except on rare occasions where they may be the same ( e.g. weakness when no etiology for the weakness can be determined by the EMS provider). b. Correctly documenting impressions is essential to many aspects of EMS data use, such as EMS reimbursement, reports of incident t ypes, specialty registries ( e.g. CARES) and CPI reviews. EMS agencies could literally lose money or equipment and staffing resources if the providers are incorrectly entering provider impressions. Addressing this issue should be an essential part of the re cord Quality Assurance and CPI process and documentation training. c. Example of documenting symptoms versus impressions : i. An opiate overdose patient who received naloxone and had a positive response. This patient would have possible Symptoms of altered mental status, unconscious, respiratory distress, and respiratory failure/apnea. All 4 of these symptoms are available as provider impressions, however the correct impression for this patient would be whatever variation of \"Drug Overdose Upda ted January 5, 201 9 335 Opiate s or Heroin\" impression(s) are setup in the local ePCR system being used. This impression will specifically define the call as an overdose with opiates, rather than a case where one of the symptoms was also used as an impression when the use of naloxone an d other assessments and diagnostic tools could not determine an etiology for the symptom(s). Narrative The various data fields within the ePCR are important as they provide a means of uniformly entering incident data that can be used for importing into bi lling software or hospital records, transmitting between EMS systems or creating descriptive reports , or conducting research. In most cases, at a local, state , or national level, if something wasn't documented in the appropriate data field, i t didn't happe n or exist. However, the Narrative plays several essential roles in the PCR. 1. Role of the Narrative a. Provides an efficient and effective means to share patient information for continuity of care between EMS services and EMS and hospital staff. The narrative summarizes the incident history and care in a manner that is easily digested between caregivers. b. Provides a place for EMS to document facts that do not fit into fixed data fields. Specifically, this would include the detailed history of the scene, what th e patient may have done or said or other aspects of thecal that only the provider saw, heard, or did. The Narrative is the place for the EMS provider to \"paint the picture\" for all others to more fully understand the incident. c. Provides a standard means to add essential details about medical history, exams, treatments, patient response , and changes in patient condition that can't otherwise be effectively or clearly communicated. 2. Narrative Formats Documentation by EMS providers demonstrates a wide variation of training and practice reinforcement . Most training programs provide limited instruction on how to properly document operational and clinical processes, and almost no practice. Most providers learn this skill on the job, and often proficient mentors are sparse. Therefore, it is essential that the EMS provider uses a standard format to ensure they are consistent and complete in their documentation. There are three standard formats for EMS documentation. EMS providers should choose the best match for them, master the format , and be consistent in its use. a. Medical Narrative: This format is the one most new EMS providers use as it is intuitive and easy to learn. Some more experienced providers use it as they find telling the story from start to finish works bes t to organize their thoughts. A drawback to this method is that it is easy to forget to include facts because of the lack of structure. b. SOAP: This format stands for Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan. This is a format that is very common in the medical field . c. CHART : This format stands for Complaint, History, Assessment, Rx (Treatment) and Transport. Each section's content is clearly defined and consistent in format. It minimizes the likelihood of forgetting information and ensures documentation is consistent between records and providers. CHART is the format most recommended as best practice by EMS legal authorities and is considered the standard in many EMS systems. A variation is DCHART, where the \"D\" stands for Dispatch (reason). Upda ted January 5, 201 9 336 Medications Given Showing Positive Action Using Pertinent Negatives For medications that are required by prot ocol (e.g. aspirin for cardiac chest pain ), pertinent negatives should be used to show that a medication protocol was considered but was satisfied by other than provider action. Example : EMS is called to a patient for cardiac chest pain. The patient has a lready taken 324 mg of aspiri n by the time EMS arrives per 9-1-1 pre -arrival instructions. EMS providers should document this as a medication given , prior-to-arrival, with the best estimated time, and qualify the medication as \"Medication Alre ady Taken\" using the pertinent n egative. Definitions for Response to Medications 1. Improved : a. The medication had its intended therapeutic effect and the patient's symptoms decreased or clinical condition improved or resolved (the word \"effective\" could be generally be substituted for \"improved\" ). b. If a patient had the intended therapeutic response to the medication, but a side effect that caused a clinical deterioration in another body system, then \"Improved\" should be chosen and the side effects documented as a complica tion ( e.g. nitroglycerin improved chest pain but dropped the blood pressure) . 2. Unchanged : a. The medication was ineffective and had no intended therapeutic effect or had a sub - therapeutic and unnoticeable effect, AND b. The patient condition did not deteriorate . 3. Worse : a. The patient condition deteriorated or continued to deteriorate because either the medication: i. Was ineffective and had no intended therapeutic effect ; OR ii. Had a sub -therapeutic effect that was unable to stop or reverse the decline in patient condi tion; OR iii. Was the wrong medication for the clinical situation and the therapeutic effect caused the condition to worsen ( e.g. giving glucose to a patient with hyper glycemia/diabetic ketoacidosis). Definitions for Response to Procedures 1. Not Applicable : The nature of the procedure has no direct expected clinical response ( e.g. patient assessment, 12 -lead EKG acquisition) . 2. Improved : a. The procedure performed had the intended effective outcome and/or the patient's symptoms decreased or clinical condition improved or resolved ( e.g. defibrillation resolved V F into a perfusing rhythm; intubation controlled the airway and allowed effective management of breathing). b. An effective procedure that caused an improvement in the patient condition may also have resulte d in a procedure complication and the complication should be documented Upda ted January 5, 201 9 337 (e.g. intubation caused minor airway trauma, but the intubation successfully secured the airway) . 3. Unchanged : a. The procedure performed did not have the clinical effect intended, but did not directly worsen the patient's symptoms or clinical condition ( e.g. attempted defibrillation and the person remained in VF); or b. Had a sub -therapeutic effect and the symptoms continued ( e.g. a bandage applied to a bleeding wound failed to stop the blee ding); or c. The nature of the procedure has no direct expected clinical response ( e.g. patient assessment). NOTE: \"Not Applicable\" would also be appropriate to choose for these cases 4. Worse : a. The results of the procedure performed lead to a worsening of the patient's symptoms or condition ( e.g. defibrillation converted VF into asystole, application of a splint caused significant increase in pain or loss of sensation and pulses) . b. In the case of worsening condition, documentation of the procedure complications may also be appropriate . c. NOTE: Just because a patient got worse, doesn't necessarily mean the provider performed the procedure incorrectly . NEMSIS Data Standards and Limitations 1. NEMSIS is a national dataset and standard used by all EMS softw are systems. Currently there are three versions of the data standard available for documentation and in which data is stored: a. NEMSIS V ersion 2.2.1 (v2.2.1) i. Adopted in 2006 , there have been no changes since release ii. Most states or systems have used this standard since its release, and the majority of most states' data available since approximately 2016 is in this format . iii. NEMSIS accepted v2.2.1 data through 12/31/2016 , and s ome states may continue to collect data in th is standard until they transition to NEMSIS v3 standards . b. NEMSIS V ersion 3 (v3) i. NEMSIS v3 was created and finalized in 2011 to replace v2.2.1 in order to allow the dataset to become more flexible for updates and adopt technical standards making linkage to other health records possible . a. NEMSIS v3.3.4 was released in March 2014 and was the first version in production where live data was collected by services and states and subsequently submitted to NEMSIS . NEMSIS will continue to . b. NEMSIS v3.4, released in March 2015 , included both changed elements and many added values to existing elements. NEMSIS has been accepting data from this version concurrently with V3.3.4 data. As of 01/01/2018, v3.4 will be the only standard and V3.3.4 will be phased out. All documentation guidelines found in this document are based on the NEMSIS v3.4 dataset and standard. Upda ted January 5, 201 9 338 2. Mandatory and Required Elements b. Mandatory: NEMSIS makes certain elements or fields mandatory so, if not included, the record cannot be properly stored or moved electronically. These fields require real data and do not accept Nil (Blank) values, Not Values , or Pertinent Negatives. c. Required: NEMSIS requires these elements or fields to be completed or the record cannot be properly stored or moved electronically. However, required fields allow Nil (blank) values, Not Values , or Pertinent Negatives to be entered and submitted. d. State and local systems may have Mandatory or Required fields that are not Mandatory or Required by NEMSIS. The manager for these systems should be contacted for a list of these fields. 3. Not Values, Nil , and Pertinent Negatives b. Not Values (NV), Nil , and Pertinent Negatives (PN) are values that are attributes of certain NEMSIS eleme nts designed to clarify a null data entry or qualify d ata entry into the element with which the NV, Nil , or PN is associated. c. Not Values available are \"Not Applicable \" and \"Not Recorded \" i. Some NEMSIS rules require one of these values to be entered when data is imported/exported if there is no other data in a field ( e.g. at least one medications given must have a value , if no medications are given, then the software system must insert \"Not Applicable\" in the medications field when exporting) ii. At times the EMS provider use of \"Not Applicable\" is appropriate documentation (e.g. using \" Not Applicable\" under eInjury.03 - Trauma Center Criteria , which combines step 1 and 2 of CDC 's Guidelines for Field Triage of Injured Patients , when transporting a patient with a s imple sprained ankle ) d. Nil Values are blank values i. Values can be left blank , which can either be an accidental or purposeful omission of data. ii. Value fields can appropriately and purposefully be left blank if there was nothing to enter ( e.g. a procedure field left blank if no p atient was encountered). e. Pertinent Negatives are attributes or qualifiers for both elements and fields. There are 11 possible Pertinent Negative values and the available list for each field varies as appropriate to the field. Two e xamples of the use of Pertinent Negatives are: i. Documenting non -administration of aspirin for chest pain by the EMS provider with the Pertinent Negative of \"Medication Already Taken\" to show evidence that thi s treatment requirement was met. ii. Documenting asse ssment of, and lack of a gunshot wound to the chest with the qualifier of \"Chest --> gunshot wound --> Exam Finding Not Present\" in the examination section (previously you could only document a positive finding of a gunshot wound with was no way to documen t that you looked and did not find one). 4. NEMSIS Element and Value Name Formats b. NEMSIS Elements/Fields are organized into groups with other related elements/fields i. There are two parent datasets: Demographic (designated by a \"d\") and EMS (designated by an \"e\"). The majority of the documentation in any ePCR falls in the \"e\" section. The Demographic dataset is intended to be descriptive of the EMS agencies and system ch aracteristics for correlation at a larger research level, rather than for use in operational CPI reviews. Upda ted January 5, 201 9 339 ii. The element numbering structure reflects the dataset and the text group name of the element 5. Example : \"eVitals.06 - SBP (Systolic Blood Pressure)\" wh ere \"e\" is the EMS dataset and \"Vitals\" is the dataset grouping for all elements related to Vitals and the number is the number assigned to a specific element. b. \"eVitals.06\" is used to store the data in the background and \"SBP (Systolic Blood Pressure)\" is what providers and reviewers see. c. Values are designated by a code and text name. i. The codes are generally derived from various sources such as ICD -10, SNOMED , or RxNorm and are used to store and move the data in the system's background . ii. Codes are not se en by the EMS provider in the ePCR , but rather the provider will see text names. Some software systems allow the visible text name to be modified or relabeled to meet local standards or nomenclature ; This feature can help improve data quality by making doc umentation easier for the provider . iii. An example of a value code and name for cardiac chest pain , found under the element \"eProtocols.01 - Protocols Used\" is \"9914117 - Medical -Cardiac Chest Pain\" . d. All minimum g eneral documentation g uideline requirements are identified using the NEMSIS element , values codes , and names to allow application across a variety of ePCR software labels for these fields . 6. Custom Elements/Fields and Values b. The NEMSIS Standard provides a data format for software vendors to create custom elements or values reque sted by states or local systems. c. States or local systems may create new elements or value extensions for existing NEMSIS elements to meet regional needs (e.g. adding additional protocol name values not on the NEMSIS list ). Airway C onfirmation Fields Specific use of the NEMSIS airway confirmation fields in documentation will not be detailed at this time due to current operational and technical challenges all states, local systems , and ePCR software vendors are experiencing . The NEMSIS airway confirmation fields were closely modeled on the \" Recommended Guidelines for Uniform Reporting of Data from Out -of-Hospital Airway Management: Position Statement of the National Association of EMS Physicians \" and the fields and values could pr ovide excellent and appropriately useful data to evaluate airway management. However, the technical structure of the fields has made their practical use limited as all the data is collected as a separate, self - contained group, rather than as part of the pr ocedures group. This means EMS providers would need to enter much of the same information twice in the ePCR, in both the procedures area and airway confirmation section (when, who did it, what device was used, and complications). Furthermore, the airway g roup can only be entered once per ePRC , so the fields cannot be used again if more than one airway was required ( e.g. one airway became ineffective and needed to be replaced with a different type of airway). Many states and ePCR software vendors have been struggling with how to make these fields functional for use by only using a portion of them or Upda ted January 5, 201 9 340 looking to add mirrored custom values that are directly linked to procedures performed. However, solutions are currently far from practical, functional, effectiv e, or uniform in how they are being implemented or used across various systems. References 1.

Medications The projec t team considered the use of Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) Tall Man Letters methodology to avoid the miscommunication of lookalike drug names. Upon review of the list and the limited number of medications carried by EMS, as well as the exp ected use of this document, it was elected not to institute this measure into our medication list. We recommend EMS agencies consider incorporating these measures into practice where appropriate.

For pediatric patients, a weight -based assessment tool (length -based tape or other system) should be used to provide a more accurate estimate of the patient's weight. Likewise, the total body surface area (BSA) estimates are different for pediatric patients compared to adults due to larger head and trunk size. For children, the palmar surface of the hand (not including the fingers is approximately equal to 1% BSA.

Evidence -Based Guidelines: GRADE Methodology An Overview of GRADE Methodology Although engagement in quality EMS research has increased significantly, the demand for evidence - based quality prehospital research continues to exceed its availability. The need for evidence -based prehospital patient care protocols was clearly recognized by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies and clearly stated in 2007 in The Future of Emergency Care: Emergency Medical Services at the Crossroads. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology is a transparent process where the available research is reviewed and assessed by a panel of subject matter experts. Following this thorough review process, the available research is reviewed and graded for its validity based upon the assessment of the workgroup, and an evidence - based guideline (EBG) is developed based upon the outco me of the workgroup. The Federal Interagency Committee on Emergency Medical Services (FICEMS) and the National EMS Advisory Council (NEMSAC) approved a National Prehospital Evidence -based Guideline Model Process for the development, implementation, and e valuation of evidence -based guidelines. This Model Process recommends the use of the GRADE methodology for the guideline development tool. The six process steps of the GRADE EBG development tool are: Assemble the expert panel and provide GRADE training Define the EBG content area and establish the specific clinical questions to address in patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) format Prioritize outcomes to facilitate systematic literature searches Create GRADE tables (or evidence profiles) f or each PICO question Vet and endorse GRADE evidence tables and draft recommendations Synthesize recommendations into an EMS protocol and visual algorithm The current evidence -based guidelines cited in this document were created for and released by NHTSA; however, the GRADE methodology is not proprietary to NHTSA or any other organization. Local, regional, and state EMS agencies and EMS systems are encouraged to support the ongoing need for quality prehospital care, improved patient outcome, and the growin g demand for EBGs for EMS.
