DESIGN: A retrospective study from December 11, 2020, to May 9, 2022, using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS). PARTICIPANTS: Patients diagnosed with VAU following administration of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), and Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen) vaccine, worldwide. METHODS: A descriptive analysis of the demographics, clinical history and presentation was performed. We evaluated the correlation between the three vaccines and continuous and categorical variables. A post-hoc analysis was performed between uveitis onset-interval after vaccination, and age, dose, and vaccine type. Finally, a 30-day risk analysis for VAU onset post-vaccination was performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The estimated global crude reporting rate, observed to expected ratio of VAU in the United States, associated ocular and systemic presentations, and onset duration. RESULTS: A total of 1094 cases of VAU were reported from 40 countries with an estimated crude reporting rate (per million doses) of 0.57, 0.44, and 0.35 for BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and Ad26.COV2.S, respectively. The observed to expected ratio of VAU for the cases reports from the United States was comparable for BNT162b2 (0.023), mRNA-1273 (0.025), and Ad26.COV2.S (0.027). Most cases of were reported in patients who received BNT162b2 (n=853, 77.97%). The mean age of patients with VAU was 46.24\u00b116.93 years, and 68.65% (n=751) were women. Most cases were reported after the first dose (n=452, 41.32%) and within the first week (n=591, 54.02%) of the vaccination. The onset interval for VAU was significantly longer in patients who received mRNA-1273 (21.22\u00b1 42.74 days) (p<0.0001). The post-hoc analysis revealed a significantly shorter interval of onset for the BNT162b2 compared to the mRNA 1273 vaccine (p<0.0001) and the first dose compared to the second dose (p=0.0021). The 30-day risk analysis showed a significant difference between the three vaccines (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The low crude reporting rate and observed-expected ratio suggests a low safety concern for VAU. This study provides insights into possible temporal association between reported VAU events and SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, however further investigations are required to delineate the associated immunological "}
