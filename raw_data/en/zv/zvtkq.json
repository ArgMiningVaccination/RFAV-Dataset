Unless you're a hot yoga regular or frequent the sauna at your [local spa](https://www.elle.com/beauty/g40920906/best-spas-to-visit/), chances are you aren't reaping the daily wellness benefits that come with a heat-induced sweat session. However, that's where sauna blankets come in. While these sleeping bag-like devices don't involve you sitting in a toasty wood-paneled room, they'll allow you to have a similar therapeutic experience from the comfort of your own home. \"Infrared technology mimics the power of the sun and stimulates healing on a cellular level,\" explains [HigherDOSE](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525074&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhigherdose.com%2F) co-founders Lauren Berlingeri and Katie Kaps. \"An infrared sauna blanket uses infrared rays to heat the blanket directly-versus how traditional steam saunas heat the air-and penetrate deep below the skin to raise our core temperatures, which helps with detoxification, relaxation, burning calories, pain relief, rapid post-workout recovery, anti-aging, improved circulation, and more.\" Our top picks for the best infrared sauna blankets in 2023 Some sauna blankets do emit [Electric and Magnetic Fields (EMFs)](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/emf/index.cfm), or what we know as radiation, but typically in low levels that aren't believed to be harmful. Still, if you're concerned about exposure, there are plenty of devices that \"have low EMF or zero EMFs to minimize exposure,\" adds longevity and regenerative medicine doctor Neil Paulvin. Ahead, I consulted Dr. Paulvin, scoured customer reviews, and tested a handful of infrared sauna blankets to bring you the very best ones on the market. I also spoke with Berlingeri and Kaps, New York-based dermatologist Dr. Joshua Zeichner, and Canyon Ranch Spa Director Sam Cooper to answer all your pressing questions about sauna blankets and how to find the right one for you. What are the benefits of a sauna blanket? \"Sauna blankets essentially create a cozy space to sweat it out,\" explains Canyon Ranch Spa Director Sam Cooper. \"Not only will your skin glow and your body relax, but the infrared sauna blanket will boost circulation and aid in muscle recovery post-workout, soothing sore muscles and reducing inflammation.\" She recommends taking a cold shower after each session to combine the benefits of hot and cold therapies. Are infrared sauna blankets safe? \"Infrared saunas are completely safe to use,\" says Dr. Paulvin. In fact, [many studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4935255/) on infrared blankets have found them to have no adverse health effects. A few things to keep in mind, however: \"Patients with nerve or heart issues should discuss with their doctor before use,\" advises Dr. Paulvin. He adds that pregnant women should avoid using sauna blankets altogether as they can heat the body to high temperatures. Additionally, sauna blankets can exacerbate skin conditions such as rosacea and melasma, notes dermatologist Dr. Joshua Zeichner. So, if you struggle with either of these skin concerns, you may want to steer clear. What to look for when choosing an infrared sauna blanket Look for a style that fits your specific needs, says Dr. Paulvin. \"Take into consideration the area you want to target and choose size accordingly,\" he notes. \"What's more, every blanket contains different materials, so you may want to avoid certain materials that could irritate your skin type.\" Some top-of-the-line options come with special features like a wide temperature range and personalized controls, but if you don't need any extra bells and whistles, you can also opt for a more affordable, basic style. How often can you use an infrared sauna blanket? In general, three to five times a week is recommended, but there are some people who prefer to use a sauna blanket daily. If you fall into the latter bucket, it's crucial that you're getting enough water to compensate for excessive sweating. As with all things, using a sauna blanket in moderation is best. What's the best way to clean an infrared sauna blanket? \"We suggest keeping a dry towel handy to absorb any sweat left behind after each session,\" say Lauren Berlingeri and Katie Kaps, the co-founders of HigherDOSE. After wiping down your blanket, use a nontoxic disinfectant wipe or spray to sanitize. \"Leave the blanket open to dry and cool down completely before folding and packing away,\" they add. What should I wear in an infrared sauna blanket? \"We recommend wearing long sleeves, long pants, and socks while in the blanket, as well as lining the blanket with a thick towel,\" says Berlingeri and Kaps. \"This will absorb any sweat released during your session and provide comfort while lying on top of the heat source.\" Some blankets may come with a removable or disposable lining, but you can also purchase a sauna blanket insert such as the one HigherDose has.
