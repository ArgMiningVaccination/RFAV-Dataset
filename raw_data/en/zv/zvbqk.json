Together. In the midst of challenging times & lots of unrest in our world, it is crucial to maintain our self-care and be committed to our practices to find our center. Caring for our own needs is essential if we want to extend our energy to creating a better future for the future generations.

So imagine the power of people coming together just to take care of themselves. The energy is powerful and will have ripples that extend far beyond each treatment. What will we do? For 5 sessions, you will relax in reclining zero gravity chairs while receiving a restorative and mind-body calming acupuncture treatment. Then, Trish or Michael will guide the group into meditation for deep rest and relaxation. In addition to the acupuncture and meditation, you will also receive a 30 minute individual wellness consultation with either Trish or Michael, discussing your goals for treatment and possible individualized suggestions for your health and well-being. AND you will get access to The Well Space membership for 60 days which includes 2 weekly live guided meditations, access to online recordings of meditation with Trish & Michael, a community to connect with, and monthly meditation and conversation sessions on the practice of mindfulness, spirituality and more. \"This practice is a fantastic combination of knowledge and compassion.
