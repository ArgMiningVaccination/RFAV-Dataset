There are various steps a person can take to stay healthy with a weak immune system. Examples include practicing good hygiene, managing stress, eating a healthful diet, and more. The immune system protects the body from infection. A person with a weak immune system may be more prone to frequent infections. White blood cells, antibodies, and other components, including organs and lymph nodes, make up the body's immune system. Many disorders can weaken the immune system and cause a person to become immunocompromised. These disorders can range from mild to severe. Some are present from birth, while others result from environmental factors. They include: [HIV](/articles/17131.php) - certain types of [cancer](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/info/cancer-oncology/) [malnutrition](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/179316.php) - viral [hepatitis](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/145869.php) - some medical treatments People with a weak immune system have a higher risk of experiencing frequent infections and severe symptoms. They may be more prone to pneumonia and other conditions. Bacteria and viruses, [including the virus](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41418-020-0530-3) In this article, we look at the signs and symptoms of a weak immune system and offer some tips that can help a person stay healthy. The primary symptom of a weakened immune system is susceptibility to infection. A person with a weakened immune system is likely to get infections more frequently than most other people, and these illnesses might be more severe or harder to treat. These individuals may also find themselves dealing with an infection that a person with a stronger immune system would not get. Infections that people with a weak immune system often get include: [pneumonia](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/151632.php) [meningitis](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/9276.php) [bronchitis](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/8888.php) - skin infections These infections may recur with a high frequency. People with a weak immune system may also be more likely to experience: - autoimmune disorders [inflammation](/articles/248423.php)of the internal organs - blood disorders or abnormalities, such as [anemia](/articles/158800.php) - digestive issues, including loss of appetite, [diarrhea](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/158634.php), and abdominal cramping - growth and developmental delays, in infants and children A doctor can do a [baseline blood test](https://primaryimmune.org/about-primary-immunodeficiencies-diagnosis-information/laboratory-tests) to identify whether a person has a weak immune system. The test will show whether a person has antibodies in the normal range. People who have a weak immune system can take several steps to maximize their chances of staying healthy and avoiding infections. Good hygiene One of the easiest ways for a person with a weak immune system to stay healthy is by practicing good hygiene, which includes washing the hands frequently. The [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/features/handwashing/index.html) - before, during, and after preparing meals and snacks - before eating - after blowing the nose, sneezing, or coughing - before and after treating a cut or another open skin wound - after having contact with someone who is unwell - after using or helping a child use the bathroom - after changing a diaper - after touching an animal or animal food or waste - after touching garbage Proper hand washing significantly reduces illnesses. According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/why-handwashing.html) The CDC also state that hand washing with soap and water can help protect children and minimize the number of deaths from pneumonia and diarrheal disease in those under the age of 5 years. Avoid people who are sick People with a weak immune system should avoid being too near to anyone who has a cold or another infection. Viruses and other infectious illnesses can spread from person to person through close contact. They can also spread in the water droplets that a person expels into the air when they cough or sneeze. It is not always possible to avoid people who are ill. However, a person with a weak immune system should always avoid close contact, such as hugging or kissing, with the unwell person until the illness resolves. They should also avoid sharing food and beverages with the person. Self-isolate during the COVID-19 pandemic People with a weakened immune system have a higher risk of developing severe symptoms of [COVID-19](/articles/covid-19) after exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/what-you-can-do.html) - stay at home if possible during the pandemic - wash their hands frequently - try to keep 6 feet away from other people - clean and disinfect surfaces often - seek medical help if health issues arise - stay in touch with family, caregivers, and others who can help deliver necessary items and take action if the person gets sick Click [here](/articles/coronavirus-transmission) to learn how the new coronavirus spreads. Disinfect household objects Germs that have the potential to cause illnesses can live on some surfaces and items in the home, such as doorknobs and remote controls. A person can reduce the number of germs that inhabit these areas and objects by disinfecting them regularly. Follow a doctor's advice on vaccines Doctors generally recommend that most people stay up to date with their vaccines. However, they may advise a person with a weak or compromised immune system to delay or not receive certain shots. If a short-term illness or a medication is responsible for the weak immune system, the person may be able to have the vaccine once the illness has resolved or they have stopped the treatment. Examples of vaccines that doctors may recommend delaying or avoiding include: - MMR vaccine against [measles](/articles/37135.php), mumps, and rubella - live [flu](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/15107.php)vaccine - MMRV vaccine, combines the MMR vaccine with a varicella-zoster ( [chickenpox](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/239450.php)) vaccine [rabies](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/181980.php)vaccine The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/parents-adults/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fschedules%2Feasy-to-read%2Findex.html) Manage stress [Stress](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/145855.php) can weaken the immune system further and make a person more susceptible to illness. Some [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4465119/) People with a weak immune system should take steps to manage their stress. Practices that may reduce and manage stress include: [yoga](/articles/286745.php) - meditation - massage - spending time pursuing hobbies - staying in touch with friends, relatives, and others who can offer support Get enough sleep According to [research](https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/35/7/933/2558879), sleep deprivation has a similar effect on the body's immune system as stress. Lack of sleep disrupts the normal production of white blood cells, a crucial component of the body's immune system. According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about_sleep/how_much_sleep.html) Eat a healthful diet A person with a weak immune system should eat a healthful diet. Eating a healthful, balanced diet can improve a person's overall well-being. For people with a weak immune system, doctors generally recommend a diet that is rich in vegetables and fruit, which will provide plenty of nutrients. If a person is very immunocompromised, for example, because they are undergoing cancer treatment, a doctor may recommend that they take extra steps to avoid foodborne illnesses. These may include: - washing all fruits and vegetables before peeling them - avoiding undercooked meats, fish, and eggs - refrigerating food promptly - choosing pasteurized juices and dairy products over unpasteurized products Exercise regularly Regular exercise keeps the body healthy. In addition to strengthening the body, exercise causes it to release endorphins that reduce stress levels. However, those with a weak immune system should be careful not to push themselves too hard, as this can weaken the immune system further. Therefore, people with a weak immune system may wish to avoid exercising: - at too high an intensity - too frequently - for extended periods without stopping to rest However, regular, low intensity exercise is likely to be beneficial. Consider taking supplements Some [vitamins](/articles/195878.php) and minerals affect the immune system. For example, a person who has a vitamin C deficiency can have weakened immunity. Other vitamins and minerals that can affect immune function include: - vitamin A [vitamin D](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/161618.php) - vitamin E - iron [folic acid](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/219853.php) - zinc It is worth noting that while certain nutrients are essential for supporting the immune system, they will not cure or prevent any disease. It is best to get nutrients from dietary sources where possible, but if this proves challenging, supplements may help with immunity. Many different supplements, including multivitamins, are available to purchase in health stores or [online](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=multivitamin+tablets&tag=healthline-subtag-20&ascsubtag=null&correlationId=null). The immune system is a complex system of blood cells and organs, and it protects the body from harmful germs that can cause illness. If a person finds that they are frequently getting infections, they might have a weak immune system. A person with a weak immune system can take some steps at home to keep themselves healthy and maximize their immune function. "}
