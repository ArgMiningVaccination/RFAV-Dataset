The Medicare baseline spending for Parts A/B services are a blend of the Medicare Fee For Service (FFS) standardized county rates and the Medicare Advantage projected payment rates for each year, weighted by the proportion of the Enrolled population in each program prior to the Demonstration. The FFS county rates wi ll generally reflect amounts published with the annual Medicare Advantage Final Rate Announcement, adjusted to fully incorporate more current hospital wage index and physician geographic practice cost index information; in this Demonstration, this adjustment was fully applied to the FFS county rates in 2013 and 2014, but the adjustment will otherwise use the same methodologies and timelines used to make the analogous adjustments in Medicare Advantage. 203 CMS may also further adjust the Medicare FFS standardized county rates as necessary to calculate accurate payment rates for the Demonstration. To the extent that the published FFS county rates do not conform with current law in effect for Medicare during an applicable payment month, and to the extent that such nonconformance would have a significant fiscal impact on the Demonstration, CMS will update the baseline (and therefore the corresponding payment rate) to calculate and apply an accurate payment rate for such month. Such update may take place retroactively, as needed. 4.3.2.2. Separate baselines will exist for Enrollees meeting the Medicare ESRD criteria. For Enrollees with ESRD in the dialysis or transplant status phases, the Medicare Parts A/B baseline will be the ESRD dialysis State rate published with the annual Medicare Advantage Final Rate Annou ncement, minus deductions for kidney acquisition costs (as of CY2021), IME, and user fees . For E nrollees in the functioning graft status phase, for CY 2015 and future years the Medicare Parts A/B baseline will be the Medicare Advantage 3.5 % bonus county rate (benchmark), published with the annual Medicare Advantage Final Rate Announcement, for the applicable county (for CY 2013 and CY 2014 the baseline was the 3 -star county rate) . 4.3.2.3. Both baseline spending and payment rates under the Demonstration for Medicare Parts A/B services will be calculated as per member per month (PMPM) standardized amounts for each county participating in the Demonstration for each year. Enrollee risk scores will be applied to the standardized rates at the time of payment. 4.3.2.4. The Medicare A/B Component will be updated annually consistent with annual Fee- for-Service (FFS) estimates and Medicare Advantage rates released each year with the annual rate announcement. 4.3.2.5. If an Enrollee elects to receive the Medic are hospice benefit, the Enrollee may remain in the One Care Plan, but will obtain the hospice service through the Medicare FFS benefit and the One Care Plan would no longer receive the Medicare Parts A/B Component for that Enrollee as described in this section. Medicare hospice services and hospice drugs and all other Original Medicare services would be paid for under Medicare FFS . One Care Plans and providers of hospice services would be required to coordinate these services with the rest of the Enrollee' s care. One Care Plans would continue to receive the Medicare Part D Component for all non- hospice covered drugs. Election of hospice services does not change the MassHealth Component. 204 4.3.3. Medicare Part D 4.3.3.1. The Medicare Part D Component is comprised of the Part D direct subsidy set at the Part D national average monthly bid amount (NAMBA) for the calendar year, as well as CMS -estimated average monthly prospective payment amount for the low income cost- sharing subsidy and Federal reinsurance amounts . The low incom e cost -sharing subsidy and Federal reinsurance amounts will be reconciled after the end of each payment year in the same manner as for all Part D sponsors. 4.3.3.2. The monthly Medicare Part D Component for an Enrollee can be calculated by multiply ing the Part D NAMBA by the RxHCC risk score assigned to the individual, and then adding to this the estimated average monthly prospective payment amount for the low income cost -sharing subsidy and Federal reinsurance amounts. 4.3.4. Aggregate Savings Percentages 4.3.4.1. Aggregate savings percentages will be applied equally, unless otherwise specified, as follows, to the baseline spending amounts for the Medicare Parts A/B Component and the MassHealth Component of the capitated rate, provided that such savings percentages may be adjusted in accordance with S ection 4.3. 4.4. 4.3.4.1.1. Demonstration Year 1, as divided into the following two (2) time periods : 4.3.4.1.1.1. First six (6) months following the first Effective Enrollment Date : 0% 4.3.4.1.1.2. After the first six (6) months following the first Effectiv e Enrollment Date through December 31, 2014: 1% 4.3.4.1.2. Demonstration Year 2: 0% 4.3.4.1.3. 0% 4.3.4.1.4. Demonstration Year 4: Demonstration Year 7: 0.50% , unless a Commonwealth of Massachusetts state of emergency related to COVID -19 is in effect on or after May 15, 2020, including but not limited to the Commonwealth state of emergency declared via Executive 205 Order No. 591. If such a Commonwealth state of emergency is in effect at any point during the period from May 15, 2020 through December 31, 2020, EOHHS may retroactively revise the savings percentage for the MassHealth Component of the capitated rate for the entirety of Demonstration Year 7 to a percentage not to exceed 0.50%. 4.3.4.1.8. Demonstration Year 8: 0.75% for the Medicare A/B Component of the capitated rate, and 0.50% for the MassHealth Component, unless a Commonwealth of Massachusetts state of emergency related to COVID -19 is in effect on or after September 1, 2020, including but not limited to the Co mmonwealth state of emergency declared via Executive Order No. 591. If such a Commonwealth state of emergency is in effect at any point during the period from September 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, the Demonstration Year 8 savings perentage for both the Medicare A/B Component and the MassHealth Component of the capitated rate will be 0.50%. 4.3.4.1.9. Demonstration Year 9: 0.75% for the Medicare A/B Component of the capitated rate, and 0.50% for the MassHealth Component, unless a Commonwealth of Massachusetts st ate of emergency rela ted to COVID -19 is in effect on or after September 1, 2021, including but not limited to the Commonwealth state of emergency declared via Executive Order No. 591. If such a Commonwealth state of emergency is i n effect at any point during the period from September 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021, the Demonstration Year 9 savings percentage for both the Medicare A/B Component and the MassHealth Component of the capitated rate will be 0.50%. 4.3.4.1.10. Demonstration Year 10: 1.0%, unless a Commonwealth of Massachusetts state of emergency rela ted to COVID -19 is in effect on or after January 1, 202 3. If such a Commonwealth state of emergency is in effect at any point during the period from January 1, 2023 through December 31, 202 3, the Demonstration Y ear 10 savings percentage will be 0. 75%. 4.3.4.2. Except as otherwise specified, including in Section 4.4.4.1.2 rate updates will take place on January 1st of each calendar year. 4.3.4.3. Savings percentages will not be applied to the Part D Component. CMS will monitor Part D costs on an ongoing basis. Any material change in Part D costs relative to the baseline may be factored into future year savings percentages. 206 4.3.4.4. EOHHS may submit for CMS approval a methodology whereby the savings percentages applied to the MassHealth Compo nent may vary by R ating Category , but will in the aggregate reflect the savings percentages specified in Section 4.3.4. If implemented, this methodology will take effect no sooner than calendar year 201 8. 4.3.5. Risk Adjustment Methodology 4.3.5.1. Medicare Parts A/B: The Medicare Parts A/B Component will be risk adjusted based on the risk profile of each Enrollee. Except as specified in S ection 4.3.5.1.1, the existing Medicare Advantage CMS -HCC and CMS -HCC ESRD risk adjustment methodology will be used for the Demonstration. 4.3.5.1.1. Coding Intensity Adjustment Factor 4.3.5.1.1.1. CMS will calculate calendar year 2013 rates as if the coding intensity adjustment factor were not applied, to reflect the fact that virtually all Enrollees were receiving care in FFS Medicare and thus there should be n o coding pattern differences for which to adjust. Operationally CMS will still apply the coding intensity adjustment factor to the risk scores but will increase the Medicare A/B baseline for non- ESRD beneficiaries and beneficiaries with an ESRD status of functioning graft, to offset this . 4.3.5.1.1.2. In calendar year 2014, CMS will calculate and apply a coding intensity adjustment reflective of all Demonstration Enrollees except as indicated in Section 4.3.5.1.1. 7. This will apply the prevailing Medicare Advantage coding intensity adjustment proportional to the anticipated proportion of Demonstration Enrollees in 2014 with Medicare Advantage experience in 2013, prior to the Demonstration. 4.3.5.1.1.3. In calendar year 2015, CMS will calculate and apply a coding intensity adjustment reflective of all Demonstration Enrollees except as indicated in Section 4.3.5.1.1. 7. This will apply the prevailing Medicare Advantage coding intensity adjustment proportional to the anticipated proportion of Demonstration Enrollees in CY 2015 with prior Medicare Advantage experience and/or Demonstration experience based on the Demonstration's enrollment phase- in as of September 30, 2014. 207 4.3.5.1.1.4. After calendar year 2015 , CMS will apply the prevailing Medicare Advantage coding intensity adjustment to all One Care Enrollees , except as indicated in Section 4.3.5.1.1.5 through Section 4.3.5.1.1.7 . 4.3.5.1.1.5. In calendar year 2022, if the anticipated member months associated with new enrollments into the Contractor's One Care Plan from Medicare FFS effective January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022 in aggregate represent fifty percent (50%) or more of the total anticipated Enrollee member months in the Contractor's One Care Plan during 2022, CMS will calculate and apply the prevailing coding intensity adjustment proportional to the anticipated proportion of Enrollee member months in the Contractor's One Care Plan during 2022 with Medicare Advantage or One Care experience in 2021, except as indicated in Section 4.3.5.1.1.7 . 4.3.5.1.1.6. In calendar year 2023, if the anticipated member months associated with new enrollments into the Contractor's One Care Plan from Medicare FFS effective January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023 in aggregate represent fifty percent (50%) or more of the total anticipated Enrollee member months in the Contractor's One Care Plan during 2023, CMS will calculate and apply the prevailing coding intensity adjustment proportional to the anticipated proportion of One Care Enrollee member months in the Contractor's One C are Plan during 2023 with Medicare Advantage or One Care experience in 2022, except as indicated in Section 4.3.5.1.1.7 . 4.3.5.1.1.7. The coding intensity adjustment factor will not be applied during the Demonstration to risk scores for Enrollees with an ESRD status of dialysis or transplant, consistent with Medicare Advantage policy. 4.3.5.2. Medicare Part D: The Medicare Part D NAMBA will be risk adjusted in accordance with existing Part D RxHCC methodology. The estimated average monthly prospective payment amount for the low income cost -sharing subsidy and Federal reinsurance amounts will not be risk adjusted. 4.3.5.3. Medicaid: For the M assHealth Component of the capitated rate, EOHHS will rely on Rating Categories described in Section 4.2.1 and in Demonstration Years 2 and 3 may use High -Cost Risk Pools 208 (HCRPs) for certain R ating Categories, described in S ection 4.3.6, to account for differences in risk among the eligible population. 4.3.6. High -Cost Risk Pools 4.3.6.1. In Demonstration Years 2 and 3, EOHHS may establish High -Cost Risk Pools (HCRPs) to account for enrollment of high-cost beneficiaries, defined based on spending for select M assHealth LTSS and services above a defined threshold within M assHealth Rating Categories across One Care Plans. For each R ating Category with an HCRP, a portion of the base M assHealth Component will be withheld from all One Care Plans into a risk pool. The risk pool will be divided across One Care Plans based on their percent of the total costs above the per Enrollee threshold amount associated with the high- cost beneficiaries. Any sums withheld for a HCRP during Demonstration Year s 1 and 2 will be refunded to the Contractor by approximately J une 30, 2015. 4.3.6.2. Applicable M assHealth Rating Categories: 4.3.6.2.1. Facility -based Care (F1) 4.3.6.2.2. Community Tier 3 - High Community Need (C3) 4.3.6.3. HCRPs will be utilized until additional long -term care risk adjustment methodology is in place. 4.3.6.4. Details 4.3.6.4.1. The lesser of 1) the total amount withheld into the pool, and 2) the total costs that are above the per Enrollee threshold will be distributed among One Care Plans in proportion to the amount of total costs above the per Enrollee threshold that are attribu ted to each One Care Plan for their high cost Enrollees. 4.3.6.4.2. Any amounts remaining in the pool (in the case where the pool exceeds total costs over the per Enrollee threshold) will be distributed among One Care Plans in proportion to their contribution to the pool. 4.3.6.5. The per Enrollee threshold and the withhold amounts will be established annually. For CY 2013, thresholds will be established on an average PMPM basis due to the enrollment phase- in that will occur during the initial months of the Demonstration. Thresholds for subsequent years will be based on annual expenses. 4.3.6.5.1. HCRP reconciliation will occur annually based on nine ( 9) months of claims run- out after the end of each calendar year 209 4.3.6.5.2. Applicable costs: 4.3.6.5.2.1. Cost must be for Covered Services incurred while Enrollee is in the Rating Category applicable to the pool. 4.3.6.5.2.2. Applicable costs include Personal Assistance Services (including administrative costs paid to Fiscal Intermediaries for Self-directed PCA), Personal Care Management Services, Day Habilitation services, Adult Day Health, Adult Foster Care, Group Adult Foster Care, Diversionary Behavioral Health Services, new Community -based Services, LTS coordination activities, Dental care, and facility care beyond skilled care days that would be covered by Medicare in FFS. Applicable costs must be net of Enrollee contributions to care. 4.3.6.5.2.3. LTS Coordinator expenses will be priced based on utilization using a standardized unit cost determined by EOHHS. 4.3.6.5.2.4. The Contractor must submit all claims for Enrollees with total costs exceeding the per Enrollee threshold within three hundred ( 300) days following the end of the calendar year. 4.3.6.5.2.5. The EOHHS and the Contractor agree that to the extent there are differences between expenditures as reflected in the encounter, cost, financial reporting or other data submitted by the Contractor, the EOHHS and the Contractor will confer and make a good faith effort to reconcile those differences before the reconciliation of the HCRPs. 4.3.6.6. The review procedures may include an audit, to be performed by the EOHHS, or its authorized agents, to verify that all paid claims for Enrollees by the Contractor are for Covered Services and/or that provider reimbursement is not excessive. EOHHS and CMS reserve the right to adjust expenditures for services that are reimbursed at more than five ( 5%) percent above the average reimbursement rate of all One Care Plans. Notwithstanding any contractual provision or legal right to the contrary, the One Care Plan agrees that there shall be no redress against CMS or EOHHS for failure to adjust expenditures for services of any One Care Plan. 4.4. Payment Terms 4.4.1. CMS and EOHHS will each make monthly, prospective capitation payments to the Contractor. The EOHHS will categorize Enrollees by 210 Rating Category according to the process outlined in Section 4.2.1 . The MassHealth Component for each R ating Category will be the product of the number of Enrollees in each category multiplied by the payment rate for that R ating Category . The Medicare Parts A/B Component will be the product of the Enrollee's CMS -HCC risk score multiplied by the relevant standard county payment rate (or the ESRD dialysis State rate by the HCC ESRD risk score, as applicable). The Medicare Part D Component will be the product of the Enrollee's RxHCC risk score multiplied by the Part D NAMBA, with the addition of the estimated average monthly prospective payment amount for the low income cost -sharing subsidy and Federal reinsurance amounts. Enrollee contribution to care amounts will be deducted from the MassHealth Component of the monthly capitation payment amount, in accordance with S ection 4.4.3. 4.4.2. of Capitation Payments 4.4.2.1. Enrollments . CMS and EOHHS will make monthly per member per month capitation payments to the Contractor. The PMPM capitation payment for a particular month will reflect payment for the beneficiaries with effective enrollment into the Contractor's One Care Plan as of the first day of that month, as described in S ection 2.3.1. 4.4.2.2. Disenrollments . The final per member per month capitation payment made by CMS and EOHHS to the Contractor for each Enrollee will be for the month in which the disenrollment was submitted, the Enrollee loses eligibility, or the Enrollee dies (see S ection 2.3 .2). 4.4.3. Enrollee Contribution to Care Amounts 4.4.3.1. If, in the financial eligibility process conducted by EOHHS, an Enrollee residing in a nursing facility is determined to owe a monthly Enrollee- paid amount, such amounts are the Enrollee's contribution to care. At the time of enrollment, and as adjusted thereafter, EOHHS will advise the Contractor of the amount of the Enrollee's contribution to care. When an Enrollee contribution to care is established, MassHealth will subtract that amount from the monthly capitation payment for that Enrollee. The Contractor is responsible for collecting this amount from the Enrollee subject to the Enrollee rights provisions of the Contractor's Evidence of Coverage (see Appendix C ). 4.4.4. Modifications to Capitation Rates 4.4.4.1. CMS and EOHHS will jointly no tify the Contractor in advance and in writing of any proposed changes to the Capitation Rates, and the 211 Contractor shall accept such changes as payment in full as described in Section 4.7 . 4.4.4.1.1. Rates will be updated using a similar process for each calendar year . Subject to Section 4.4.4.1.2, c hanges to the Medicare and MassHealth baselines outside of the annual Medicare Advantage and Part D rate announcements and annual Medicaid rate update will be made only if and when CMS and EOHHS jointly determine the change is necessary to calculate accurate payment rates for the Demonstration. Such changes may be based on the following factors: shifts in enrollment assumptions; major changes or discrepancies in Federal law and/or State policy compared to assumptions about Federal law and/or State law or policy used in the development of baseline estimates; and changes in coding intensity. 4.4.4.1.2. Modifications to Rate Year 2015 MassHealth rates that are published after October 1, 2015 only apply if the Contractor participates in the Demonstration through December 31, 2016. 4.4.4.1.3. For changes solely affecting the Medicare program baseline, CMS will update baselines by amounts identified by the independent Office of the Actuary necessary to best effectuate accurate payment rates for each mont h. 4.4.4.1.4. Subject to Section 4.4.4.1.2 if other statutory changes enacted after the annual baseline determination and rate development process are jointly determined by CMS and EOHHS to have a material change in baseline estimates for any given payment year, baseline estimates and corresponding standardized payment rates shall be updated outside of the annual rate development process. 4.4.4.1.5. Changes to the savings percentages under Section 4.3.4 will be made if and when CMS and EOHHS jointly determine that changes in Par t D spending have resulted in materially higher or lower savings that need to be recouped through higher or lower savings percentages applied to the Medicare A/B baselines. 4.4.5. Quality Withhold Policy for M assHealth and Medicare A/B Components of the Risk -Adju sted Rate 4.4.5.1. Under the Demonstration, both CMS and EOHHS will withhold a percentage of their respective components of the C apitation Rate, with the exception of Part D Component amounts. The withheld 212 amounts will be repaid subject to the Contractor's performance consistent with established quality thresholds. 4.4.5.2. CMS and EOHHS will evaluate the Contractor's performance according to the specified metrics required in order to earn back the quality withhold for a given year . 4.4.5.3. Whether or not the Contractor has met the quality withhold requirements in a given year will be made public. 4.4.5.4. Additional details regarding the quality withholds, including the more detailed specifications, required thresholds and other information regarding the methodology are available in the Medicare- Medicaid Capitated Financial Alignment Model CMS Core Quality Withhold Technical Notes and Massachusetts Quality Withhold Measure Technical Notes . 4.4.5.5. Withhold Measures in Demonstration Year 1 4.4.5.5.1. Figure 4.1 below identifies quality withhold measures for Demonstration Year 1. Together, these will be utilized as the basis for a 1% withhold. 4.4.5.5.2. Because Demonstration Year 1 crosses calendar and Contract years, the Contractor will be evaluated to determine whether it has met required quality withhold requirements at the end of both CY 2013 and CY 2014. The determination in CY 2013 will be based solely on those measures that can appropriately be calculated based on the actual enrollment volume during CY 2013. Consistent with such evaluations, the withheld amounts will be repaid separately for each calendar year.

Withhold Measures in Demonstration Years 2 through 10 4.4.5.6.1. The quality withhold will be 0% in Demonstration Year 2, 1% in Demonstration Year 3, 1.25% in Demonstration Year 4, 1.5% in Demonstration Year 5, 1.75% in Demonstration Years 6 through 8, 2.5% in Demonstration Year 9, and 2.75% in Demonstration Year 10. 4.4.5.6.2. Payment will be based on performance on the quality withhold measures listed in Figure 4.2, below. The Contractor must report these measures according to the prevailing technical specifications for the applicable measurement year. 4.4.5.6.3. If the Contractor is unable to report at least three of the quality withhold measures listed in Figure 4.2 for a given year due to low enrollment or inability to meet other reporting criteria, alternative measures will be used in the quality withhold analysis. Additional information about this policy is available in the Medicare- Medicaid Capitated Financial Alignment Model CMS Core Quality Withhold Technical Notes . 4.4.5.6.4. For Demonstration Years 6, 7, 8, 9, and/or 10, CMS and EOHHS in their sole discretion may provide flexibilities via administrative guidance to the quality withhold measures listed in Figure 4.2 related to COVID -19 impacts.

Indian Enrollees and Indian Health Care Providers 4.4.6.1. All payments to the Contractor are conditioned on compliance with the provisions below and all other applicable provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. See also 42 C.F.R . \u00a7 438.14. 4.4.6.2. The Contractor shall offer Indian Enrollees the option to choose an Indian health care provider as a P CP if the Contractor has an Indian PCP in its network that has capacity to provide such services . The Contractor shall permit Indian Enrollees to obtain Covered Services from out -of-network Indian Health Care Providers from whom the Enrollee is otherwise eligible to receive such services. The Contractor shall also permit an out -of-network Indian Health Care Provider to refer an Indian Enrollee to a Network Provider. 4.4.6.3. The Contractor shall demonstrate that it has sufficient access to Indian Health Care Providers to ensure access to Covered Services for Indian Enrollees; 4.4.6.4. The Contractor shall pay both network and non- network Indian Health Care Providers or I/T/U who provide Covered Services to Indian Enrollees a negotiated rate which shall be no lower than the MassHealth fee- for-service rate for the same service or the applicable encounter rate published annually in the Federal Register by the Indian Health Service, whichever is greater, in the absence of a negotiated rate, an amount not less than the amount that the Contractor would pay for the Covered Service provided by a non-Indian Health Care Provider or I/T/U or the MassHealth fee for service rate for the same service, whichever is greater ; 4.4.6.5. The Contractor shall make prompt payment to Indian Health Care Providers; and 4.4.6.6. The Contractor shall pay non- network Indian Health Care Providers that are FQHCs for the provision of services to an Indian Enrollee at a rate equal to the rate that the Contractor would pay to a network FQHC that is not an Indian Health Care Provider, including any supplemental payment described in 42 C .F.R. \u00a7 438.14(c)(1) . 4.4.6.7. The Contractor shall not impose enrollment fees, premiums, or similar charges on Indians served by an Indian H ealth Care Provider; Indian Health Service; an I/T/U or through referral under contract health services. The Contractor must exempt from all cost sharing any Indian Enrollee who is currently receiving or has ever received an item or service furnished by an I ndian Health Care Provider or through referral under contract health services. 216 4.4.7. Suspension of Payments 4.4.7.1. EOHHS may sus pend payments to the Contractor in accordance with 42 C.F.R. \u00a7455.23 and 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 130 CMR 450, et seq. as determined necessary or appropriate by EOHHS. The Contractor may not contract with, or otherwise pay for any items or services (other than an emergency item or service, not including items or services furnished in an emergency room of a hospital) furnished by an individual or entity to whom the State has failed to suspend payments during any period when there is a pending investigation of a credible allegation of fraud against the individual or entity, unless the S tate determines there is good cause not to suspend such payments. 4.4.8. One-time 72 Hour Medication Supply 4.4.8.1. In accordance with 130 CMR 406.414(c), if a pharmacist cannot bill Contractor at the time an Enrollee presents the pharmacist with a prescription for a MassHealth covered medication and MassHealth pays for a one- time seventy- two (72) hour supply of the presc ribed medications, Contractor shall reimburse MassHealth for such sum , as set forth in Section 2.9.1.1.5. 4.4.9. Federally -Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) 4.4.9.1. Where the Contractor enters into a contract for the provision of services with a FQHC or a rural health clinic (RHC), the Contractor shall provide payment that is not less than the level and amount of payment which the Contractor would make for the services if the services were furnished by a provider which is not a FQHC or RHC. 4.4.10. COVID -19 Vaccination Incentive Payment 4.4.10.1. For Demonstration Year 8, EOHHS shall provide the Contractor with a vaccine incentive payment if, by June 30, 2021, the Contractor ensures that at least eighty (80%) percent of the One Care Plan's eligible Enrollees as specified below are fully vaccinated (i.e. all doses of the recommended regimen for the applicable vaccine are administered). Enrollees in the Contractor's plan eligible to be counted towards the eighty (80%) percent vaccinati on threshold shall: 4.4.10.1.1. Reside in the cities and towns identifi ed by DPH as most disproportionately impacted by COVID -19, as further directed by EOHHS; and 4.4.10.1.2. Exclude those Enrollees in the F1 Rating Category, as set forth in Section 4.2.1.2 ., as of January 1, 2021. 217 4.4.10.2. Subject to the Contractor meeting the requirements set forth in Section 4.4.10.1. above, such vaccine incentive payment shall be the lesser of five hundred thousand ($500,000) dollars or five (5%) percent of the Contractor's Medicaid capitation payments, which will be calculated as if the Contractor has received the full quality withhold payment, for Demonstration Year 8 (2021) as determined by EOHHS; and 4.4.10.3. Such vaccine incentive payment shall be excluded from the calculation of Risk Corridors and Medical Loss Ratios as described in Section 4.7 . 4.4.10.4. Such incentive arrangement is available to both public and private Contractors under the same terms of performance. Participation in this incentive arrangement is not conditioned upon the Contractor entering into or adhering to intergovernmental transfer agreements. Such incentive arrangement is necessary for the specified activities, targets, performance measures, or quality -based outcomes that support program initiatives as specified in the state's quality strategy. 4.5. Transitions Between Rating Categories and Risk Score Changes 4.5.1. Rating Category Changes 4.5.1.1. The MassHealth C omponent of the Capitation Rates will be updated following a change in an Enrollee's status, based on facility status and the Minimum Data Set -Home Care (the MDS -HC), or any subsequent documentation required by CMS and the Commonwealth as follows. 4.5.1.2. On a monthly basis, as part of capitation payment processing, the Rating Category of each Enrollee will be determined based on the Enrollee's facility status and the most recent MDS -HC information as of the 1 st of the m onth.

Bristol Essex Franklin Hampden Hampshire Middlesex Norfolk Suffolk Worcester Plymouth 322 Appendix L - Foundational Elements of Primary Care And Behavioral Health Integration The following are the foundational elements that signify integration of primary care and behavioral health in each of five practice areas or domains of care delivery. These elements were defined by the Massachusetts Patient -Centered Medical Home Initiative (PCMHI) Beha vioral Health Work Group in consultation with Mountainview Consulting and Work Group member Dr. Alexander Blount, as essential for a Primary Care Provider to effectively integrate Behavioral Health Services. I. Relationship and Communication Practices Triaged Access at Emergent, Urgent and Routine Times PCPs and behavioral health providers have established a reliable positive working relationship and regular communication exchange among one another. Smooth Hand- off PCPs routinely discuss patient care issues with behavioral health providers prior to and after same- day hand- offs or prior to a scheduled initial visit. Sharing Expertise PCPs are comfortable routinely requesting advice from Behavioral Health Providers about intervening with patients who present with behavioral health and medical concerns. Training Activities Behavioral health providers provide periodic training and education for medical staff on behavioral health topics (e.g., at a provider meeting, through a monthly newsletter or a lunch time training on a topic of interest to PCPs). Program Leadership PCPs have a defined steering group and medical champion for the practice's behavioral health integration activities. II. Patient Care and Population Impact Routine Screening and Referral for Adult Behavioral Health Issues Patients are routinely screened prior to or during annual physical exams with a standardized tool for both depression and alcohol use. Behavioral Health Skills Used by the Care Team 323 PCP staff providing direct service are trained in patient activation and health behavior change techniques. PCPs and (other members of the care team as appropriate) deliver evidence- based interventions in consultation with behavioral health providers. III. Requirements to Ensure Effective Community Integration Self-Help Referral Connections PCP practices have available and regularly use referral information for self -help groups, and offers books, pamphlets and websites that foster patient self -help Community Group and Resources Connections PCPs provide linkages that facilitate the connection of patients with community resources such as gyms, churches, housing and food support. Specialty Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Referral Connections PCPs establish and use referral and information- sharing protocols with an array of mental health and SUD specialty services. IV. Care Managers Coordination of an Integrated Treatment Plan Integrated treatment plans (plans that include medical and behavioral health goals) are effectively coordinated by the C linical Care Manager. Use of Behavioral Health Skills Behavioral health skills are used by the C linical Care Manager when working with patients. Use of Community Resources The Clinical Care Manager is aware of behavioral health- focused community resources and regularly utilizes them. V. Clinic System Integration Schedule Accessibility The PCP can facilitate the scheduling of a behavioral health visit for a patient at the time of a patient visit. Leaders are committed to integrated care 324 PCP staff leadership understands the value of the behavioral health service to patients and will commit to maintaining effective BH integration. Staffing or Affiliations PCPs have sufficient Behavioral Health Provider staffing and / or referral opportunities for/ relationships with other BH services outside of the practice. Chart Note Integration The behavioral health provider chart notes are placed in the same location as PCP chart notes. Process Integration Within a given practice, PCPs and individual behavioral health providers use the same screene rs and outcome instruments to follow progress. 325 Appendix M - Acceptable Admitted Assets 1.
