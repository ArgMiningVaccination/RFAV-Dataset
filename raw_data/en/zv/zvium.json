The natural healing force within each one of us is the greatest force in getting well. Our food should be our medicine. Our medicine should be our food. But to eat when you are sick is to feed your sickness. - Hippocrates Each of you are reading this for a reason. For a few of you it may be that your just curious and are open to new ways of improving your health and well-being. However, for most of you - you are probably reading this because you know you have to do something about your health. It may be that you are overweight, or feel tired, or have a disease you want to heal - or maybe its just that you don't feel 100% optimum and know you can feel so much better. Today is a new day. Today you have the opportunity to change your life forever by re-gaining control of your own health. We all have our own unique vision of what 'optimum health' looks like. For some it is the raw vegan diet and for others it may be just simply reducing meat, dairy, processed foods, refined sugar and exercising more. Whatever your vision of health is - you know what it takes to get there. So what is stopping you. Why does optimum health elude so many. The reason optimum health eludes so many is that society 'norms' have taught us to look at food as comfort and reward. Add to the equation that highly educated food scientists know how to manipulate our food with salt, sugar and fat so that it tastes really good and our bodies get addicted to it both physically and physiologically. Did you know that 70% of western society deaths are caused from lifestyle diseases which are all induced primarily by what we eat. To reach optimum health we need to reframe how we look at eating. Instead of eating for comfort we need to choose to eat for a purpose. Eating is an energy exchange and in order to reach optimum health we need to choose high vibrational and high energy foods that will deeply nourish our bodies and mind. With each food choice we make we need to ask ourselves is this piece of food filled with empty calories that have no benefit for my body or is it full of nutrients that will feed, fuel and heal my body. We also need to ask the very important question - Where has my food has come from. Has it had very little human intervention or has it been manipulated in a lab somewhere in the world? Has the production of it contributed to planet destruction, animal cruelty or to some kind of modern day slavery. Unfortunately our food system is corrupt and is doing far more damage the majority of people are aware of - therefore I gently urge you to take the time to really learn about whats in your food and where your food comes from. So how do you go from your current habits which seem near impossible to break to a step closer to your vision of what is optimum health? For me personally my recommendation is to go on a juice fast which will enable your body to have the time to disconnect from the habits that haven't served you up until now. I went from a cheese loving wine guzzling bread addict to someone who now eats a mostly raw vegan diet in the space of a year. I honestly feel so good today that I no longer have any interest in going back to my old bad habits. My journey to a raw food diet was only made possible because of juice fasting. I did several juice fasts over the year, my first one lasted about 9 days, my second one lasted only 14 days and my most recent juice fast lasted 30 days. Each time I completed a juice fast I was a step closer to my own personal vision of optimum health. With each juice fast my tastebuds adjusted, my relationship with food and myself changed and I slowly evolved both pyshollogically and physically as I committed to my own journey of health and well-being. I went from someone who loved wine and cheese, and who was always sick (colds and flus at least twice a year + sore throats, congestion now and then, \"unexplained fatigue\", dull skin, headaches, brain fog, moments of depression and gradual weight gain) and all the rest of the so-called \"normal\" ailments & physical problems that our (myself included) western society puts up with, to one who experienced thriving health for the very first time. It was a natural progression and not achieved overnight which is why it eludes most. I am one of the lucky ones who persevered. A lot of my success is thanks to all the plant-based books and documentaries such as The China Study, Forks Over Knives, Earthlings and Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead - in moments where I wanted to give up I would seek out these educational resources.. If you are wanting to gain back control of your health or your weight then I gently urge you to experiment with juice fasting. The best way to start your journey is to just give it a go - 7 days, 10 days, 14 days or even 30 days. I promise if you give it both your time and commitment you will go from a place of surviving to thriving. So aside from breaking bad habits and reprogaming your food choices, what are the other benefits of juice fasting? Well; in a nutshell juice fasting is a therapeutic alternative medicine that will detox and heal your body. The thing is that toxins are everywhere - they are in the food we eat, water we drink, make-up we use, air we breathe, the media we absorb and so forth. We just cannot escape these toxins no matter how hard we try. Conventional medicine really only offers one single solution to every symptom, and that is a prescription. Now while our body is strong and can actually fight these toxins, we need to give it a little break every now and then so that it can overhaul and reboot. If we don't give our body the break it needs and deserves then eventually our bodies succumb, in the form of sinus issues, allergies, low energy, poor skin quality, excess weight and even disease. Take A Moment To Consider This What is the happiest, healthiest version of yourself that you can imagine? Do you visualise someone who: - Feels purposeful, energetic, and inspired? - Eats a diet rich in whole foods? - Glows with health and vitality? - Doesn't rely on caffeine, alcohol, prescription drugs or other pills? - Gets outdoors and exercises daily You probably don't visualise someone who: - Is reliant on prescription drugs. - Needs caffeine first thing in the morning, a sugar snack after lunch and a glass of wine to unwind in the evening. - Feels anxious, stressed, fatigued, or depressed. - Slumped in front of the television for several hours on end. Many of us are far from our ideal vision of health. To be brutally honest, mass media, drug companies, and the fast-food industry hope we stay there - docile, suppressed and reliant on them. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, however the medical industry, government, food companies, and the pharmaceutical industry do not have our best health interests at heart. For these companies profits always come first, and there is a lot of money to be made by keeping people sick and addicted. I'm here to tell you that you have choices and the power to change your life. You can get healthy and live happy - without drugs. Once you make the life-changing decision to own and heal your own body, this sense of empowerment that will flow over to all facets of your life, and over time you will become to be the master of your complete well-being. Should I fast? You are in need of a fast if you are currently feeling any of the below? - Missing out on living to your full potential because of depression, stress, anxiety, and other mood issues? - Frustrated that the medical advice and solutions you've been given are not working for you - and maybe even making you sicker? - Cant loose that extra weight even though you feel like you don't eat that bad? - Feel tired and fatigued often - especially in the afternoon? - Are walking around daily life in a mental fog? - Whilst you feel ok physically you know deep within that you should be feeling better? - Does your skin look dull, lifeless and is prone to accelerated ageing? - Do you suffer from auto-immune disease, diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's, thyroid trouble or cancer? If you are ready to own your own body, and free your mind - to feel healthier and happier without drugs - I encourage you to consider doing a juice fast to reboot and heal your mind and body. WHY SHOULD I FAST? In todays modern world disease is rampant - almost everyone is suffering some form of disease from cancer, depression, anxiety, diabetes, heart disease to Alzheimer's. According to doctors drugs are the foundation of healing. According to the nutrition industry, vitamin supplements and superfood powders are. Then there is the alternative approach, which personally feels like the more natural journey and that is to give the body time and space to heal by only consuming nutrient dense vegetable juices. The chronic illnesses of Western society are mostly caused from inflammation within the body. Inflammation shows up differently from person to person, it might show up as diabetes, in another person as cardiovascular disease, in someone else as depression or anxiety. Healing can not take place in an inflamed body. It is not enough to swallow pills, eat superfoods and follow the latest fad diet. Many people are seeking out optimum health, however very few people actually stop eating. We need to give our digestive system a break so that our body has a chance to heal. The energy your body would normally use for digestion is diverted elsewhere in your body for self-healing. Fasting from solid food is one of the most powerful ways to heal and has been used for thousands of years. We live in a toxic world. All this toxicity in our life creates a lot of stress on our bodies! Our bodies' natural detoxification process struggles to keep up with this overload and the excessive buildup then causes inflammation and disease. Regular juice fasting gives our bodies the space and time to heal and prevent the onset of disease. When you fast, your body breaks down this toxic material and begins the elimination process. Step by step the impact is incredible. Effortless weightloss, boundless energy, radiant health, greatly lowered risk of [and even the reversal of] major diseases such as certain cancers, heart disease, diabetes, hormonal imbalances and depression. I would also like to throw into the mix the power of intermittent fasting. Currently there is huge hype about intermittent fasting, and Research has shown that intermittent fasting [where you only eat for a 6-8 hour block per day] should be used as a daily practice to increase health, weight control and longevity. You can google the research - it is everywhere on the internet. I personally am a big fan of intermittent fasting and I even do it when I am on a juice fast. BENEFITS OF JUICE FASTING A Nutrient Injection Health authorities recommend we eat at least 5 servings of fruits and veggies per day. However 9+ servings per day is essential if you want to transform your health. (Most people average only 1 serving of fruits and veggies per day.) Our modern processed diet has left our bodies starving for nutrients at the cellular level. Fresh vegetable juices revitalise our blood and within 15 minutes of drinking them the nutrients enter into the blood stream and carry vital vitamins, anti-oxidants, minerals, live enzymes, phytonutrients and amino acids to all parts of the body rejuvenating our organs and glands. Green juices made with leafy greens are the best. The molecule of chlorophyll [found in leafy greens] has only one atom that makes it different from a molecule of human blood. According to the teachings of Dr. Ann Wigmore, to consume chlorophyll is like receiving a healthy blood transfusion. Because juices are rich in nutrients they make the best diet supplements, working harmoniously and synergistically to enable your body to heal, maintain good health and stay free of diseases. Even when you are not fasting fresh vegetable juices should be part of your daily diet. All the vital enzymes, vitamins and minerals [including protein] that our body requires will be obtained by eating plants. It is a myth that we need animal protein and calcium. When we eat protein or calcium derived from an animal we are just consuming a low-grade protein and calcium stored in the animals body that originally originated from when the animals ate plants. Why not go direct to the source [plants] instead of eating a low-grade by-product? Juice Is Liquid Energy When we drink raw vegetable juice we are ultimately drinking life. The fruits and vegetables we eat absorb nutrients from the rich soil while getting energized by the sun during the process of photosynthesis. When we eat these plants the cells in our body, in turn, absorb all these plant-derived essential nutrients and energy leaving us with a deep feeling of vitality and boundless energy. Great for fighting fatigue and tiredness. Body Can Rest + Heal When you feel sluggish, fatigued, unwell or depressed, stop eating and go to juices to enable your body to reboot and heal. Food takes a tremendous amount of energy to digest [especially animal products and processed foods] and the digestive system uses most of the bodies energy to just break down the food. When you stop eating, your digestive system rests, which allows blood and energy to flow and feed other parts of the body. Juice fasting is the answer to all disease, by giving your digestive system a chance to rest it then enables the body to put its energy into other areas of the body that need healing. Because we don't give our digestive system a break our body never gets enough energy to start healing and renewing cells in our body in order to fight disease. Toxins from processed/refined foods (artificial food additives, preservatives, chemicals, etc.) and the polluted environment \"clog\" our cells, suffocating them and causing diseases, inflammation and pain.When doing a juice fast we give our digestive system a break and flood our cells with nutrients , it is at this time the body has the ability to release the toxins held deep within our cells and replace them with nutrients from fresh juices. Most deep healing starts to take place after about 21 days of an extended juice fast when the cells begin to regenerate using the nutrients that they are receiving. This extended period allows the body uninterrupted time to do the meticulous work of repairing, renewing and healing.Years of bad eating are being torn down and released as toxins are being transported out of your system. Be sure to drink plenty of water (distilled water is best) during fasting to flush these wastes out efficiently. Juices Contain Vital Live Enzymes For Healing Juices contain gigantic amounts of live enzymes that are required for breaking down food. Enzymes are heat sensitive, therefore when we cook food we destroy all the vital enzymes the body needs to digest the food. If there are no enzymes in the food we eat the pancreas, liver and your digestive system needs to work extra hard to produce similar chemicals in order for you to digest your food. However when your body does not have to tap into its one energy source to produce these chemicals that are similar to live enzymes it then has extra energy that can be transported to the parts of the body that need healing. Even a so-called healthy western diet is a live enzyme-free diet which is why raw vegan diets are becoming well-known to be the best for our body. Juicing Thins Blood Thinning the blood is one the most important things we can do for our body. Blood carries all the vital nutrients to our organs - ultimately feeding our body. When we are ill our bodies are trying to pump blood to the diseased area in order to feed, nourish and heal. Due to our modern-day diets rich in animal fats and processed foods our blood becomes like mud and does not effectively get to the diseased area. Thinning our blood is one the greatest keys to getting healthy. It increases our circulation because the blood becomes more like water than mud which then allows the body to circulate blood easier and feed the deeper parts of the body and organs. Weight Loss It is normal to lose anywhere up from 15 to 20 kilograms of weight over a 30 day fast. Body fat stores chemicals such as un-metabolized prescription drugs, pollution chemicals, chemicals found in our food and even some beauty and health care products have left their deposits of poisons in our system. Juice fasting is a powerful process for dealing with this part of the cleansing process. Balance hormones and repairs chemical deficiencies Many people are sick because they don't produce enough insulin in their body. Or, they don't produce enough thyrox in their thyroid. Or, they don't produce enough serotonin to regulate sleep and appetite, mediate moods, and inhibit pain. Along with many people don't produce enough estrogen or progesterone or testosterone. All the chemicals needed for a healthy body are all built from the nutrients we feed our body. One of the things that juice fasting does is, it supplies your body with a tremendous amount of nutrition. So it balances your metabolism, balances your hormones, balances your mood, balances your endocrine system, your thyroid, your pancreas, and your reproductive organs. Feeds the mind and balances the emotions A high-raw diet, in the form of juices, will not only reverse the body degeneration, but also make you feel more clear, alert and emotionally balanced. After a couple of days juice fasting it will feel like the fog is cleared. The body develops a deeper sense of smell, taste and sight while gaining a greater awareness to the minds perceptions and thoughts. If you have a big decision to make or find yourself in a stressful situation, then stop eating and go on a juice fast. You will discover that by day 3 your mental clarity and emotional well-being will be enhanced. We are drunk on food. Overeating makes us dull and docile. Animal products and processed foods are extremely hard to digest, as a result the body's blood and energy is being drawn to the digestive tract instead of feeding and nourishing the brain. Fasting clears the digestive system then the mind, and so it is a physical and emotional cleanse, and maybe even a spiritual cleanse. Harvard Medical School have published many articles and research papers on the importance of nutrition for mental health and well-being [[Click here]](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/nutritional-psychiatry-your-brain-on-food-201511168626). I also love [this article on whole-body psychiatry](https://experiencelife.com/article/whole-body-psychiatry-nutrition-for-mental-health/) where it delves into why nutrition can and has treated mental illness with great success. Also, during the [Kame Project](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2266591/), people who consumed juice more than three times per week were 76 percent less likely to develop Alzheimer's disease than those who consumed juice less than once a week. Heals Depression, Anxiety + Other Forms Of Mental Illness I personally suffered anxiety, overwhelm and depression on a regular basis, however since I made juicing a daily practice I no longer suffer any of these conditions and feel totally balanced emotionally at all times. For me the mental wellness has been one of the biggest changes I have personally experienced through both juice fasting and through drinking 3 juices a day when not fasting. More and more doctors are coming to the realisation that the majority of mental illness stems from how we perceive the world around us [our perception] combined with how well our brain is feed with high nutrient dense foods. This approach is coined 'Whole Psychiatry' and it is a slow yet growing trend where a doctor will explore all possibilities, from looking for disruptions in basic body systems that might manifest as mental illness, while also looking into psychological, social, and spiritual factors. While medications should be used to stabilize a person who is in a crisis state, the overall goal must be to treat the underlying health issues through nutrition, supplementation, and lifestyle changes. Curing mental illness with vitamins is not new. In fact, this approach was the breakthrough treatment in mental health in the 1950s. Canadian physician and medical researcher Abram Hoffer began treating people with schizophrenia using niacin, or vitamin B3, and claimed a cure rate of 75 percent \u2014 meaning, he said, that these people were well enough to go back to work and pay taxes instead of needing to be supported by society. In 1968, Nobel Prize-winning scientist Linus Pauling \u2014 the great champion of mega dose vitamin C \u2014 coined the term \"orthomolecular,\" which means \"the right molecule,\" to describe this method of treatment. The body is one of the most sophisticated systems, it doesn't make mistakes. Anytime you have pain your body is trying to get you to pay attention to something that has become unbalanced. Juicing is a great way to put your body into balance nutritionally. Nourish The Skin The flood of vitamins build healthy skin - you will be left with a healthy glow that is soft and supple. Fasting has helped reduce wrinkles, acne and eczema and over time you will save money on expensive face creams and prescription ointments because you are getting the nourishment from the inside out. Liver Detoxification One of the primary functions of the liver is to serve as the body's detoxifier. The livers primary job is to remove harmful substances (like environmental toxins, chemicals, food additives, preservatives, alcohol, drugs, etc) before they can enter the bloodstream and harm the body. Periodic cleansing of the liver through juicing is crucial in maintaining good health. Fresh juices reduce the burden on the liver and give it a chance to catch up. Juicing allows the liver to rid itself of accumulated toxins, thus permitting it to operate more efficiently. Stronger Immune System Infections and disease thrive in an inflammed body, and as discussed earlier one of the greatest benefits of cleansing is to reduce the inflammation so that disease can start to heal. Freshly pressed juices are packed with disease-fighting antioxidants and the phytonutrients found in both fruit and vegetables boost your body's immune system and keep it functioning properly all year round. Majority of people that eat a balanced high raw plant-based diet will tell you they haven't had a headache or flu for years - they simply don't get them. Personal transformation You are eating life-force. Beyond weight-loss and the healing of disease an extended juice fast often becomes a catalyst for a total life overhaul. A raw diet is a high vibrational diet and as a result it has the power to not only ground a person but to reconnect them back to nature. After a juice fast you will be inspired to go raw vegan, exercise more, have more compassion for other beings, start caring about the earth and even dissolve some of that toxic ego. Fasting is not only a physical journey but a deeply spiritual one also. Food is an energy exchange and when you are putting high vibrational foods into your body you will be guided on a natural progression to a more open mind - it truly is a beautiful shift. A Boost Of Light Energy Light energy is found in the living cells of raw fruits and vegetables. Uncooked plants have been shown to emit coherent light energy when photographed (evidenced in Kirlian Photography). This light energy is believed to have many benefits when consumed; one in particular is to aid cellular communication. It's also believed to contribute to our energy and a feeling of vibrancy and well-being. Reprograms Your Tastebuds Changes Your Relationship With Food: Every time you do a juice fast your relationship with food gets better each time. We all have our own journey, however what always remains true for all is that the relationship we have with food becomes one where we no longer eat for comfort and rather eat for a purpose [our health, the planet, the animals, those suffering hunger etc]. You realise eating is an energy exchange. Cools Down The Body Because your giving your digestive system a break the body is not working has hard, therefore it feels quite cool which is wonderful in summer during the hot days. Great for women going through menopause. Reconnects You Back To The Simple Life Eating raw vegetable juices simplifies life as there is very little effort needed to be put in planning and cooking meals. We live in a world of excess - from excess stuff, excess achievement to excess eating. We have forgotten to choose quality over quantity Changes The World Not only does juicing change your own world on many levels it also contributes to bringing about a more peaceful world. When you just consume raw organic produce you are not contributing to animal cruelty, environmental damage or modern day human slavery. Also because you start to appreciate how little you need to consume to feel amazing you will start to only consume what you need - and if everybody did this then there would be enough resources to feed the entire planet tenfold. Raises Your Vibration The life-force energy that enters your body via drinking juices is a pure, nature based energy that resonates with spirit/universe/god. We are what we eat and think - therefore when we fill our bodies with pure plant energy we start to vibrate at a higher frequency. You will actually feel the energy buzzing out of you - it truly is amazing. Because you are vibrating at a higher frequency you will attract the right people, opportunities and situations into your life. It will amp up your connection with the universe which in return will amp up your co-creating power. HOW LONG SHOULD I JUICE FAST? There are many different viewpoints, some say detox once a week, others say detox once a month and some say detox every three or six months. There are no right or wrong methods, just listen to your own body and do what feels right for you. Joe Cross made a self-documentary called \"Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead\" when he went on a 60-day juice fast to lose 50 kilos and recover from a debilitating, autoimmune disease. Likewise, I've seen many people thrive on a 30-day, 60-day and even 90-day juice fast. But don't let that intimidate you. While I personally recommend a 30 day fast I understand that it can be quite daunting for many. Start with seven days. Then, if you feel great, try 14 days, then 21. Each seven-day block compounds the healing process within the body. Once you have done your big fast, so long as you keep to a high raw plant-based diet afterwards you can just do maintenance fasts of 7 days every three or four months. However, if you start eating processed foods again it is crucial to do another extended fast. WHO SHOULDN'T FAST Most people can do an extended fast with no health effects what so ever. However women who are pregnant plus children should never embark on an extended juice fast. If you are taking prescription drugs then you must consult with your doctor first as the potency of some juices may affect your medication. When consulting with your doctor please keep in mind that many mainstream doctors may not be supportive of an extended juice fast, it is important that you convey to them that you are doing primarily vegetable juice and for fasts over 15 days you will be using protein powder or putting an avocado in your juices. If they don't agree then it doesn't hurt to get a second or third opinion - as research has shown that juice fasts are a healing therapy for majority of diseases and ailments. HOW DO I JUICE FAST? When you have decided to commit to a juice fast there are two things you must consider and that is \"how to start\" and \"how to end\" the fast. When both are done properly, it can make fasting much more enjoyable. There are several ways to build up to an extended fast. Some people go cold turkey and others spend a few weeks preparing. If you drink alcohol, eat meat, eat dairy, drink coffee, eat bread and other processed foods you will feel pretty shitty during the detoxification and will power may be a struggle. I recommend first trying to stop alcohol, coffee, meat and dairy first. To make this transition easier I recommend finding healthier alternatives for your favourite foods. For example I drink Kombucha instead of wine, have dandelion tea with soy milk instead of coffee, have coconut cheese instead of dairy cheese and so forth. You truly will be surprised how easy it is to source healthier replacements. Once you feel ok without consuming those items then go raw vegan for a week or two - also include a few fresh juices or smoothies during the day. When you feel ready to start the fast first embark on a water fast for as long as you can - 5 days to 14 days are ideal. Then switch to a juice fast [make sure you still drink plenty of water] and do that for as long as you can. Make sure you don't purchase pre-bottled juices as you need to be juicing your own vegetables and drinking them the same day you juiced them. Whilst on the fast if you feel the need to cheat then have a smoothie, the thickness of a smoothie drink should fill your belly and satisfy your palette. When you are really struggling then have a small piece of fruit. When you feel ready to stop the fast it is crucial that you implement solid foods slowly - otherwise it can be dangerous. Start having smoothies and soups of the first few days. Then implement salads and raw foods. Ideally you want to permanently stay on a high plant-based diet after the fast to prevent your body going back to its old ways of toxicity and weigh gain. PREPPING FOR A JUICE FAST Organise your kitchen: Before you journey on a juice fast take the time to remove all junk and processed foods from your cupboards and refrigerator. Get rid of sugary drinks, alcohol, coffee, processed snacks and bottled sauces. Wipe over the shelves and organise your cooking space. Make room on your counter-top for your juicing needs. Get you juice jars: Purchase or recycle glass jars with lids to store your juices in for the day - ideally they will be about 500ml each. Collect more glass jars than you need on a daily basis. Stock up on water and coconut water: Don't buy water or coconut water in plastic bottles as research is showing that plastic bottles are releasing a toxin that can cause hormone disruption. Sparkling water in evening is great alternative to get past those alochol cravings. Stock up on herbal teas and vegetable broths: My favourite is peppermint or liquorice. Herbal teas and vegetable broths are great for hydration. If you need to sweeten your tea then add a little maple syrup. If it is summer make some iced herbal teas or fruit infused water. Get a juicer and blender: When it comes to choosing a juicer there are two types of juicers on the market. The best types of juicers for highest nutrient content move slower so that they don't heat and oxidize the juice. This includes brands like the Hurom, Omega and the Green Star juicer. Whereas, juicers like the Breville juice much faster and are more affordable. Because I juice everyday I have both types of juicers and I often use my Breville when I am in a hurry. Set your start date: Don't let fear hold you back. Set the date and commit. You are always going to have events and birthdays come up - don't make excuses. Just begin. Get your stats: Get your weight, height, measurements, go to your doctor and get your chloresterol and blood pressure. On the last day of the fast get your stats done again. Stimulate Your Mind: Get inspired by watching health and juice documentaries such as \"Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead\" \"Super Juice Me\" \"Forks Over Knives\". Ted talks are also a great resource. Download a few apps: There are some great juice fasting apps available to purchase for just a couple of dollars and they are so worth it. Most of them come with recipes, shopping lists and weekly coaching videos. My two favourite juice fasting apps are by either Joe Cross or Jason Vale GETTING THROUGH THE JUICE FAST Boost your juice: Experiment and play with different flavours from chilli, nutmeg or cinnamon. Protein powders and spiralina are also great. If you must cheat: There may be times where you can't take it anymore - so instead of giving up it is much better to have a little cheat. Have half a piece of fruit or half an avocado with a drizzle of lemon and black pepper. Make sure you keep your cheats to just one a day, and don't have it if you don't need it. Something I love to do for something warm and comforting at night is to make a sweetened almond milk by blending up almonds, coconut water, dates, vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg. Gently heat it up if you need. Get in the right frame of mind: Rather than eating for comfort you now need to switch to looking at eating for a purpose. Look at the grand scheme of things. You must know your why. Have the vision for your long term goal and lay down the foundation which requires hard work. Humans don't do discomfort so this is difficult for many people. Remind yourself why this juice fast is important to you. Visualise how a healthy body will look and feel like. Understand your cravings: 95% of your cravings are physiological not physical. On a western diet almost everyone is addicted to something and lets face it no-one makes the decision to juice fast if they are not having some kind of health issue. Nobody has an issue with their health and not have an addiction to food. I am not talking about an addiction to blueberries or salads but an addiction to burgers, fries, cheese, salt, chocolate, bread, sugar, coffee, alcohol and other quick convienant meals. When going on to a healthy diet it is natural to have fear. Your mind will be trying to convince you that you will never enjoy your food again and that raw foods are bland and boring. Your cravings are your addictions speaking and they are not logical - addiction is not logical. When your cravings come up your mind will try and convince you to cave into your craving in by giving you an excuse why it is different for you. Some common excuses may be - your going out for dinner with friends or it is the wrong time to start the health journey. Don't be a slave to the junk food. What you need to do to get rid of your cravings is to starve them to death. If you are constantly feeding your cravings then they will never go away. For the first few days your body will be going in shock and sending you severe hunger pains so that you feed the cravings. Your body is going into withdrawal therefore it creates a false hunger in order to get you to reach for all those 'bad and toxic' foods. To test if it is a real hunger or a false hunger go to your refridgerator and reach for an apple. If your body is screaming 'yes' then have it. However; I bet my life on it that your body will not be interested in the apple and it will scream at you for some salt, sugar, bread, dairy, meat, caffeine and so forth. Instead of hoping your cravings go away choose to invite them in. Feel the full intensity of the craving and just be with it - then let your educated brain tell the food that you don't want it because it destroys your health. So long as you don't feed the craving it will disappear after 3 or 4 days. Realise that the craving is your body trying to convince you that you need the junk. Sit with the craving and realise that it will go away so long as you don't feed it. Realise it was this feeling that kept you feeding the false hunger which kept you hooked on the junk for years. The only way to farewell it for good is to not feed the craving and starve it to death. It is this craving that has caused either the extra weight, disease or feeling of constant fatigue. If you understand the feeling then you will be less likely cave in to your cravings. Realise it is only 30 days: 30 days out of your entire life to completely change your life is nothing in the scheme of things. There are thinkers and doers in this world - be a doer. No more excuses. It is so easy to come up with reasons why you shouldn't be doing the juice fast. You have made the decision so don't make any excuses. Don't hope you can do it. Instead give yourself certainity by telling yourself that you have it within your power. Once again it is only 30 days, yes the first 4 or so days may be hard but then you are home and dusted. Watch out for the juice skeptics: Doubt is the silent killer. While you are fasting watch out for the negativity coming in from other people. The negativity may even be coming from yourself based on your own preconceived ideas on what is healthy and what is not. You can not judge or know something until you have experienced it for yourself - and trust me juice fasting will change your life. People will try and tell you that it is not healthy, watch out for the sugars or that you will put on heaps of weight after the fast. Unfortunately the skeptics will mainly come from your friends and family. Don't have a diet mentality: When you feel like you are depriving yourself then you are guaranteed to have a food break down. Educate yourself on what food does to your body and I can guarantee that you will no longer want the junk food. However, like drugs junk food is addictive and it can take 4 to 5 days to get it out of your system, but once it is out your palette and cravings will be drawn to more natural and nutrient dense foods. When you learn to sustain from all the junk others will think you are superhuman and you will even feel superhuman. Enjoy the process and feel empowered that you have the strength to not feed the cravings and take your health into your own hands. Prepare for the detox symptoms: There is no easy way around detoxing. You will feel miserable for the first 3 or 4 days. There is a high chance you will feel weak, have headaches, get flu-like symptoms or have low energy when you first start your juice fast. Generally the headaches are caused due to caffeine and sugar withdrawal. The fatigue and tiredness is greatly attributed to the fact that your body has grown accustomed to eating 3 meals a day - and as a result it is freaking out at the fact it doesn't know when its next meal will be. You feel tired because the body has gone into panic mode and is trying to get you to rest and conserve energy. When considering a juice cleanse it is important to schedule day 3 and 4 around your days off or around the more quiet/easy days for you. The best way to get through the detox symptoms is to drink plenty of water and get rest. If your head-aches get so bad [which can happen with caffeine withdrawals] that you are having trouble getting through your day then take some paracetamol. While it is a toxin in-itself at least it will get you through the hump and it will flush itself from your body in the days to come. I have the entire detox process written below. Please educate yourself on what is happening in your body so that you stay strong and don't get defeated by the healing crisis process. WHAT TO JUICE It is highly recommended to juice mostly green vegetables and to avoid juicing fruit if you can. However please ensure you juice the rainbow on a daily basis with an emphasis on green veggies - as the more colour you consume, the larger the variety of nutrients you are adding to your body. Also choose organic vegetables where you can. Definitely avoid drinking concentrated fruit juices as they are high in sugar and because their is little fibre to slow down the sugar it raises the body's blood sugar levels to much. PLEASE NOTE: Fruit consumed in it's whole form is essential for a healthy diet - however not in the form of concentrated fruit juice. If you do have to add fruit to your juices to make them drinkable then add it as per the following ratio of 80% vegetables and 20% fruit. The top list of juicing produce often includes: celery, cucumber, carrot, green and purple cabbages, green apple, beet, lemon, lime, and assorted greens like coriander, kale, dandelion, bok choy, parsley and collards. For flavor and additional health benefits add in small amounts of fresh green herbs and spices like fennel, mint, ginger, thyme, turmeric as well as many wild green varieties. It is important to keep things varied and interesting to give you something to look forward to drinking HOW TO JUICE The only juice you should be drinking are freshly pressed and 100% raw. Do not buy bottled juices - even if they say 100% juice. Juices can easily loose their nutrient content over time and by being exposed to air. Ideally it is best to drink the juice as soon as you make it. However, for most this is not practically so the next best thing to do is to juice all your juices for the day and store them in a glass airtight container kept cold. When storing the juice you want little air in the container so fill it all the way to the top before sealing it. If you don't have enough juice to fill to the top then top it up with either water or coconut water. Quality juice bars are also an excellent alternative for getting fresh juices. DRINK WATER While juice-fasting it is crucial to still drink 2-3 litres of water. You can mix this up with herbal teas, fruit infused waters and coconut water. Drinking water keeps you hydrated, energised, reduces cravings and detox symptoms and aids in flushing out toxins. HOW MUCH JUICE SHOULD I BE DRINKING? Juices are super filling and generally a 500ml mason jar is adequate for one serving. Most people find they have between 2 litres to 2.5 litres of juice a day or 4 to 5 glasses. However there are no rules and you can drink as much as you like. To ensure you are getting all the nutrients your body needs its important to get the correct calorie intake for your body, otherwise your body will not feel satisfied and you will get cravings or start to get tired. WHAT IS DETOXIFICATION Detoxing is part of any healthy lifestyle, by detoxing you are allowing your body to heal and repair itself. When you go on a detox your body is able to flush out all the toxins that build up over time. Once your body is free from many toxins it then has the ability and energy to start repairing and healing other areas of your body such as illnesses, hair, skin, nails and everything else that may have been neglected. A regular detox allows less sludge to be built up in your body so that your body can continue working at an optimum condition. Physical toxins can accumulate in many ways; the food we eat, the products we use on our skin, the environment we live in, and daily emotional stresses all contribute to stored toxins in our system. We all have toxins in our system and it is crucial to detox regularly as toxic build-up can cause disease and a variety of health related issues. Detoxification is a well-respected alternative medicine that promotes giving the body a rest so that it can draw out stored pollutants from our cells and tissues. THE STAGES OF DETOXIFICATION The more toxic your lifestyle is the more reactions you will have. When you start a detox program it is common to experience headaches, nausea, irritability, tiredness, intense food cravings, flu-like symptoms or skin eruptions. These symptoms are signs that the detoxing process has begun. Because your body's energy is no longer taken up with processing food in the digestive system it now has time to start repairing the body and one of the first things it does is gets rid of the toxins that have been stored in your cells. The toxins are pulsing through your bloodstream and the body is working hard to expel them through urine, sweat, skin eruptions and faecal matter. This is referred to as a \"healing crisis.\" It is important to understand that this is commonly part of the detoxification process and that symptoms normally pass quickly, frequently leaving you feeling way better than you did before the detox episode. You will notice by day three or four the symptoms will be drastically reduced due to the initial hit of toxins being released and as a side-effect you will start to feel nutritionally satisfied and full of boundless energy. Here is an overview of the detoxification stages during a juice fast written by Mr. Tom McGregor, author of Eating in Freedom. The time periods are a general estimation. Stage 1 of detoxification (Day 1 To Day 2) On the first day of fasting, the blood sugar level drop below 70 mg/dl. To restore the blood to the normal glucose level, liver glycogen is converted to glucose and released into the blood. This reserve is enough for half a day. The body then reduces the basal metabolic rate (BMR). The rate of internal chemical activity in resting tissue is lowered to conserve energy. The heart slows and blood pressure is reduced. Glycogen is pulled from the muscle causing some weakness. The first wave of cleansing is usually the worst. Headaches, dizziness, nausea, bad breath, glazed eyes and a heavily coated tongue are signs of the first stage of cleansing. Hunger can be the most intense in this period unless the enema is used which quickly assists the body into the fasting state by ending digestion in the colon. Stage 2 of detoxification (Day 3 To Day 7) Fats, composed of transformed fatty acids, are broken down to release glycerol from the gliceride molecules and are converted to glucose. The skin may become oily as rancid oils are purged from the body. People with problem-free skin may have a few days of pimples or even a boil. A pallid complexion is also a sign of waste in the blood. Ketones are formed by the incomplete oxidation of fats. It is suspected that the ketones in the blood suppress the appetite by affecting the food-satiety center in the hypothalamus. You may feel hungry for the first few days of the fast. This effect is temporary. The desire to eat will disappear. Lack of hunger may last 40 to 60 days, depending on whether you are on water or juice. The body embraces the fast and the digestive system is able to take a much-needed rest, focusing all of its energies on cleansing and healing. White blood cell and immune system activity increases. You may feel pain in your lungs. The cleansing organs and the lungs are in the process of being repaired. Periodically, the lymphatic system expels mucoid matter through the nose or throat. The volume excreted of this yellow-colored mucus can be shocking. The sinuses go through periods of being clogged, then will totally clear. The breath is still foul and the tongue coated. Within the intestine, the colon is being repaired and impacted feces on the intestinal wall start to loosen. Stage 3 (Day 8 to Day 15) On the latter part of an extended fast, you can experience enhanced energy, clear-mindedness and feel better than you have felt since childhood. On the downside, old injuries may become irritated and painful. This is a result of the body's increased ability to heal during fasting. If you had broken your arm 10 years before, there is scar tissue around the break. At the time of the break, the body's ability to heal was directly related to lifestyle. If you lived on a junk-food diet, the body's natural healing ability was compromised. During fasting, the body's healing process is at optimum efficiency. As the body scours for dead or damaged tissue, the lymphocytes enter the older, damaged tissue secreting substances to dissolve the damaged cells. These substances irritate the nerves in the surrounding region and cause a reoccurrence of aches from previously injured areas that may have disappeared years earlier. The pain is good as the body is completing the healing process. The muscles may become tight and sore due to toxin irritation. The legs can be the worst affected, as toxins accumulate in the legs. Cankers are common in this stage due to the excessive bacteria in the mouth. Daily gargling with salt and water will prevent or heal cankers. Stage 4 of detoxification (Day 16 to Day 30) The body is completely adapted to the fasting process. There is more energy and clarity of mind. Cleansing periods can be short with many days of feeling good in between. There are days when the tongue is pink and the breath is fresh. The healing work of the organs is being completed. After the detoxification mechanisms have removed the causative agent or render it harmless, the body works at maximum capacity in tissue proliferation to replace damaged tissue. While a short fast will reduce the symptoms, a longer fast can completely heal. Homeostatic balance is at optimum levels. The lymphatic system is clean except for a rare discharge of mucus through the nose or throat. After day 20, the mind is affected. Heightened clarity and emotional balance are felt at this time. Memory and concentration improve. Stage 5 of detoxification (Breaking the Fast) The sticky, toxic, mucoid coating on the intestinal wall is loose, and the first meal frees it from the intestinal wall. Toxins enter the blood through the colon. The gallbladder dumps its waste in a heavy discharge of bile. This can cause an instant bowel movement upon eating followed by intense diarrhea. If the symptoms are too uncomfortable, an enema will help. JUICING VS BLENDING Many people wonder what is better ...juicing or blending...They both serve different yet equally important purposes in the wellness path... so we believe that after the juice fast it is important to include both in your diet. Juicing makes it easy for us to get a variety of fresh fruits, vegetables and herbs into our daily diet, whilst creating drinks that flood our bodies with nutrients which are incredibly easy to digest. But smoothies have their place in a daily menu as well - they offer fibre, good fats and opportunities for adding more protein into your diet all while tasting deliciously creamy and decadent. What's the difference? Fresh juices require more veggies and fruit to make a juice as opposed to blending - therefore there is a higher dose of vitamins. Freshly pressed juices have the indigestible fibre removed which allows a concentrated amount of nutrients to enter your blood stream almost immediately. The nutrients in a freshly pressed juice are in higher concentrated quantities than if you were to eat the fruits and vegetables whole. When you drink fresh fruit and vegetable juices, your body is flooded with nutrients. It's like injecting wholesome nourishment into your blood stream, nourishing and feeding your body instantly. Fresh juices are a great way for anyone who feels that they are nutrient deficient to load up on vitamins and feed the body. Because they have had most of the fibre removed they are incredibly easy to digest and this is what makes them perfect for a cleanse - you get the nutrients while still giving your digestive system a break. Smoothies are easy to make and clean-up, and can be stored up to about 3 days while keeping the vitamins and minerals intact. Unlike juices, smoothies take longer to oxidise - which means you can make one in the morning and have it for lunch, knowing that it is still nutrient enriched. Smoothies still contain all of the fibre from the vegetables - however, the blending process breaks the fibre apart and makes it easier to digest. The naturally occurring fibre in plants will help to regulate the pace at which the natural sugars enter your blood stream. When you drink smoothies, your body benefits from the phytonutrients found in the skin and flesh of fruits and veggies. You also benefit from the large amounts of fibre found in whole fruits and vegetables. Fibre is important for regulating blood sugar, keeping bowels regular, aiding in hunger control, and it may help prevent certain types of cancers. Blended drinks are more filling and generally faster to make than juice, so they can be great to drink first thing in the morning as your breakfast, or for snacks throughout the day. Some people, who have extremely sensitive digestive tracts, often have a hard time with fibre. For these people, a freshly pressed juice may be tolerated much better within the system than a blended smoothie which is rich in fibre. Both smoothies and fresh juice can be a healthy and delicious way to boost the amount of micronutrients in your diet. If you are in relatively good health, both freshly pressed juices and freshly blended drinks can be beneficial. It's really a matter of personal preference. BONUS TIPS FOR JUICE-FASTING - Start the day with a cleansing drink of lemon and water. Simply add the juice of half a lemon to a glass of warm water. This will aid in removing some toxins along with nourishing your body with Vitamin C and Potassium. Alternatively brew a cup of herbal tea if lemon is not your thing. - To help flush out the toxins do daily exercise that is gentle such as yoga, pilates, swimming or a walk. - Dry body brush daily to help flush out the toxins quicker. - Give yourself my \"Detoxing DIY Spa Treatment\" which is my detoxing body treatment inspired from the Australian Rainforest. Detoxing DIY Spa Treatment Start by giving your body a full dry body brush: Grab a natural body brush or hemp mitt then lightly brush your skin starting at your feet. Move in a gentle sweeping movement towards your heart. Gradually make your way up your body and don't forget your arms, chest and neck. Body brushing stimulates the lymphatic system, helping to reduce fluid retention and removing toxins. As you body brush do not judge or critise your body, brush it with love and nurture. Be grateful for how your body protects you and for what it allows you to do. Next take a Sacred Healing Shower: Put 3-4 drops of peppermint essential oil on a natural loofah or body clothe. Massage this into your skin with gentle circular movements. As you shower, bask in the falling water, let the water run off you and imagine that all your negative thoughts are being washed down the drain. Replace them with positive affirmations such as \"I feel wonderful, nourished and alive\" After your shower give yourself a full body exfoliation: Use a handful of sea salt mixed with 1 tbsp of wild lime juice and 3-4 drops of eucalyptus oil. Rub into the skin in a soft gentle circular motion from your feet to your chest and then up along your arms. Wrap yourself up in a warm towel or robe and await your bath. End the treatment with The Desert Journey Tea Bath: Soak in the aroma and tranquillity of the Australian rainforest, this is a luxurious bath treat, guaranteed to leave you feeling calm and at one with nature. Simply add: - 1 tbsp each of eucalyptus leaves, citrus peel, lavender, rosemary, chamomile and sage - 10 drops of lavender essential oil To prepare put all the ingredients into a glass jar and shake, then add two tbsp to your bath directly or in in a muslin bag or clothe. Allow the herbs to steep in the bath for a few minutes before getting in. You can keep the jar of the tea bath ingredients for up to three-six months. Now light some candles, put on some soothing music and let your mind get lost. COMMON QUESTIONS I don't have a juicer, and I want to Fast. Can I use a blender instead? Blending contains the fibre, which means your digestive system has to work a little to break it down - unlike juicing which gives your body a complete break. However, if you have never done a fast before it can be a great way to introduce you to fasting as blended smoothies do leave you feeling full and satisfied. Because you don't blend as many vegetables as juicing it can be hard to get all your nutrient requirement - therefore it is recommended to only do smoothies for no longer than 14 days. .When blending, while you'll still have the benefits of all that fresh produce, you are still essentially \"eating\" and therefore will experience weight loss at a slower rate. For best results I recommend juicing, however I do feel that blending has its benefits for those new to fasting. What About Protein + Healthy Fats? When you think of protein, most people think of a piece of meat, however many raw vegetables also contain protein. Broccoli, spinach, kale, collards and watercress all contain roughly 5 grams of protein per cup. During a juice fast, so long as you are sipping on mostly green juices you will easily consume 20 to 30 grams of protein or more from your juices alone. If you are fasting for 14 days or more then I always recommend adding a high-quality plant protein powder, such as rice or pea, to one of your daily juices. Simply juice your juice and then add the plant-based protein powder to the glass jar and shake well. When it comes to healthy fats it is a good idea to blend an avocado, coconut oil or raw seeds (flax, chia, hemp, etc.) into your one of your juices daily when you are fasting for more than 14 days. What About Fibre? Many people worry about not getting any fibre when they juice fast. However, there is no need for concern as there are 2 main types of fibre found in fruits and vegetables and 1 of these types of fibre is still present in fresh juices. There are insoluble and soluble fibre. Reboot With Joe explains fibre and juicing below [2]: - Insoluble fibre adds bulk to the stool, helps to keep the bowels regular, fills you up and speeds up the passage of food through the digestive tract. Insoluble fiber include cellulose, hemicellulose and lignins. This is mostly removed from the juice although it is still present in smaller amounts. - Soluble fibre absorbs water like a sponge and provides bulking matter that acts as a prebiotic to support good bacterial growth and digestive health. It also regulates blood sugar control, may lower blood cholesterol and slows the transit of food through the digestive tract and helps fill you up. Soluble fibers include pectins, gums and mucilage. This is still present in the juice. Will it heal my disease? Many people have healed from disease on an extended juice fast - however results can vary. Disease lives in an inflamed body and what juice cleansing does is it gets your body healthy so that it has the resources to fight disease within the body. There is a high chance that you will cure disease when you live on a raw plant based diet, however every body is different so results can vary. Take this time to experiment and learn about your body. Should I go off my medication? Many people start to feel amazing after about day 14. Because they often see drastic results and improvements they feel that they don't need their medication anymore or can take less of it. While there is a high chance your body is healing, never go off your medication without approval from your doctor. To ensure safety most doctors will keep you on your medication until a considerable amount of time has passed to ensure that the improvements are permanent. Will I be starving myself? So long as you are drinking at least 2.5 litres of fresh vegetable juice daily you will be getting plenty of calories and nutrients. Will I be hungry? For the first few days you will think you are hungry due to the fact that you have habitually eaten 3 meals a day for your entire life. Your body will be going in shock and sending you severe hunger pains. Your body is going in withdrawal therefore it creates a false hunger in order to get you to reach for all those 'bad and toxic' foods. To test if it is a real hunger or a false hunger go to your refridgerator and reach for an apple. If your body is screaming 'yes' then have it. However; I bet my life on it that your body will not be interested in the apple and it will scream at you for some salt, sugar, bread, dairy, meat, caffeine and so forth. Through juice cleansing your body is supported nutritionally and by day 7 or 8 you will feel so light and energised that you will lose your interest in food. Is there much scientific research on the benefits of detoxing and fasting? Unfortunately research into the healing properties of vitamins, nutrition, fasting and juicing is limited, because, frankly, there's little profit to be made from these discoveries \u2014 unlike the money flowing from new pharmaceutical drugs, meat and dairy industry and the processed food industry. Even worse, there is not enough awareness of the existing research. Research has been done on the effects of fasting. Many papers have been published in scientific journals such as The Journal of International Biochemistry, CMAJ - Canadian Medical Association Journal and Pubmed journals that explain the benefits and biochemistry, physiology, and metabolism of fasting. The papers show an improved metabolism, cognitive function and neurogenesis in the memory center of the brain and life span. The diet also decreased instances of cancer as well as \"bad\" visceral fat. In particular, a team of scientists led by Professor Volter Longo at the University of Southern California have proven that fasting replenishes white blood cells and restores functional wellbeing to our immune systems. \"There is no evidence at all that fasting would be dangerous while there is strong evidence that it is beneficial,\" Professor Longo said. It has also been shown that during a fast, our bodies not only use glucose and fat stores to expel of toxins, but excess white blood cells are broken down [to many white blood cells can cause cancer]. Studies have confirmed that fasting can be particularly beneficial for those with damaged immune systems. So why do so many people say that fasting is not safe?: We have grown up being taught that we need to eat 3 meals a day so that we get enough variety of foods to make up a balanced diet. Mainstream thinking promotes the idea that we must include all foods in the health authorities food pyramids - and fear we won't get enough protein, calcium and general nutrition from plants. Unfortunately these food pyramids are highly funded by the meat and dairy industry with the sole agenda of making us consume more meat and dairy. Plants provide all the nutrients our bodies need - however when we are hardwired to believe we must consume animal products to be healthy it can be hard for some people to grasp the idea of anyone choosing to do things differently. It is 100% safe to fast. However if you are dependant on pharmaceutical drugs, suffer from Type 1 diabetes or are pregnant/breastfeeding then it is crucial to seek medical advice beforehand. And don't be an extremist like Basil Brown - the carrot man who drank 1 gallon of carrot juice a day for 10 days whilst taking 5 times the recommended amount of Vitamin A supplements. Due to all the Vitamin A intake, Basil's liver could not break down the vitamin and his body went into toxic shock and he died. Should I only use organic fruits and vegetables?: Ideally yes; however if your budget doesn't allow for organic then that will be ok also. Do the best you can with what you have. If you can't buy organic then wash your veggies in vinegar and rinse with water to remove the chemical residue on the surface that you are about to juice. How much weight will I lose?: The short answer to this is that you can quickly lose a lot of weight if you have a lot to lose. Most people lose anything from three to six kilos in the first week [mostly water weight] and then it slows down for the next few weeks. Over 30 days the average weight loss is around 15 kilos or 30 pounds. People with a lot of weight to lose may lose more. If you are underweight and afraid of losing too much weight then I recommend supporting your cleanse with a daily smoothie with a vegetable protein powder supplement in it. What is a Pre-cleanse and should I do one? A pre-cleanse is the recommended diet to follow at least 5 days and up to 3 weeks before commencing your juice cleanse. This allows the body to prepare by gently beginning the cleansing process. It aids in the transition to detoxification and minimises any side effects of the fast. However; there are many people who successfully embark on a juice cleanse with no pre-cleanse - so it is possible - but will make things harder. "}
