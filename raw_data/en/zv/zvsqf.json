Essential oils are natural aromatic compounds found in the seeds, bark, stems, roots, flowers, and other parts of plants. They can be both beautifully and powerfully fragrant. If you have ever enjoyed the gift of a rose, a walk by a field of lavender, or the smell of freshly cut mint, you have experienced the aromatic qualities of essential oils. Essential oils elicit powerful responses, yet the use of essential oils goes well beyond their fragrant appeal. Essential oils have been used throughout history in many cultures for their health-promoting properties. Modern trends toward more holistic approaches to self care and growing scientific validation of alternative health practices are driving a rediscovery of the profound health benefits of essential oils. Many have powerful cleansing properties. Their unique chemical structure allows them to deliver targeted benefits through topical application. Certain oils may be used as dietary aids to promote vitality and well-being. Extraction Methods Essential oils are most often extracted via a steam distillation process in which steam is circulated under pressure through plant material, liberating the essential oils into the steam. As the steam mixture cools, the water and oils are separated and the oil is collected in its pure form. T o ensure the highest quality oil extract of correct chemical composition, temperature and pressure must be monitored very closely. T oo little heat and pressure will not release the valuable oil; too much can fracture the oil's delicate chemical composition and alter its potency. In addition to using proper distillation methods, creating a quality CPTG\u00ae essential oil requires the meticulous selection of the correct plant species and plant parts, harvested at the perfect moment when their aromatic compounds are most concentrated. This complex process is as much an art form as it is a science and requires experienced growers and distillers working together to ensure a superior product. 6 Essential Wellnes sWhat Are Essential Oils?CPTG Certified Pure Tested Grade\u00ae dTERRA\u00ae CPTG Certified Pure T ested Grade\u00ae essential oils are pure, natural, aromatic compounds carefully extracted from plants. They do not contain fillers or artificial ingredients that would dilute their active qualities and are free of contaminants or other chemical residues. As important as it is to keep contaminants out of our oils, assuring the presence of the oils' active compounds at the right levels is necessary to guarantee safety and effectiveness. Many oils claim to be natural and some may be pure\u2014but few are subjected to rigorous testing standards for chemical composition. dTERRA CPTG Certified Pure T ested Grade essential oils are cross tested using Mass Spectrometry and Gas Chromatography to ensure both the purity and compositional potency of each batch. dTERRA works closely with a global network of leading essential oil chemists and growers to select botanicals of the correct species, grown in ideal environments, and carefully harvested at the right time. The aromatic compounds of the plants are skillfully extracted by experienced distillers and subjected to chemical analysis to ensure purity and composition. dTERRA CPTG Certified Pure T ested Grade essential oils represent the safest and most beneficial oils available in the world today. Equally stringent standards of safety and efficacy are applied to all dTERRA Essential Wellness products. Guided by our Medical Advisory Board, dTERRA uses only top development and manufacturing partners who maintain Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification and enjoy industry reputation for superior innovation and quality. Each dTERRA product is guaranteed to exceed customer satisfaction and performance expectations. doterra.com 7CPTG\u00aeEssential Oil Uses Essential oils are used for a very wide range of applications. They can be used individually or in complex blends depending on user experience and desired benefit. Essential oils are usually administered by one of three methods: diffused aromatically, applied topically to the skin, or taken internally as dietary supplements. Using essential oils can be both profoundly simple and life changing at the same time. Working with someone who has used essential oils before will help first-time users have a more beneficial and enjoyable experience. Essential oils are naturally safe and have few, if any, undesirable side effects when used as directed. They are, however, powerfully concentrated and should be used with care. Be sure to use only pure essential oils and follow all label warnings and instructions. Essential oils should never be used in the eyes or inside the ear canal. If redness or irritation occurs when using essential oils topically, apply a vegetable oil such as Fractionated Coconut Oil to the affected area\u2014water will not dilute essential oils. Consult your physician before using essential oils if you are pregnant or under a doctor's care. Look for the following symbols by the essential oil product descriptions in this product guide to help you with your oil selection. (Use instructions and appropriate cautions are included on individual essential oil labels.) 8 Essential Wellnes sPlease note, some products can be used in multiple ways.
