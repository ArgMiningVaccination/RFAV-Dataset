Through your active myBeaumontChart , an invitation will be sent to you to schedule an appointment. The invitations are sent out using a randomized process and only to those that meet the eligibility criteria. As more appointment times and vaccines become available, more invitations will be sent. In addition to the Beaumont Service Center in Southfield, Beaumont has opened additional vaccine clinics at the health system's Troy and Dearborn campuses. These clinics will remain operational as vaccines are available.

We have created a robust, regularly updated, website with Frequently Asked Questions about the vaccine: www.beaumont.org/covid-vaccine Common Myths and Answers About COVID-19 Vaccines Beaumont experts help set the record straight on some common COVID-19 vaccine myths and questions that can undermine the science and research that went into the development. MYTH : The vaccine was rushed, so it's probably not safe. FACT: The United States Food and Drug Administration closely monitored research by Pfizer and Moderna as the two companies worked toward a vaccine. The research suggests both vaccines have very little, if any, side effects, and is approximately 95% effective. Additionally, the FDA has rigorous scientific and regulatory processes in place to facilitate development and ensure the safety, effectiveness and quality of COVID-19 vaccines. In addition, Beaumont Health established a Vaccine Review Subcommittee comprised of experts in Infection Prevention, Research, Nursing and Pharmacy that will review all available data and make a recommendation to the Vaccine Steering Committee about proceeding to offer vaccine to employees, physicians and the community. Beaumont is committed to ensuring any vaccine provided to employees and the community is deemed safe by our expert panel. Dr. Nick Gilpin, infectious disease specialist and chief medical officer for Beaumont Hospital Grosse Pointe, received the first vaccination at Beaumont.February 2021 Beaumont Health Foundation Insights MYTH: I'll get the first round of vaccine, but I won't need the second. FACT: There are some viruses and some bacteria that we vaccinate against and one dose of the vaccine just doesn't provide full immunity to prevent illness. Priming your immune system with the first dose allows it to react to it once, create some memory and then when you get exposed to it a second time through the second vaccination, it really develops that full, long-term memory. MYTH: Because vaccines are available, the pandemic is over. FACT: According to the CDC, while experts learn more about the protection COVID-19 vaccines provide under real-life conditions, it will be important for everyone to continue using all the tools available to us to help stop this pandemic, like covering your mouth and nose with a mask, washing hands often, and staying at least six feet away from others. Together, COVID-19 vaccination and following CDC's recommendations for how to protect yourself and others will offer the best protection from getting and spreading COVID-19. MYTH: If I get vaccinated for COVID -19, I'll be more vulnerable to illnesses. FACT: While the COVID-19 vaccine will work to teach your immune system to recognize and protect against coronavirus, it is not proven to make you vulnerable to other illnesses. You may experience the typical sore arm, slight fever or aches, but that's a sign your immune system is active and getting ready to protect you against COVID-19, if necessary. MYTH: The vaccine changes your D NA. FACT: The vaccine does not change your DNA. It's called an mRNA vaccine, which is a type of vaccine that causes your cells to make an inactive part of virus that triggers an immune response. That immune response is what protects us from getting infected if the real COVID-19 virus enters our bodies. Q: If we had a positive COVID-19 test but developed no antibodies, can we receive the vaccination? A: At this time, the guidelines recommend that individuals who have had COVID-19 in the last 90 days still get the vaccine but are a lower priority than others who haven't had COVID-19. So yes, those who have had a positive COVID-19 test are still eligible, albeit in a lower prioritization if within the last 90 days. Q: Why did I need to get two doses of the vaccine? What happens if I don't get my second shot? A: There are some viruses and bacteria that we vaccinate against that one dose of the vaccine just doesn't provide full immunity in order to prevent illness if you were to be exposed to it, whereas priming the system allows your immune system to react to it once, create some memory and, when exposed to it a second time, it really develops that full, long term memory. Q: What are the differences and similarities between the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines? A: Both vaccines are about 95% effective. Pfizer and Moderna had a fair and comparable spread of races and ethnicities included in the clinical trials. There does not appear to be any significant differences in vaccine effectiveness between the two brands. For the Pfizer vaccine, the first and second dose should be approximately 21 days apart and is recommended for ages 16 and up. For the Moderna vaccine, the first and second dose should be approximately 28 days apart and is recommended for ages 18 and up. Both vaccines have the same side effects listed with the CDC. The most common side effects include tiredness, headache and chills.
