Aromatherapy + $10 Cupping Adding cupping to your massage can create more relief in less time. We massage the muscles with oil first. This provides the initial loosening effect. We then use silicone cups to suction onto the body. The silicone cups can maintain suction while going over bony landmarks such as the spine, shoulder blades, hips, etc. This is a great way to break up scar tissue, provide myofascial release and drastically increase range of motion in your \"stuck\" areas. *Cupping cannot be added to prenatal or hot stone massages and not all therapists are certified to do cupping. Cupping + $15 Body Gua Sha Gua Sha is a Chinese Medicine name that describes muscle scraping. 'Gua' means to scrape and 'Sha' is the reddening of the skin that appears as a result of the scraping. A smooth-edged tool is used with oil to scrape over a tight muscle or an area that is restricted with scar tissue or knots in the muscle. Repetitively going over the muscle with this tool helps to loosen the tight muscle, bring fresh oxygenated blood to the area, break up scar tissue and promote healing. Your therapist will stop working on an area once some of the reddening has appeared. It is not necessary to overly scrape the area until it is purple. Gua Sha does not cause the skin barrier to break or bleed. *Not all therapists are trained in body gua sha.
