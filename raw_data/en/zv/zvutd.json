See the published version at https://doi.org/10.1186/s12961-021-00698-x.Page 3/17Abstract Background With increased penetration of the internet and social media, there are concerns regarding its negative role in in\u0000uencing parents' decisions regarding vaccination for their children. It is perceived that a mix of religious reasons and propaganda by anti-vaccination groups on social media are lowering the vaccination coverage in Malappuram district of Kerala. We undertook a qualitative study to understand the factors responsible for generating and perpetuating vaccine hesitancy; to understand the pathways of trust de\u0000cit in immunization programs; and to understand the interaction between various social media actors. Methods In-depth interviews and focus group discussions conducted among parents/caregivers, physicians, public sector health staff, alternate system medical practitioners, \u0000eld healthcare workers, and teachers in areas with highest and lowest vaccination coverage in the district as well as with communication experts. Results The trust-de\u0000cit between parents/caregivers and healthcare providers is created by multiple factors such as providers' lack of technical knowledge, existing patriarchal societal norms, and vaccine critical views of naturopaths and homeopaths. Anti-vaccine groups use social media to in\u0000uence caregivers' perceptions and beliefs. Religion does not appear to play a major role in creating vaccine resistance in this setting. Conclusions A long-term, multi-pronged strategy should be adopted to address the trust de\u0000cit. In the short to medium term, health sector can focus on appropriate and targeted vaccine related communication strategies including the use of infographics, soft skill development of health workers, technical competency improvement through a mobile application-based repository of information, and creation of a cell to monitor vaccine related conversations in social media and intervene if needed. Background An emerging body of evidence suggests that anti-vaccination campaigns within social media and by some alternate medical practitioners including naturopaths and homeopaths negatively in\u0000uence immunization [1-3]. De\u0000ciency in trust of healthcare providers and of mainstream medicine is a major determinant of resistance to vaccination [4].Vaccine hesitancy refers to delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability of vaccination services.[5] On, the other hand, the term 'vaccine resistance' refer to a 'conscious decision to refuse the recommended vaccination', or 'the arguments critical ofPage 4/17vaccination policy', and implies a collective action, at times stemming from a 'fundamental opposition to the dominant biomedical understanding of health and disease' [6, 7] Knowledge level of health workers on vaccines and their con\u0000dence in their ability to communicate effectively to parents about vaccines, are important factors which can in\u0000uence vaccine acceptance, along with trust, attitudes and beliefs [8]. In addition, the emergence of social media enables people with anti-vaccine beliefs to generate, consume and share information [9]. The South Indian state of Kerala has signi\u0000cantly reduced mortality and morbidity due to vaccine- preventable diseases (VPDs) and has brought down infant mortality to 6 per 1000 live births [10]. However, VPDs are re-emerging in Malappuram District in northern Kerala. In 2016, 229 cases of Diphtheria were reported from the district including two deaths [11, 12]. As per the National Family Health Survey (NFHS)2015-16, while Kerala had 82% fully immunized children, the corresponding \u0000gures for Malappuram was 70.6%; with a well pronounced urban and rural difference (61.1% and 80. 2% respectively) [13]. The decline in full immunization coverage in the district was accompanied by a decrease in coverage of most individual vaccines. Coverage in urban areas was consistently lower than in rural areas. Another recent survey found that Malappuram district had 23,912 out of 342,657 under-\u0000ve- children who were not fully immunized, and 36% of children aged 5-10 years had no immunizations [13]. Kerala is the \u0000rst digital state in India, has the highest mobile penetration (more than 30 million connections for a population of 33 million) with an internet penetration rate of 37% [14, 15]. Malappuram Municipality offers free Wi-Fi to the citizens [16]. However, there is increasing concern among public health workers and administrators that access to social media is increasingly in\u0000uencing vaccine decisions as has been reported in other contexts experiencing a similar upsurge in social media use [17, 18]. In Malappuram, this is particularly worrying in the context of lower vaccination coverage [19, 20]. One major constraint in dealing with anti-vaccine social media messages, is the inadequate capacity among health workers to respond to these messages, as per literature [21, 22]. But this has not been studied in the context of Kerala which has a well-functioning health system comparable to some of the developed countries. The factors responsible for the resistance and trust de\u0000cit are not clearly understood in the context of social media usage. A clearer understanding of the interaction between various social media actors and the pathways involved in generating trust de\u0000cit is needed in order to technically empower the health workers. This study therefore aimed to explore the factors responsible for generating and perpetuating vaccine hesitancy and mistrust in the immunization program in Malappuram district in the context of emerging anti-vaccine social media campaigns and to understand how the trust de\u0000cit between caregivers and health workers in\u0000uences caregivers' decisions on child vaccination. MethodsPage 5/17We used qualitative methods speci\u0000cally in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs). The objective was to gain understanding of the social, and health system factors in the context of increased social media usage and how social media messages contribute to development of vaccine hesitancy and mistrust in the immunization program. In addition, we also did quantitative content analysis of the vaccine related Information Education Communication (IEC) materials and anti-vaccine YouTube videos, which will be published separately. The study was conducted in four health sub-center (HSC) areas under the Nilambur taluk of Malappuram district in Kerala state of India. These HSCs were selected from the catchment areas of two Primary Health Centers (PHC): one PHC area with the highest (98.9%) and the other with the lowest (79%) vaccination coverage. Each of the PHCs had 5 HSCs and we randomly selected two HSCs under each PHC. Malappuram is the most populous district in the state (41.13 million; 2011 census) [23]. The Muslim majority (70.24%) district literacy rate of 93.57% (males: 95.76%, females: 91.62%) [23] and a total of 124 public health institutions including 20 community health centers (CHC), 20 primary health centers (PHCs) always open, and 66 other PHCs [24]. Study participants IDIs were conducted among doctors from various disciplines (modern medicine, homeopathy and naturopathy), schoolteachers, religious leaders (Muslim, Hindu and Christian) and communication campaign experts. Separate FGDs were conducted with caregivers (mother, father, grandfather or grandmother) of vaccinated children and with partially vaccinated/unvaccinated children, modern medicine doctors, public health nurses and Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) workers. We de\u0000ned children (aged 0-2 years) as partially vaccinated when they missed one or more National Immunization Program (NIP) vaccines for the age, as unvaccinated when they missed all vaccinations for their age in the program, and as vaccinated when they received all vaccinations as per the program. Data collection Prior to data collection, permission was obtained from the Government of Kerala and the District Medical O\u0000cer (DMO), Malappuram. For IDIs with providers, religious heads and schoolteachers, respondents were selected through purposive sampling with the help of panchayath (local government) and health authorities in the respective study areas. Face-to-face IDIs were conducted at their o\u0000ces, ensuring privacy and con\u0000dentiality. Communication campaign experts were identi\u0000ed through the websites of national and international health organizations and IDIs were done through emails after obtaining consent. FGDs with health care workers were conducted in the respective PHC or health sub-centers. Using the list of vaccination status of children under 2 years obtained from the PHCs as a sample frame, we identi\u0000ed houses with vaccinated, partial or unvaccinated children and invited consecutive caregivers for interviews. In case of refusals, the next eligible household in the list was included and this process was continued until 8-12 respondents were achieved in each FGD group. FGDs with caregivers ofPage 6/17vaccinated and partially vaccinated /unvaccinated children were conducted separately at Anganwadi (village level pre-school childcare) centers. All IDIs and FGDs were audio recorded without any personal identi\u0000ers. Data was collected between November 2017 and March 2018 till it was felt that saturation was achieved as no new themes or trends were emerging. Data analysis After transcription and translation, KRN and SS did the content analysis. The responses were repeatedly read to identify frequently reported patterns with similarity and differences. These transcripts along with \u0000eld notes were used to code and categorize in order to conceptualize the conversations into themes. They also read the information and \u0000eld notes in order to cross-check and \u0000nalize the themes and prepared an abridged transcript related to the research question. A process of triangulation was attempted by constantly referring to the \u0000eld notes prepared by the researchers. KRN and SS did this entire process manually and the emergent themes were discussed with other authors to re\u0000ne the themes. This process enabled the authors to identify the three main themes-social factors, service delivery factors and factors related to health workers as discussed below. Results In total, we held 34 IDIs and 22 FGDs with 252 respondents. We held IDIs with government and private physicians (n=4), Homeopathic and Naturopathic practitioners (n=8), schoolteachers (n=4), religious health o\u0000cials (n=2) and communication experts(n=4). The FGDs were conducted among caregivers of vaccinated(n=8) and unvaccinated children (n=8), private physicians (n =2), public health nurses(n=2) and ASHA workers (n=2). Details of the respondents are given in Table 1.Page 7/17Table 1 Details of study participants In-depth interviews (N=34, Females-14)Government physiciansTwo; one per study area, both females Private physicians Two; one per study area, both males Homeopathic practitionersFour; two per study area, three females Naturopathic practitionersFour; two per study area, all females School teachers Four; two per study area, two males and two females Religious heads All males Muslim- Four, two per study area Hindu- Four, two per study area Christian- Four, two per study area Communication expertsThree males out of total four District o\u0000cers Two females; one medical and one immunization o\u0000cer Focus group discussion (N=218, Females-128 (One FGD per group per study area)Caregivers of vaccinated childrenMothers- 12 participants per FGD Fathers- 12 in FGD1 and 8 in FGD 2 Grandfathers- 10 in FGD1 and 9 in FGD 2 Grandmothers- 10 participants per FGD Caregivers of un-vaccinated childrenMothers- 12 in FGD1 and 8 in FGD 2 Fathers- 10 participants per FGD Grandfathers-8 in FGD1 and 12 in FGD 2 Grandmothers- 11 in FGD1 and 9 in FGD 2 Private physicians 8 in FGD1 and 9 in FGD 2 Public health nurses 8 in FGD1 and 9 in FGD 2 ASHA workers 11 in FGD1 and 10 in FGD 2 The IDIs and FGDs were analyzed thematically to \u0000nd out the factors leading to the trust de\u0000cit between caregivers and health workers with respect to vaccination in the context of emergence of social media campaigns. Personal factors (religion, patriarchal societal structure of the study area); the presence of an anti- vaccine group (inclusive of certain individuals practicing alternative systems of medicine; in\u0000uence of the anti- vaccine views of international anti- vaccine groups); health system factors (lack of trust onPage 8/17the health system by caregivers and the inability of the health system staff to address the doubts and concerns of the caregivers regarding vaccination) are the main three themes which emerged from the analysis. The complete set of themes and narratives are available as supplementary material to this article. The three themes were divided into sub-themes and are summarized below with a few selected relevant quotes. Social factors Issues related to faith and religion- Most caregivers were of the opinion that religion does not play a negative role in the decision to vaccinate. However, many providers suggested that certain communities or sects within the Muslim and Christian religions do not believe in taking medications or vaccination. They (religious leaders) usually tell us to take vaccination. Mother of unvaccinated child, FGD, Study area 2 A group of Muslims do not believe in medicines and treatment. For them, Allah is the one who gives diseases to the child and if the child dies, it's Allah's destiny. They ask why they should try to change that destiny by using vaccines. FGD, ASHAs, Study area 1 Patriarchy-Mothers of unvaccinated children opined that husbands usually make the decision to vaccinate the children or not- even if the mother is willing to give vaccination. An interesting feature is that the male heads of many of these families work in middle east countries. These men seem to be negatively in\u0000uenced by anti-vaccine social media messages. The main decision makers of the family are fathers... The only media they have access to...is social media like WhatsApp.... They are mostly non-resident Keralites.... Newspapers and television are the main source of positive messages on vaccination. Social media is mostly spreading negative messages on vaccination. FGD, Fathers of vaccinated children, Study area 1 Past negative experiences and doubts- Negative experiences with regard to vaccination were found to be a major concern of caregivers. They also have doubts regarding the need for vaccination for a healthy child. My child was very active before vaccination. After that particular vaccination, he couldn't move his leg. This is the main reason for not taking my younger child for vaccination. Father of unvaccinated child, FGD, Study area 1 We need to treat only when the child is affected with disease. What is the point in taking prior medication?Page 9/17Mother of unvaccinated child, FGD, Study area 2 Access to internet and social media-Many respondents said that they are exposed to both positive and negative vaccine related messages through social media like WhatsApp, Facebook, and YouTube videos which make them confused regarding which decision to make. The anti-vaccine groups propagate negative messages focused on \"horrifying side effects\" of vaccination, depopulation, international lobbying and the presence of harmful contents in vaccines. \"Which view are we, the less educated people, supposed to believe? If he (anti vaccine naturopath) is spreading false information, the government should take proper action. Then we will have more trust in the government health department.\" -Mother of unvaccinated child, FGD, Study area 2 Negative messages get more visibility and circulation at all times. Communication Expert, IDI Service delivery factors Lack of trust by caregivers- Many respondents refused vaccination because of their lack of trust in the allopathic system of medicine. Also, they were concerned about vaccine administration procedures. \"Regarding vaccination, I have no trust in allopathy. I follow homeopathy which is giving good results.\" - Father of unvaccinated child, Study area 1 We don't know whether they are keeping vaccines in ice boxes or not. I doubt the quality Father of unvaccinated child, FGD, Study area 2 Factors related to health workers- Field level health workers themselves expressed their lack of information and training to respond to the queries and doubts posed by caregivers, especially in response to negative messages in social media. Lack of coordination between different systems of medicine with regard to vaccination is another issue. We \u0000nd it di\u0000cult to convince the laymen about the science behind vaccination. It is a very complex one and we are not trained. ASHA, FGD, Study area 1 Discussion Based on the \u0000ndings, we developed a framework to explain the trust de\u0000cit of caregivers in the district of Malappuram (Fig. 1). As compared to the Complacency, Convenience and Con\u0000dence (3Cs) model and the 2014 WHO- SAGE group Determinants of Vaccine Hesitancy Matrix report [25], our data suggest social media usage as a key factor in the framework which drives vaccine hesitancy in the study area. Social factors like caregivers' faith and religion, patriarchy, negative experiences and doubts of caregivers and their access to the internet and social media in\u0000uence the trust of caregivers. Furthermore, the anti-Page 10/17vaccine in\u0000uencers affect caregivers' decisions through extensive utilization of social media platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp and YouTube to propagate their ideas. As reported in many other contexts, health system related factors also in\u0000uence the complex issue of resistance to immunization and the trust of caregivers in these programs. Here, the general lack of trust of public health care services, which is dominated by allopathic medicine; is extended to the realm of immunization services. The inability of the health care workers to clarify queries about vaccination adds to furthering the mistrust of caregivers. The role of religion and faith is considered as a key player in the decision to vaccinate in studies around the world including India [26, 27]. However, our study results show that individual's faith and religion were not de\u0000nitive factors regarding decision-making. However, vaccine-resistance related beliefs exist in the community; especially prominent was the belief that vaccination is part of a depopulation agenda for certain communities with differential vaccine vials for different communities. It is also seen that external forces such as any authority, advisors or technology do not in\u0000uence certain resistant areas; they are inherently resistant and hold a different worldview on health and medicine. This is in contrast to the scenario which exists in other parts of Kerala with high vaccination coverage [28]. Past negative experiences also play a key role in the decision to vaccinate. Most parents are concerned about the side- effects, along with the impact of vaccination on natural immunity of children. These concerns are largely a product of their interactions with indigenous practitioners and naturopaths, and contributes to vaccine resistance and hesitancy, as reported in previous studies [29, 30]. Milieu of vaccine related doubts prevail in the global media [31, 32]. This is re\u0000ected in the local media too, which has added to vaccine resistance among caregivers. Another key factor is the in\u0000uence of patriarchy in the decision to vaccinate [33]. This may be linked to religion also, though only in a limited sense because it is largely a social reality that fathers are the decision-makers in many families and therefore patriarchal norms cut across religions. In most cases, these are absentee fathers who work in Middle Eastern countries who obtain their information against vaccination through the internet and social media, such as Facebook and WhatsApp [34]. Since they are casual visitors to the district, health workers do not get a chance to communicate with them and often the well- educated and well-off mothers are not able to convince the absent fathers and the present grandfathers of the household to give permission for child vaccination. In this context, the in\u0000ux of anti-vaccine messages which are widely accessible through social media is a key factor [35, 36]. Anti-vaccine groups including naturopaths and homeopaths use retracted and withdrawn journal articles from the past as well as edited and manipulated videos which highlight trivial and known short- term adverse effects like fever, excessive crying and restlessness and non-associated problems like paralysis, allergy, tiredness, weakness and use them as arguments to abstain from vaccination. Such negative messages are widely circulated by social media. At the same time, anti- vaccine activists in Kerala also exhibit \"denialism\", as explained by Diethelm and McKee [36]. Anti-vaccine lobbyists use \"rhetorical arguments to give the appearance of legitimate debate and unresolved debate about matters generally considered to be settled\" and in the process, use and create untrue reports, views, expert opinions and results to maintain the \"conspiracy theory\" regarding vaccination [31, 32, 37]. In ourPage 11/17study, an important driver that contributed to mistrust is the role of naturopathy and homeopathy, which openly criticize vaccination. Parents who follow such systems are given wrong information to create an impression that allopathic medicine has many side-effects which leads to mistrust. This was also reported in other parts of the world [38]. From the service delivery point of view, it was noted that there is a lack of trust in the public health sector, in all levels of care. Parents expressed concerns regarding vaccine safety, especially related to vaccination storage during mass vaccination campaigns. Lack of trust is worsened when the health workers (ASHAs and Anganwadi workers) are unable to answer the questions and concerns of caregivers. Health workers lack of training and preparedness in managing di\u0000cult conversations with vaccine resistant caregivers, limited knowledge about vaccines and lack of speci\u0000c training for such situations contribute to trust issues [38]. Respondents felt that the health workers reach out to only on vaccine related matters, which creates mistrust. Doubts persist as to why the government is 'so overtly interested' in only vaccinating the children and not in other issues of public health relevance. Heightened campaigns by the public health system staff during mass vaccination programs also led to suspicions and hesitancy among the caregivers. In the local setting, allopathic practitioners are largely curative-oriented, giving less priority to stress on healthy life-style practices such as exercise, walking etc. This leads to the wrong impression that such healthy practices belong to the alternate systems of medicine. Furthermore, there is lack of coordination between different systems of medicine within the government health system, especially when practitioners of certain alternate systems have a different viewpoint on vaccines Limitations of the study The results of the study are relevant to countries and contexts with relatively higher internet coverage and social media usage. Most of the health workers we interviewed belonged to the public sector. However, in most health systems, immunization is a service largely delivered by the public sector. Furthermore, we collected data from all relevant stakeholders at the household level (fathers, mothers, grandfathers and grandmothers) which should have given us enough information on the demand side factors in the decision-making process. Conclusions The trust-de\u0000cit between parents/caregivers and healthcare providers is created by multiple factors such as providers' lack of technical knowledge, existing patriarchal societal norms, and vaccine critical views of naturopaths and homeopaths. Anti-vaccine groups use social media to in\u0000uence caregivers' perceptions and beliefs. Religion does not appear to play a major role in creating vaccine resistance in this setting. Addressing the issue of trust de\u0000cit is a challenging task and requires a multi-pronged, long-term strategy. However, we propose four practical interventions from the health sector point of view, that can give results in short to medium term. One, develop appropriate and targeted vaccine related communication strategies including the use of infographics, that can be shared through social media platforms. Two,Page 12/17enable health workers through soft skill training programs so that they can address the anti-vaccine propaganda with con\u0000dence. Three, enhance their technical competence on vaccines through a mobile application-based repository of information and FAQs. Finally, start a social media cell for the Department of Health with the responsibility to monitor vaccine related conversations in social media and intervene if needed.
