Levesque MPH, CPhT Adult Immunization & Quality Assurance Coordinator Maine Immunization Program February 23, 2018 This webinar is being brought to you by the Maine Immunization Program (MIP), part of Maine CDC, Department of Health & Human Services. There is no continuing education available. MIP has no relationship with vaccine manufacturers or distributers. All information within this webinar is up-to-date as of February 23, 2018. Please refer to the manufacturers websites for additional updates. Reminders & Housekeeping 2 Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention At the end of this webinar, participants will be able to: 1. Describe Shingles, how the disease progresses, and identify risk factors, symptoms, and complications from the disease. 2. Discuss the two vaccines available for Shingles including, but not limited to: storage and handling requirements, indications and the new ACIP recommendations. 3. Understand why Shingrixis now recommended over Zostavax.4. Talk with patients about why they should receive Shingrixvaccine. Objectives 3 Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention Shingles is a viral infection primarily characteriz ed by a painful rash located on the head or torso, usually on one side of the body. Anyone who has gotten the Chickenpox can get Shingles -even children. Symptoms: -Pain, itching or tingling of the skin -Rash of blister-like sores -Fever, headache, chills (~20% of patients) -Upset stomach Shingles 4 Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention Source: US CDC, NFID If a patient had Chickenpox as a child, the Herpes Zoster (HZ) virus is already inside their body. -Patients who never had the Chickenpox disease do not have the HZ virus inside their body, however the Chickenpox, or HZ, virus may be contracted through contact w ith an infected person. -Current research suggests the patients that have never had Chickenpox would benefit from vaccination. As the body ages the immune system cannot suppress the HZ virus as well, causing the virus to flare and symptoms to develop. About 1 in 3 people will develop Shingles at age 60 or older. -That's about 1 million cases per year Shingles 5 Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention Source: US CDC, NFID Risk Factors: -Increasing age -Female (increased risk) -White (risk is 2x higher in whites than African Ame ricans) -Trauma/surgery in affected dermatome Shingles 6 Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention Source: US CDC, NFID Image: http://infectioncontrol.ucsfmedicalcenter.or g/education CK6 LA6Slide 6 CK6 balance the and graphics vs white space) Coaty, Kristen, 1/25/2018 LA6 Added graphic to help explain what a dermatome is Levesque, Ashley, 1/29/2018Shingles 7 Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention Source: US CDC Those who have Shingles should avoid contact with the following people: -Pregnant women who have never had Chickenpox or the Varicella vaccine -Premature or low birth weight infants -Those with a weakened immune system There are currently no recommendations to stay home from work or school Transmission of Shingles virus is less contagious than Chickenpox. -Only contagious before blisters have crusted Covering the rash greatly minimizes risk of transmission. Shingles 8 Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention Source: US CDC Blisters will begin to scab over in 7 - 10 days and the rash typically clears in 2 - 4 weeks. Treatment is fairly limited: -Acyclovir, Best 'treatment' is prevention! Treatment 9 Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention Source: US CDC All children should receive two doses of Varicella vaccine per ACIP Recommendations. Adults should receive Shingles vaccine whether they had the Chickenpox or not. Two vaccines available in the US: -Zostavax -Shingrix Prevention 10 Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention Live Attenuated Zoster Vaccine Licensed in 2006 for those 60 years old and older Must be kept frozen Single dose administered subcutaneously Is 51% effective against HZ -Only ~35% effective for those over 70 -Immunity wanes after 1-2 years Efficacy is 67% for postherpeticneuralgia (PHN) Low uptake for the vaccine, only about 30% of popul ation vaccinated Contraindicated for people with immunosuppression Zostavax 11 Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention Source: NFID, US CDC Adjuvanted Recombinant Zoster Vaccine Licensed October 2017 for those 50 years old and ol der Must be refrigerated -antigen component must be mix ed with adjuvant suspension 2 dose series administered intramuscularly in the d eltoid and 0 and 2-6 months. Efficacy for HZ amongst the 4 groups studied ranges : 91.3% -97.9% Expected to potentially prevent 53,000 cases of Shi ngles and 4,000 cases of PHN per year. Contraindications: History of severe allergic react ions to components of the vaccine or after 1 st dose. Additional studies are currently being conduc ted with individuals with immunosuppression. Shingrix 12 Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention and GSK related complicatio ns for immunocompetent adults aged 50 years and older. -Prevention of HZ and related complications for immu nocompetent adults who previously received zoster vaccine live (Zostav ax) Shingrixis preferred over Zostavaxfor the prevention of HZ and related complications. US CDC accepted this ACIP Recommendation on January 26, 2018. New ACIP Recommendation October 2017 13 Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention Source: NFID Vaccine efficacy against HZ and PHN is much higher in Shingrix -Current data suggests high efficacy in ALL age grou ps studied over 4 years Ages 50-80 -Efficacy for HZ amongst the 4 PHN is 67% Efficacy unknown for just 1 dose Why The Change of Recommendation? 14 Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention Source: NFID All data currently shows there is no increased risk of adverse events. Most common events were site reactions and systemic symptoms which usually resolved in 2-4 days. Need additional safety data, but the vaccine is considered safe to use now with your patients. Need more data on co-administration with other vaccines. Safety Profile 15 Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention Source: NFID Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention 16 Administration Safety Source: US CDC Patient refusal should be considered temporary - be sure to assess why the patient is refusing vaccination at EVERY visit. May be accomplished by: -Take an extra minute to find out why patient is ref using. -Make a firm, positive recommendation to get the vac cine. -Refer to another Provider if needed to finish serie s or for cost concerns. Example: Refer patient to pharmacy for 2 nd dose NFID Shingles Toolkit VIS - Zoster Recombinant published 2/12/2018 Talking With Patients About Shingrix 17 Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention Source: NFID Remember, Shingrixis a 2-dose series Tips to vaccinate all adults aged 50 and older against Shingles: -Give the patient an appointment card. -Use recall reminders prior to 2 nd appointment. -Assess dose completion of series-dosed vaccines at each patient encounter. -Offer vaccines in the late afternoon, evening & wee kends. -Partner with other Provider to complete the series. -Designate an Immunization Champion within your prac tice.
