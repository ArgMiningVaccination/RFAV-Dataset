Migraines can be caused by food sensitivities, environmental toxicities, candida infection, trauma (concussion), and/or nutrient deficiencies (among other things). In a functional medicine approach, we work to treat the cause vs. just the symptom or health concern. When a patient comes in with a migraine, the focus is not just giving them a pain reliever or anti-inflammatory to remove the pain of the migraine, but to address the cause of the migraine itself. So if someone with a migraine had mold toxicity, they would continue to experience a migraine despite the pain medications, until the mold toxicity was addressed. Understanding the patient's story provides us the information for investigating the cause and assessment is done with the appropriate lab test listed (circles). We also keep in mind that one trigger can cause many health concerns. In treating the patient with the migraine, there may be other health concerns that arise related to the triggers. This allows us to treat the patient comprehensively and holistically. Oftentimes, patients are surprised that the symptoms that they have, seemingly unrelated, can be connected to the same triggers. Naturopathic medicine is based on the belief that the human body has an innate healing ability. Naturopathic physicians teach individuals to use diet, exercise, lifestyle changes and cutting-edge natural therapies to enhance their bodies' abilities to prevent and treat disease. They view a person as a complex, interrelated system or as a whole person, and not as a disease or a constellation of symptoms. Therefore, identifying the cause of illness is necessary as it may be expressed by a variety of imbalances as the body attempts to compensate. Therefore, every individual's treatment plan is comprehensive and tailored to his or her specific health concerns, unlike others. Naturopathic physicians are trained as primary health care practitioners at accredited four-year medical universities, whose diverse therapeutic techniques include a blend the best of modern medical science and traditional natural medical approaches to not only identify and treat the causes of illness, but to also restore health. Naturopathic physicians also have advanced training in clinical nutrition, botanical medicine, counseling and homeopathy. The first visit with the physician may be one hour or more in length. A very extensive history is taken to gather information about your physical, mental, emotional and spiritual health. THE PRINCIPLES OF NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE The following principles are founded on medical tradition and scientific evidence: The Healing Power of Nature The body has the inherent ability to establish, restore and maintain health. Naturopathic doctors act to identify and remove the obstacles to recovery and to facilitate and augment this healing ability. First, Do No Harm Utilize low-risk procedures and medical substances - such as nutritional supplements, herbal extracts, dietary and lifestyle counseling - minimizing the risk of harmful side effects; When possible, do not suppress symptoms, which may be the body's efforts to heal itself; Acknowledge and respect the individual's healing process, using the least possible force or intervention necessary to diagnose illness and restore health. Find the Cause Symptoms are expressions of the body's attempt to heal, but are not the cause of illness. Underlying causes of illness must be identified and removed before complete recovery can occur, rather than just treat or merely suppress symptoms. Treat the Whole Person Naturopathic doctors diagnose the cause of illness and customize treatments for each individual by taking into account the complex interrelationship of the physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social and spiritual aspects of health. Every person communicates and heals in different ways and the doctor respects one's differences Doctor as Teacher One of the main objectives of naturopathic medicine is to educate and work closely with individuals and emphasize self-responsibility for health. In addition to thoroughly explaining the reason for one's illness and specific treatments, Naturopathic doctors teach individuals how to eat, exercise, relax and nurture themselves physically and emotionally. Prevention Preventative medicine and education can save money, discomfort or suffering, and lives. Naturopathic doctors emphasize disease prevention, assessment of risk factors and hereditary susceptibility to disease and make appropriate interventions to prevent illness. Naturopathic medicine strives to create a healthy world in which humanity may thrive. "}
