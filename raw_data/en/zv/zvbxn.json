The space's monochromatic scheme isn't a style statement. In fact, it's the opposite. In color psychology, the ashen shade represents neutrality and balance\u2014which also happens to mirror the ethos of Remedy Place. Founded by Dr. Jonathan Leary, [Remedy Place](https://remedyplace.com/) is a \"social wellness club.\" (Let Leary himself define that for you: \"It's a club that is temptation and toxin-free, that enhances health and social life at the same time.) There's no gym equipment, massage tables, or beauty offerings. Instead, there's an extensive array of holistic treatments. Facilities include an infrared light sauna, acupuncture and cupping rooms, cryo chambers, hyperbaric chambers (they're different!), and ice baths, just to name a few. Some experiences are solitary, but many can be done with friends. For example, those aforementioned ice baths are offered in group classes, where an instructor guides attendees through 10 minutes of holotropic breath work followed by six minutes submerged in 38-degree water. Meanwhile, the vitamin IV suites are arranged so two people can sit facing each other while taking intramuscular B-12 shots. Leary, who has his doctorate in chiropractic and alternative medicine, developed Remedy Place while he was a concierge doctor in Los Angeles. His practice catered to those seeking a nonsurgical approach to chronic pain rehabilitation and attracted an impressive clientele of celebrities, CEOs, and pro athletes. Leary realized two things: One, although they loved the results they saw from adapting such a health-focused lifestyle, many found it isolating, as so much of social life and dating traditionally revolves around going out and drinking. Two: His patients felt emotionally better getting treated in their homes, which aided their physical recovery. \"I found how important the environment was to their healing process,\" says Leary, who saw a need to create a comforting, well-designed place where people could also be around friends. \"It needed not just to be self-care, but social self-care,\" he says. (Fittingly, at Remedy Place, the furniture is fashionable yet functional\u2014a tubular couch, for example, is completely ergodynamic.) Another desire of Leary's was to devise a public space where anyone could explore alternative treatments for their health. In that spirit, Remedy Place also offers functional medicine consultations, where a trained medical professional examines factors like diet, genetics, and lifestyle components when treating pain and illness. The first Remedy Place opened in West Hollywood in 2019. It drew an impressive crowd that included everyone from Kacey Musgraves to Rita Ora to Sean White\u2014even creating a pop-up at Kourtney Kardashian's home. Today, a second outpost opens in the Flatiron District. Visitors can book \u00e0 la carte services or, if they wish, opt for a membership, which offers a package of treatments each month. (The levels range from 595 a month to 2750.) Wellness, more and more, is becoming a communal endeavor: in addition to Remedy Place, [Heimat, a private health club](https://www.vogue.com/article/heimat-wellness-club-los-angeles) that includes expansive fitness spaces, a Martin Brudnizki-designed restaurant, and a lounge, opened recently in Los Angeles. \"The most important part of self-care is human "}
