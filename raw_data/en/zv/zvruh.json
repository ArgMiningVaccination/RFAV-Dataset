You may find yourself spending more time replaying an endless loop of thoughts and emotions in your mind than noticing how your body is feeling. Over-thinking your emotions can leave you feeling more disconnected and unable to recognize the messages your body is sending you. The thoughts and feelings you spend a lot of time discussing or analyzing seem to continue to return again and again, increasing the discomfort in your body. The repetitive cycle of concern and pain is getting in the way of your relationships, your work, or how you perceive yourself. Loneliness starts to creep in. You know your mind and body are connected, yet you continue to feel miserable and confused, and your life may feel unmanageable. The truth is you deserve to live a healthy life: mind, body, and emotions on the same team. You deserve to be connected with your whole self to access your best self. If you don't take action and continue ignoring the signals your body is sending you, things could get worse. The gap between your mind and body can widen, creating even more confusion. Your internal discomfort can grow into feeling physically numb. Your self-perception remains diminished. The disconnection could persist, but if you reach out, things could begin to change and start getting better. You are in the right place.
