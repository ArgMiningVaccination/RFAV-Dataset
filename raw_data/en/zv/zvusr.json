Previously we described hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC)-based rheologically structured gel vehicles (RSVs) for vaginal immunization of an HIV-1 vaccine candidate, a soluble recombinant trimeric HIV-1 clade-C envelope glycoprotein designated CN54gp140. Here we investigated the efcacy of lyophilized solid dosage formulations (LSDFs) for prolonging antigen stability and as i.vag delivery modalities. LSDFs were designed and developed that upon i.vag administration they would reconstitute with the imbibing of vaginal fluid to RSVs, (ii) modied of more suited to lyophilization (sodium carboxymethyl cellulose CN54gp140. enhanced antigen RSVs. Rheological analysis indicated the NaCMC-based LSDFs would offer enhanced vaginal retention in woman compared to more conventional vaginal gel formulations. All LSDFs were well tolerated in the mouse model. Following i.vag administration, all LSDFs boosted systemic CN54gp140-specic antibody responses in sub-cutaneously primed mice. Induction of CN54gp140-specic antibody responses in the female genital tract was evi- dent. Of all the LSDFs the fastest releasing which was lyophilized Carbopol\u00aegel elicited immune responses comparable to buffer instillation of antigen suggesting that rather than slower sustained release, initial high burst release from the LSDFs may sufce. The boosting of specic immune responses upon i.vag administration indicates that LSDFs are viable mucosal vaccine delivery modalities promoting antigen stability and facilitating intimate exposure of CN54gp140 to the mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue of the female genital tract. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd. 1. Introduction The HIV epidemic is fuelled predominantly by heterosexual transmission, notably so in sub-Saharan Africa where women are Abbreviations: DSC, differential SVF, vaginal fluid. Corresponding author at: Institute of Nursing Research/School of Nursing, Uni- versity of Jordanstown particularly in the 15-24-year-old age range [1]. The exact mechanisms whereby HIV infects across the vaginal mucosal barrier are not fully elucidated [2], although stud- ies with SIV indicate that HIV rapidly disseminates once across the vaginal epithelium [3]. As such, there is profound scientic rationale to pursue the development of female-controlled preven- tive strategies, principally involving the cervico-vaginal region, the predominant mucosal viral portal of entry in heterosexual transmission. To be fully effective, such a vaccine should provide sterilising immunity in the vaginal mucosal environment by induc- ing sustained robust protective immune effector function against diverse viral isolates. How to achieve sustained immune effector function, particu- larly humoral immune effector function \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd. doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.04.023Open access under CC BY license. Open access under CC BY license.L. Donnelly et al. / Vaccine 29 (2011) 4512- 4520 4513 antibody or rapid effective recall of immunological memory at mucosal surfaces is the subject of intense investigation. In addition, from a formulation/drug delivery perspective to ensure equity of access, particularly in the context of sub-Saharan Africa, such a vac- cine should preferentially be inexpensive, safe, thermo-stable not requiring cold-chain storage and would facilitate female-controlled administration. It is thought that the envelope spike is the only HIV-1 target available for neutralising antibodies [4]. As a result much emphasis has been placed on viral surface envelope glycoproteins as HIV- 1 vaccine candidates. The efcacy of protein pharmaceuticals as vaccines depends upon maintaining storage stability as well as intended antigenicity following administration. Vaginally admin- istered solubilised protein antigens are subject to leakage at the administration site, rapid enzymatic degradation, the influences of the menstrual cycle and inadequate exposure to the mucosal asso- ciated lymphoid tissue. There are a limited number of reports of vaginal immunization in women [5-11] and, with the exception of three studies [5-7] they have employed a known potent mucosal immunogen-cholera toxin subunit B that does not require the use of an adjuvant. We previously reported on the design and development of well-tolerated mucoadhesive, syringeable, administra- tion of an HIV-1 vaccine candidate - a recombinant clade-C gp140 envelope protein (CN54gp140), in the rabbit model [12,13]. While the RSVs were a viable delivery modality for vaginal immuniza- tion as determined by the vaccine-specic serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G, and vaccine-specic IgG and IgA in genital tract secretions, the vaccine was not stable within the aqueous- based preserved RSV formulations. The antigenicity of CN54gp140 altered over the course of prolonged storage and this was more pronounced the higher the storage temperature. In a related study, repeated vaginal exposure of CN54gp140, formulated within a Carbopol\u00aesemi-solid, was well tolerated and induced systemic and mucosal IgG antibody responses in the rabbit model [14]. Herein we report the formulation and vaginal delivery of CN54gp140 within solid dosage forms; lyophilized equivalents of the Carbopol\u00ae, and modied RSV formulations. The innovative, robust, lyophilized solid dosage formulations (LSDFs) in this study were more conducive to CN54gp140 stability with the potential to offer improved patient acceptability for vaginal administration than the equivalent semi-solid formulations. In addition, the viability of the LSDFs as delivery modalities for vagi- nal immunization was demonstrated by the ability of the vaginally administered lyophilized formulations containing CN54gp140 to boost subcutaneously primed mice. 2. Materials and methods 2.1.

Nalgene tubing (PVC, 3 mm internal diameter, 5 mm outer diam- eter, 1 mm Wall) was purchased from VWR International Ltd. (Dublin, Ireland) and blister packs were kindly supplied by Almac (Craigavon, UK) and Warner Chilcott (Larne, UK). Ultra-pure water was obtained using an Elga Purelab Maxima system. Six to 8-week old female BALB/c mice were obtained from Harlan Ltd., UK. All in vivo procedures were carried out in compliance with the United Kingdom Animal (Scientic Procedures) Act 1986 and associated Codes of Practice for the Housing and Care of Animals. 2.2. Preparation of semi-solids 2.2.1. Hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) based semi-solids Preparation of the HEC based RSV formulations has been described previously [13]. Briefly, a HiVac\u00aeBowl (Summit Medical Ltd., Gloucestershire, UK) was used to facilitate mixing under vac- uum following the stepwise addition of components. Poylcarbophil (PC) (3% w/w) was rst added to the bowl containing deionised water and sodium hydroxide prior to the addition of HEC (3 or 5% w/w) followed by polyvinylpyrollidone PC (3% w/w) was added to the vortex produced in a metal beaker by rapid stirring (at 500 rev min1) of deionised water and the required amount of NaOH to reach pH 6 using a Heidolph mechan- ical stirrer. Following complete dissolution of the mucoadhesive (3, 5 or 10% w/w) and added stepwise following attainment of homogeneity. The gels were transferred to sterile centrifuge tubes, gently centrifuged and stored for 24 h (ambient temperature) prior to analysis. 2.3. Flow analysis of semi-solids pre-lyophilization under continuous shear Flow rheometry was conducted using rheometer (T.A. Instruments, Surrey, England) at 25 \u00b1 0.1C using a 6 cm diam- eter parallel plate geometry (selected according to formulation consistency) and a gap of 1000 /H9262m, as previously reported [12]. Flow curves (plots of viscosity versus shear rate) were examined in the range of 0.1-100 s1. 2.4. Preparation of CN54gp140 loaded semi-solids 2.4.1. For lyophilized solid dosage tablet formation NaCMC semi-solid (2.8 g) was weighed into a 5 ml syringe bar- rel. The semi-solid loaded syringe barrel was attached to a second syringe via a 1.5 cm length of Nalgene tubing. CN54gp140 (200 /H9262l4514 L. Donnelly et al. / Vaccine 29 (2011) 4512- 4520 at 530 /H9262g/ml) was added to the semi-solid containing syringe bar- rel via pipette and the plunger replaced. Uniform distribution of CN54gp140 throughout the semi-solid formulation was achieved by carrying out 40 passes of the syringe barrel contents from one syringe to the other (method previously validated [13]). 2.4.2. For lyophilized solid dosage rod formation for mouse immunization studies Semi-solids (HEC- and NaCMC-based) (0.36 g) were weighed into a speed mixing pot prior to the addition of CN54gp140 (180 /H9262l at 3.5 mg/ml). 2 Spin cycles at 3300 rpm for 30 s were carried out to provide uniform antigen distribution throughout the semi-solid formulations. The same lyophilization protocol was adopted for each formulation. 2.5. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of semi-solids pre-lyophilization To optimise the lyophilization protocols, the glass transition temperatures of the selected and cooled semi-solid formulations were investigated by DSC using hermetic pans (DSC Q100, TA Instruments, Surrey, UK). Following cooling to 60C and holding isothermally for 5 min, the samples were heated at 2-40C using a modulated procedure (\u00b10.4C every 0.5 s). 2.6. Lyophilization Prior to lyophilization, semi-solid formulations were dispensed into suitable blister packs using a TS250 Digital Timed Dispenser (Adhesive Dispensing Ltd., Buckinghamshire, UK) for tablet forma- tion or alternatively extruded into nalgene tubing with the use of a 5 ml syringe for rod formation. Lyophilization was carried out using the Advantage Freeze Dryer (VirTis, Gardiner, NY, USA). Blister packs/tubing were placed on the shelf and a 4 h thermal treatment step was carried out at 28C. This temperature was maintained for a further 2 h while the chamber pressure was reduced to 100 mTorr. Primary drying commenced with a 4 h hold under these conditions followed by a 1 h ramp to and 2 h hold at 20C. The temperature was further ramped to 0C over 2 h then held for 2 h at 500 mTorr followed by a 2 h ramp to 20C. Secondary drying was then per- formed at 27C for 4 h at a reduced pressure of 50 mTorr. Following lyophilization samples were transferred into individual sterile uni- versal tubes. 2.7. Friability studies Each lyophilized solid dosage tablet formulation tested (n = 5) was weighed and transferred into the test drum of a Copley Sci- entic friability tester (25 rpm, 4 min), during which they are subjected to the rolling movement around the drum which has a curved aperture allowing the formulations to rise and then fall over a distance of 16 cm. The dosage forms were then expelled, reweighed and any decrease in weight recorded. 2.8. In vitro dilution of lyophilized solid dosage tablet formulations in simulated vaginal fluid (SVF) SVF was prepared as previously lactic acid (2 g), acetic acid (1 g), glycerol (0.16 g), urea (0.4 g) and glucose (5 g) were dissolved in 1 L of deionised water, followed by adjustment to pH 4.2 with HCl. Solid dosage tablet formulations were diluted and thoroughly mixed with a dened volume of SVF (1 ml) and the dynamic rheological properties analyzed. Oscillatory rheometry was conducted within the linear viscoelastic region over a frequency range from 0.1 to 10 Hz asdescribed elsewhere [12]. The dilution ratio was chosen on the basis of that normally encountered in the vagina following insertion of the delivery vehicle [17]. 2.9. ELISA for the quantication of CN54gp140 A heterogeneous indirect sandwich ELISA was optimised for quantication of CN54gp140 in PBST 0.999). Wells were incubated with 50 /H9262l/well of GNA at 10 /H9262g/ml in deionised water (5 h at 37C). The wells were washed (5\u00d7 300 /H9262l PBS-T) and blocked for 1 with PBST containing 5% porcine serum (PBS-T-serum). Standards, samples and controls were prepared in PBS-T (n = 4), and incubated overnight at ambient temperature. The wells were washed and incubated with 50 /H9262l/well HuMab 5F3 (1 /H9262g/ml in PBS-T-serum) for 2 h at 37C. Following washing, bound antibody was detected using 50 /H9262l/well goat anti-human IgG peroxidase conjugate diluted 1:5 and incubated for 1 h at 37C. After washing, the wells were incubated with 100 /H9262l TMB/E for 5 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 /H9262l of 2.5 M H2SO 4. Plates were read immediately at A450. 2.10. In vitro release of CN54gp140 from lyophilized solid dosage tablet or rod formulations Each CN54gp140 containing lyophilized tablet (n = 4) was placed in a sterile polypropylene pot containing release media (PBS-T, 30 ml) prior to housing in an orbital incubated shaker (Sanyo Gal- lenkamp, 100 rpm) maintained at 37C. At predetermined time intervals the release medium was sampled (3 ml) and replaced with fresh pre-warmed dissolution media. Samples were diluted in PBS- T for concentration analysis by ELISA. For rods dissolution volume was 20 ml and sample volume was 2 ml. Dissolution volumes were selected to maintain sink conditions. 2.11. CN54gp140 stability assessment within lyophilized solid dosage tablet formulations Stability assessment was carried out in a similar fashion to the described release protocol. Following complete dissolution of the CN54gp140 containing lyophilized solid dosage tablets in PBS-T (30 ml) a sample was taken and diluted in PBS-T for concentration analysis by ELISA. 2.12. Mouse immunogenicity study Animals were assigned to experimental groups where n = 5 (Table 1). Mice received a subcutaneous (s.c.) prime (Day 0) then an intra-vaginal (i.vag.) boost three times at 21-day intervals (Days 21, 42, 63) with vaginally administered rod formulations (Table 1). Mice were lightly anesthetised and the rod formulations were inserted into the vagina using a positive displacement pipette (Gilson Microman - 100 /H9262l maximum volume) and a tip with the end cut off and led down to smoothness. To thin the vaginal epithelium and improve protein uptake, mice were treated subcu- taneously with 2 mg of depoprovera (in 50 /H9262l PBS) 5 days prior to the rst and third vaginal immunization. Blood samples were taken from the tail vein of mice on Days 20, 41, 62, and 83 and by cardiac puncture on Day 120. Blood samples were centrifuged following clotting for collection of sera. Vaginal lavages were conducted on Day 83. Vaginal lavages were collected and pooled by flushing the vaginal lumen three times with a 25 /H9262l volume of PBS using a pos- itive displacement pipette. 5 /H9262l of 25X protease inhibitor was added to the vaginal eluates, which were incubated on ice forL.

All samples were stored at 80C until analysis. 2.13. CN54gp140-specic antibody ELISAs Binding antibodies against CN54gp140 in vaginal lavage and serum samples were measured a quantitative ELISA. 96-Well plates were coated with CN54gp140 and blocked with 1% BSA as before. IgG or IgA standards were used on each plate to quantify the CN54gp140 specic antibodies. Experimental samples were or 1:10 and 1:50 (lavage) to ensure the absorbance reading measured fell within the linear range of the standard curve. Bound IgG was detected by incubation for 1 h at 37C with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, bound IgA was detected using biotinylated anti-mouse IgA and followed by Streptavidin-HRP. Plates were washed and developed with 50 /H9262l TMB/E substrate and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 /H9262l of 2 M H2SO 4and read at A450. Vaginal lavage values were normalised against the total IgA or IgG measured in the same sam- ple. 3. Results 3.1. Preparation of semi-solids Semi-solids (Table 2) were prepared using either an overhead stirrer or HiVac\u00aebowl, the choice of which was dependent upon the viscosity of the systems being prepared. The lower viscosity of the NaCMC-based semi-solids permitted use of the overhead stirrer and although some degree of aeration occurred this was readily removed upon gentle centrifugation (min). It had previously been determined that overhead stirring was not suitable for preparation of the HEC-based semi-solids due to the high rate of shear required to achieve uniform mixing, excessive aeration and the potential for high shearing stresses to trigger mechanical breakdown of the polymeric components. To overcome this, mixing was carried out under vacuum with the use of the HiVac\u00aemixing bowl. 3.2. Flow analysis of semi-solids pre-lyophilization under continuous shear Following dispensing trials a number of semi-solid formulations were selected for rheological flow analysis. The influence of shear rate on the shear viscosity of the selected HEC- and NaCMC-based semi-solids is shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. Flow analysis Fig. 1. Mean log viscosity versus log shear rate (n = 4) of been omitted for clarity - coefcient of error<5% throughout. showed that all the semi-solid formulations were pseudoplastic in nature in that they displayed decreasing shear viscosity with increasing shear rate. The power law function was used to deter- mine flow consistency (/DC4) of the materials understudy (at 1 s1) (Table 2). 3.3. DSC analysis of semi-solids pre-lyophilization On the basis of rheological analysis and dispensing trials, deter- mined by viscosity and ability to settle into blister pack wells, formulations containing Blanose 7LF were chosen for lyophiliza- tion. For all semi-solid formulations in the absence and presence of CN54gp140, the glass transition temperature was identied between 21 and 22C. 3.4. Lyophilization Three solid dosage forms with different dimensions were prepared (Fig. 2a-c). LSDFs containing 10% Blanose 7LF were inconsistent in structure whereas those containing lower levels of Blanose 7LF provided uniform units suitable for further investiga- tion. 3.5. Friability studies Following friability testing no lyophilized solid dosage formu- lation tested (both those shown in Fig. 2a and b) was subject to fracture or exterior damage. No loss of weight occurred whereas slight increases in weight were detected (<8%). 3.6. SVF dilution studies Following reconstitution of the LSDFs designed for i.vag administration (Fig. 2a) in SVF (1 tablet per 1 ml) oscillatory (dynamic) analysis (a measure of consistency) was performed4516 L.

Discussion To the best of our knowledge, this article is the rst example of i.vag immunization employing LSDFs derived from semi-solids. Previously soluble recombinant HIV-1 gp140 has been shown to be immunogenic in the absence of mucosal adjuvant, upon i.vag immunization and formulated within semi-solids [13,14]. This is the rst demonstration that soluble recombinant HIV-1 gp140 is immunogenic in the absence of mucosal adjuvant, upon i.vag immunization, and formulated within LSDFs. Moreover, the for- mulations were well tolerated in the murine model. In general, semi-solid dosage forms are currently the most com- mon dosage form used for i.vag delivery [18]. They have many desirable attributes that make them suitable for vaginal deliv- ery but are also associated with messiness and poor retention. Previously we developed highly viscous, mucoadhesive gel sys-4518 L. Donnelly et al. / Vaccine 29 (2011) 4512- 4520 tems, developed for site-retentive application of CN54gp140 to the vagina [13]. Although the GMP manufactured CN54gp140 has proven to be exceptionally stable in simple buffer solutions (D. Katinger - personal communication), stability was severely com- promised when formulated within the aqueous-based RSVs. So although both the RSVs and a considerably less viscous Carbopol\u00ae semi-solid formulation [13,14] have proven to be viable deliv- ery modalities for i.vag immunization with CN54gp140, from a practical perspective such aqueous-based semi-solid formulations requiring labour intensive bed-side mixing to overcome instability concerns are neither suitable for the clinic or eld. Lyophilization is routinely used for the preparation of stable pharmaceutical products. In the present study lyophilization of semi-solids was explored with the intention of developing LSDFs for i.vag immunization that were conducive to antigen stability. Desirable attributes of the resulting LSDFs included that they would provide rapid stabilisation of antigen, long-term product stability (avoiding cold-chain storage) and ease of reconstitution upon i.vag administration. Upon administration these formulations were pre- dicted to reconstitute to semi-solids by the imbibing of vaginal fluid, permitting intimate contact of the vaccine candidate with the vaginal epithelium. Upon reconstitution the formulations would retain the intended benecial attributes of the original semi-solid formulations, including mucoadhesiveness and in the case of the lyophilized RSVs enhanced viscoelasticity, thus enhanced retention compared with more conventional vaginal semi-solid formula- tions, including Carbopol\u00ae. To enable preparation of the LSDFs, equivalent to their respec- tive semi-solid formulations but with dened dimensions (suitably translational to the human clinic), semi-solids were dispensed into blister packs and subsequently lyophilized. Due to their high viscosity and resistance to deformation the RSVs described pre- viously [12,13] were not suitable for dispensing, as they were resistant to settling within wells. The RSV semi-solid formulation (PC3HEC250HHX5PVP4) [12] underwent modication to reduce viscosity thus facilitating lyophilization in blister packs, deter- mined visually through dispensing trials and by rheological flow analysis (manifested as a reduction in viscosity). Modications tri- alled included a reduction in the HEC250HHX content from 5% to 1%, omission of the PVP component, and omission of the PVP component plus substitution of the HEC250HHX polymer compo- nent with HEC250G, a grade exhibiting lower Brookeld viscosity (400 mPa s compared to 15,000 mPa s). Rheological flow analysis, used as an aid for the optimisation of processing parameters such as dispensing, in addition to predicting the way in which a material will behave upon storage and end-user application, demonstrated the pseudoplastic nature of all the modied RSVs. Such shear thin- ning behaviour was a desirable attribute to facilitate expulsion of the semi-solids from the dispensing tubes and to ensure adequate settling into the blister pack wells. Omission of the PVP component had no signicant effect on consistency (determined using power law) whereas reduction of the HEC250HHX content resulted in a drop in consistency from 3194 \u00b1 177 Pa sn[12]. Substitution with HEC250G in combination with PVP omission also resulted in a drop in consistency to 399 \u00b1 14 Pa sn. However, dispensing trials demon- strated that the HEC-based semisolids did not exhibit sufcient flow properties to settle uniformly into the blister pack wells. To overcome this, the HEC component of the original RSV for- mulations was substituted with NaCMC. NaCMC-based semi-solid formulations were subsequently evaluated, and the original RSV formulation was not pursued to lyophilization as uniform dosage forms suitable for human administration were not attainable. Phar- maceutical grades of Blanose were investigated with high (7HF), medium (7MF) and low (7LF) molecular weights (MW). The Brook- eld viscosity of Blanose decreases down through the grades - 7HF (20,000 mPa s), 7MF (600 mPa s) and 7LF (40 mPa s). As a resultwhen combined with PVP and PC the consistency of the semi- solid formulations decreased with decreasing MW of the Blanose component. The higher viscosity arising from the inclusion of the 7HF grade is likely due to the increased number of physical entan- glements that the larger molecular weight component may form, which in turn may lead to the increased resistance to deformation observed in the form of resistance to settling into the blister pack wells. In contrast to this, inclusion of the 7LF grade resulted in the formulation of semi-solids that could be adequately dispensed and subsequently settled into the blister pack wells. As a result the opti- mised LSDFs described contain Blanose 7LF as part of their overall polymer component. To avoid collapse of the formulations during lyophilization DSC analysis was conducted to optimise the lyophilization protocols. Primary drying was maintained below the glass transition tem- peratures of the semi-solids at 28C to overcome inefciency of thermal transfer between the shelf and dispensed semi-solids and to ensure immobilisation of the polymeric chains thus preserving structure. Friability testing indicated that the solid-dosage formu- lations would withstand the rigors of transport and handling. The slight increases in batch weight were attributed to water uptake upon re-exposure of the dehydrated formulations to normal atmo- spheric conditions. As anticipated oscillatory analysis conrmed a decrease in con- sistency of the semi-solid formulations created upon reconstitution of the LSDFs with SVF compared to the equivalent semi-solids pre-lyophilization. This was attributed to the lower pH and lower ratio of solid polymer component to solution of the reconstituted systems. Although, compared to the original RSV semi-solid formu- lations the viscosity of the Blanose prior to lyophilization and following reconstitution in SVF was considerably reduced, the reconstituted formulations (modelling the in vivo sce- nario) retained consistencies greater than those of commercially available PC based formulations [12] prior to i.vag administration. Importantly, based on this observation the LSDFs were anticipated to offer enhanced vaginal retention compared to more conventional gels such as Carbopol\u00aewhich would be subject to further reduc- tions in viscosity upon i.vag administration due to the imbibing of vaginal fluid, increases in temperature and exposure to lower pH. In vitro release of CN54gp140 from the LSDFs containing Blanose 7LF was sustained over an 8 h period at which point the tablets had undergone complete dissolution. As anticipated due to changes in viscosity the LSDFs containing vivo scenario) than the highly viscous RSVs (expulsed into dissolution medium to model in vivo smearing) [13]. The percentage load- ing of Blanose 7LF did not influence in vitro release. As a result one lyophilized formulation lyo-PC3Blanose7LF3PVP4 was pro- gressed to stability and immunogenicity analysis. The degree of matrix associated dampening varies with each formulation type and over the course of a dissolution study using the specied ELISA. Therefore the concentration of CN54gp140 was determined against a CN54gp140 in PBS-T calibration curve and matrix asso- ciated dampening was not corrected for. As a result recovery of CN54gp140 as determined by ELISA was not expected to reach 100%. Importantly antigenicity/recovery was retained at greater than 70% for at least 5 months when CN54gp140 was formulated within lyo-PC3Blanose7LF3PVP4 indicating that lyophilization sig- nicantly enhanced long-term stability under accelerated storage conditions. Comparatively, recovery had dropped in the aqueous- based RSVs from 77% to 21% by Day 9 at 37C [13]. PVP, one of the polymer components of the LSDFs is reported to be a cryoprotectant [19,20], which may have been a contributing factor. Comparative in vitro release studies were also conducted on the LSDFs intended for the mouse immunogenicity study (Fig. 2c). TheL. Donnelly et al. / Vaccine 29 (2011) 4512- 4520 4519 rationale for comparing the optimised Blanose LSDF to lyophilized equivalents of the original RSV and of Carbopol\u00aein the mouse immunogenicity study was that the selected formu- lations present three very different rates of release. The RSV and Carbopol\u00aegel can be lyophilized in rod format only. As previously discussed the RSV is not suitable for lyophilization within blis- ter pack wells and the lyophilized equivalent of Carbopol\u00aegel is spongy with inadequate rigidity for i.vag administration. Due to their small size the in vitro release proles of the lyophilized rods were of limited value and were merely designed to be demon- strative that due to the nature of the formulation components these rods release antigen at varying rates in vitro as was the case with the equivalent formulations of larger size. As anticipated the lyophilized version of Carbopol\u00aegel (lyo-Carbopol\u00ae) exhib- ited rapid release whereas lyophilized version of the highly viscous unmodied RSV (lyo-PC3HEC250HHX5PVP4) had a much more sustained release prole. Comparative release proles of the larger equivalent formulations designed for non-human pri- mate (NHP) or human administration present more distinguishable release proles further separating the quick release formulations from the more sustained release formulations. Inevitably formu- lation size is largely dictated by the constraints of animal models. How influential this is to enabling adequate comparison of formula- tions that are designed to release at varying rates in vivo is yet to be determined. HIV envelope proteins are notoriously poorly immunogenic. Contrary to our previously conducted rabbit experiments [14] prior experiments in mice have indicated that i.vag as a sole route of administration for CN54gp140 alone does not elicit detectable immune responses (unpublished data). As a result we selected a heterologous prime-boost regimen, increasingly prevalent in HIV vaccine research [21]. Remarkably, all topically administered i.vag formulations boosted sub-cutaneously primed mice, importantly in the absence of adjuvant. Of the responses detected locally within the vagina we cannot rule out, as has been reported in HIV infec- tion [22], that serum transudation contributed. Nevertheless, the LSDF inserts have been shown to be a viable delivery modality for i.vag immunization. With respect to immunogenicity the study data indicated that in the case of the mouse model the LSDFs were not offering any additional benets over i.vag administration of CN54gp140 formulated within PBS buffer alone. Perhaps with the exception of lyophilized Carbopol\u00aethat may be prolonging or aug- menting CN54gp140-specic systemic humoral effector immune responses. The formulation (lyo-PC3HEC250HHX5PVP4) with the slowest release induces the lowest response, whereas the formu- lation (lyo-Carbopol\u00ae) with the fastest release closest to the PBS alone scenario marginally prolongs or augments the response. How translational this may be to other animal models, in particular NHPs and more importantly to humans is yet to be determined but this may be indicative that sustained release is not required rather an initial high burst release may sufce. The perceived benets such as enhanced retention that drive such formulation develop- ment with respect to improving immune responses may not be wholly realised due to the size restrictions of the murine vaginal lumen. However although the LSDFs did not augment immune responses in comparison to those following administration of antigen in PBS alone the problems associated with human i.vag administration of vaccines in simple buffer solutions are not to be underestimated. As such the LSDFs that elicited comparable immune responses to those of the PBS group have the potential to provide additional attributes for vaginal mucosal vaccine deliv- ery in humans. LSDFs can be self-administered with relative ease using conventional solid dosage vaginal applicators, compared to the instillation of buffers and to the administration of semi-solids, thus promoting higher acceptability and enhanced user compli-ance. The stability advantages have the potential to eliminate the requirement for cold-chain storage, and the reduction in weight associated with the removal of water could reduce constraints on distribution including expense. 5. Conclusion This study has described the design and development of LSDFs derived from the lyophilization of mucoadhesive semi-solid dosage forms. CN54gp140 was formulated within the LSDFs for i.vag administration. Upon application the LSDFs boosted s.c. primed mice indicating that the LSDFs reconsituted in vivo with the imbib- ing of vaginal fluid, resulting in intimate exposure of CN54gp140 with the mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue of the female genital tract. The LSDFs were conducive to long-term antigen storage sta- bility. To the best of our knowledge this is the rst description of lyophilized solid dosage forms as vaginal mucosal vaccine delivery modalities.
