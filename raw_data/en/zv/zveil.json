It is the only bivalent vaccine currently authorized in Canada as a booster dose for this age group and offers strong protection against both the Omicron and original strains. For most children in Nova Scotia, the recommended interval between the last dose of the primary vaccine series and a booster dose is 168 days (the primary series is the first two vaccine doses for most children). Children who have had COVID-19 should also wait 168 days from the time of their infection before receiving their booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Children who are moderately to severely immunocompromised are eligible for a shortened interval of 120 days since the last dose of their three-dose primary series. If these children have had COVID-19, they should wait 120 days from the time of their infection before receiving their booster dose. At this time, only a single booster dose is recommended for children aged five to 11, and those who have already received a booster with the original Pfizer vaccine are expected to be well protected. However, parents of children who are at high risk for severe COVID-19 disease may choose to speak with their healthcare provider about their child receiving a bivalent booster dose once the recommended interval has passed since their first booster. Children at high risk for severe disease may include those who are obese, have more than one comorbidity or neurological disorder, have Down syndrome, or have immunocompromising conditions or other medical complexities. If children aged five to 11 have not completed their primary vaccine series, parents and guardians are encouraged to book those appointments as soon as possible so their children are well protected. Also starting today, only bivalent vaccines will be available when booking booster doses for everyone aged five and older. Public Health recommends bivalent vaccine as the preferred type for doses after the primary series is complete. Appointments can be booked online at [https://novascotia.ca/vaccination](https://novascotia.ca/vaccination) or by calling 1-833-797-7772. Vaccine scheduling by phone is available Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and on Saturdays and Sundays from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. People who have not completed their primary series can also book the same way. Most COVID-19 vaccines are administered at pharmacies. Quick Facts: - the Province has adopted the recommendations of the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) on the use of COVID-19 vaccine booster doses in children aged five to 11 and concurrent vaccine administration - people six months and older can safely receive the COVID-19 vaccine before, after or at the same time as receiving other routine vaccinations, including the influenza vaccine Additional Resources: NACI's recommendations on the use of COVID-19 vaccine booster doses in children aged five to 11 and concurrent vaccine administration: [https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/phac-aspc/documents/services/immunization/national-advisory-committee-on-immunization-naci/updated-recommendations-use-covid-19-vaccine-booster-doses-children-5-11-years-concurrent-administration.pdf](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/phac-aspc/documents/services/immunization/national-advisory-committee-on-immunization-naci/updated-recommendations-use-covid-19-vaccine-booster-doses-children-5-11-years-concurrent-administration.pdf) Vaccination resources "}
